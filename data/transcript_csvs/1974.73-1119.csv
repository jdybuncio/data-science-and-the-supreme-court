1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,210.521,217.179,"Let's see, I gather that nuisance statutes are in Title 7 and the obscenity statutes are in Title 14 of the Abatement Code?"
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,217.179,217.655,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,219.966,223.362,What -- is there any provision which interconnects the two?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,223.362,232.558,"No, sir and the State of Alabama has not interpreted its Red Light Abatement statute to include or exclude."
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,232.558,234.236,"Now, why do you call it Red Light Abatement Controller?"
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,234.236,239.435,"Because that's the term that it was given at the time, it was originally passed Your Honor."
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,253.235,256.646,"It's a fairly old statute then, is it?"

1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,270.226,272.929,There is a new address.
1974.73-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,293.827,308.588,"Mr. Smith, did I understand you say a moment ago that it's the Alabama Supreme Court has never decided whether it's Red Light Abatement Statutes apply to the theater showing what this type of (Voice Overlap, would you?"
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,308.588,316.231,"It never interpreted that question of whether or not their statute applies to theaters, adult theaters and adult bookstores."
1974.73-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,316.231,323.744,Did you raise that argument in the Circuit Court proceeding -- the equity proceeding?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,323.744,326.745,"We -- in the equity proceeding, yes sir."
1974.73-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,343.125,347.112,"Now wait a minute, you say order upon prayer for temporary injunction."
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,352.031,353.502,"Yes, Your Honor that's true."
1974.73-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.502,363.053,If you -- is this a temp -- what I would call a temporary injunction either affidavits or some testimony but at least with after notice and hearing.
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,363.053,363.861,This was notice and hearing.
1974.73-1119,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,499.567,501.02,Where do you say this is?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,501.02,508.326,That's on A-99 and A-100 Your Honor of the appendix of appellants.
1974.73-1119,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,510.635,512.133,"That's at the bottom, yes."
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,512.133,521.668,"Yes, sir and the -- what I said in to the Court is that the co-plaintiff General Corporation thereafter appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court."
1974.73-1119,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,521.668,522.001,"Now, let's see."
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,524.776,525.273,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1119,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,525.273,525.792,Right.
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,525.792,529.619,This -- it was a co-plaintiff in the same case.
1974.73-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,532.523,532.796,General --
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,532.796,534.154,That was in Huntsville.
1974.73-1119,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,537.811,539.853,"Well, let me see in the District Court?"
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,539.853,540.388,In the District Court.
1974.73-1119,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,540.388,542.44,That we combined the Huntsville case and your case?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,542.44,542.957,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1119,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,542.957,544.621,Separate judgments entered in each?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,544.621,545.53,"Yes, that's correct."
1974.73-1119,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,545.53,547.174,And you brought your judgment here?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,547.174,547.834,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1119,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,547.834,549.387,And Huntsville did what?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,549.387,558.201,"After the three-judge court denied the injunction, they then entered an appeal in the Supreme Court of the State of Alabama."
1974.73-1119,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,558.201,558.838,Alright.
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,560.37,562.589,Closing in Huntsville.
1974.73-1119,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,562.589,565.684,And the closing was sought to a temporary or permanent injunction?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,565.684,567.355,Permanent injunction there sir. (Voice Overlap)
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.355,569.227,And argue in the appeal?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,569.227,571.395,"No sir, we did not."
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,571.395,572.61,The time expired?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,572.61,588.979,There is no -- we suggest there is no appeal for a temporary injunction in the State of Alabama there is a -- you can file a separate motion to dissolve which is a separate proceeding but Your Honors we had filed our federal suit prior to that temporary injunction.
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,588.979,590.596,"And thus, what happened to the Huntsville?"
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,590.596,591.044,"Alright, --"
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,591.044,595.249,He -- he did take an appeal directly from whatever this injunction was temporary.
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,595.249,598.857,"After the three-judge court said, we deny the injunction."
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.35,614.495,What is dismissed anyway?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,614.495,620.363,"The appeal was not dismissed, there was the appeal brought by general from a final order in their case --"
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,620.363,621.962,From a permanent injunction?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,621.962,622.662,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,622.662,623.719,Not a temporary injunction?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,623.719,624.393,That's correct.
1974.73-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,635.749,640.191,"Well, yours is being argued December 10, 1974 and it hasn't been decided."
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,640.191,645.509,"But I'm always saying sir that one of the reasons why the court said, “Well, maybe we ought not deal with this question.”"
1974.73-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,656.857,657.204,Could it be that the Supreme Court (Voice Overlap)?
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,657.204,659.912,"Well, it may not be fact but they exist."
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,664.461,665.942,"Yes, sir and that --"
1974.73-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,665.942,672.01,And could it be there waiting for us to decide in this case?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,672.01,684.716,It could be Your Honor but I say that October 15th was the day of the argument and that's October 1974 and this decision by Judge Pointer was October 1973.
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,689.638,693.082,I think if you'd be hearing the same argument if that started the criminal case against your point?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,693.082,694.356,"No, sir."
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,696.275,700.503,"Well, different prospect but it would be just as slow in the state court process?"
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,700.503,702.228,"Yes, but then we have the Younger versus Harris problem."
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.515,710.633,"Well, I know but let's assume the three-judge court is quite right as to the applicability of Younger here."
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,710.633,712.207,"Well, I just happen to think they're not."
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,712.207,714.986,"Well, I hope but if they were you're in trouble I take it."
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,714.986,715.79,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,715.79,718.15,"Well, that's the issue we've got to decide it."
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,718.15,722.092,We're not in trouble sir because we still have the permanent injunction which is not yet been heard.
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.092,725.032,"But is it the only question we have here, the Younger issue?"
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,725.032,726.841,"We think that that's the primary question, Your Honor."
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.841,731.716,"The primary, I'm looking at the jurisdictional statement that's the only question (Voice Overlap)."
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,751.448,752.87,"That's what they said, yes sir."
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,758.815,766.264,You may but don't we usually give great difference to the lower federal courts to their view of the state law?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,766.264,778.736,I think it was the view that they placed on it Your Honor because they took the Fifth Circuit decision of Palaio versus McAuliffe and I think they misapplied that particular case because if the court will look at that case.
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,856.857,866.726,"Well, that's only an argument isn't it Mr. Smith that even if in a relation as the three-judge court found that the statutes is what the three--judge court said it was as a matter of state law."
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,868.351,869.877,"Yes sir, that is correct."
1974.73-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,869.877,884.755,"Mr. Smith, I hesitate to further complicate but seems to become rather a prolix argument here but are you familiar with the probably not with the decision of this Court announced this morning, Gonzalez?"
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,884.755,887.245,I had a brief moment to review it.
1974.73-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,888.591,902.192,"That case of course cast a substantial doubt upon whether or not this appeal is properly here at all because this decision by the three-judge court was not a decision on the constitutional merits, was it?"
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,902.192,902.716,"No sir, it was not."
1974.73-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,902.716,909.908,"It's a decision to dismiss because of its understanding of a Fifth Circuit law, the law Younger against Harris?"
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,909.908,913.643,"Right, but they did not say we do not have standing to be before the Court in that case."
1974.73-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,914.464,915.248,I beg your pardon?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,915.248,920.581,They did not raise -- say that we had no standing to be before the Court in that case that we had not raised substantial question. (Voice Overlap)
1974.73-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,920.581,926.17,"Well, I -- I'm sure you're not -- I wouldn't possibly expect you to be familiar with the opinion announced this morning."
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,951.054,953.898,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1055.094,1064.405,"Was -- Mr. Smith, with the time sequence in this case that first, Mr. Jenkins filed his action in the equity court?"
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1064.405,1064.85,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1064.85,1071.848,Then you filed your action three-judge District Court then the equity court issued with the temporary injunction?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1071.848,1073.186,"Yes sir, that's correct."
1974.73-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1092.234,1095.098,Have you filed a protective appeal in this case to the Court of Appeals?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1095.098,1096.532,There is no need to sir.
1974.73-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1096.532,1099.896,"Well, that's a very open question as I suggest it to you."
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1099.896,1102.932,I pretend because we have a temporary restrain injunction.
1974.73-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1108.343,1114.388,You have a dismissal of your prayer for an injunction is what you have in the three-judge District Court.
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1118.396,1121.037,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1121.037,1121.5,Thank you.
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.5,1124.87,Have you moved to dissolve the state court injunction?
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1124.87,1134.969,"No sir, we took the position that under England versus Board of Medical Examiners if we took that affirmative action we might very well be then usurp it at the jurisdiction of the federal court."
1974.73-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1146.123,1149.373,"So, you took no action to dissolve a temporary injunction?"
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1149.373,1151.556,"No, sir."
1974.73-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1151.556,1165.641,"Mr. Smith, it is not likely that we'll finish this case today if you wish you may file any comments or observations you have about the applicability of the Gonzalez case to this case tomorrow morning."
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1165.641,1165.854,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1165.854,1169.49,But you won't be confined with that.
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1172.314,1173.201,"Yes, I would appreciate that."
1974.73-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1173.201,1179.461,It's not a long opinion but you can file it either in the morning or --
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1179.461,1181.963,"I'd like to have till Friday, if the Court please."
1974.73-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1181.963,1182.323,Very well.
1974.73-1119,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1182.323,1188.71,Thank you.
1974.73-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1188.71,1190.84,Mr. Jenkins.
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,1190.84,1195.69,Mr. Chief Justice Burger and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1656.891,1662.176,"But it says I gather a separate equitable proceeding in that circumstance, does it?"
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,1662.176,1662.727,Sir?
1974.73-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1662.727,1667.513,Does it take a separate equitable proceeding to get the injunction?
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,1667.513,1668.99,It just says in a --
1974.73-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1668.99,1670.389,And how about -- what's your Alabama facts?
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,1670.389,1674.875,"Yes, you do -- you have to go into the equity court after you have the convictions."
1974.73-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1674.875,1678.441,"Your Alabama judicial structure has a separate equity court, does it?"
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,1678.441,1680.35,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1687.057,1689.245,"(Voice Overlap)-- put on its equity, doesn't it?"
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,1689.245,1689.811,That's right.
1974.73-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1689.811,1690.665,Yes.
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,1690.665,1697.812,"But we still keep it divided, the equity judge is still lay and they still handle the automatic to refer him to the equity division anyway."
1974.73-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1697.812,1703.444,"So in any event, the statute contemplates a separate independent equitable proceeding even in the circumstances of the conviction?"
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,1703.444,1704.303,That's right.
1974.73-1119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1709.342,1720.742,"Can the equity court or the chancellor take some sort of notice or is there some sort of res judicata effect, do I gather from your reading of that language as a result of the criminal conviction?"
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,1720.742,1730.323,"Well, I play it safe, I introduced certified copies of the convictions are both and Recorder's Court and those that we had convictions in the Circuit Court."
1974.73-1119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1736.343,1738.443,Were they admitted in the equity proceeding?
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,1738.443,1745.024,They were admitted and there were evidence and proof of the convictions as previously mentioned.
1974.73-1119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1824.136,1832.243,But it takes a stipulation of the parties to the injunctive action in order to continue the permanent injunction beyond six months?
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,1832.243,1833.239,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1833.239,1835.023,And that there was such a stipulation here?
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,1835.023,1838.555,"Yes, sir, because of the appendices of this litigation."
1974.73-1119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1838.555,1840.26,And not to the temporary injunction?
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,1840.26,1847.545,"No, sir, they loss that because they only had 10 days and they did not take advantage of it."
1974.73-1119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1847.545,1859.414,I thought your 10 days to appeal the temporary injunction but that it will expire of its own force without any appeal in six month unless that was stipulated that be continued (Voice Overlap) --
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,1859.414,1863.705,A temporary restraining order which was not issued in this case would've been issued to ex parte.
1974.73-1119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1878.503,1880.775,What's the six months time that you --
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,1880.775,1909.763,"Well, after the temporary injunction is issued and there is no appeal taken from it within 10 days which is provided by the statute then after six months if the either party hasn't attempted to set it down for a final hearing on the question whether the injunction should be made permanent which is permanent until such a final hearing, then it automatically expires if no attempt is made to had it set down for a final hearing."
1974.73-1119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2116.985,2117.937,And unpleasant.
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,2117.937,2124.068,And unpleasant and you cannot stop pornography that way.
1974.73-1119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.888,2358.795,Do you want us to overrule ex parte Young?
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,2358.795,2360.496,"Ex parte, sir?"
1974.73-1119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2360.496,2361.277,Young?
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,2361.277,2363.05,"No, sir."
1974.73-1119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2371.06,2374.417,But in your argument you might not be.
1974.73-1119,1,27355,herbert_jenkins_jr,,2374.417,2400.844,"And I -- I read, I just merely -- I alternate is an alternative to some extent to show that I think that of course I realize that state officials can be sued but I was trying to say that it was -- well, action against the state and not myself and that should -- could be consideration."
1974.73-1119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2462.274,2463.25,Thank you Mr. Smith.
1974.73-1119,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,2467.008,2469.0,"Alright sir, thank you."
1974.73-1119,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2525.646,2528.157,The country wasn't confined to the traffic aspect?
1974.73-1119,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,2528.157,2532.454,"I know sir, there're young people going by and of course the same thing would be necessary true here."
1974.73-1119,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2601.441,2612.926,"Well, doesn't -- doesn't England type of abstention for a state law question mean retention of jurisdiction but Younger versus Harris has meant dismissal, hasn't it?"
1974.73-1119,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,2612.926,2633.967,"Yes, but if the Court if you will remember the opinion of the judge they suggested and it was a mixed bag that in this instance we have not gotten to a Younger versus Harris problem but we hadn't got into the special circumstances there because the state court could construe the statute in a manner which would take the federal constitutional question out of it."
1974.73-1119,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2660.133,2662.486,"Yes, that will be on Friday."
1974.73-1119,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,2662.486,2670.85,"Thank you, Your Honor."
