1989.88-1872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We'll hear argument now in Number 88-1872, Cynthia Rutan v. Republican Party of Illinois, and a companion case."
1989.88-1872,0,36188,mary_lee_leahy,,10.572,13.824,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,62.823,66.942,"Mrs. Leahy, Illinois has a civil service system?"
1989.88-1872,0,36188,mary_lee_leahy,,66.942,68.644,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,68.644,75.798,And it was... there was an executive order--
1989.88-1872,0,36188,mary_lee_leahy,,75.798,77.298,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,78.564,80.5,--that imposed a hiring freeze back in 1980?
1989.88-1872,0,36188,mary_lee_leahy,,80.5,81.583,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,81.583,83.785,And is that freeze still in effect?
1989.88-1872,0,36188,mary_lee_leahy,,83.785,84.552,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,84.552,100.329,And did the freeze in effect impose a new system of determining promotions and transfers and hires?
1989.88-1872,0,36188,mary_lee_leahy,,100.329,106.4,"Your Honor, I believe that this... yes, a new system imposed on the civil service system."
1989.88-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,106.4,110.602,"Because the freeze, the text of the freeze just said we won't have any more hiring."
1989.88-1872,0,36188,mary_lee_leahy,,110.602,116.856,"Unless I approve it, or someone that I delegate that authority to approves it."
1989.88-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.848,138.288,"And had the civil service system been in effect, there would not... you wouldn't be here."
1989.88-1872,0,36188,mary_lee_leahy,,144.708,155.5,"Your Honor, we believe, and we quoted in our brief, certain appellate court rulings in Illinois that talked about the purpose of the civil service system."
1989.88-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,163.987,171.61,Do you know how many states do not have a civil service system now for nonpolicy-making employees?
1989.88-1872,0,36188,mary_lee_leahy,,171.61,174.628,"No, Your Honor, I do not know the precise number."
1989.88-1872,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,178.38,186.702,"Just to be clear, the civil service system just had the Governor's order superimposed upon it."
1989.88-1872,0,36188,mary_lee_leahy,,187.719,188.802,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1872,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,188.802,198.908,"So that for the plaintiffs here, the civil service system was still operating in that it had examinations and it had a list of qualified people?"
1989.88-1872,0,36188,mary_lee_leahy,,198.908,205.145,"That is correct, Your Honor, but the decision now is made by the Governor's Office of Personnel."
1989.88-1872,1,43347,thomas_p_sullivan,,1387.598,1391.417,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1872,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1558.658,1571.716,"Mr. Sullivan, were all of the named plaintiffs here processed through that civil service system and tested and examined and rated and so forth?"
1989.88-1872,1,43347,thomas_p_sullivan,,1571.716,1572.349,"Yes, they were."
1989.88-1872,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1580.904,1587.475,"And they were included in the list of eligibles for promotion, transfer, et cetera?"
1989.88-1872,1,43347,thomas_p_sullivan,,1587.475,1587.891,Yes.
1989.88-1872,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1623.6,1626.552,"Well, we're here on a motion to dismiss, I guess."
1989.88-1872,1,43347,thomas_p_sullivan,,1626.552,1626.868,Yes.
1989.88-1872,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1627.835,1633.622,I am just trying to find out whether they all were tested and processed through the civil service system.
1989.88-1872,1,43347,thomas_p_sullivan,,1633.622,1634.455,--The answer is yes.
1989.88-1872,2,36188,mary_lee_leahy,,2776.461,2781.246,May it please the Court:
1989.88-1872,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.964,2843.82,"xxx make much difference; they both are qualified, as long as the choice is made to pick the well-qualified Republican."
1989.88-1872,2,36188,mary_lee_leahy,,2843.82,2854.378,"No, Your Honor, in this case, specifically pled, that Petitioners Rutan and Taylor were more qualified than who was chosen."
1989.88-1872,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2854.378,2860.698,"Well, I know, but it wouldn't... your case would be just as good on... your constitutional argument if they were equally qualified."
1989.88-1872,2,36188,mary_lee_leahy,,2860.698,2861.515,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1872,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3026.404,3028.654,"Thank you, Ms. Leahy."
