2011.11-166,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.104,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-166, RadLAX Gateway Hotel v. Amalgamated Bank."
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,9.022,12.141,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-166,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,82.568,90.158,But how does one determine what is the indubitable equivalent of the creditor's claim?
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,90.158,101.381,"The indubitable equivalent will be determined at the time of plan confirmation, in our case after the sale has been conducted although not yet approved by the court."
2011.11-166,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,102.315,106.533,The sale -- something -- the sale can't go on without the court's approval.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,109.735,111.154,"--Well, here's what happens typically."
2011.11-166,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,138.138,143.625,And so what qualifies as indubitably equivalent?
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,143.625,151.481,The indubitable equivalent must be an amount that is at least equal to the amount of the secured claim.
2011.11-166,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,159.818,172.728,"Suppose the -- suppose the creditor thinks that the sale was -- undervalued the assets, that it -- it wasn't the equivalent?"
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,172.728,192.306,"The creditor has an opportunity at the plan confirmation hearing to raise any issue with regard to the sale process, with regard to the auction that occurred, has the opportunity to raise any other issue that may bear on the price that is received at the sale that occurs."
2011.11-166,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,199.961,207.065,"Well, isn't the -- isn't the issue who is going to decide whether something is really the indubitable equivalent?"
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,215.921,217.173,"--Well, it's--"
2011.11-166,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,217.173,222.075,"--namely, where there can be credit bidding, which is what the -- which is what the Respondent would like?"
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,222.075,227.313,"--It's going to be the judge, after reviewing what happens at the sale."
2011.11-166,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,236.318,247.792,"Well, if the Respondent thought that what the judge would determine would indubitably provide the indubitable equivalent, then there wouldn't be an issue here, right?"
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,258.584,265.688,"In this particular instance, I would suggest that the -- the creditor simply does not want the asset sold."
2011.11-166,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,269.59,275.294,Isn't that -- isn't that pretty much what he bargained for when he insisted upon security before giving the loan?
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,275.294,281.363,"--Well, what they bargained for was that the asset be liquidated and all of the proceeds applied to their loan."
2011.11-166,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,285.501,296.223,"Well, you're depriving the secured creditor of the opportunity to hold on to the asset, because he thinks it is, for perhaps a short period, unreasonably devalued."
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,297.642,308.431,"Well, he -- he is denied that right under subsection (i), which is our traditional reorganization, internal reorganization provision of section 1129(b)(2)(A)."
2011.11-166,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,308.431,311.0,Did I cut off your answer to Justice Alito?
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,311.0,329.727,"Well, with regard to the indubitable equivalent, clearly the judge is going to make that determination, but that's no different than the judge making a determination under subsection (i) as to what the fair market value of the collateral is for purposes of determining the note that the creditor is going to receive and be paid off over time."
2011.11-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,329.727,344.904,"Could the -- could the judge say when the proposal is made to him, the only way I can be sure that it is the indubitable equivalent is to have the sale open to credit bidding, which is what we always do?"
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,346.923,360.513,"If there is testimony provided to the judge that that is the way that will maximize the sale proceeds and that in fact you can't get indubitable equivalence unless you allow credit bidding, it would seem to me under that circumstance the judge would have that discretion."
2011.11-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,360.513,361.182,"Now, you're--"
2011.11-166,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,361.182,374.606,"It makes no sense to me what you are saying, because under all circumstances the credit bid, unless the property is valued higher than the credit bid amount, but then another bidder could -- could make -- enter that bid."
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,374.606,375.523,"Well, the problem is when--"
2011.11-166,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,375.523,377.375,The maximum value always has to be the value of the credit.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,377.375,378.575,"--Well, I--"
2011.11-166,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,378.575,383.796,If the -- if the -- if the creditor is willing to put it at risk that way.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,383.796,385.798,"--Your Honor, I would disagree."
2011.11-166,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,411.781,412.915,What's wrong with that?
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,441.384,449.321,That in essence would be denying chapter 11 relief to a host of debtors where their collateral is worth--
2011.11-166,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,449.321,451.773,"Well, in accordance with (i), (ii) and (iii)."
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,453.875,458.277,"--What -- the problem is, you are cutting off the bankruptcy process really before it has--"
2011.11-166,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,458.277,459.262,I don't understand that.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,534.51,535.346,--Your Honor--
2011.11-166,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,535.346,537.396,So that's the whole thing as I am seeing it at this moment.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,539.048,539.748,--Thank you.
2011.11-166,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,558.026,561.328,"No, it doesn't have the language, which is why we have a case."
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,579.708,580.608,--Well--
2011.11-166,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,580.608,581.241,So why not?
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,587.212,591.433,"--If you are looking at it from the perspective of the creditor saying well, this--"
2011.11-166,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,591.433,594.735,"No, I'm looking at it from the perspective of a bankruptcy system--"
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,594.735,595.301,--Okay.
2011.11-166,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,595.301,605.106,"--that is trying to get secured creditors what they have their security in, while giving the debtor the advantage here of being able to stretch out his payments."
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,605.106,618.53,"I agree, and there are other parties and interests in a bankruptcy case, including obviously unsecured creditors, that get nothing if the result is all the creditor gets is the relief from the automatic stay to foreclose on the collateral when you have this great discrepancy between what--"
2011.11-166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,618.53,620.116,"Well, how would they get anything, anyway?"
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,644.147,652.101,"--Well, in our particular instance obviously there are some senior liens that would be paid, including things like mechanic's liens and real estate taxes."
2011.11-166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,653.77,661.876,"But those are -- those continue forward, so even if the secured creditor got the property, there would be mechanic's liens on the property, isn't that right?"
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,661.876,679.921,"--That's true, although resolving them pursuant to a plan is usually a better resolution for them, by providing more certainty and -- with regard to the result, and a more quicker resolution usually, as opposed to being relegated only to State court to fight them."
2011.11-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.321,682.54,"--Mr. Neff, can -- are you done?"
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,684.607,693.412,--I was only going to say that in our particular instance the stalking horse had agreed over a future time after it obtains the property to provide for recovery to general unsecured creditors.
2011.11-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.412,696.782,Can I -- let's look at the text.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,743.678,753.719,"Subsection (ii) provides that if you allow credit bidding regardless of the price that's achieved, that that is deemed to be fair and equitable treatment of the secured creditor's claim."
2011.11-166,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,753.719,756.171,But that's just not true from what you just said.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,791.161,804.152,"With regard to Justice Scalia's question, all I was trying to point out is that in subsection (ii), regardless of the price that is achieved as long as you allow the secured creditor the right to credit bid."
2011.11-166,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,804.152,804.819,So why doesn't he get--
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,804.819,805.636,That's the fair and equitable--
2011.11-166,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,805.636,810.222,--Why doesn't he get everything that the buyer is promising to everyone else?
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,826.684,829.536,--The secured creditor will get all the proceeds from the property.
2011.11-166,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,829.536,831.819,"Not -- with sales price, but not from all the payments."
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,831.819,832.253,Right.
2011.11-166,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,839.409,840.892,You still haven't answered my--
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,840.892,849.464,"There are other benefits that the secured -- that will get, that will increase the -- the price that is received by having sold the property in bankruptcy."
2011.11-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,853.234,854.501,Yes.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,854.501,864.29,"So clearly to the extent that the transfer taxes being saved are in an amount that ultimately exceeds what ultimately goes to the unsecured creditors, these--"
2011.11-166,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,864.29,865.392,--You still haven't answered my question.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,876.365,883.004,--It would be our obligation to show at confirmation that the creditor is paying the top dollar for the asset.
2011.11-166,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,902.499,920.294,"Could you explain what the reasoning is for requiring a credit bid if property is sold during the plan, but not permitting it when it's sold at the plan's--"
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,920.294,920.777,Sure.
2011.11-166,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,920.777,923.079,--Doesn't that delay the bankruptcy in every situation?
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,930.168,934.053,"Is your question why we always have it under section 363, but not under the plan?"
2011.11-166,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,934.053,934.67,Uh-hmm.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,934.67,940.274,Section allows the sale of property outside the ordinary course of business during a bankruptcy case.
2011.11-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.982,981.017,"Mr. Neff, don't you feel sorry for the United States?"
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1003.783,1006.25,"Well, no, I don't think that that is the case."
2011.11-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1032.65,1033.652,I don't understand.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1033.652,1044.725,"--Well, they can seek from the Bankruptcy Court a greater role when the asset is being marketed for sale to ensure that they are receiving top dollar on their claim."
2011.11-166,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1044.725,1046.894,They don't have that right now?
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1046.894,1053.13,"Well, when we sell assets the debtor typically has the control over how it's going to be marketed and sold."
2011.11-166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1075.896,1080.115,"Mr. Neff, can I understand how your system would actually work in practice?"
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1102.713,1103.313,Right.
2011.11-166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1103.313,1110.052,And now the court has to decide whether it's $500 or $750 after the auction has gone forward.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1110.786,1121.358,"The court is going to review the process to actually sell the asset, who was -- where was it marketed, who knew about it, who showed up at the auction, how many bids were made."
2011.11-166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1121.358,1125.996,"Well, now let's say the court says: You know, I think that the government is right; it's really $750."
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1127.598,1128.098,Right.
2011.11-166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1128.098,1129.998,And you've sold it for $500.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1129.998,1130.982,There has been no closing.
2011.11-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1139.921,1153.146,"But wouldn't the court always say, when it's confronted with this situation, the government comes in and the court says, yes, well, you know, I guess that that price is probably so low because nobody could credit bid."
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1161.352,1174.828,"No, because you are going to have situations where creditors -- secured creditors will credit bid amounts that have no relationship to the fair market value, what we call, for instance, loan-to-own lenders, where their only interest is actually getting the title to the property."
2011.11-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1178.63,1191.371,"Well, that might be, but it doesn't -- it doesn't take a genius to figure out that if you allow people to bid for cash or for credit, you are going to get more bids and higher bids than if you allow them to bid for cash only."
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1191.371,1206.298,"--The problem is when you are dealing with larger assets, like what we are dealing with, you are not going to get a sophisticated buyer to come in to bid against a lender that can credit bid, particularly in a situation like our case, where the lender has said: I simply want the property back."
2011.11-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1206.298,1210.183,That just means that you can't find a buyer who is willing to pay that much.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1210.183,1217.588,"Well, we believe that -- that subsection (iii) allows us to show that the secured creditors receiving the--"
2011.11-166,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1217.588,1224.675,"Look, in subsection (iii), if it applies here -- I assume -- suppose it doesn't apply here."
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1271.939,1272.941,"--Yes, I do."
2011.11-166,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1272.941,1273.341,Good.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1273.341,1279.01,The bankruptcy judge sees this in a variety of cases.
2011.11-166,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1304.243,1307.597,"But the concern was, I gather, there is no other bidder, you have said."
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1340.168,1342.937,"--Interestingly, the process actually works a little different than that."
2011.11-166,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1361.998,1369.754,"When this procedure is followed, how often does a buyer other than the stalking horse obtain the property?"
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1369.754,1371.854,I don't know from a statistical basis.
2011.11-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1390.584,1392.201,I didn't realize the judge had to approve--
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1392.201,1394.986,The stalking horse?
2011.11-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1394.986,1395.47,--Yes.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1395.47,1395.953,Yes.
2011.11-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1395.953,1398.004,The judge has to approve the stalking horse?
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1398.004,1399.273,That's part of the bid procedures.
2011.11-166,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1410.412,1416.249,The vast majority of bankruptcy courts have permitted credit bidding in these situations.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1427.374,1435.797,"I would say the vast majority of cases occur under section 363, where there is no question because of 363(k) that there is the right--"
2011.11-166,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1435.797,1437.197,And stalking horses still come in.
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1443.568,1444.018,--That is true.
2011.11-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1456.626,1457.86,Say it again?
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1459.512,1473.755,"--When you are selling under section 363, because of 363(k) there must be a right to credit bid; and, in most situations, the secured creditor wants the assets sold when you are doing a section 363 sale."
2011.11-166,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1482.51,1486.162,"Well, this is a case, though, where you would not want the asset sold."
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1498.32,1498.92,That's correct.
2011.11-166,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1510.628,1517.684,What is the doubtless equivalent of his claim?
2011.11-166,0,21301,david_m_neff,,1526.306,1538.197,"It's going to be measured by the current market conditions, but to the extent that the secured creditor brings in an appraisal that will invariably be based on what the projections are going to be and take that into account."
2011.11-166,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1541.149,1541.949,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1547.97,1550.855,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1597.334,1603.238,Or -- or he is entitled to realize the indubitable equivalent of his claims.
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1608.707,1609.441,"No, Your Honor."
2011.11-166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1663.111,1665.428,They tried and failed to prove what?
2011.11-166,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1665.428,1666.496,Cause.
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1666.496,1668.48,"Your Honor, cause."
2011.11-166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1668.48,1669.015,Cause.
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1669.015,1677.954,So under -- we reprint the 1129 clause (ii) is on 20a in the red brief at the back.
2011.11-166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1730.419,1742.56,Your -- your friend on the other side suggests that (ii) and (iii) address different ways of protecting the secured creditor.
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1760.988,1770.394,"I don't think that's a fair characterization of the three clauses, Mr. Chief Justice, because all three of the clauses have both procedural and substantive components."
2011.11-166,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1797.296,1810.888,Is it correct that really the heart of your argument is that the real value of this property is greater than the value that you think the Bankruptcy Court would assign to it if this were done under subsection (iii)?
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1810.888,1814.34,"That is definitely the fear, Justice Alito."
2011.11-166,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1814.34,1815.108,Why?
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1815.758,1822.446,"Because valuations are inherently uncertain, and Congress knew that."
2011.11-166,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1827.583,1830.702,But doesn't clause (i) depend upon a judicial valuation?
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1837.705,1839.307,"That's true, Justice Kagan."
2011.11-166,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1904.15,1907.868,How about in subsection (iii) where it talks about substitute collateral?
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1910.82,1918.159,"That would be true, but I think in that situation we would also have the option to make the 1111(b) election."
2011.11-166,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1941.706,1956.884,What is it about the auction -- what is it about the auction process that you think is likely to produce or creates an unacceptable risk of producing a valuation that is -- that is too low?
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1963.121,1978.297,"If the secured creditors aren't able to come in and bid their credit, and if the secured creditors can't, as is a real risk, raise enough cash to bid the amount of their credit in cash -- and in some instances, as with the government, they can't, they actually can't."
2011.11-166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2000.16,2007.833,"Well, but there is, of course, a good reason which is consistent with the policy of the Bankruptcy Code, which is you do want to look out for the other creditors as well."
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2018.806,2029.414,"There will be no cash for anyone junior to these creditors unless these creditors are paid in full, regardless of whether everyone bids in cash or we bid in credit."
2011.11-166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2037.603,2043.423,"Well, maybe in this particular case, but that's not going to be true in every case and we are asked to issue a ruling that is going to apply in every case."
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2043.423,2054.562,"--In every case where the property is under water, there will be -- in every case in which the secured creditor has a lien on the property, the secured creditor takes first."
2011.11-166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2057.916,2069.155,"Well, I know, but the whole premise of why this problem arises is that the security is worth a lot less than -- than it was obviously when it was purchased."
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2075.895,2088.968,"--Everyone agrees that the property is under water, but it's important to note that the valuations in this case that have been filed in the district court in conjunction with the relief from the stay, the appraisals are different by tens of millions of dollars, what the property is worth."
2011.11-166,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2105.147,2116.872,"I was just guessing before, but, I mean, if you're right, what is the (iii), the indubitable equivalent, what kind of situation does that come up?"
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2133.664,2134.583,"--The legislative history,--"
2011.11-166,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2136.449,2136.816,What?
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2136.816,2137.368,Two examples.
2011.11-166,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2144.622,2144.972,"Yes, I'm sure."
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2144.972,2147.574,But that -- there aren't very many clause (iii) cases.
2011.11-166,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2169.756,2170.339,That's what I was thinking.
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2170.339,2177.443,"--courts are very hesitant to do that, and it would have to be really -- because it is -- you know, you are stripping our lien; you're supposedly giving us an equal lien."
2011.11-166,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2188.401,2203.16,"Could you tell me what the -- what's the purpose -- if you permit credit bidding, why do you go through the sale at all, if it's always -- if the credit is always going to be higher than the value?"
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2210.764,2216.401,"It's not a sham, Justice Sotomayor, because the creditor -- secured creditors don't often want to run a hotel and parking garage."
2011.11-166,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2225.524,2227.542,So it is the stalking horse dance.
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2234.28,2235.882,--That's definitely one of the strategies.
2011.11-166,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2252.257,2263.632,"When do you think under 363(k), what's good -- what would constitute or has constituted in the case law good cause not to permit credit bidding?"
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2270.469,2275.957,--The cause cases include malfeasance of the creditor in some way--
2011.11-166,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2275.957,2276.757,I'm sorry.
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2277.125,2279.175,--Malfeasance of the creditor in some way.
2011.11-166,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2280.427,2282.611,--How does a creditor commit malfeasance?
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2282.611,2288.014,"--I'm sorry, I can't remember any specific examples."
2011.11-166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2422.65,2425.252,How does it work in practice?
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2458.307,2461.425,"I think all those things are ways that it can happen, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.11-166,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2505.469,2514.827,Wouldn't that be a reason for saying there's no adequate -- there's nothing under (iii) that would be the indubitable equivalent?
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2534.838,2550.833,"I don't think that latter way would be the better reading of the statute, Justice Ginsburg, because Congress turned its attention to this precise problem and decided that the best way to protect the secured creditor against the risk of undervaluation was to allow it to -- to bid."
2011.11-166,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2579.852,2591.091,The Petitioner suggests that the usual rule that the specific governs rather than the general provision doesn't apply in this case because the specific is not a subset of the general.
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2594.529,2597.145,"Well, this Court's never applied the rule in that way."
2011.11-166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2626.764,2627.25,I lost you.
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2631.935,2633.237,--The for cause.
2011.11-166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2674.731,2680.551,You said earlier we have never said that the specific has to be a subset of the general.
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2692.876,2696.327,"Well, maybe I misunderstood Justice Kagan's question or misunderstood their point."
2011.11-166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2736.554,2744.325,"So when we say our doctrine says the specific controls over the general, the specific is a subset of the general?"
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2744.325,2755.366,"--Yes, to the extent that I think it's always fair to say that what the party who's claiming they fit within the general does could definitionally possibly fit within the general."
2011.11-166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2755.366,2756.216,Thank you.
2011.11-166,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2756.216,2756.885,Thank you.
2011.11-166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2756.885,2771.059,Ms. Harrington.
2011.11-166,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2771.059,2773.161,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please--"
2011.11-166,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2773.161,2774.597,"--big case for the government, Ms. Harrington, isn't it?"
2011.11-166,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2774.597,2775.313,--Pardon me?
2011.11-166,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2775.313,2776.963,It is a big case for the government.
2011.11-166,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2776.963,2777.898,It is a big case for the government.
2011.11-166,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2814.255,2821.091,You have got a whole cadre of U.S. trustees that presumably can look out for the interests of the poor United States.
2011.11-166,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2821.091,2830.097,"Well, in most chapter 11 cases the U.S. trustee doesn't play a role because it's a debtor in possession, and so the trustee is not in charge of the property of the estate."
2011.11-166,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2830.847,2833.066,I thought we were worried about the situation where it's a creditor.
2011.11-166,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2833.066,2835.185,--Where the -- where the United States is a creditor.
2011.11-166,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2837.187,2839.337,"In those cases, of course, the trustee's there, right?"
2011.11-166,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2839.337,2852.13,"--The trustee is there, but if the debtor proposes a plan that wouldn't allow the United States to credit bid at an auction that is selling its collateral, then the United States is usually out of luck because the Antideficiency Act prevents us from bidding cash."
2011.11-166,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2919.438,2925.526,"Well, but of course it could bid up if it thinks that there are going to be other bidders, right?"
2011.11-166,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2930.563,2933.448,"I mean, it has more flexibility because it has already put up its money."
2011.11-166,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2950.227,2951.144,That just begs the question.
2011.11-166,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2955.279,2955.963,--Absolutely.
2011.11-166,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3028.244,3029.496,What is the reference?
2011.11-166,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3046.655,3052.275,"Well, the type of sale contemplated in clause (ii) is essentially a liquidation of the secured creditor's lien on a property."
2011.11-166,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3126.937,3132.941,"Of course, valuing property is what bankruptcy judges do all the time, right?"
2011.11-166,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3132.941,3134.426,They -- they definitely do.
2011.11-166,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3201.835,3203.17,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.11-166,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3203.17,3203.937,Thank you.
2011.11-166,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3203.937,3207.039,"Mr. Neff, you have 4 minutes remaining."
2011.11-166,3,21301,david_m_neff,,3207.039,3226.784,"With regard to the market valuation, we are doing a market valuation, as this Court instructed in the 203 North LaSalle case from 1999, by having an auction, and after that auction still having to prove up that we've given the indubitable equivalent by showing what occurred at that auction."
2011.11-166,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3241.376,3255.786,"What you just said is so long as they come in with some appraisals that are above what -- what the property sold at for cash, then it's not the indubitable equivalent?"
2011.11-166,3,21301,david_m_neff,,3255.786,3256.27,--If they can--
2011.11-166,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3256.27,3259.472,Because you've got to have at least one appraiser who says it's -- it's worth more.
2011.11-166,3,21301,david_m_neff,,3260.405,3260.738,--Right.
2011.11-166,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3263.024,3264.857,Indubitable is indubitable.
2011.11-166,3,21301,david_m_neff,,3264.857,3265.792,It's a very high standard.
2011.11-166,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3266.776,3268.928,If you have one honest appraiser who says--
2011.11-166,3,21301,david_m_neff,,3268.928,3293.043,"--If it is a creditable appraisal and we were unable to achieve that, then we will have a very difficult time satisfying that standard; but, the process will have been allowed to play out, which is extremely important because those of us who have done debtor work know how many times a lender doesn't want to do something, and ultimately you have a sale or otherwise some sort of disposition of assets, the price gets high enough, and they are willing to go along with it."
2011.11-166,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3296.345,3301.582,"--What happens if you go to the judge and the judge says: There is one higher bid, so I can't say it's indubitable?"
2011.11-166,3,21301,david_m_neff,,3302.382,3309.921,--Then you would have to provide additional consideration to the secured creditor to get it to the level that the judge would find it to be indubitable.
2011.11-166,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3321.628,3327.282,"Well, that assumes that you can just pull out a wad of cash from your back pocket, but mostly the debtors are not in that position."
2011.11-166,3,21301,david_m_neff,,3329.849,3336.055,"It's more so that the purchaser would have to come up with that, would have to come up with that or find some other way to bridge that gap."

2011.11-166,3,21301,david_m_neff,,3415.84,3416.507,Okay.
2011.11-166,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3416.507,3419.142,What's the business value for upsetting the norm?
