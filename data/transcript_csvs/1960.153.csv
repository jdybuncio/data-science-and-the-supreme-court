1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,114.287,116.245,"It's not a coerced, no, Your Honor."
1960.153,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,322.318,324.634,"How long after the robbery did this occur, Mr. Mahoney?"
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,324.634,354.094,"Approximately 12 days Your Honor, the difference between February 15th and February 27th of 1956. When he got outside of the bank, the petitioner was released by the F. B. I. Investigation, of course, as you can readily appreciate, followed from that particular time, but with no molestation as far as actual custody interrogation of the petitioner was concerned."

1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,1130.941,1135.549,"In other words, what I'm saying is they didn't come out and give many mandate or command."
1960.153,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1139.654,1143.179,The lower courts found to contrary of it?

1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,1629.188,1630.536,Do you want their page in the record?
1960.153,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1630.536,1639.178,I was wondering at that time did they mention Coppola as being one of the to make this robbery a tenant robbery.

1960.153,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1716.29,1718.672,Who paid for the lunch?
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,1718.672,1722.713,I think that's a confidential communication.[Attempt to Laughter]
1960.153,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1780.37,1786.292,"Suppose those are -- are state offenses also, aren't they?"

1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,1790.185,1796.017,"-- I think Justice Warren or Clark before that, they are state violations."
1960.153,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1796.017,1797.369,Yes.
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,1797.369,1808.54,"Now, he doesn't claim and -- and he never claimed in his testimony that -- as to whether or not his interrogation was concerning the federal side of an order of the State."

1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2033.44,2049.149,"Yes, Your Honor, this is January 10th, and at about 9:00 o'clock, the police officers took the petitioner out of the cell block and brought him to a small office where the two agents, Eddy and Jensen were seated."
1960.153,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2125.044,2127.977,This was in the Erie County Jail or Buffalo City Jail?
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2127.977,2131.772,This was in police headquarters of the Buffalo Police Department.
1960.153,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2131.772,2133.16,He was in a lockup here.
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2133.16,2136.097,"Yes, Your Honor, the lockup."
1960.153,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2172.041,2173.403,When was that reached?
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2173.403,2179.409,That was January the 11th at approximately 11:00 a.m.

1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2211.064,2212.174,"On January 11th,Your Honor?"
1960.153,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2212.174,2220.883,"Yes, when they filed the charge before the United States Commissioner that you say about 11:00 o'clock, did the Government then demand custody?"
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2220.883,2237.895,The Government called police headquarters and talked to Klenk and asked him if he would deliver the petitioner in this case to the office of the U.S. Commissioner to surrender him to the F. B. I.
1960.153,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2237.895,2238.544,Did they do that?
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2238.544,2258.317,"At that particular time, that was not done because at 11:00 o'clock in the morning, the petitioner was taken over to the office of the District Attorney in what we call an Erie County hall and they were held there or he was held there until approximately 1:00 p.m."
1960.153,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2274.26,2276.507,They had been booked on that before?
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2278.537,2290.2,"He was not booked according to Klenk until 1:00 or 1:10 on January 11th, 1957."
1960.153,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2290.596,2293.76,At the same day he was -- same time he was arraigned.
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2293.76,2296.807,"About an hour before arraignment, Your Honor, yes."
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2411.497,2417.702,Do you think that's a term -- do you think that as a term of art of working arrangement?
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2420.42,2422.776,"No, I don't think so, Your Honor."
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2422.776,2427.16,Just a colloquial phrase which relates to a set of circumstances to be --
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2427.16,2427.287,That's --
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2427.287,2428.963,-- demonstrated in each case.
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2428.963,2429.725,That's true.
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2429.725,2431.71,"It's not a litmus paper test, isn't it?"
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2431.71,2433.24,"No, very true."
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2455.565,2456.492,I think that --
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2456.492,2457.235,I think I -- I beg your pardon.
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2457.235,2458.138,I'm sorry.
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2458.138,2470.165,I should think the two cases cited after the phrase working arrangement or a few words after by as the Gambino indicates what was meant.
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2470.165,2471.684,"By the Gambino case, Your Honor?"
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2471.684,2482.842,"I say the Gambino case and the Byars case cited for and used the following sentence using the phrase “working arraignment” indicates what is meant by working arrangement, doesn't it?"
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2482.842,2507.251,"I would say that there, it's suggestive of just what is meant and even in spite of that particular fact, I do say to the Court that the circumstances proven here, the continuity of them, the number of them, and the substance of what occurred certainly would seem to me to bring it within the Byars case that they had a hand in it."
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2507.251,2513.586,"But won't you -- won't you go beyond -- all that I was suggesting, Senator Mahoney is that working arrangement isn't a talismanic phrase."
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2513.586,2513.82,No.
1960.153,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2515.949,2525.977,Do you think it means more than an effort to try to solve the crime?
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2525.977,2531.834,"Well, the question then arises, Your Honor, as to the breath of what is an effort to solve a crime."
1960.153,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2531.834,2544.096,"Not just that there's an exchange of information, anything they heard as to any leads on any crime that was -- bank robbery I suppose is well known in the community."
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2544.096,2555.527,"Well, and I -- I certainly think that cooperation between those agencies would be commendable, and I wouldn't be one -- for one at any time that I would criticize it."
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2655.478,2659.435,"Senator Mahoney, all -- all words are rather sharp instruments."
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2659.435,2659.812,That's true.
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2659.812,2662.102,You can't avoid them -- avoid that.
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2684.956,2685.57,Yes.
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2685.57,2695.263,"Should you accept that as the colloquial way of trying to express the same idea that lay behind that phrase, in the context of the Anderson case?"
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2703.446,2704.1,Sure that they were partners --
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2704.1,2719.841,Not that while somebody's in complete control of somebody else he had lead to somebody else to talk to and that's a very different thing from -- from the -- what I call partners being active companions in a common enterprise.
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2719.841,2721.964,"Well, and -- and I would say again in answer to that, Your --"
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2721.964,2723.114,I'm not suggesting that --
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2723.114,2723.35,No.
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2723.35,2726.071,-- this does or doesn't come within the phrase.
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2731.914,2764.192,"Well, I -- I would say very candidly to the Court that I think that the admissions made by special agent Roche as well as those made by Chief of Detectives Golombeck show that they were partners in this venture and not only were they partners in it but what came from the lips of special agent Roche was that he and his agents under him were partners with Golombeck and Klenk, and members of the Buffalo Police Department of a lesser rank and I --"
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2764.192,2773.657,"When you -- when you use language like that, you imply as -- you imply responsibility on the part of federal officials, don't you?"
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2773.657,2773.966,That's true.
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2773.966,2774.897,And that's implied in --
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2774.897,2775.946,Yes.
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2775.946,2783.426,"-- that it isn't by grace of the state authority were they're allowed to do something but they had a responsible, active controlling share."
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2784.733,2788.705,"That's true, Your Honor."
1960.153,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2789.647,2790.771,Could I ask one question?
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2790.771,2791.213,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.153,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2791.213,2808.912,"Is there any evidence that the period of interrogation whether by police, by the state police, or by the federal officers prolonged while this man was -- at the request of the F. B. I., while he was in the hands of the state authority?"
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2808.912,2820.884,"Your Honor please, the -- the testimony in sort of a capsule form is that the interrogation was from 2:30 until 3:30 on January 10th, from 3:30 to 4:00 on that same day --"
1960.153,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2820.884,2821.576,Yes.
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2821.576,2838.073,"Then there was some additional interrogation by the police officers relative to what they were interested in and then the interrogation of the petitioner started at 9:02 p.m. on January 10th and ended at 12:45 a.m. on January the 11th, 1957."
1960.153,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2838.073,2851.55,"Well, if I didn't make myself clear, is there -- and during that whole period of time, is there any evidence that there was a -- there was a -- that a point had been reached where the State was willing to have this fellow arraigned --"

1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2859.343,2877.65,The only -- the only evidence in the case was that the State had never indicated that it was going to do anything else throughout the 10th as well as the 11th of January up until 1:10 p.m. to hold a man on suspicion or as they call it on open charge.
1960.153,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2879.132,2879.406,Yes.

1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,2982.488,2998.277,He's the Buffalo police and he interrogated as soon as he came back from lunch but his interrogation as I said before covered among other things the Manufacturers and Traders Trust and also the Liberty Bank.

1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3007.593,3008.628,"No, Your Honor."
1960.153,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3008.628,3012.065,I suppose each side was afraid of what the answers might be?
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3012.065,3018.009,"Well I -- if they weren't afraid, they were really careful."
1960.153,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3037.122,3039.674,I didn't mean any mandate but I just wondered if there's any inquiry at all --

1960.153,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3039.84,3040.655,-- as to what --
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3040.655,3042.338,"There was none, Your Honor."

1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3345.576,3346.697,-- I think I got it.
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3352.432,3353.452,Yes.
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3353.452,3359.448,"-- People against (Inaudible), which is very familiar to yourself and other kindred cases."
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3372.282,3377.325,"Well, and I -- I assume and knew there was -- Judge Cardozo's opinion before -- before --"
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3377.325,3378.551,Before.
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3378.551,3382.666,"But -- and you referred to page 82, Senator Mahoney."

1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3383.375,3385.668,What charges were faced against number 10?
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3396.33,3399.429,"If Your Honor please, I -- I think I can answer it this way."
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3428.729,3431.604,"Well, is that common practice just to put down investigation?"
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3431.604,3431.763,Yes.
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3431.763,3432.02,That is --
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3432.02,3432.663,I found that to be --
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3432.663,3436.12,"And to -- and to call any charge, sounds a little odd, doesn't it?"
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3436.12,3436.98,In what?
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3436.98,3441.315,That an investigation is called a charge that was at large.
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3441.315,3441.504,"Well, I know."
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3441.504,3442.69,There's no warrant of arrest --
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3442.69,3443.687,No warrant of arrest.
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3443.687,3446.197,"No warrant of arrest, no charge, it's just an investigation."
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3446.197,3457.211,"But it's just loose talk on the part of those police officers that, you know, they're talking a certain type of jargon and you can't control them, but I would say that if that was definitely loose talk --"
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3457.211,3465.329,"While your -- while the Court of Appeals -- while you haven't got the exclusionary rules, they have from time to time and sets things about this, the Court of Appeals."
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3465.446,3469.84,Very definite and they've set convictions aside our Court of Appeals.
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3482.118,3493.943,"Well -- well, is your answer saying that the evidence would not be excluded also covers that they -- the question whether failure to obey the statute leads them to set aside the conviction."
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3493.943,3496.863,Failure to obey does lead them to set aside the conviction.
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3496.863,3498.155,Then I'll repeat my question.
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3503.826,3521.895,"I think, Your Honor, in view of what our Court of Appeals has said that there definitely would be a reversal if this testimony were allowed to be introduced in state court and merely because of the violation on the part of the police officers in detaining illegally."
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3525.489,3529.152,A little difficult of -- there and -- for me to reconcile that with the general rule that --
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3529.152,3529.162,That's true.
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3529.162,3537.225,-- the mere fact of the evidence is obtained from the circumstances of -- it pursues him illegal or in violation of the Constitution.
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3537.225,3537.678,"Well, we have a section --"
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3537.678,3540.571,"You now have a search and seizure provision, haven't you, in New York?"
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3540.571,3541.445,"Yes, we have."
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3541.445,3555.86,"So that now, evidence may be procured in violation of the search and seizure provision of the State Constitution, but that would not exclude the evidence, but failure to arraign in time might lead to a reversal."
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3555.86,3556.526,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3556.663,3557.58,A little difficult to reconcile.
1960.153,0,45434,william_b_mahoney,,3557.58,3558.337,It's true.
1960.153,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3564.414,3565.853,Mr. Heffron.
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,3565.853,3570.686,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3621.346,3627.568,"When you say culpable, we get into trouble sometimes, we use moral terms."
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,3648.786,3649.932,"Yes, it would."
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3649.932,3658.148,"So when you say culpable, you introduce an element of -- of moral responsibility that isn't required."
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,3658.148,3658.284,"Well, I --"
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3658.284,3662.477,It may -- it may accompany to transaction but it isn't a test.
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,3662.477,3666.122,"No, we would not insist that that is a test."
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3870.204,3874.487,"Well, up to this time, doesn't anything that calls for interpretation."
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,3883.212,3884.091,No.
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3884.219,3886.707,So there's no problem as yet.

1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3887.018,3887.714,Is that right?
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,3887.714,3888.139,That's right.
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3888.934,3889.084,Alright.
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,3889.084,3890.019,-- this point.
1960.153,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3969.46,3969.462,Is that the --
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,3969.462,3970.794,There's been no trial under it.
1960.153,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3970.794,3973.77,Is that the robbery that occurred at the Butcher shop?
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,3973.77,3974.934,"Yes, that is the Butcher shop robbery."
1960.153,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3974.934,3976.408,On January 4 --
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,3976.408,3976.596,Yes.
1960.153,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3976.596,3979.31,-- 1957.
1960.153,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3979.31,3981.825,"January 23rd of what year, the indictment was returned?"
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,3981.825,3983.632,Of 1957.
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4032.735,4053.97,How much upon do you -- how much time transpired -- took place between the arraignment either by state or federal -- under state or a federal charge other than the investigation -- arraignment I'm talking about.
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,4064.447,4066.658,I'm not sure I -- I understand -- I understand the question.
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4066.658,4071.727,That the Federal -- the F. B. I. people talk with the petitioner before he was arraigned.
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,4072.11,4072.76,Yes.
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4072.76,4078.36,How much time elapsed between the time that they talked to him and the time that he was arraigned?
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,4078.36,4084.945,They talked to him at -- from 9:00 o'clock in the evening until midnight or past midnight.
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4090.033,4096.734,"So the -- they just intervened the night and before noon, is that right?"
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,4096.734,4097.509,"Yes, sir."
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4097.509,4098.14,Alright.
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,4098.14,4098.493,And --
1960.153,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4098.493,4100.875,The state arraignment was at 12:00.

1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,4139.001,4139.346,No.
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4142.22,4177.104,"Well, now, suppose you had -- suppose all this had taken place through federal law enforcement, through F. B.

1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4192.501,4209.621,"But what was therefore the -- we have to canvas, I think the relation of the F. B. I. to the arrest and to the condition into which he was placed until the F. B. I. began their talk -- investigation --"
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,4209.621,4209.998,Well --
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4209.998,4211.147,-- at 9:00 at night.
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,4224.754,4230.813,"Well, the relation was one where the F. B. I. had supplied information which led to this man's arrest."
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4230.813,4232.057,That was antecedent –
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,4232.057,4237.868,"Yes, and they awaited an opportunity to interview the prisoner."
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4241.697,4243.172,That same day -- that same day?

1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,4251.033,4252.213,"Yes, they had lunch with the state officers."
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4252.213,4260.756,They have anything to do except furnishing the information on the basis of which the state police made the arrest.
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,4260.756,4262.006,"No, they did not."
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4262.006,4265.693,"Did they have anything to do with the actual arrest, the physical arrest?"

1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4272.627,4275.013,"Well, I mean they asked permission to talk --"
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,4275.013,4279.184,-- but did they actually come into his presence and -- and began to talk with him?

1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,4825.556,4828.241,"Oh, I would say over 1000 pages clearly."
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4828.241,4829.432,Over 1000 pages.
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,4829.432,4840.831,"But I would say this that the bulk of the testimony at the hearings which pertained to the issue of the illegal detention and admissibility of confession by far, virtually all of that is in the printed record."
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4846.6,4857.284,"I understand that but for all one know, there maybe some reference as to some of these matters in the -- in the trial on the merits to crop out somehow or other, what they did and what they didn't do, the police."
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,4863.962,4869.772,"Well, the testimony at the trial was -- was actually a duplicate of what took place at the preliminary hearings."

1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,4875.668,4877.184,"Well, we know of nothing different in that transcript."
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4877.184,4878.169,I'm not suggesting.

1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,4950.788,4956.261,I believe it went six days.

1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5176.473,5177.712,You say there have to be more facts.

1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,5270.012,5271.259,I see.
1960.153,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5271.259,5273.909,Did you look at --

1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5288.101,5290.9,I'm not talking about what consequences follow.
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,5290.9,5291.286,That's right.
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5291.359,5294.048,But that's the meaning under the -- of the New York statute.

1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,5855.469,5856.86,Yes.
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5857.068,5861.662,The standard is the federal standard of constitutional analogy on the search and seizure.
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,5864.445,5866.729,"Yes, I believe that's correct."
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5866.729,5876.021,"Correct me if I'm wrong, I do not recall or rather thought the opposite that the case did not go on the proposition."
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,5911.263,5912.022,Yes.
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5912.403,5924.997,"So then, the mere fact, no matter what illegality may involve in -- under New York law in these transactions, that in and of itself does not exclude the evidence in the federal courts."
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,5924.997,5926.37,That is our point here.
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5926.37,5947.855,"And therefore, the only basis of dealing with this question or the problem -- the only problem is whether in fact the official -- the evidence was secured by the federal officials in circumstances, which if there had be no intervention of state authorities, they would be held responsible for it under McNabb."
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,5949.065,5949.695,That is correct.
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6102.715,6108.175,"Just in the interest of that was -- you see Mr. Heffron, I had my recollection verified."
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,6116.177,6121.88,"Well, my information, I gather, was not as current as that."
1960.153,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6122.119,6126.711,And that's why I'm telling it to you.
1960.153,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,6126.711,6142.358,"But if I may summarize on this branch of the argument, absent involvement by federal officers the reason for applying a McNabb-Mallory rule of exclusion is not present."
