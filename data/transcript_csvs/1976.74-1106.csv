1976.74-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,40.895,We will hear arguments next in 1106 United States against Gregory Washington.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,43.754,47.118,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.74-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,240.932,245.473,He had not gotten any Miranda warnings he was talking to the Assistant U.S. Attorney?
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,245.473,249.661,He had not had Miranda warnings when he was talking to the assistant.
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,526.139,533.269,"Mr. Sheehan, your point is that this is not compulsion within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, if I understand you correctly."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,539.537,544.87,If he testified as a witness in trial in open court.
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,549.33,554.455,"No, as I understand your argument, correct me if I’m wrong I am just trying to get the thread of the argument."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,562.535,563.241,Yes indeed.
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,563.241,566.636,With respect to the issue of whether or not there is compulsion.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,566.636,567.568,Yes indeed.
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,567.568,573.661,"And you say, there is compulsion in the police station but does not compulsion in the grand jury room because it’s more public."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,573.661,575.244,For that reason and others.
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,575.244,584.35,"And if that reason is valid, would it not also follow that testimony in open court pursuant to a subpoena would not be testimony pursuant -- would not be a compelled testimony."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,584.35,585.633,Yes it does indeed follow.
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,586.545,590.262,Well then it would be -- to what does the Fifth Amendment ever apply then?
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,590.262,591.983,To testimony that is compelled.
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,629.974,631.174,Let me put this case to you.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,650.45,651.491,I think it would not be compulsion.
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,651.491,652.099,I see.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,655.424,655.634,No.
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,660.286,661.566,What is it?
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,661.566,669.582,Compulsion occurs when by the Government’s affirmative conduct did overbears the witness's will.
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,669.582,674.093,"Well, then in my hypothetical case there would be no compulsion because he just didn’t realize that he was --"
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,674.093,681.394,Not unless he was -- not unless he was instructed by the Government that he was compelled to answer questions or that he was compelled to take the stand.
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,692.884,694.016,Well he probably would give one.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,694.498,695.719,I think the District Court probably --
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,695.719,697.748,But under your position there will be no duty to warn.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,699.782,700.409,No I think --
1976.74-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,700.409,705.16,You don’t really mean that trial judge could say take the stand.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,705.16,705.448,"Oh, no."
1976.74-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,705.718,706.485,That’s compulsion.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,706.485,708.592,I think that might well be compulsion sir.
1976.74-1106,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,708.592,709.159,That’s the question --
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,709.159,711.5,"Oh, no."
1976.74-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,712.424,714.262,But to do that to an ordinary witness.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,718.2,719.057,That’s correct.
1976.74-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,719.057,725.969,And it isn’t deemed compulsion of the Fifth Amendment purposes unless he has ordered to answer over a claim of the privilege.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,725.969,726.833,That’s correct.
1976.74-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,735.774,750.405,"But it's well settled that whatever the logic of it maybe that it violates the Fifth Amendment even if called the defendant himself to the stand if the calling is done by the prosecution, am I correct?"
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,755.109,756.45,That is --
1976.74-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,756.45,757.917,That is a violation.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,757.917,763.941,"Well, it would also be a violation -- it would also be a violation of the federal statute making the defendant competent to testify on his own behalf."
1976.74-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,763.941,770.35,"Violation of the constitution, heaven sakes."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,770.35,781.461,I think it would be a violation of the constitution in large measure because the Government could not oblige the defendant in that case assert his privilege in front of the jury.
1976.74-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,781.461,790.944,"Yes, doesn’t it fall under the cases that simply say that there can be no reference to the failure of the defendant to testify and that would be one way of calling attention to it."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,790.944,794.647,"Yes, the situation is quite different Mr. Chief Justice in the setting of the grand jury."
1976.74-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,794.647,803.18,"Long at a date set the constitutional rule of the comment on its failure to testify, which came about only about 10, 12 years ago."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,813.536,818.273,"Well it -- I’m not certain if it is a couple of centuries old, I’m prepared to see --"
1976.74-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,818.273,837.095,That was long established as long as -- I’m not quite – couple of centuries old but when I was at law school I was well established and the proposition that violates the Constitution to comment on the defendant's failure to testify is only about 15 years old.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,837.095,849.373,Well I’m prepared to concede for purposes of argument here that it is indeed settled today that it would violate the constitution for the defendant -- for the Government to call the defendant to the stand or in anyway to comment upon his failure --
1976.74-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,849.373,861.535,If you conceded that it violates the constitution namely the Fifth Amendment to call the defendant the witness stand you must necessarily also concede that that is a form of compulsion within the meaning of the Self-incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,861.535,867.386,"Well, even if it is, my position is that the situation in the grand jury is entirely different."
1976.74-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,868.241,872.083,There is less compulsion in the grand jury context than in the open Court?
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,872.083,872.46,"Well, the --"
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.46,879.653,"The argument before ran in just the opposite direction that the greater the public character, the lesser the degree of compulsion."
1976.74-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,879.653,891.957,"Well, isn’t the advice of calling in the first type of the hypothetical calling him in the presence of the jury which is then made aware of his failure or his refusal to testify."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,891.957,892.447,Yes indeed.
1976.74-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,893.647,899.708,Wouldn’t that apply the bench trial as well as the jury trial?
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,899.708,910.656,"Well, I think the issue of whether the defendant can be called to the stand in a criminal case is not the issue post here."
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,985.163,987.42,"Mr. Sheehan, I interrupted you and I really didn’t mean."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,994.81,1000.086,Well they were both turns on the same point.
1976.74-1106,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1041.54,1045.49,Did the Court say well how it defined a potential defendant?
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1045.49,1047.661,It did not.
1976.74-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1091.138,1109.478,"Except the only way the Miranda rule is an exclusionary rule and the only time that it arises that this is in a criminal trial and the interrogatee, whatever the word is of course as what was questioned by definition by hypothesis is now a criminal defendant."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1112.772,1116.952,"Well, he may not have been a potential defendant so far as the Government knew though."
1976.74-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1123.798,1126.79,You’re not obliged to give anybody warnings.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1128.269,1128.354,Yes.
1976.74-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1128.354,1129.935,Keeps evidence out of a criminal trial.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1129.935,1130.322,Yes.
1976.74-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1230.381,1232.036,It is compulsion.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1233.726,1235.519,It is indeed a compulsion to appear.
1976.74-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1247.106,1254.952,"What if he refuses to answer before the grand jury and he says I won’t answer, they take him before the judge and judge just orders him to answer."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1257.256,1263.229,"Well, I think in a situation like that under the Cordell case it might be too late for him to claim the privilege later on if he --"
1976.74-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1263.229,1265.718,"Well, he never claims a privilege at any point."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1271.864,1278.35,It's compulsion to appear and testify but not to testify as to matters that fall within your privilege against self incrimination.
1976.74-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1278.35,1283.199,"Well, there is no privilege against self incrimination, there is privilege against compulsory self incrimination."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1283.199,1286.623,There is a privilege against compulsory self incrimination.
1976.74-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1299.902,1302.787,Let’s just suppose he never claims a privilege.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1303.64,1305.831,And he refuses to answer.
1976.74-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1305.831,1309.187,He just refuses to answer and the judge orders him to answer.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1309.187,1312.212,Yes and then what?
1976.74-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1312.212,1313.025,And then he answers.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1314.351,1315.725,And incriminates himself.
1976.74-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1316.827,1318.405,Do you say that is compelled certainly.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1318.405,1320.911,Well certainly if the judge orders him to answer and he does.
1976.74-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1320.911,1325.583,Well l know but he has never claimed a privilege.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1342.152,1343.302,"Well, I think that the general rule is because --"
1976.74-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1343.302,1351.436,"And that compulsion only arises, prefers to this amendment, after you are compelled to answer after you have claimed the privilege."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1351.436,1363.196,"Well, I think in that case it -- the general rule stated in the case of United States against Monia is that the witness has to claim his privilege in the grand jury setting or else it is going to be lost to him."
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1374.795,1379.16,"Yes, but waiving the privilege is quite a different thing from saying there was no compulsion at all."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1382.28,1383.659,I don’t --
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1383.659,1385.947,Maybe I’m not -- let me give you another case.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1404.566,1412.901,"Well, I think in that case it would be incumbent upon to -- if he wanted to keep his testimony out of a subsequent prosecution to say, I don’t want to testify because it would violate my privilege."
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1412.901,1414.725,"No, he is not claiming privilege at all."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1420.717,1421.579,"Yes, I think he can be."
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1421.917,1423.086,With no doubt into the judge.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1423.56,1425.26,I think there’s no question about it he is not being --
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1425.26,1432.403,"So then, the compulsion arises without any reference to the judge or any reference to the privilege against self-incrimination that arises solely from the subpoena and getting on the stand --"
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1432.403,1432.841,Oh no but he is not --
1976.74-1106,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1432.841,1434.608,Obeying the law and answering questions.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1434.608,1446.414,No but the compulsion is that -- the compulsion takes place when he is compelled to incriminate himself when he is called to testify and he says “I don’t want to testify because I don’t want to get my friends into trouble.”
1976.74-1106,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1461.346,1469.436,Well supposing a witness is asked a question by the prosecutor before the grand jury and he says I just won't answer that.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1477.463,1478.312,No.
1976.74-1106,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1478.435,1482.627,Or do you have -- do you have to go before the -- do you have to go before the judging get an order compelling him to answer.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1482.627,1484.206,That is my understanding.
1976.74-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1499.625,1503.751,The short answer might be that there is a high press to protecting your friends in that setting.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1509.05,1512.225,"Yes, I think that’s right."
1976.74-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1570.44,1571.841,Mr. Sheehan may I ask.
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1639.749,1643.946,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I haven’t thought about that, I’m not sure that I can give an easy answer to it."
1976.74-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1643.946,1658.195,"Well, there the hypothesis is that it's a custodial interrogation of the suspect by an FBI agent who gives them Miranda warnings."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1664.803,1669.304,"I think he would not have to tell him he was the suspect as well in those -- in that case, I think we --"
1976.74-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1669.304,1675.888,"If then not withstanding his Miranda warning, he lies, he can be prosecuted under that statute."
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1675.888,1680.441,I think that’s right.
1976.74-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1680.441,1684.321,What additional protection would it give him to tell him he was the suspect?
1976.74-1106,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1692.333,1692.59,Yes.
1976.74-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1816.916,1821.202,Very well Mr. Sheehan.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,1826.963,1835.615,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court I’m Frederick Weisberg, I’m counsel for Gregory V. Washington, the respondent in this case."
1976.74-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1923.466,1928.98,Was it any different in any way from the usual subpoena to appear before the grand jury?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,1928.98,1929.472,No Your Honor.
1976.74-1106,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1951.513,1953.737,Well isn’t that the fact as in almost every jurisdiction?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,1953.737,1955.541,I’m not familiar with the other jurisdictions.
1976.74-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1955.541,1957.828,I wondered why you thought that was unusual.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,1957.828,1971.033,"It is not unusual Mr. Chief Justice, the reason I’m mentioning not because it’s unusual but because Mr. Washington coming in without counsel gets a piece of paper signed by the -- in the name of the Chief Judge of the Court commanding him to appear and answer questions."
1976.74-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1975.905,1982.035,"You might get a similar piece of paper if you were called in, there is a possible witness in an automobile accident case would they not?"
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,1982.035,1982.771,That’s true.
1976.74-1106,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1984.342,1990.845,Was the subpoena returnable in the grand jury room itself or that you have to go to an Assistant US Attorney’s office?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,1990.845,1995.968,In the grand jury room Your Honor.
1976.74-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2114.645,2130.956,How do you square the -- with your view the situation of the ordinary witness in a civil or criminal case where he gets on the stand and simply refuses to answer a question the judge orders him to answer it.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2143.517,2146.937,The way we answer that question Your Honor is simply this.
1976.74-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.066,2153.497,Let’s talk about the witness.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2153.497,2154.44,Okay.
1976.74-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2154.44,2158.512,"Talk about him now, why doesn’t he win with his Fifth Amendment Court?"
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2158.512,2167.906,Under certain circumstances it’s conceivable to me given the purposes for which he was subpoenaed and the Government’s knowledge at that time he would have a valid subpoena.
1976.74-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.906,2184.795,"Well, let’s take the ordinary civil case of automobile accident and he is called as a witness and he is asked a question and he says, I prefer not to answer it and the judge orders him to answer and he incriminates himself."
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2184.795,2185.989,The answer to that question Your Honor the seeking --
1976.74-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2185.989,2188.557,And because the answer is later admissible isn’t it?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2188.557,2194.606,The Answer to that question it seems to me Your Honor is in the Gardner opinion written by this Court last term and we relied very heavily in the Gardner opinion.
1976.74-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2198.835,2201.707,"Yeah, but in terms of the Fifth Amendment what is the explanation?"
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2201.707,2203.529,The explanation is that when the --
1976.74-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2203.529,2209.6,Because he didn’t want to answer and the judge told him to answer or ordered him to answer and the result was he incriminated himself.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2209.6,2215.256,The difference is Your Honor that when the Government is seeking to avoid the burdens of the adversary system.
1976.74-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.764,2224.382,Let’s talk about the witness I was talking about.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2230.504,2238.009,Because with respect to ordinary witnesses Your Honor with respect to whom the Government has no purpose to indict.
1976.74-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2250.392,2254.821,Whether anybody could sensibly say he knew of his right or not?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2254.821,2255.489,That’s correct Your Honor.
1976.74-1106,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2255.489,2263.413,The classical definition of compelled self-incrimination is one who was ordered to answer a question over the claim of privilege.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2267.694,2269.427,We don’t think so Your Honor.
1976.74-1106,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2270.697,2284.98,What authority do you have from this Court for your proposition that in this type of situation you have to show annoying and intelligent waiver rather than the claim of privilege of being an element in the compulsion?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2284.98,2292.337,We think that the decision in Gardner which we set forth at great length in our brief is exactly the authority for that Your Honor.
1976.74-1106,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2310.046,2312.099,I thought of a due process not a Fifth Amendment.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2312.099,2317.85,We think this case could be decided under either provision Your Honor but I think it’s part of the self-incrimination process.
1976.74-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2423.114,2434.221,"The description of his colloquy with the police would indicate he was rather in his rights, innovative, inventive kind of a fellow."
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2437.054,2438.828,I must say Mr. Chief Justice that --
1976.74-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2438.828,2446.348,"You mean, he didn’t know that he was in some on threshold possibly of some kind of trouble?"
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2446.348,2450.103,"Well, no."
1976.74-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2455.655,2458.882,But someone had just happened to place there?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2458.882,2459.459,"Well, he knew how it got there."
1976.74-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2459.459,2466.389,(Inaudible)
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2466.389,2468.013,I have heard it so many times in my practice.
1976.74-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2468.013,2470.154,Is there any difference at this one?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2470.154,2470.513,Pardon me?
1976.74-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2470.513,2473.296,Is this one any different?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2473.296,2477.226,I don’t know whether it is different or not Your Honor that he was not indicted for perjury.
1976.74-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2487.504,2490.129,Somebody gets that.
1976.74-1106,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2490.129,2491.12,Mr. Weisberg.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2491.12,2491.934,Yes sir.
1976.74-1106,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2491.934,2500.446,"I understand that you say you’re not interested in Miranda warnings if you want, -- must have been called target warnings."
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2507.304,2517.56,Mr. Justice Powell in our view the focus on what he was told or what he was not told is the wrong focus.
1976.74-1106,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2525.577,2529.581,What in addition do you think that prosecutor should have asked him in this case?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2529.581,2535.871,Whether he understood that the body that he was appearing for might indict him for a criminal offense and he might be prosecuted.
1976.74-1106,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2535.871,2542.617,Do you think that’s materially different from telling him that whatever he said could be used against him?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2542.617,2543.854,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.74-1106,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2595.023,2609.056,Suppose a prosecutor in this case did not know personally that respondent was a target of the investigation but the files did show that respondent maybe a target.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2613.382,2624.331,It seems to me that there has to be some knowledge on the part of the Government that it is compelling potentially self-incriminatory testimony before our analysis is activated.
1976.74-1106,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2624.331,2634.534,Does that mean the prosecutor would have to exercise due care to know what the Government might know through the FBI or perhaps other officials?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2634.534,2640.946,"I would think at a minimum that’s correct and as a practical matter, prosecutors generally know at least the outlines of --"
1976.74-1106,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2640.946,2642.203,But perhaps not always.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2642.203,2658.204,It maybe that they don’t always in such a case if the Government can make a claim before a review in court that this was really an ordinary witness that they have no basis for thinking that this person would -- that they were not trying to avoid the burdens of the adversary system but by building a case against this person out of his own mouth.
1976.74-1106,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2679.412,2690.976,In Gardner the Court stated the general rule derived from Monia or how one pronounces that decision and it said there were three exceptions to it.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2693.846,2696.477,In a sense Your Honor I think all three apply.
1976.74-1106,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2696.477,2701.275,Which of the three is the more relevant?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2703.633,2708.185,"It seems to me, starting with the one that seems least like this case."
1976.74-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2823.898,2830.518,You mean if the Government has a man in the grand jury room and they say “did you steal his property?”
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2834.807,2835.368,"No, Your Honor."
1976.74-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2848.991,2856.224,The fact is that in this case the prosecutor misinformed him as to his rights didn’t he?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2869.826,2870.275,Your Honor --
1976.74-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2870.275,2872.644,He was required to answer any questions.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2872.644,2875.555,He has to required to answer every question.
1976.74-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2875.555,2879.694,"So, he was misinformed, he was told that he had rights that in fact he didn’t not possess."
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2879.694,2891.288,"We have not argued in this case because it is not necessary to our position that a putative defendant in the grand jury has like a defendant in a trial, an absolute right to refuse to testify if he is in fact refuted the the defendant."
1976.74-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2914.92,2925.16,"But if this family told that he had absolute right not to answer questions or fortiori, he certainly had a right not to answer any questions it would incriminate, didn’t he?"
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2935.951,2939.038,If I understand Your Honor’s question.
1976.74-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2953.429,2957.082,"Well, he was advised he didn’t have to answer any questions, wasn’t he?"
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2957.082,2958.54,That’s correct.
1976.74-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2958.54,2962.97,"And while that was incorrect advice, that was the information he was given."
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2962.97,2965.782,"The only thing, I’m quarreling with is that means that he was over warned."
1976.74-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2969.976,2972.935,"Well, he was totally -- didn’t have to answer any."
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2972.935,2973.722,That’s correct.
1976.74-1106,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2973.722,2978.294,He wouldn’t have to give any reason for not answering under the text of the prosecutors warning.
1976.74-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2978.294,2979.447,Exactly.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2979.447,2980.517,I see.
1976.74-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2984.685,2986.447,He was told he could.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,2988.631,2995.266,Our view that contempt proceedings would have begun very quickly and the prosecutor would have told him that he misspoke himself when he said he can remain silent.
1976.74-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2995.266,2999.951,"Look at the compulsion, where is the compulsion?"
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3001.052,3002.814,"The compulsion Your Honor, we submit --"
1976.74-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3002.814,3006.625,The man says you don’t have to answer any question.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3009.588,3013.464,Your Honor the subpoenas he gets tells -- commands him to testify and give answers.
1976.74-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3021.195,3024.135,But did he understand it?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3024.135,3026.117,He may not have understood why it made any difference to him.
1976.74-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3026.117,3026.91,Did he understand it?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3026.91,3028.054,He may have understood that he --
1976.74-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3028.054,3030.228,Didn’t have to answer any question?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3030.228,3031.369,He may well have understood that Your Honor.
1976.74-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3031.369,3035.208,"And once he understands, that's the end of the compulsion is it not?"
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3035.208,3036.295,Not in our view.
1976.74-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3036.295,3038.319,"Well, what is the compulsion after that?"
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3038.319,3039.493,When your under subpoena as to --
1976.74-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3039.493,3040.642,After that.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3040.642,3042.11,When you’re under subpoena as a target witness.
1976.74-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3042.11,3043.226,"Well, it carries over."
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3043.226,3044.017,Our view is that the compulsion --
1976.74-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3044.017,3045.833,Three weeks I guess or four weeks?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3045.833,3047.418,It’s not a temporal thing Your Honor.
1976.74-1106,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3056.127,3066.01,Mr. Weisberg in your view is the grand jury proceeding a criminal case within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3066.01,3067.338,The short answer to that question is yes.
1976.74-1106,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3073.817,3078.854,"Well, if that’s your view and if you say he is tantamount to a defendant when he is a putative defendant."
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3082.048,3084.02,I understand your question.
1976.74-1106,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3103.492,3118.2,"I understood your theory to be that he was in essence the same as the defendant because the Government had already made up its made to proceed against him and therefore, his rights before the grand jury would tantamount to his rights in open Court which were -- which would be the right to answer no questions at all."
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3121.722,3132.193,I met that as an argument by analogy Your Honor as the supporting basis for a holding that a true putative defendant before the grand jury would have a right to silence.
1976.74-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3163.867,3177.342,"At the point that Justice Stewart took you and characterized it as an over warning, he had already been told that he can have a lawyer outside the Courtroom to help him or haven’t he?"
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3226.787,3228.961,"Your Honor, he was warned."
1976.74-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3264.62,3282.094,"Well, now, I don’t -- I know that's the argument you make and I know that’s one of the issues in this case but certainly whether or not you are targeted in an investigation doesn’t either elevate or depress your constitutional right not to be compelled to testify against yourself."
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3284.407,3284.819,I agree.
1976.74-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3284.819,3287.932,And neither true or nor less true whether or not you are.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3287.932,3289.245,I agree.
1976.74-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3289.245,3289.998,Is that correct?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3289.998,3290.409,I agree with that.
1976.74-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3290.409,3301.679,And whether or not -- whether you are a target or not a target you don’t have any privilege to tell a lie under oath which of course is not involved here.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3301.679,3303.07,We agree.
1976.74-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3303.07,3307.529,"So why -- what’s the point, what’s the purpose of telling somebody is a target."
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3312.553,3315.785,I would respond to that question Mr. Justice Stewart in two ways.
1976.74-1106,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3338.748,3341.749,"So that’s a question that says, suppose the compulsion -- right?"
1976.74-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3341.749,3345.998,Or is it got a waiver?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3345.998,3370.026,"We think he’s compelled by the subpoena Your Honor to answer and if he is compelled, and if he is in the category of suspects recognized in Gardner as not being required to put the Government on notice simply because the Governments already had noticed then the compulsion of the subpoena is only undone by a voluntary knowing and intelligent waiver and we think that that requirement is not merely a prophylactic rule."
1976.74-1106,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3379.025,3383.077,What’s your definition of a target defendant?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3383.077,3387.832,We have -- again in this case not defined --
1976.74-1106,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3387.832,3396.785,"Well, it's quite important, it would adopt the principle that you are advocating, prosecutors would have to know who were target defendants and who weren’t."
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3396.785,3397.851,I agree.
1976.74-1106,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3400.468,3401.49,"Well, how do you define it?"
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3401.49,3416.072,When the Government knows that the answer is that it is compelling by subpoena may incriminate that witness in the sense that the witness is a potential target for indictment and what the Government knew in this case is that the grand jury will be to believe him or it wouldn’t believe.
1976.74-1106,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3416.072,3424.597,When the Government say -- when the Government knows that the answer it's compelling from the witness will incriminate him?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3424.597,3429.404,Will incriminate him not in the sense that he is definitely just believe and definitely going to be indicted.
1976.74-1106,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3433.246,3439.57,"Well, that’s true of any witness before a grand jury, even if he just believe he maybe indicted probably for perjury?"
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3439.57,3449.128,"But in this case Your Honor, the difference is that the Government knew when it subpoenaed him, that one very likely possibility is that the grand jury would just disbelieve him and indict him and that’s why they subpoenaed him."
1976.74-1106,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3449.128,3455.794,What if I’m a prosecutor and I know that a potential grand jury witnesses have to lie before the grand jury.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3460.295,3465.869,I think the answer to that question is no in light of the Mandujano opinion but that maybe affected.
1976.74-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3508.277,3510.529,The question isn't whether the Government loses something.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3513.9,3515.168,That’s our starting point Your Honor.
1976.74-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3515.168,3517.576,Not whether it is a good idea to give warnings.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3517.576,3518.306,I agree completely.
1976.74-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3563.461,3570.457,"But on your theory then, the only way you can compel testimony before a grand jury is to grant immunity to people."
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3570.457,3571.049,Not at all Your Honor.
1976.74-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3574.6,3582.104,"Suppose, before having questioned they ask -- just as after every question they ask to witness for a grand jury."
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3595.603,3596.37,Of those two?
1976.74-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3596.37,3598.701,Yes.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3604.818,3609.703,"If I were a suspect, it is right not to answer anything regardless of the incrimination."
1976.74-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3609.703,3611.329,But Justice Stewart’s point isn’t it?
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3611.329,3618.684,"But two Courts below Your Honor has said that that in this case he didn’t knowingly, intelligently waive his privilege because he didn’t know that --"
1976.74-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3618.684,3622.709,What if you were in the witness chair and they -- and then prosecutor gave you both of those.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3633.276,3644.768,It seems to us Your Honor that unless this Court can conclude that that was a knowing and intelligent waiver over the holdings of two Courts below that the holdings of the two Courts below-- the Court below ought to be affirmed.
1976.74-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3644.768,3645.239,Although --
1976.74-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3645.239,3648.116,"Oh, I agree with that, I agree with that but what about you?"
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3651.7,3656.596,That he had no basis of knowing why he shouldn’t answer those questions.
1976.74-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3671.533,3672.69,Very well Mr. Weisberg.
1976.74-1106,1,24730,frederick_h_weisberg,,3672.69,3673.053,Thank you Your Honor.
1976.74-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3673.053,3675.15,Do you have anything further Mr. Sheehan?
1976.74-1106,2,46106,william_f_sheehan,,3675.15,3678.91,I would like to add one point in the conclusion.
1976.74-1106,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3718.777,3721.712,Mr. Sheehan may I just ask one question.
1976.74-1106,2,46106,william_f_sheehan,,3735.463,3736.899,I think that’s probably right.
1976.74-1106,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3736.899,3744.079,Is it not fair inference then that if a person like this is given such a warning the Government must have had some notion intending to indict him.
1976.74-1106,2,46106,william_f_sheehan,,3744.079,3748.587,"Oh, I think that there is no -- no I don’t think it is fair."
1976.74-1106,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3748.587,3753.709,Would there be any reason to give a warning this broad unless the person were likely defended?
1976.74-1106,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3753.709,3758.111,I think that there is no question but that this person was a possible defendant.
1976.74-1106,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3779.224,3789.103,"Isn’t it equally and likely that this warning, over warning, was something inadvertent mistake."
1976.74-1106,2,46106,william_f_sheehan,,3794.592,3796.585,I think that’s entirely correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1976.74-1106,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3802.672,3805.417,Should he testify for the hearing?
1976.74-1106,2,46106,william_f_sheehan,,3805.417,3806.831,I believe he did.
1976.74-1106,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3806.831,3808.939,Was he was asked why?
1976.74-1106,2,46106,william_f_sheehan,,3808.939,3809.896,No.
1976.74-1106,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3809.896,3812.111,Wasn’t any focus on the over warning?
1976.74-1106,2,46106,william_f_sheehan,,3812.111,3812.577,Thank you.
1976.74-1106,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3812.577,3813.216,Thank you gentleman.
