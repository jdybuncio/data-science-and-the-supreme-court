1972.71-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.583,"We'll hear arguments next in 71-732, Schneckloth against Bustamonte."
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,13.98,17.929,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1972.71-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,148.534,153.585,Do you connect the picking up of the three men with the efforts to cash the checks?
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,153.585,154.028,"Yes, that was the --"
1972.71-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,154.028,155.932,Which was the purpose of their association for that moment?
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,155.932,156.812,Yes.
1972.71-732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,782.631,795.13,"Mr. Granucci, you said that the existence of a confession is itself evidence that the Miranda rights were understood and waived, whereas the production of tangible goods is not."
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,800.083,804.177,"I think, perhaps I have to expand them a bit."
1972.71-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,867.363,886.168,"As I have understood your brief, your argument in part was that the very fact of a request by the officer gave -- amounted to an inference, an indication that the request could be denied?"
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,886.168,889.275,"Yes, that’s right, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,913.253,922.573,"Did the Ninth Circuit comment on the fact the Bustamonte helped with the search, assisted the officers?"
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,922.573,922.767,"No, Mr. Chief Justice --"
1972.71-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,922.767,924.29,-- you recall from the opinion?
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,924.29,926.49,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, they did not."
1972.71-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,932.85,933.867,Alcala --
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,933.867,936.754,-- the one who had borrowed his car from his brother for this expedition.
1972.71-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,936.754,937.136,I see.
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,939.407,941.771,He had the driver’s license.
1972.71-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,952.94,969.728,"I think, I got those two parties confused, because I recall you have an argument that the conduct that followed the request for consent and giving of consent verbally demonstrated a consensual situation generally?"
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,969.728,976.178,"Yes, and it did, because Alcala said, “Sure, go right ahead” and then he searched the car."
1972.71-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,984.94,992.013,"The thing that worries me is the officer comes up and says, “Would you let me see your driver’s license?”"
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,992.013,993.402,"Under California law, Your Honor, --"
1972.71-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,993.402,1002.426,"No, but if he says, “would you mind,” don’t you usually understand that he means “you either show it to me or else”?"
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1005.019,1013.579,"Your Honor, I go beyond that, because under California law a driver is required to exhibit his license whenever an officer requests it."
1972.71-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1013.579,1015.946,That’s not my question.
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1019.878,1021.492,Yes.
1972.71-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1021.802,1023.269,That means “give it to me.”
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1023.269,1023.718,That is --
1972.71-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1023.718,1025.531,In that instant; that means “give it to me.”
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1025.531,1029.46,"That is, Your Honor, a polite assertion of authority."
1972.71-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1029.46,1030.574,Right.
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1033.914,1036.983,Again a polite assertion of authority.
1972.71-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1036.983,1039.286,"Then he says, “May I search your car?”"
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1041.332,1041.872,No.
1972.71-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1045.224,1048.019,"Well, what’s the difference?"
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1048.019,1051.026,I think the difference is twofold.
1972.71-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1070.068,1072.506,Mostly?
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1072.506,1073.747,"Mostly, yes."
1972.71-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1087.407,1094.036,"Is there any other difference you can give for those three questions, other that that?"
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1094.036,1107.771,"Your Honor, I think that’s the first thing, that comes to mind, we do feel that the real issue is -- we don’t preclude the possibility of unlawful assertion of authority."
1972.71-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1155.233,1163.035,Does this record show in what words or in what form the request to exhibit the driver’s license was made?
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1163.035,1164.934,It’s in the Appendix.
1972.71-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1165.366,1167.839,"I will find it, you won’t have to stop now."
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1167.839,1177.852,"And the Appendix contains the -- a hearing outside the presence of the jury, on the objection to these three checks."
1972.71-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1201.371,1201.758,Excuse me.
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1224.051,1224.348,No.
1972.71-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1226.883,1237.539,"I was expecting to see whether the two situations were comparable, but apparently, on this record, they’re not."
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1237.539,1249.42,"On our second point, it’s agreed by both proponents and critics of the exclusionary rule that its primary purpose is to deter unreasonable police action."
1972.71-732,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1290.297,1311.057,"Now, you’re talking about the exclusionary rule as it was in Weeks v. United States or People v. Cahan, whatever the case was, when it was just a rule, the trouble is that since Mapp against Ohio it’s been part of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States."
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1323.162,1332.158,"Your Honor, conceptually I think that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution itself contains no explicit exclusionary rule."
1972.71-732,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1332.158,1340.521,"I know that, and you know that but Mapp says that the exclusionary rule is part of the Fourth Amendment as incorporated in the Fourteenth."
1972.71-732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1347.304,1364.265,"Am I right in thinking that at least part of your contention here is that even though the exclusionary rule is constitutionally derived, in a case such as Harris, decided a couple of years ago, there was a limitation on its application in some aspects of the adoption of testimony?"
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1364.265,1364.46,Exactly.
1972.71-732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1364.46,1369.663,Are you suggesting that that limitation be broadened to cover the field of habeas corpus?
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1369.663,1372.647,"Exactly, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1972.71-732,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1395.651,1397.345,You don’t really mean that?
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1397.345,1398.244,I think I do.
1972.71-732,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1480.606,1497.054,"But you are -- is it your submission that the Court should retreat from Kaufman at least to the extent of the Thorton case in the District of Columbia Circuit, or would you have us go all the way and just say this is not open to collateral attack, at least when it’s been considered by the State Courts?"
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1497.054,1498.373,I would go all the way and say --
1972.71-732,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1498.373,1504.673,"Anyway the Thorton case was discussed a good deal in the Kaufman opinion, Judge Leventhal’s opinion in Thorton?"
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1504.673,1506.828,"Yes, I think I recall that."
1972.71-732,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1510.043,1510.894,Shouldn’t be opened?
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1510.894,1513.36,Shouldn’t be opened.
1972.71-732,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1513.36,1521.066,"No matter how it reaches from, it egregiously outrages the search and seizure clause?"
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1521.066,1544.145,"That’s the position I have to take, but to ameliorate that, I would point out to Your Honor that the decisions of this Court in the early 1960’s almost guaranteed adequate State process for the vindication of Federal claims, by providing each defendant with an attorney, with a specific procedure for raising constitutional questions."
1972.71-732,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1582.288,1585.305,"Well, how broad is your argument."
1972.71-732,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1593.361,1594.451,It would.
1972.71-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1651.897,1655.098,"Thank you, Mr. Granucci."
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,1657.635,1661.289,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1711.845,1718.081,Doesn’t that suggest a totality of circumstances concept?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,1718.081,1719.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don’t believe so."
1972.71-732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1832.742,1836.927,One of the exceptions explicitly enumerated in Coolidge --
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,1836.927,1837.687,"Pardon me, sir?"
1972.71-732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1837.687,1851.681,"One of the exceptions explicitly enumerated in Coolidge, as well as in Katz and other cases, if you want to call it an exception, was that the search, when there is consent to the search, it doesn’t present a Fourth Amendment problem?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,1851.681,1857.833,"Well, I perfectly agree that consent searches are permissible under the Constitution."
1972.71-732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1863.242,1863.91,Yes.
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,1863.91,1865.901,"As a matter of fact, let’s look at this case."
1972.71-732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1902.808,1904.356,"Well, how much would you require?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,1904.356,1913.844,"Well, I would say that I would require that there be a showing that he did in fact understand his right to request that the police obtain a search warrant."
1972.71-732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1913.844,1916.53,"You wouldn’t require that there be probable cause, would you?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,1916.53,1917.796,"No, not at all, sir."
1972.71-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1932.292,1953.649,"Would it satisfy your standard, counsel, if the policeman had said, in addition to what he did say, “You are not required by law to consent, you may refuse your consent if you wish; but if you refuse, we will be obliged to detain you here until we can get a search warrant?”"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,1955.234,1962.119,"Well, I think one question underlying that is whether, in fact, the police could detain him under those circumstances."
1972.71-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1963.432,1965.947,"Well, I’m not going to --"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,1965.947,1966.514,I’m sorry.
1972.71-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1966.514,1968.485,"— an appraisal of that question, counsel."
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,1992.241,2001.458,"I believe that such a warning would be adequate, but I would premise that, if I may, by saying that in my mind, that appears to me to constitute possibly an arrest."
1972.71-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2001.458,2003.429,You think that’s a coercion at that point?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2003.429,2013.444,"I think that it is, and I think that, on that basis, a search could be approved, so long as the justification for the detention is appropriate at that time."
1972.71-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2013.444,2017.666,"If he placed the man under arrest, could he search the entire car then and there?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2017.666,2027.794,"I believe that under the Court’s recent decisions dealing with searches incident to arrest, a search of the entire automobile at that time might not be constitutionally justified."
1972.71-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2045.156,2050.165,Could he have been arrested for operating the motor vehicle without a license?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2050.165,2052.623,"Under California law, I frankly don’t know the answer to that."
1972.71-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2078.77,2091.612,"Mr. Tobisman, as a practical matter, with the consent standard which you’re seeking to have upheld here, mean that the police would have to give warnings much as they do in the Miranda situation now?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2091.612,2104.409,"Well, I would say that the decision affirming the Ninth Circuit’s disposition in this case would not necessarily require that affirmative admonitions be given in all Fourth Amendment cases."
1972.71-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.791,2216.625,Was there a hearing here as to the question here?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2216.625,2222.961,"My understanding is that the question was raised at the trial, and that testimony was taken in chambers."
1972.71-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2233.734,2235.784,The defendant didn’t testify there?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2235.784,2242.473,"No, the defendant did not testify and Mr. -- as I mentioned before, Mr. Alcala did not testify."
1972.71-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2242.473,2252.55,"I suppose it would be enough to satisfy your rule if it were clearly shown that the defendant knew what his rights were, even though he weren't informed?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2257.832,2260.893,"Well, if I may backtrack a little bit."
1972.71-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.575,2275.084,"Well, did the driver say he didn’t know what his rights were?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2275.084,2279.556,"No, the actual -- the man that gave the consent was Joe Alcala."
1972.71-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2281.633,2283.13,"Well, he did testify, didn’t he?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2283.13,2284.13,He did not testify.
1972.71-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2297.094,2306.402,"Well, was there testimony anywhere at the hearing that the defendant put on any testimony for the defendant that the fellow who gave the consent did not know what his rights were?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2306.402,2319.962,"There was -- at the time the motion was made, there was some suggestion by counsel for the defendant that the search was not properly authorized, that Mr. Alcala was not aware of his rights, and that it was conducted in a -- the search was conducted in a coercive atmosphere."
1972.71-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2319.962,2324.829,Does California have an express hearing?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2324.829,2326.064,"I’m afraid I can’t answer that, sir."
1972.71-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2326.909,2331.68,"Alcala, then didn’t take the stand to enlighten anybody about the state of his knowledge about his rights?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2331.68,2333.667,Alcala never testified at all.
1972.71-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2333.667,2335.605,Nor was he called by the defendant?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2335.605,2337.462,He was not called by the defendant.
1972.71-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.14,2351.523,"Well you would say, then, on this record, then, you also have to go on and say that California has the burden?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2351.523,2351.651,Oh!
1972.71-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2354.303,2356.095,You think that’s constitutionally required?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2356.095,2356.793,"Yes, I do."
1972.71-732,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2370.145,2374.196,"Incidentally, were any of the other five convicted of anything?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2374.196,2376.114,Not to my knowledge.
1972.71-732,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2406.978,2408.055,"Mr. Tobisman, could I just go back?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2408.055,2409.542,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-732,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2409.542,2421.294,"Do I understand your position to be that if Mr. Alcala knew that he did not have to consent, that would be sufficient, whether or not Bustamonte didn't?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2421.294,2422.633,"Yes, that’s my position."
1972.71-732,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2422.633,2423.905,And how about the other side?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2434.394,2437.212,"That question, I think, is obviously a difficult one."
1972.71-732,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2461.498,2464.793,Would that be the extent then of California’s burden which you are saying?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2464.793,2465.839,"Yes, yes."
1972.71-732,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2466.309,2470.979,At Bustamonte’s trial it would have to show that Alcala at least knew he didn’t have to consent?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2470.979,2471.538,That’s right.
1972.71-732,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2476.307,2485.489,But you’re not sure that it would be sufficient if California proved at Bustamonte’s trial that Bustamonte knew that he didn’t have to consent to that?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2485.489,2485.72,No.
1972.71-732,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2491.352,2495.808,So California could satisfy its burden only by proving Alcala knew he didn’t have to?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2495.808,2497.415,That would be my position.
1972.71-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2497.415,2510.846,You would say that the Constitution would not permit a rule of California to the effect that the defendant must first put on some testimony that Alcala didn’t know?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2510.846,2511.044,No.
1972.71-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2525.841,2534.786,"You don’t think California makes a prima facie case of consent by showing that he said, as he did here, “Go right ahead; just go right ahead”?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2534.786,2537.233,"No, I don’t."
1972.71-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2555.421,2566.22,You don’t think that’s reinforced any by the fact that the speaker who said these words then proceeded to help the officer with the search?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2566.22,2572.757,"Well, I believe that the assistance rendered by Mr. Alcala is partially overstated."
1972.71-732,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2636.565,2643.709,"Mr. Tobisman, incidentally, was any attempt to come here by certiorari from the appeal after the conviction in the State Courts?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2643.709,2644.58,"No, sir, there was not."
1972.71-732,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2671.282,2672.954,Do you think that that’s significant at all?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2672.954,2673.523,"No, I don’t, sir."
1972.71-732,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2698.954,2701.076,Actually Fay v. Noia overruled Dar v. Burford.
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2701.076,2710.009,"That’s right, overruled Dar versus Burford, which had, as I understand it required that such a petition be filed prior to seeking habeas corpus."
1972.71-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2797.83,2818.44,"Mr. Tobisman, it’s my understanding that your opponent takes the position that the giving of warnings for a Fourth Amendment situation would be much, much more complicated, since the right protected is the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, rather than just an absolute right to counsel."
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2821.259,2822.667,"Yes, I do."
1972.71-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2863.649,2881.409,"But a judgment as to whether probable cause exists or whether the circumstances are exigent is necessarily not a very firm one and in many doubtful cases, I should a police officer might be approaching with the thought, “I think I’ve got probable cause, but I’m going to see if I can get a consent?”"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2881.409,2883.908,"Well, I think he may in fact do that on many occasions."
1972.71-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2922.985,2931.071,The essence of your case is that the California test is not a fair test of reasonableness?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2931.071,2932.365,That’s correct.
1972.71-732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2975.586,2984.681,"I thought you were attacking the California rule as to what is consent, as consent vel non, not reasonableness vel non, aren’t you?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2984.681,2992.6,"Well, I think that -- I can’t conceive, in my own mind, how you can have consent to something unless you know it exists."
1972.71-732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2994.325,2997.555,"Exactly, so you are attacking the California test of consent --"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2997.555,2998.421,That’s right.
1972.71-732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2998.593,2999.978,-- not the reasonableness.
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,2999.978,3001.546,"Pardon me, I misunderstood the question."
1972.71-732,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3014.909,3015.667,Mr. Tobisman?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3015.667,3015.79,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-732,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3015.79,3022.785,Do you feel that Ker against California cuts down in your favor or against you?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3022.785,3035.275,"I believe that Ker versus California would be in my favor, if only because it requires that certain fundamental safeguards are -- certain fundamental criteria are met in viewing the elements of a constitutional right."
1972.71-732,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3035.633,3047.935,"That’s the difference that Mr. Justice Clarke, as I read it, tried to draw between Federal and State review?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3047.935,3051.761,"Offhand, I can’t remember the passage that you’re referring to."
1972.71-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3061.619,3065.738,"Suppose they stop a car and say, “What have you got in there?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3074.058,3087.335,"Well, I would be afraid that that represents some sort of coercion, just a suggestion to the individual that “we know you’ve got it” or “do you have it”; that would concern me."
1972.71-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3087.335,3088.007,That’s not what I said.
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3101.833,3104.56,"Well, I would say that at the time the evidence, if in fact --"
1972.71-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3104.56,3107.895,"I think you’d be in trouble, won't you?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3107.895,3109.037,"Well, I think that if --"
1972.71-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3109.037,3112.141,Of course that’s not a question of consent.
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3115.85,3128.279,"Well, I think that if I’m inviting, if I’m inviting an officer, for example, to search my car, if it’s a true invitation, it can only be based on my understanding of my right to say “It’s none of your business.”"
1972.71-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3141.758,3147.108,"So if it gets to that point, the police officer can say, “You don’t have to let me look.”"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3149.005,3157.051,"Well, I’m saying that either at that stage or at trial, some evidence would have to be adduced to demonstrate that the individual knew he could say no."
1972.71-732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3157.051,3158.678,And that’s the burden on the State?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3158.678,3160.973,"Yes, I believe it is."
1972.71-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3348.863,3357.697,"Well, what do you think about your argument that’s in the context of the State court having already approved the search and found it reasonable?"
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3357.697,3358.377,I think that --
1972.71-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3358.377,3362.601,Then what’s the deterrent effect of a later Federal habeas proceeding?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3362.601,3378.928,"I think that, in effect, the Court is saying that the standard of reasonableness, a standard based on vindicating the individual’s right to be free from unreasonable governmental intrusions, that standard of reasonableness prescribes certain rules, certain conduct that the police must comply with."
1972.71-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3378.928,3379.227,"Well, I understand that."
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3390.167,3405.029,"With respect to deterrents, if this Court, in this case, affirms the decision of the Ninth Circuit, I am confident that all around the country, police officers will recognize that in order to sustain a conviction, it is going to be necessary to demonstrate knowledge on the part of the individual who --"
1972.71-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3405.029,3407.1,That really isn’t my question.
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3446.514,3447.345,I think absolutely.
1972.71-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3460.146,3461.843,I agree with you for the future?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3461.843,3464.206,"Oh, oh, I’m sorry."
1972.71-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3472.36,3472.847,Alright.
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3472.847,3473.872,"Pardon me, I misunderstood the question."
1972.71-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3473.872,3479.404,"Suppose, Mr. Tobisman -- I’ll try to restate my thought on Mr. Justice White’s question."
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3501.203,3510.06,"I think the ultimate result in that context would be that the conviction would be overturned, presumably, if in fact we had all of the other elements."
1972.71-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3510.06,3511.847,"Certainly, but we’re not talking about the conviction."
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3511.847,3512.107,"No, no, I’m sorry."
1972.71-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3512.107,3515.1,But where the police officer looks for guidance?
1972.71-732,1,42169,stuart_p_tobisman,,3515.1,3524.991,"I believe that the police officer would ultimately look to guidance to the court that is at the end of the line, that’s going to, in effect, say whether this conviction can stand or not."
1972.71-732,2,39374,robert_r_granucci,,3619.337,3620.848,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1972.71-732,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3730.36,3735.622,So you’re saying that on the evidence in this record there was a prima facie case for consent?
1972.71-732,2,39374,robert_r_granucci,,3735.622,3736.196,Yes.
1972.71-732,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3736.196,3739.763,And that the California rule that it depends on the facts?
1972.71-732,2,39374,robert_r_granucci,,3739.763,3740.747,That’s right.
1972.71-732,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3740.747,3750.35,"And as long as the officer asks, and he consents, then at least the burden of going forward with the evidence shifts?"
1972.71-732,2,39374,robert_r_granucci,,3750.35,3751.873,"I think that’s right, Your Honor."
1972.71-732,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3757.877,3759.412,"Well, obviously."
1972.71-732,2,39374,robert_r_granucci,,3759.412,3760.758,"You see, in other words, we look for --"
1972.71-732,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3760.758,3762.292,But that isn’t in this case?
1972.71-732,2,39374,robert_r_granucci,,3762.292,3766.299,"No, sir, it isn’t. Verbal expression of permission to search."
1972.71-732,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3774.26,3774.852,But you were.
1972.71-732,2,39374,robert_r_granucci,,3788.784,3789.825,It might be a different case.
1972.71-732,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3805.249,3809.89,"Once again, would you tell me why they asked to search the car?"
1972.71-732,2,39374,robert_r_granucci,,3809.89,3813.487,"Well, it’s in the record, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1972.71-732,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3874.118,3878.967,"Mr. Tobisman, you served at the Court’s request and by the Court’s appointment."
