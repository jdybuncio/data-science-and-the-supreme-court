1958.234,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,14.621,"The -- before you proceed, Mr. Friedman, I just -- I just say you don't need to be seated."
1958.234,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,26.814,29.995,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,1926.209,1930.46,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please."
1958.234,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1981.882,1988.672,"You do consider this in the trade as an invoice, the -- the document which appears at 66 (a)."
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,1988.672,1990.771,"I'm not sure, Your Honor, that we do."
1958.234,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1990.771,1992.403,"Well, you just said -- you just said they did."
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,1992.403,1995.224,"Well, we're using invoice here."
1958.234,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1999.986,2000.101,Yes.
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2000.101,2006.735,"Now, whether this is an invoice in the retail trade, there's nothing in the record about that, one way or the other."
1958.234,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2006.735,2007.905,"Well, just an ordinary sales slip."
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2007.905,2008.527,I beg your pardon?
1958.234,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2008.527,2009.847,It's just the ordinary sales slip.
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2009.847,2011.469,That's the way we -- we view it.
1958.234,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2020.72,2035.823,"But is the real question whether, although it is an ordinary sales slip thing, you and I or -- or I and my ignorance, my -- my extreme of calling it an invoice, Congress is entitled to give invoice defined -- limit beyond the colloquial meaning."
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2035.823,2036.003,"Well, that's right, it is."
1958.234,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2036.003,2039.079,And the question is whether it has done so.
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2039.079,2042.222,That -- that brings us down to the -- to the heart of the question.
1958.234,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2042.222,2043.63,Certainly.
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2043.63,2056.687,"Whether in specifying the invoicing, Congress brought within its scope these invoices that are given at the -- at the retail level."
1958.234,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2056.687,2062.42,"Well, now -- now may I -- may I ask this."
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2078.042,2087.068,"If Your Honor please, in the early -- early in briefing stages, as I recall, we raised the point and went on."
1958.234,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2127.811,2133.454,"When you say you have to meet the issue, other than saying it isn't an invoice in the terms of the statute."
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2140.596,2141.126,"Well, we --"
1958.234,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2141.126,2146.015,"-- to satisfy the requirement if this be an invoice, did it?"
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2149.408,2149.567,That --
1958.234,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2149.567,2151.982,"-- of why invoice, it didn't satisfy --"
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2151.982,2155.402,That came to be one of the questions in the case that --
1958.234,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2155.402,2156.678,But you say you had to meet the issue --
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2156.678,2156.979,Whether --
1958.234,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2156.979,2157.357,What?
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2158.538,2160.654,"We had to face up to the issue, perhaps, I should have said."
1958.234,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2160.654,2164.106,But what was -- how do you face up to it except by saying --
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2164.106,2164.402,Where -- well --
1958.234,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2164.402,2165.22,-- you're not within the statute?
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2165.22,2169.72,"First, we denied that it was an -- an invoice within the statute."
1958.234,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2176.534,2177.393,I see.
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2177.54,2177.72,And --
1958.234,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2177.72,2179.543,That's what I was searching for.
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2179.543,2190.492,"It was found that some of them lacked, some of the required -- some of the elements, some of the representations that would be required if it were a statutory invoice within the Act."
1958.234,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2190.492,2192.401,Let me be clear about this.
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2212.941,2216.591,Speaking of the sales slips that are in evidence here.
1958.234,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2223.476,2231.106,"Well now, if you -- if you are required to include those elements, then the Commission has a right to issue this into this order, doesn't it?"
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2231.106,2232.213,That's correct.
1958.234,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2232.213,2234.358,And so I go back to my question.
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2244.821,2255.727,"On the invoicing issue, I think that we are concluded by the finding below that --"
1958.234,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2255.727,2257.144,There were omissions -- there were omissions.
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2257.144,2262.246,They were -- there were omissions.
1958.234,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2262.246,2269.224,"But the Court of Appeals did agree with your fundamental and primary contention that these were not invoices within the meaning of the statute, is that (Voice Overlap)?"
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2269.224,2270.989,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.234,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2270.989,2274.416,"And that's the issue here on that -- on that part of the case, isn't that it?"
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2274.416,2283.845,"That is the -- that is the first issue, whether those invoices, good or bad, or the in -- or the invoices contemplated by the statute, in the private statute."
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2283.845,2288.012,"If that's not an invoice, what would be invoice?"
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2288.012,2290.501,What would be an invoice?
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2304.767,2308.998,You mean the retailer cannot issue an invoice.
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2308.998,2313.646,"Technically, he can, but I'm saying that in the common acceptance of the term and whether Congress --"
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2313.646,2326.586,"I'm -- I'm -- what I'm -- I might -- you say that this fee were not invoice, isn't what I ask you on -- if these are not invoices, how could a retailer issue an invoice?"
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2326.586,2331.245,"I -- I'd have difficulty in saying how a retailer could invoice, I --"
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2331.245,2335.056,Your -- your position seems to me to be that the retailer can't do it.
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2345.203,2348.52,"If we are wrong on this first issue here, it is."
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2350.597,2355.216,"Well, that in your -- in your judgment, would that be an invoice?"
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2355.216,2356.152,In --
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2356.152,2362.322,"Hold on -- hold on to invoice 12 different furs, put them all down just what they have here."
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2362.322,2362.579,Well --
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2362.579,2364.946,"In your judgment, would that be an invoice via retail?"
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2364.946,2377.828,An invoice is usually defined as a list of goods sent together with prices perhaps from one person to another.
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2378.695,2387.301,"Whole -- wholesales -- wholesales over put down on here and I went in and bought 15 furs and put them all down, put down the price on each."
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2393.501,2397.142,"Within the meaning of the statute to -- no, Your Honor."
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2397.142,2400.756,"Well, if not, what could be an invoice?"
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2400.756,2405.141,"Well, an invoice within the meaning of the statute is one thing and an invoice --"
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2405.141,2405.484,What could be --
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2405.484,2406.651,-- at large --
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2406.651,2411.385,"In your judgment, are you saying that a retailer cannot issue an invoice?"
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2411.385,2411.626,I don't --
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2411.626,2413.589,Something he does would be an invoice.
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2413.589,2414.995,I don't believe we can say that.
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2415.592,2420.055,"Well, what would be then if this is --"
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2420.055,2422.725,This technically --
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2422.725,2423.73,I'm not talking about this.
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2424.268,2425.324,"Technically, this may be an invoice at large."
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2425.324,2429.406,"In your judgment, (Voice Overlap) invoice, under the statute if this is one."
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2429.406,2440.383,"Technically, this may be, speaking at large and apart from the statute, these sales slips may be invoices too."
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2441.953,2444.23,Maybe.
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2453.488,2463.03,"Well, I -- my difficulty is in getting away from the strong feeling that in -- in the common acceptance of the term, an invoice is an earlier stage of the process."
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2463.03,2464.487,"Earlier stage, you mean --"
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2464.487,2465.733,Prior to the retailers' handling.
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2465.733,2468.873,"In other words, a retailer doesn't issue invoice."
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2468.873,2480.4,"Not in the common acceptance of the term, but I don't believe, Your Honor, that with all respect that that's going to -- to get us anywhere because we've got a definition of invoice here."
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2493.851,2497.354,"You mean by saying step, when the retailer does?"
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2497.354,2498.604,"Does the -- yes, sir."
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2499.149,2503.97,You are thinking of invoices given by manufactures or wholesales.
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2503.97,2508.967,I think that's -- that is certainly the common acceptance of the term and that is the way we view the requirements.
1958.234,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2510.764,2513.551,"Mr. Horne, let's take this situation."
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2554.548,2558.069,"Perhaps we'd have to call that a non-statutory invoice, Your Honor."
1958.234,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2558.069,2561.752,[Laughter]
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2561.752,2563.554,"How do you use the word ""invoice""?"
1958.234,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2563.554,2573.032,"[Laughs] No, we were labeling this from a -- the carrier."
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2573.032,2574.129,"Well, of course."
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2583.73,2589.576,Where -- what part of the statute is that you think States takes out of retailer?
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2589.576,2594.796,"Two parts, Your Honor, which is issued in connection with any commercial dealing --"
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2594.796,2598.928,In what ways to stop right then and do you consider this a commercial dealing?
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2598.928,2602.137,The sale from the -- from Mandel to -- to the customer?
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2602.137,2604.325,Yes.
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2604.325,2609.934,It seems to me that dealing imports two people.
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2609.934,2611.943,"Well, there are two here."
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2611.943,2622.974,And dealing commercially imports trafficking in goods with a view to resale or exchange as a business.
1958.234,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2656.302,2669.154,"I imagine both of these are, one of them is trying to get as cheap as it can, which is -- I'm afraid my recent experience, they -- they will not achieve and the other is trying to get as much profit as they can get."
1958.234,1,41506,samuel_h_horne,,2669.154,2672.132,I suspect in this situation --
