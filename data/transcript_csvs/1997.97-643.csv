1997.97-643,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.586,"We'll hear argument now in Number 97-643, United States v. Vickie Cabrales."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,9.008,12.952,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-643,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,118.254,133.144,"Does it make any difference at all, Mr. Stewart, whether the defendant had any knowledge of the circumstances of the predicate offense or any link at all with the State in which that was carried out?"
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,133.144,140.71,"To establish guilt under the money-laundering statutes the defendant would have to be shown to have known that the funds were illegally acquired, so to--"
1997.97-643,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,140.71,146.503,"Well, the defendant presumably could have been told by somebody, look, I got these funds illegally."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,163.985,165.387,"--Yes, under our view it is."
1997.97-643,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,170.382,174.746,Even if the defendant doesn't know that the crime occurred in Missouri and--
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,174.746,175.027,--That's correct.
1997.97-643,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.027,175.918,--was never there.
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,175.918,176.779,That's correct.
1997.97-643,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,187.838,193.214,"Well, what cases do you think justify that particular approach?"
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,193.214,198.91,I think the two best cases in this Court would be Hyde v. United States and In Re Palliser.
1997.97-643,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,225.378,230.682,"Well, I... it's a little easier to see, isn't it, in a conspiracy context."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,233.174,246.191,--It... you're correct that in some sense the link between the defendant and the coconspirators may be more direct than the link between the money-launderer and the persons who perpetrate the predicate crimes.
1997.97-643,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,263.976,268.087,"Well, what about receiving stolen property, one of the examples mentioned, I think, in one of the briefs."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,268.087,268.617,--I--
1997.97-643,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,268.617,275.172,"You know, the property is stolen in State A, and then it's received and resold in State B.--"
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,275.172,293.866,"--It certainly is our theory that the prosecution could be brought in State A for much the same reasons, that because the evil of the offense is that it facilitates or conceals the crime that occurred in jurisdiction A, and because the harm of the crime is felt in jurisdiction A, it therefore makes sense to prosecute the offense there."
1997.97-643,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,293.866,299.672,"--Well, how does receiving stolen property in New York conceal the existence of a crime, say, in Chicago?"
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,299.672,310.829,"Well, for one thing, if the person in New York receives it and profits by it rather than, for instance, turning over the evidence to the police, in that sense it conceals the offense."
1997.97-643,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,321.136,325.66,"I can see how it facilitates it, but to say it conceals it, I really don't follow that."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,325.66,334.926,--I guess it would be accurate to say it conceals it only if we compare the person who receives the stolen property to the person who becomes aware of the theft and reports it to the authorities.
1997.97-643,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,334.926,340.32,I take it on your theory... how do you feel about controlled substances?
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,351.437,361.644,"No, I don't think so, because the Attorney General's act of putting the controlled substance on the list would not in any sense be conduct that the ban on possession--"
1997.97-643,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,361.644,362.804,"No, it's not conduct exactly."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,362.804,363.054,--It would--
1997.97-643,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,363.054,364.897,But isn't it an element of the offense?
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,364.897,365.495,--It's no--
1997.97-643,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,365.495,370.77,"I mean, if the substance is not on the list, then you can't prosecute the person for the offense."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,370.77,378.605,"--It would not be conduct that it was the purpose of the controlled substance statutes to prohibit or deter, and I think--"
1997.97-643,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,378.605,378.915,Oh--
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,384.419,384.67,--I--
1997.97-643,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,384.67,385.781,Is it or isn't it?
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,385.781,388.335,--Element of the offense is not a universal justification.
1997.97-643,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.387,392.436,"It's not sufficient, then."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,392.436,393.508,--That's correct.
1997.97-643,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,393.508,415.523,"So what else do you... I mean, it's... your theory is that although all the conduct relevant here took place in Florida, I take it, but there was some element of the offense that took place in a different State, that that element of the offense does give venue, but my element of the offense, putting the drug on the list, doesn't give venue, because?"
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,415.523,420.726,"Well, I would dispute the proposition that all of the conduct that's relevant here occurred in Florida."
1997.97-643,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,423.269,442.612,"Yes, all the conduct... and similarly the Attorney General's conduct of putting a drug on a list took place in Washington, D.C., but that conduct which created an element of the offense does not count for venue, but here the conduct of the activity and element of the offense in Missouri does, because--"
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,442.612,464.507,"--There's an intensely practical reason for that, that is that the central purpose underlying the constitutional requirement that the crime be prosecuted at the place where it was committed was to facilitate the production of relevant evidence, and it's very likely, in money laundering prosecutions generally and in this case in particular, that the fact that specified unlawful activity generated the funds will--"
1997.97-643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,464.507,468.18,--Do you really think that provision was designed to protect the Government's interest in getting evidence?
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,468.18,468.928,--I don't think it was designed to--
1997.97-643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,468.928,470.551,Not to protect the defendant's interest--
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,470.551,470.711,--I--
1997.97-643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,470.711,471.502,--in being tried at home?
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,471.502,486.871,"--I think... well, it was designed to protect the defendant's interest, but clearly if the Framers had been concerned only with the defendant's convenience, or with the right of the defendant to be tried at home, the Constitution would say that the defendant has a right to be tried in the district of her residence."
1997.97-643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,496.361,498.742,Prevent him from being tried where he goes and commits a crime.
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,506.439,508.382,"--Well, I think it is consistent with the prin--"
1997.97-643,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,508.382,527.863,"Mr. Stewart, in the Constitution... this is mentioned twice in the Constitution, and in the Sixth Amendment it says, the accused shall enjoy the right, so apparently the people who wrote that thought... the right to be tried in the district wherein the crime shall have been committed, enjoy the right."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,535.971,541.343,--I'm not suggesting that they put the provision in there in order to protect the prosecution.
1997.97-643,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,564.16,578.521,"But it is the idea of the jury of the vicinity where the act was committed, and you have dealt with the Attorney General and the list, but what crimes?"
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,607.404,612.667,"--Well, in terms of something that went on earlier, I think there isn't so much authority."
1997.97-643,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,622.575,622.895,But that--
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,635.183,651.214,"--Well, it is true that respondent is not being held responsible for the drug-trafficking crimes in the sense of being prosecuted for distribution of narcotics or for conspiracy to distribute narcotics, but I think it's nevertheless accurate, in a sense, to say that she is being held responsible for those acts."
1997.97-643,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,651.885,664.975,"But if we could take the substance of it, is what I'm... let's assume we're talking about just a single defendant, no aiding and abetting, so I know from the cases that there's receiving stolen property, and there's jury tampering, and there's money-laundering."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,666.126,692.786,"--I think perhaps the best example would be offenses involving the use of the mails, or the channels of interstate commerce, where Congress has provided by statute that those offenses can be prosecuted in any district, for instance, where the mail was sent, where the mail was received, or even in a district through which the mail passes in transit, and the idea is that even though the defendant may not personally have been present in the district of receipt, nevertheless she is responsible for harm occurring in that district by--"
1997.97-643,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,692.786,696.899,"Well, is that it, or she is using the mails wherever she sends her letter."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,704.285,717.053,"--I think... it... I think it is a good example, at least to the extent that it shows that the Constitution does not guarantee the defendant the right to trial in a district where she personally acted."
1997.97-643,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,717.053,721.567,"Oh, sure, but that's not the contention being made here by the defendant, I don't think."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,736.366,738.036,"Well, I think the Palliser case involves--"
1997.97-643,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,738.036,738.797,I think it's Palliser.
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,738.797,739.378,"--Oh, Palliser."
1997.97-643,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,739.378,741.741,"Have you read the Trollope novels, the Palliser novels?"
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,743.753,743.933,Okay.
1997.97-643,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,787.534,787.965,So your--
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,821.57,837.271,"I mean, I think Your Honor is correct in saying that the defendant in a money-laundering case doesn't cause the narcotics-trafficking activities to occur, but I think it's nevertheless the case that the harm of those... the money-laundering activities is felt in the district where the predicate crimes took place."
1997.97-643,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,849.292,860.841,"You're not backing away from my description of your position as to the meth prosecution being in Arizona, even though it was sold by someone who has never been in Arizona and it's gone through three different stages and it's in New York City?"
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,860.841,864.043,I guess I'm not sure about the precise scope of your hypothetical.
1997.97-643,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,864.043,880.824,"Well, the hypothetical is that meth is manufactured in Arizona, it's sold by two or three different people, and it's finally sold by some guy on the street in New York, and it seems to me, under your point of view, this street seller can be prosecuted in Arizona, because that... it makes the meth laboratory work to have this little distribution network."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,880.824,890.679,"I think that may not be accurate, because I think in the prosecution of the street seller it would not in any sense be an element of the crime, where... we would not typically show--"
1997.97-643,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,890.679,892.611,But you're not relying on elements of the crime.
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,892.611,896.863,"--Well, we are relying on effects to the extent that they are elements of the crime."
1997.97-643,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,907.361,909.653,Use Justice Kennedy's example with counterfeiting.
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,909.653,910.754,--I'm sorry.
1997.97-643,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,910.754,913.067,Use Justice Kennedy's example with counterfeiting.
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,917.88,929.297,"I think that probably would fall under our theory, although I think that's a harder case, because the harm in that case would be felt where the counterfeit bill was passed, and not where the bills were manufactured."
1997.97-643,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,930.309,935.133,"Oh, you mean the Government doesn't think there's any harm in having a counterfeit organization in a particular community?"
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,935.133,937.815,--There's harm in having the counterfeit organization.
1997.97-643,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,980.622,986.405,"Well, but Mr. Stewart, may I ask you a question that goes one step further on that question of purpose."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1107.319,1114.972,"--I think you are right in your assumption about the purposes, and I... we would respectfully disagree with the assertion that the purposes are not served here."
1997.97-643,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1160.965,1163.239,"The counterfeiting case, that wouldn't apply."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1191.779,1196.621,I don't think it follows that the place where the felony was committed would be an appropriate venue.
1997.97-643,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1224.179,1224.47,Why might it be?
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1224.47,1243.193,"--It might be because I assume that an element of the offense of passing counterfeiting money is that the person knew that it was counterfeited and, at least in some cases, one of the ways of proving that the defendant knew that the money was counterfeit was to show that he was the one who manufactured it and perhaps took it to distant locations to pass it, but that he was involved in the operation."
1997.97-643,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1253.95,1262.306,"Well, I suppose if that's what you're going to rely on for proof you would prosecute him for manufacturing the counterfeited bill in the jurisdiction in which he did it."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1262.306,1264.039,We might prosecute him for that.
1997.97-643,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1278.559,1282.181,I'm not sure you have to win the counterfeiting case in order to win this case.
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1326.141,1328.103,"I wouldn't say the whole purpose, but I would say--"
1997.97-643,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1328.103,1328.804,You wouldn't say the whole purpose?
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1328.804,1329.044,--I--
1997.97-643,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1329.044,1334.617,"I mean, what do you care if somebody launders money if it's not... you know, you're trying to stop the drug-dealing?"
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1334.617,1337.91,"--I mean, I would say... I'm sorry if I misspoke."
1997.97-643,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1342.885,1348.247,"Oh, I know, because you want to reach further, but in order to win this case I don't have to agree to go any further, do I?"
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1348.247,1357.353,"--I think that's absolutely correct, and I think certainly we would acknowledge that there is indeterminacy at the margins as to the way that certain cases should come out."
1997.97-643,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1357.353,1357.553,"Well, sure."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1372.083,1375.806,That seems to me at the margins.
1997.97-643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1397.223,1406.888,May I ask about your suggestion that the fact the money was illegal... the taint of the money occurred in Missouri makes venue proper there.
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1428.692,1432.396,"--Well, it's the place where the funds were unlawfully generated, and--"
1997.97-643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1432.396,1439.01,"But supposing you'd alleged Missouri, you thought it was, and it turned out... on proof it turned out they were actually done right across the river in Illinois."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1439.01,1439.61,--The--
1997.97-643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1439.61,1440.551,Would you lose the case?
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1440.551,1441.672,--We would lose the case.
1997.97-643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1441.672,1442.223,You would not.
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1442.223,1443.114,We would lose the case.
1997.97-643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1443.114,1443.345,You would lose the case.
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1443.345,1443.913,That is--
1997.97-643,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1443.913,1445.976,It would be dismissed for improper venue.
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1445.976,1446.347,--That's correct.
1997.97-643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1448.819,1450.709,"Now, assume he's tried in... assume she's tried in Florida."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1452.572,1452.792,--Oh.
1997.97-643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1452.792,1454.853,I'm just talking about the element of the offense.
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1464.299,1464.67,No.
1997.97-643,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1488.429,1503.36,"When the conduct that occurs in a different place, like Missouri here, is not conduct that has been engaged in by the defendant, as is true here, you say it has to be an element of the offense, and it has to be the purpose of the statute, to get at it?"
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1503.36,1512.026,"I would say if the defendant could show that that act, while an element of the offense, is manifestly not the act that Congress was attempting to--"
1997.97-643,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1512.026,1515.397,Does that mean that that act has to be bad in some way?
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1535.832,1536.373,--I think it does get it.
1997.97-643,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1536.593,1537.565,It does get it.
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1537.565,1538.867,--We would say in these cases that--
1997.97-643,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1538.867,1539.087,All right.
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1552.845,1567.605,--I think as a practical matter another way of coming at it is to say that the District of Columbia wouldn't be an appropriate venue in the hypothetical regarding the listing of the drugs because trial in that district would manifestly fail to serve the purposes underling the constitutional requirements.
1997.97-643,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1573.718,1575.709,"Sounds as if it's getting a little ad hoc, this test."
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1594.623,1605.0,"--I guess one of the things I'd like to focus on is, on the facts of this case, this is... the Western District of Missouri seems to us to be manifestly the sensible district to try the case."
1997.97-643,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1612.228,1615.53,"Mr. Stewart, may I ask you, what practical difference does it make?"
1997.97-643,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1634.733,1645.151,--I think the main difference is that if we are limited to the conspiracy charge in Missouri we would have to prove an agreement in addition to... an agreement to launder money in addition to the money-laundering offense.
1997.97-643,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1646.802,1647.934,"Very well, Mr. Stewart."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,1651.608,1657.521,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-643,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1738.159,1745.386,"So could Congress provide... you say this is a straight question of statutory interpretation that we have, this venue statute."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,1754.869,1763.725,I think that if Congress was to define money laundering where venue would be proper where the underlying unlawful activity--
1997.97-643,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1763.725,1764.456,That's not defining the crime.
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,1776.374,1790.863,"--I believe that statute would violate the Constitution when... in the cases when the crime was not committed where it's tried, so I don't think that that would pass constitutional muster."
1997.97-643,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1790.863,1796.636,"So we're dealing not merely with a question of statutory interpretation, but one that you say is constitutionally compelled."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,1796.636,1807.074,"I think... I believe the Constitution compels that the trial be had where the crime is committed, and if the trial is not had where the crime is committed, I think it will violate the Constitution."
1997.97-643,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1807.074,1810.607,"Well, that's really tautological."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,1825.978,1837.384,"Well, this Court has said when it... to look... to determine where the crime is committed, you must look at the acts of the defendant that violate the statute, and that's why you can't divorce what the proscribed conduct is from the Constitution."
1997.97-643,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1837.384,1856.338,"Well, in this situation, if the Government were to allege and show that the defendant had, indeed, conspired and participated in the drug offenses in Missouri and had agreed that there would be money-laundering, could she be tried in Missouri?"
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,1856.338,1857.75,She could be tried in Missouri--
1997.97-643,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1857.75,1859.781,For the money laundering that occurred in Florida?
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,1859.781,1865.224,"--If it was a conspiracy to launder money, possibly, under that hypothetical, she could be."
1997.97-643,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1869.685,1871.007,"Well, was she--"
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,1878.133,1878.811,She was.
1997.97-643,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1880.334,1889.09,"And does that mean that the laundering offense started in Missouri, in effect, because that was the conspiracy agreement?"
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,1889.09,1901.348,"Well, conspiracy, of course, punishes the agreement to commit the illegal act, so in the sense that the agreement was formed in Missouri and there were overt acts in Missouri, venue would be proper for a conspiracy prosecution in Missouri."
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.348,1908.103,Or even if the agreement was formed in Missouri and there... or the agreement was formed in New York and there were overt acts in Missouri.
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,1908.103,1908.824,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1914.487,1918.56,But how do you square that with your interpretation of the Constitution?
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,1932.84,1949.292,"In both those cases, in the conspiracy context and in the aiding and abetting context, you have a situation where the defendant herself or himself would be legally liable for the conduct of another, so in that sense the crime is committed in that district where the other acts that they're legally liable for."
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.135,1956.355,That's... okay.
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,1962.989,1974.226,"Aiding and abetting is... by a statutory matter it says that an aider and abettor can be prosecuted as a principal, so in that sense I think the aider and abettor is legally liable for the actions of the principal."
1997.97-643,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1974.226,1985.374,"Mr. Rogers, you... I... am I correct in thinking that there is a conspiracy charge here against your client in connection with one of the pending counts?"
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,1985.374,1986.035,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-643,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1986.035,1988.927,Then why doesn't Hyde cover this case?
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,1988.927,1993.79,Venue has to be looked at for each crime that is charged.
1997.97-643,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2003.866,2008.671,"So you say all we're talking about here is the substantive offense, not the conspiracy?"
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2008.671,2011.893,Conspiracy is not at issue in... on... in this case at all.
1997.97-643,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2011.893,2020.561,"You didn't contest venue, or whoever was representing the defendant didn't contest venue with respect to the conspiracy count."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2020.561,2022.221,"No, that's not correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-643,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2022.321,2022.661,You did?
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2022.661,2026.115,--I filed the motion to dismiss based on all three counts on venue.
1997.97-643,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2060.128,2065.853,"But on appeal the only question related to the money laundering, not to the conspiracy, is that right?"
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2065.853,2066.842,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-643,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2066.842,2069.835,So that's what's before us for review.
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2075.257,2076.4,"I'm sorry, I--"
1997.97-643,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2076.4,2084.193,"The... you pursued the venue objection on the conspiracy count only in the district court, not in the court of appeals."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2084.193,2084.964,--That is correct.
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2093.8,2119.606,"What if the Government enacts a statute that says, a person who launders money derived from a illegal enterprise, drug sales, for example, shall be deemed an aider and abettor of the illegal enterprise?"
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2119.606,2126.852,"If they were, in fact... I... if... in that situation, if they in fact--"
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2126.852,2130.826,"This same statute, just calling your client an aider and abettor of the drug dealing."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2134.108,2135.28,"--That is correct, Justice--"
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2135.28,2136.011,The court just said it wrong.
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2136.011,2137.26,--Or she would have to aid and abet the drug dealing.
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.305,2156.977,"Well, the statute says that the act of enabling the drug dealers to get the benefit of their drug dealing by rendering the money usable, laundering it, constitutes aiding and abetting of the drug dealing."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2160.718,2163.498,That's... in your hypothetical--
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2163.498,2164.029,Yes.
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2164.029,2164.6,--If that's what the statute--
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2164.6,2164.961,I'm making it up.
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2164.961,2165.251,--Yes.
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2172.106,2172.406,Right.
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2172.406,2176.109,--then you could be proper where the underlying illegal activity happened.
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.109,2182.942,"It's not much of a constitutional protection, is it, if it just turns on how the statute was framed."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2192.381,2204.348,"I would respectfully disagree that it's not a constitutional protection, since because what you have done is, you have created a statute that penalizes different conduct than the money-laundering statutes at issue."
1997.97-643,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2215.638,2215.898,Well--
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2215.898,2218.92,--and they would be legally liable for the people that--
1997.97-643,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2218.92,2235.469,"--Well, but what would happen, Mr. Rogers, if your client were charged with aiding and abetting, and that was the only basis for venue in Missouri, and the court concluded after all the evidence was in that she may have done something, but that she did not aid and abet."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2239.022,2242.145,"--On the hypothetical that Justice Scalia gave, yes."
1997.97-643,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2242.145,2244.806,"No, on the hypothetical that I gave."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2244.806,2247.357,"I'm sorry, I didn't follow that."
1997.97-643,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2247.828,2266.301,"Well, what I'm trying to get at is, if the basis for venue were a charge of aiding and abetting, and the court were to decide there just is insufficient evidence of aiding and abetting as to this particular individual, would the next step be to dismiss the case against that individual for improper venue?"
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2266.301,2270.443,"--Well, I think you would dismiss it for failure of proof on the substantive--"
1997.97-643,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2270.443,2271.355,Failure to prove that--
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2271.355,2274.037,"--That they aided and abetted, yes, and--"
1997.97-643,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2274.037,2285.144,"--Well, what if they were charged both with a substantive offense and with aiding and abetting, and the district court says, there's enough here to go to the jury on the substantive offense, but there isn't enough on aiding and abetting?"
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2285.144,2288.406,"--Once again, I think my answer would be the same."
1997.97-643,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2296.363,2298.995,Even though were venue were based only on the aiding and abetting?
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2298.995,2299.356,"Oh, no, no."
1997.97-643,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2312.735,2318.198,"If that were so there would be no problem here, because she was indicted on the conspiracy count."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2318.198,2319.25,--Correct.
1997.97-643,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2319.25,2322.292,"If that's all that matters, then you could link the other two."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2322.292,2337.543,"In that sense, this is no different from many cases where, if you have a huge conspiracy of a criminal enterprise, that they can... the Government can only join the counts in the district where the crime was committed if they were... even if they were substantive violations in furtherance of the conspiracy."
1997.97-643,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2352.023,2353.796,That's one of the questions I was asking Mr. Stewart.
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2373.401,2374.322,--There's--
1997.97-643,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2374.322,2374.573,--her exposure?
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2374.573,2376.195,"--You're right on the money, Your Honor."
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2384.461,2387.563,Why is aiding and abetting different from this statute?
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2429.58,2437.067,"Your Honor, if I said that just because the Government said she aided and abetted, venue would be proper in Missouri, I clearly misspoke."
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2439.988,2441.508,"No, when I say the Government said it."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2464.835,2467.336,I go back to the Constitution.
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2475.421,2487.319,"But in aiding and abetting, the act that she's aiding and abetting did not occur in Florida, it occurred in Missouri, and here the act that she's facilitating, the drug deal, did not occur in Florida, it occurred in Missouri."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2488.28,2490.143,I... the difference--
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2490.143,2491.602,--for constitutional purposes?
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2491.602,2498.929,"--Well, for constitutional purposes, in an aiding and abetting situation you're legally liable for the acts of others, so the crime can be committed."
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2498.929,2508.355,"So here, you are legally liable... you're being punished in part because of the acts of others, the drug transaction."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2508.355,2511.286,"In an aiding and abetting situation, I don't disagree with that."
1997.97-643,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2511.817,2519.543,"Mr. Rogers, may I interrupt with this suggestion, because this may be what's defeating the joinder here."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2621.484,2622.135,--Your Honor--
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.135,2623.296,"Take it, Mr. Rogers, take it."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2625.229,2628.301,"--Thank you, Your Honor, and you are absolutely correct."
1997.97-643,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2633.294,2635.795,And this is a case in which Justice Scalia may even agree with you.
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2637.517,2643.201,--If you are an accessory after the fact you aren't legally liable for the principals.
1997.97-643,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2688.215,2694.047,"Suppose you intend the effects of the crime to be felt in Missouri, so that there is this prospective element?"
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2694.047,2694.308,Sure.
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2744.085,2755.032,"Well, you wouldn't say that, I mean, what if you... you know, the Unabomber sends the bomb, it explodes and injures the person in New York, and he goes back to Darien, Connecticut, and dies in Darien."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2758.495,2779.648,"I believe that in certain situations that if you have a... where you commit the... like, if I shot someone and they didn't die, and then they stumbled over to a different district and died, I believe that's one of the rare situations when murder probably could be a continuing offense, and would be proper where the act of the... was committed and where the result was caused in that sense."
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2787.202,2800.061,Cases that we've decided which allow a Federal murder indictment where the person died and not where the act which caused the death was applied?
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2800.061,2804.623,"--Well, I think that... go back to the Unabomber example."
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2813.249,2827.428,"No, but the explosion occurs, the act which you produced occurs where the package is received, and then the person is taken to another State where he eventually dies."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2833.662,2836.334,--I'd have to agree with you.
1997.97-643,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2847.102,2849.384,I'm not clear on your answer to that question.
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2874.632,2893.185,"--I think that if you... I'm not... I... were... I don't think that if the person was shot in one district and then somehow they hopped on a plane and went somewhere else, I don't think that State would properly be able to try a murder prosecution there."
1997.97-643,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2893.185,2903.51,Suppose that the defendant intends the... his acts to have effects which it's the object of the statute to prevent.
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2920.921,2923.302,"Well, if the statute was--"
1997.97-643,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2923.302,2924.874,And there was proof to that effect.
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,2924.874,2925.135,--Sure.
1997.97-643,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2979.423,2987.107,"Mr. Rogers, one aspect of this puzzles me and that is, this is presented to us as a very clean case."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,3020.25,3030.546,"Well, in that situation, in the crime you're talking about, you've got a... you could have a conspiracy to launder money, or a conspiracy to distribute drugs."
1997.97-643,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3030.546,3031.777,Who did transport this money?
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,3033.657,3037.2,"I... frankly, I don't know who transported the money."
1997.97-643,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3039.27,3041.291,"Your answer should be, what money?"
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,3044.344,3053.261,"Assuming the money was transported... assuming the money was transported, that has nothing to do with the substantive violation of money laundering."
1997.97-643,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3058.757,3068.133,"Yes, but I was just wondering why, on the Government's side, there was this admission that she wasn't involved in transporting, or that at least what they charged doesn't involve that."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,3068.133,3070.485,--I couldn't speak for the Government on that issue.
1997.97-643,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3075.87,3076.66,That's what I was wondering.
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,3076.66,3078.232,I just don't know.
1997.97-643,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3082.373,3084.776,"Thank you, Mr. Rogers."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,3084.776,3085.375,--Thank you.
1997.97-643,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3085.375,3086.787,"Mr. Stewart, you have 1 minute remaining."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,3086.787,3103.747,"As the exchange between Mr. Rogers and Justices Scalia and Souter indicates, really the respondent's position stands or falls with the proposition that there is a constitutionally significant difference between being an aider and abettor and being an accessory after the fact, and I think the fact that Congress has chosen to define an aider and abettor as--"
1997.97-643,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3103.747,3107.05,"Of course, in the aider and abettor, you've got to aid something that hasn't yet happened."
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,3115.015,3119.138,"--I think if we can prove the conspiracy charge, then presumably the money laundering--"
1997.97-643,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3119.138,3119.829,Would be relevant conduct--
1997.97-643,1,32719,john_w_rogers,,3119.829,3122.17,--itself would be relevant conduct and probably the end result would be negligible.
1997.97-643,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3127.546,3128.935,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
