1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,37.53,40.213,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,51.555,52.766,Very well.
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,52.766,63.082,I may just in advance say that this is an action for just compensation under the Fifth Amendment to the United States constitution.
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,215.003,216.846,Directed at what station?
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,216.846,224.118,"Pardon me Mr. Chief Justice, directed at United States army troops, station in the street along 11th Street in Bolivar Avenue."
1968.517,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,226.039,227.663,Could you point out where your building is again.
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,227.663,227.974,Yes.
1968.517,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,232.415,233.305,Right next to it.
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,233.305,234.161,Right next to it.
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,239.275,241.031,Is that involved in the litigation too?
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,241.031,242.723,"Yes, it is Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,351.093,351.775,May I ask --
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,351.775,351.889,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,351.889,361.327,"May I ask first, what if any damage was done to those blocks that were in that area where you have your pointer right now."
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,361.327,364.25,"The -- yes, Mr. Chief Justice, if you will see the --"
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,364.25,364.585,"Yes, that -- those lines."
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,364.585,367.463,-- shaded area indicates those were buildings that were damaged.
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,367.463,367.74,Yes.
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,367.74,369.734,There was no damage to these buildings here.
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,369.734,369.842,No.
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,369.842,372.435,No damage to these buildings down here.
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,381.382,381.59,Yeah.
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,388.249,389.018,Over here?
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,389.018,390.747,"No, those cross lines (Voice Overlap)."
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,390.747,391.968,These are the buildings in question Mr. Chief Justice --
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,391.968,395.389,"Well, I know but they weren't all in this -- all in Masonic Temple (Voice Overlap) --"
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,395.389,396.071,"No, the Masonic Temple was --"
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,396.071,396.988,"What was done in that, I don't care."
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,396.988,398.216,That's the Masonic Temple.
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,398.216,402.282,Was there a general destruction done on that whole area?
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,402.282,404.439,"As to these buildings, Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,407.402,420.721,"Okay, what I want to know is this, you've got certain blocks that are right there in the area of these two buildings and you have them marked with diagonal lines across them like that."
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,422.223,422.64,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,422.64,431.247,"Now, what damage was done to those blocks, not any particular building but those blocks other than the -- other than in those two buildings?"
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,431.247,432.639,In these three buildings?
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,432.639,434.638,"No, I'm not talking about three buildings; I'm talking --"
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,434.638,434.885,(Voice Overlap) --
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,434.885,439.853,-- about this general area that's -- has those diagonal lines on them.
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,439.853,442.029,There was no damage other than into the building Your Honor.
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,442.029,442.602,Other than --
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,442.602,444.902,These shaded areas indicate buildings not blocks.
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,444.902,446.02,Just those three?
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,446.02,446.271,Yes.
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,446.271,447.184,Those three buildings.
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,447.184,447.6,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,447.6,451.936,"Well, the hash lines going down Bolivar Avenue or just marked the boundary line of it?"
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,451.936,452.714,That's correct.
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,452.714,454.452,"Well, that -- those are not buildings or any area of destruction or anything else."
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,454.452,455.33,"No, no."
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,461.347,466.865,"I can't read your legend from here but what is that mean, those diagonal lines?"
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,466.865,469.678,"That says, buildings looted and damaged or burnt."
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,474.772,477.198,"Oh, yes, thank you."
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,477.198,484.07,On the basis of these facts the Court of Claims held that there was no liability for the seizure and use of these buildings.
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,581.908,582.994,What is your --
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,606.875,624.885,"No, Mr. Justice Fortas, I would characterize the factual element of the issue as to whether there was a seizure and a use for a military purpose and we take the position as that expressed by Judge Davis below that once there's a seizure and use by the U.S. Armed Forces for military purpose, there's a liability regardless of how the damage occurs."
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,624.885,627.244,Let's see if I could get it this way.
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,662.059,664.245,"Yes, Your Honor although that's not the facts of this case."
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,664.245,664.544,I understand that but though --
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,664.544,666.332,But I would contend that there would be --
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,666.332,668.027,"Well now, tell me why."
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,668.027,672.893,"Because in that case Your Honor, the army once it took those buildings."
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,672.893,674.357,"Well, the question -- there you're (Voice Overlap) --"
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,674.357,677.225,I'm using taking not on the constitutional sense Mr. Justice Fortas.
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,677.225,678.328,"Well, they don't say it."
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,678.328,678.473,All right.
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,678.473,678.733,They never say --
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,678.733,680.206,Once the Army seized those buildings.
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,680.206,687.768,But once the army retired into those buildings as part of its protective operation.
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,687.768,698.509,"I would say there would be liability because by so doing under the established case law, it then makes -- exposes those buildings to special response on the part of the opposing forces."
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,698.509,735.114,"Oh, you're -- what you're saying then amounts to the proposition that in any riot situation, any building to which is physically occupied -- which is physically occupied by the military forces of the United States, problems within this category that is to say that the United States is liable for the damage inflicted upon that building by the attacking mob."
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,735.114,736.275,"I would say Mr. Justice Fortas, I --"
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,736.275,737.462,Isn't that (Voice Overlap) --
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,737.462,738.88,May I qualify that.
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,741.855,744.929,"Now, what -- now that -- this to me is a critical area."
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,744.929,745.469,Right.
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,745.469,752.922,And what do you -- do you think it constitutes a compensable taking in a riot situation in which you don't.
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,752.922,756.257,I would say the criteria would be as follows Mr. Justice Fortas.
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,827.355,831.372,"Well, these are not simple standards."
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,831.372,832.519,"No, Your Honor, and --"
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,832.519,846.082,"Now, let me just put this to you very simply, I'm -- because we're not engaged in what is entirely an academic exchange of verbal dialogue here."
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,912.835,916.758,I would say that is a compensable taking Mr. Justice Fortas.
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,920.668,930.632,And you can't -- if we should disagree with you on the case that I have put to you then we would have to disagree with you on the case submitted to us for adjudication.
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,930.632,935.685,Not necessarily Mr. Justice Fortas because I think this is a stronger case.
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,963.92,985.028,"Well, I may be wrong on this but by recollection of reading the documents here is that the damage to the Masonic building occurred after the troops had retired into that, after the YMCA building was set on fire."
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,985.028,985.568,"No, Your Honor."
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1016.564,1033.44,"Why don't you make the claim for that part of the damage inflicted in the -- those initial phases of the operation that was inflicted by the army, let us say by the exchange of civilities between the army and the mob?"
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1033.44,1047.034,"Well, because Your Honor, that damage to be precise if I may on the basis of the record, the damage -- the initial damage is all done by the rioters, a very little -- they have got in and they were looting the interiors of the buildings and the army moved them out."
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1049.666,1053.998,Let me ask you one more question and then I'll leave you alone.
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1086.219,1087.758,"Would not have been liable, Your Honor, because --"
1968.517,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1087.758,1089.523,"Then your submission, it would not?"
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1089.523,1092.319,"It would not because there's no use made of that building, Your Honor."
1968.517,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1112.219,1117.845,"But Mr. Jacks, do I understand that the army went there to protect these two buildings."
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1117.845,1125.548,It went there Mr. Justice Marshall for the purposes of clearing the rioters from the zone and protecting the zone in general.
1968.517,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1125.548,1126.965,Including those two buildings?
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1126.965,1128.792,"Including those two buildings, yes."
1968.517,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1128.792,1133.977,And the use of that building was for the same purpose?
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1133.977,1138.975,The use of the building we contend Mr. Justice Marshall was primarily to protect the troops.
1968.517,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1145.73,1152.983,"Well, if they had withdrawn the troops around -- from around that building, back down that street, what would happen to those two buildings?"
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1152.983,1155.061,"If they had been destroyed, there'd be no claim here, Your Honor, because there had been --"
1968.517,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1155.061,1157.579,"Well, wouldn't -- wouldn't they had been destroyed?"
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1157.579,1159.484,"Wouldn't -- it's not clear, it's not clear."
1968.517,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1159.869,1165.655,"Well, the -- either the Masonic Temple or the YMCA have troops?"
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1165.655,1166.314,Did either of them have --
1968.517,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1166.314,1166.823,Yes.
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1166.823,1167.975,"Yes, they did, Your Honor."
1968.517,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1167.975,1168.797,Both troops?
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1168.797,1170.66,Troops inside the buildings.
1968.517,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1170.763,1172.641,"Oh, I mean, they hire troops?"
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1172.641,1173.304,No.
1968.517,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1173.304,1175.161,"No, obviously they didn't."
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1180.709,1181.21,It's not --
1968.517,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1181.21,1188.57,"And if they had stayed outside of the building to protect the building, you have no claim."
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1194.941,1198.3,"May I rephrase my answer to that question, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1968.517,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1198.3,1199.767,It would help.
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1199.767,1204.734,I think that they withdrew into the buildings to protect the troops primarily.
1968.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1229.713,1244.04,"Well, what if they had retired behind the building so to keep the rioter -- the building between them and the rioters, and the rioters in the process of trying to shell or shoot the troops had destroyed the building?"
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1244.04,1247.142,"Then I would not be making the claim here today, Mr. Justice White."
1968.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1252.222,1256.636,But they were still using the building for protection.
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1256.636,1259.407,"In the facts of this case, I think that could be argued both way."
1968.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1276.914,1280.684,"But as long as it stands, you couldn't be covering it?"
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1280.684,1289.873,"Would not without overruling Caltex I believe in that case if they used -- if they sacrifice the buildings to protect the troops, but we of course we contend that's not the effect."
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1293.252,1294.027,You may Mr. Jacks.
1968.517,0,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,1294.027,1298.777,Thank you.
1968.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1298.777,1300.487,Mr. Strauss.
1968.517,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1300.487,1305.243,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.517,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1479.771,1481.659,I can't see Mr. Strauss. I can't see.
1968.517,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1481.659,1482.468,Excuse me.
1968.517,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1482.759,1484.697,You're between me and the chart.
1968.517,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1484.697,1503.49,"It was forced to fall back here where you can see there are not many buildings in general along the boundary, behind the railroad tracks and there are photographs in the exhibits of record in court, not reproduced in the joint appendix which show the bunker positions built with sandbags behind this railroad track."
1968.517,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1549.325,1564.793,"Oh, I suppose the army a month in advance of this trouble had said, “We foresee that there's going to be trouble and we therefore occupy these two buildings.”"
1968.517,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1564.793,1566.776,"Well, I think we have a much different case Justice Fortas."
1968.517,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1566.776,1576.038,"Do you think it might be -- I know it would be different and I appreciate you're agreeing with me, but would that be a compensable taking in the constitutional sense?"
1968.517,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1576.038,1577.674,I think it would be and I --
1968.517,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1577.674,1587.406,"And the -- that compense -- in the payment for that would have to cover the consequential damages, wouldn't it or would it?"
1968.517,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1587.406,1590.156,"It's not clear, the extent to which it would."
1968.517,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1608.286,1609.091,But suppose the --
1968.517,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1609.091,1610.35,But the --
1968.517,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1610.35,1642.098,"If the army a month in advance had occupied these building and the riots have occurred and the rioters had destroyed the building, do you think it's an open question as to whether the Government would have to pay the total cost of the building as distinguished from just compensation for use and occupancy without taking into account the damage done by the riots."
1968.517,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1642.098,1647.104,"The Government would be liable and if the Court concludes that there's a taking in this case, of course the Government would be liable (Voice Overlap) --"
1968.517,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1647.104,1648.489,"No, no, no, that's not my question."
1968.517,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1648.489,1649.707,"That's alright, I agree."
1968.517,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1649.707,1651.071,"The critical -- no, wait a minute --"
1968.517,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1651.071,1651.86,If I may say --
1968.517,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1651.86,1654.84,"Wait a minute, Mr. Strauss."
1968.517,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1670.468,1679.575,"It seems to me there would be a difficult factual question, but one which might possibly be resolved as to what damage would have occurred had the troops not been there."
1968.517,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1689.165,1707.277,"Well, I'm not sure that I would but you say you think the Government would be liable for the damage that occurred in the course of the riot unless such part of that damage as could be shown to be not attributable to Government occupancy."
1968.517,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1707.277,1711.117,"Well, if I may explain the basis on which I do that it seems to me you have --"
1968.517,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1711.117,1712.602,"Well, that's what you're saying is."
1968.517,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1712.602,1724.175,That's what I'm saying and I'm saying it because it seems to me you have your finger on the distinction which is crucial to the so-called target doctrine in which petitioners may rely.
1968.517,2,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,3175.74,3178.294,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1968.517,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3198.039,3201.077,What's your idea about how they decided to get there?
1968.517,2,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,3201.077,3203.884,"How the troops decided, you mean to take over these buildings?"
1968.517,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3203.884,3205.511,That's right.
1968.517,2,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,3205.511,3221.878,"The record is not clear as to when that choice occurred but it seems to me that it's apparent for -- hence to say that when the troops in the street in front of these buildings began to receive sniper fire and that it was a prudent decision to withdraw into these buildings, one."
1968.517,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3241.293,3243.616,Was there -- is there fact finding --
1968.517,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3243.616,3243.98,The facts in this --
1968.517,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3243.98,3247.663,-- what -- which states the reason why they withdrew into the building?
1968.517,2,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,3247.663,3248.147,Yes.
1968.517,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3248.147,3248.928,What is the fact finding?
1968.517,2,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,3248.928,3252.846,Mr. Justice Brennan the facts say as developed in three documents.
1968.517,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3273.498,3279.703,So there's in the way of a fact finding that they took the buildings in order to establish command posts?
1968.517,2,39622,ronald_a_jacks,,3279.703,3296.264,"Yes, the facts in this case are stipulated Your Honor on the basis of this formal presentations by the Government and those facts clearly show that is the Governments own version of the fact show that -- or admit that the buildings were taken as command post, observation post and initially seized to “protect the troops.”"
