2010.09-11328,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.48,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-11328, Davis v. United States."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,8.298,10.823,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-11328,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,102.986,103.536,Excuse me.
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,141.902,143.864,"--I disagree, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-11328,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,163.928,176.798,"Yes, but just to pursue Justice Scalia's point: The good faith rule is itself a rule that's intact, that's a precedent, that was on the books, and the good faith rule qualifies the exclusionary rule."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,179.64,180.27,The--
2010.09-11328,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,180.27,182.863,"I mean, there's nothing retroactive or prospective about it."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,185.872,187.668,"--I disagree, Justice Kennedy."
2010.09-11328,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,201.168,209.945,"Well, that's an application of -- that's a subset, it's one application, of the good faith rule, which is an overall principle."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,214.917,218.889,I think the Court needs to take away the labels here.
2010.09-11328,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,223.794,225.49,It's not a label at all.
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,253.452,270.71,"At the same time, Justice Scalia, whatever rule is applied in this case would have to be the same rule that applies in Gant itself, and without the incentive of counsel to argue in favor of the change in the law, that would block claims by defense attorneys to overturn the precedents of this Court."
2010.09-11328,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,270.71,275.729,"Well, Mr. Kerr, our cases have talked about the deterrence impact on police conduct."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,299.802,303.524,"Leon, I think, raised a different setting."
2010.09-11328,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,323.921,335.874,"Well, I think our -- our theory on the exclusionary rule across the board, without regard to the underlying substantive violation, is that you look to deterrence of police conduct."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,339.466,339.983,--Yes.
2010.09-11328,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,339.983,344.985,So what impact -- why do we want to deter them from doing what's right?
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,344.985,351.253,Because it takes two branches of government for the exclusionary rule to deter constitutional violations.
2010.09-11328,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,364.752,385.333,"Well, I understand your argument with respect to decisions of this Court, and I think that's your strongest argument, but would you concede that that argument does not apply when the precedent on which the police are relying is a decision of one of the courts of appeals or a State supreme court Fourth Amendment decision?"
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,393.927,398.066,"Justice Alito, I think it depends on what the good faith exception is."
2010.09-11328,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,426.907,439.693,"Well, it applied its understanding of Belton, which turned out to be different from the understanding of the Arizona Supreme Court in Gant and the understanding of at least four members of this Court when Gant got here."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,439.693,458.795,"At the same time, the Eleventh Circuit's development of the law was -- went no further than Belton itself, and this Court needs adversaries to make forthright arguments to this Court which may involve distinguishing precedent and may involve overturning precedent."
2010.09-11328,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,458.795,474.803,"If I could just come back to my question: Suppose you have a decision in one of the courts of appeals that says certain conduct is permitted under the Fourth Amendment, and the police in that circuit, Federal law enforcement officers in that circuit, follow that precedent."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,486.423,500.235,"If this Court adopts a good faith exception that is quite narrow and would not allow an officer in one circuit to reasonably rely on the clear circuit court decisions of another circuit, that's certainly a possibility."
2010.09-11328,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,517.16,528.53,"Mr. Kerr, the line that has been suggested by Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy, that is exactly the line that the Eleventh Circuit took; is it not the case?"
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,545.622,546.668,That's correct.
2010.09-11328,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,546.668,581.694,"And on your theory, I mean, there's another question in this case; that is, perhaps this evidence would come in under the inventory, as a -- as a legitimate inventory search, and if the Court decided that question, then -- then the question you're arguing, the exclusionary rule question, would have no practical consequences."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,594.564,597.952,"That issue, of course, has not been briefed in this case."
2010.09-11328,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,617.72,621.359,If I could just follow up on Justice Ginsburg's question.
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,645.682,650.487,"I agree that's never been the Court's law, and I think there's an important distinction to be made here."
2010.09-11328,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,660.994,661.994,"Well, it's often -- we do that."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,690.039,693.944,--But there's a big difference between a tough case and no case.
2010.09-11328,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,710.186,717.584,So your incentive argument really only holds up when the ground on the alternative ground is hopeless?
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,723.119,727.658,Hopeless meaning a zero percent chance of likelihood.
2010.09-11328,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,731.213,744.167,"Mr. Kerr, let's say I'm concerned about the kinds of issues that you're raise, the incentives on defense counsel and also the oddity of the Court deciding a case in which it's absolutely not possible to grant a remedy."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,760.441,775.433,"--I think Justice Harlan's answer to that is persuasive, that it's inconsistent with basic norms of constitutional adjudication to treat the first case differently from other cases not on -- other cases on direct review."
2010.09-11328,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,775.433,777.396,"I guess, Mr. Kerr, I'm not sure that that's right."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,830.394,838.255,"Justice Kagan, that was the precise premise of the Linkletter regime."
2010.09-11328,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,885.818,898.521,"With respect to the incentives that you're talking about, is there really much difference between what would apply in a case like this and what already applies in cases that fall under Krull?"
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,952.731,955.406,I think there are two differences.
2010.09-11328,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,984.202,985.332,"Well, we could leave that open here."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,1001.923,1018.311,"And yet I think your -- your hypothetical, your suggestion that perhaps the Court could adopt that standard, shows the difficulty of trying to craft a good faith exception that ends up running up against the Linkletter problem."
2010.09-11328,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1023.367,1034.773,"Essentially, is your argument essentially that we should distinguish never, which would be this case if your position is not right, and hardly ever."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,1035.57,1037.283,--That's correct.
2010.09-11328,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1051.412,1063.698,"Well, you might respond that the government's going to say, well, there's Monell that's in their brief, and you'll probably say that that's a weak substitute for a criminal defense attorney's doing it in the trial itself."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,1063.698,1064.994,It is a weak substitute.
2010.09-11328,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1078.66,1098.975,"Suppose we were concerned with the costs of your rule in the sense that Gant does have some exception for the safety of the officers, and I think you can read the case if there's some general safety considerations for not securing the car in a neighborhood rather than leave it by itself."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,1116.196,1117.993,I disagree.
2010.09-11328,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1158.62,1159.917,"Well, those cases were pending."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,1163.093,1172.303,"--In the closed cases, I'm not in any way challenging the traditional rule of Teague v. Layne and Stone v. Powell that the new rule is not available."
2010.09-11328,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1229.689,1248.441,"You're asking us for an exception to our general approach, assuming the general approach is not the one you succeed, for, as you put it, cases where there's zero possibility of success, while allowing application of the good faith precedent, even if the chances of success are remote."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,1260.31,1264.866,"Just to be clear, the Court has not applied the good faith exception in this setting."
2010.09-11328,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1274.439,1275.486,I understand your position on that.
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,1284.764,1291.828,"I don't foresee litigation on that point because, at least as I understand the government's rule, as soon as a defendant utters the phrase"
2010.09-11328,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1308.003,1310.466,Most lawyers don't take that position.
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,1325.725,1334.835,--In that circumstance I think the Court would be forced with issuing what -- forced to issue what may amount to an advisory opinion.
2010.09-11328,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1334.835,1347.334,"And it seems to me -- I mean, in terms of the incentives on the defense counsel, it would be an odd defense lawyer who is going to say you should consider argument A because my second argument has got zero chance of succeeding."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,1347.334,1360.585,"I think the incentive on defense counsel, if the government's rule is adopted, is to never argue that cases should be overturned, and instead make not terribly candid arguments to this Court that every case is distinguishable."
2010.09-11328,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1360.585,1364.276,"Mr. Kerr, I've been on the bench 30 years or so now."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,1381.481,1395.081,"Katz v. United States is perhaps a case worth focusing on, where the Court overturned the rule of Goldman and Olmstead that wiretapping does not implicate the Fourth Amendment."
2010.09-11328,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1417.721,1430.554,"There was still not the argument you should overrule the prior case, period, with no effort to show why you could come out that way without overruling the prior cases."
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,1431.42,1434.646,"Those arguments, I agree, Justice Scalia, are rare."
2010.09-11328,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.451,1439.747,--I'm saying they're nonexistent.
2010.09-11328,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1441.044,1443.423,The difference between zero and remote.
2010.09-11328,0,37484,orin_s_kerr,,1445.433,1454.876,"--Nonetheless, the incentive on counsel under the government's rule would be not to ever make the claim that a precedent should be overturned."
2010.09-11328,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1481.209,1482.088,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1485.931,1488.857,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-11328,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1529.418,1531.91,"Mr. Dreeben, what about Gant itself?"
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1552.558,1555.317,"Justice Ginsburg, let me give two responses to that."
2010.09-11328,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1593.869,1595.232,And how would you answer it?
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1603.176,1604.972,Gant obtained relief.
2010.09-11328,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1617.341,1618.721,Suppose -- suppose it had been raised?
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1618.721,1634.017,"The logic of our position would be that, to the extent that Gant was seeking Belton to be overruled, he would not be able to impugn the actions of the officers who relied on it."
2010.09-11328,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1666.051,1687.145,"Mr. Dreeben, do you think that if a lawyer did that, if a lawyer filed a cert petition and said you should overturn the following Fourth Amendment precedent, and that was all that was in the cert petition, would we be able to grant that cert petition knowing that there was no possibility of relief for that petitioner?"
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1687.145,1703.653,"Yes, Justice Kagan, I believe the Court could grant that petition, although it's highly likely that any criminal defendant who filed it would couple it with a claim that this Court should either reverse, modify, or limit any holding that came out."
2010.09-11328,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1703.653,1711.651,But you think that we would have appropriate Article III authority to decide that question without any hope of relief?
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1711.651,1727.856,"Certainly the Court would have Article III authority, because it's always free to limit, modify or abrogate one of its precedents, including a holding, if one issued from this decision, that the good faith rule applies when the Court overrules its decision."
2010.09-11328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1742.651,1759.66,"I assume if Petitioner says we should be able to overrule our prior substantive precedent, he should also logically say that we should be able to overrule our prior precedent regarding the exclusionary rule."
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1785.992,1790.298,"That's correct, Justice Scalia, and I think it illustrates why there is no Article III impediment."
2010.09-11328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1815.63,1822.565,"And if he asks for the double overruling that I just suggested, I guess there's some chance that the Court would do it?"
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1822.565,1826.537,"It would be remote, but not zero."
2010.09-11328,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1827.499,1836.194,You've just raised the question of qualified immunity and the similarities.
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1903.692,1910.506,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, we're not kind -- trying to come in through the back door with qualified immunity as a standard in this case."
2010.09-11328,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1935.096,1954.347,"So there's no value in your mind to the fact, as your adversary is saying -- I don't -- I haven't found one case previously by this Court where it has applied the good faith exception to the finding by the Court of a Fourth Amendment violation."
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1957.402,1960.911,Not directly under the exclusionary rule.
2010.09-11328,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1972.448,1978.483,"Well, what we're doing is sort of -- your adversary is right, we're returning to Linkletter, aren't we?"
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1983.818,1993.595,"Not returning to Linkletter, Justice Sotomayor, because Linkletter was an across-the-board rule that said that this Court had the authority to render--"
2010.09-11328,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1993.595,1995.142,I'm talking about what happened before then.
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1995.142,1998.068,--Before--
2010.09-11328,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1998.068,2002.389,We're going to have the exclusionary rule apply sometimes but not other times.
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2002.389,2030.73,"--That's true, but that's a direct consequence of the logic of the good faith exception itself; and the considerations that had informed this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence in the Peltier decision were taken out of the law of retroactivity when the Court decided Griffith v. Kentucky; but those same considerations became relevant to the good faith exception, which is tied to the question of whether there is a need to deter police misconduct because the police have disregarded the governing law."
2010.09-11328,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2030.73,2035.269,Is there -- is there anything to be said for simplicity?
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2084.478,2091.359,"Well, Justice Breyer, I think nine of the people who will understand it are on this Court."
2010.09-11328,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2091.359,2092.488,That's very optimistic.
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2093.868,2096.331,I'm an optimist.
2010.09-11328,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2096.331,2098.59,I don't think that--
2010.09-11328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2098.59,2100.053,"I don't think it's so complicated, counsel."
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2102.516,2105.162,The principle is very straightforward.
2010.09-11328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.097,2146.403,"Actually, why don't we just abolish the exclusionary rule?"
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2156.696,2159.705,--It would be an extremely simple system.
2010.09-11328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2159.705,2161.281,"You're not proposing that, though?"
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2161.281,2172.271,"Not in this case, because this case represents only an application of existing doctrine in the Court with respect to the purposes of the exclusionary rule."
2010.09-11328,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2172.271,2182.012,There is something ironic in your position that the defendant who lives in the circuit that is most clearly wrong is treated worst.
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2182.012,2188.279,The defendant in these cases is not the object of the Court's protection.
2010.09-11328,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2224.935,2235.258,"Well, if there's a circuit split, how do we encourage police officers to be careful about the Fourth Amendment?"
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2307.774,2313.625,"Justice Sotomayor, we don't expect police officers to attempt to define the content of the Fourth Amendment on their own."
2010.09-11328,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2338.161,2340.67,But they're going to be protected -- they're going to be protected from that--
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2340.67,2341.354,--Well--
2010.09-11328,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2341.354,2344.893,--meaning they're going to get qualified immunity from any personal liability.
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2344.893,2354.67,"--Yes, but the reason that the Fourth Amendment balance has been struck in any given way in a particular court is because that is felt to be the reasonable way for officers to operate."
2010.09-11328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2355.466,2371.975,"I assume that an officer when he goes out to do his job does not have primarily in mind not to get sued, but I think primarily in mind he wants to arrest somebody in such a manner that the person can be convicted of the crime that he's done, right?"
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2371.975,2373.604,"--Justice Scalia, that's exactly right."
2010.09-11328,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2449.509,2472.666,"Well, particularly in light of that, what is wrong with the suggestion that Justice Kagan raised in one of her questions about retaining an exception to the good faith exception for the situation, for the defendant whose case comes up here and results in the overruling of one of this Court's precedents?"
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2485.469,2490.386,"No, Justice Alito, there is nothing to prevent this Court from inventing that exception."
2010.09-11328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2573.226,2576.502,"I don't think we'd look particularly good, either, do you?"
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2595.27,2596.299,Yes.
2010.09-11328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2596.299,2602.15,"So I guess we would -- we would just grant the first and deny all the rest, even though they're raising the same issue?"
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2602.15,2604.463,I think the strongest argument against--
2010.09-11328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2604.463,2605.51,It doesn't smell very good.
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2605.51,2610.678,"--the proposal, Justice Scalia, would be an appearance of arbitrariness in the Court's actions."
2010.09-11328,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2610.678,2627.354,"So that's why, isn't it -- that's why the normal rule has been that the person litigating the case gets the advantage of the new rule, as do other people whose initial appeals are not final, and there we are."
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2645.824,2651.176,"Justice Breyer, it hasn't caused havoc, for several reasons."
2010.09-11328,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2709.146,2711.655,"--I would have thought it was more for this Court, actually, anyway."
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2738.404,2739.4,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-11328,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2739.4,2741.247,"And you want to change that, it seems to me."
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2741.247,2741.626,No.
2010.09-11328,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2745.932,2748.478,You're hiving off the -- the suppression.
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2749.191,2754.626,"--This Court has acknowledged that the exclusionary rule is not an individual right, it's a remedy."
2010.09-11328,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2801.772,2809.337,--Were we right that -- there were several cases that were TBR'd in light of Gant.
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2813.725,2831.947,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, before the litigation that occurred in the wake of Gant, there was only one precedent on the books in any circuit that I'm aware of that had applied the -- in the Federal system -- that had applied a good faith rule to overrule judicial decisions."
2010.09-11328,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3018.086,3045.214,"Would the rule that you're arguing for apply only in the situation where there is a binding precedent that affirmatively approves a particular police practice, or would it also apply in the situation in which there is simply absolutely nothing on the books that prohibits the police practice, so that a reasonable officer wouldn't have any reason to think that the practice was unconstitutional?"
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3045.214,3055.787,"This case, Justice Alito, only involves the example of binding appellate precedent, and Judge Kravitch's opinion for the Eleventh Circuit distinguished between the two situations."
2010.09-11328,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3096.165,3106.739,"She did say that if there is ambiguity, then the police must err on the side of not searching."
2010.09-11328,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3113.09,3119.905,"No, Justice Ginsburg, I would not submit to the Court that the United States necessarily agrees with that."
2010.09-11328,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3195.56,3196.76,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2010.09-11328,2,37484,orin_s_kerr,,3200.032,3200.999,Thank you.
2010.09-11328,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3246.844,3270.168,"In -- in -- in one -- in one sense if we're talking about costs, the rule the government proposes is -- is defendant friendly, in that this Court may be more willing to impose stricter rules under the Fourth Amendment, if it knows that the good faith rule will protect against the -- the costs of -- of overturning the conviction."
2010.09-11328,2,37484,orin_s_kerr,,3270.168,3272.131,"That's exactly right, Justice Kennedy."
2010.09-11328,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3317.017,3322.155,"But that could work to the benefit of defendants as a class, not the particular defendant?"
2010.09-11328,2,37484,orin_s_kerr,,3322.155,3325.878,"That works to the benefit of defendants as a class, absolutely."
2010.09-11328,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3457.122,3458.835,"Thank you, Mr. Kerr."
