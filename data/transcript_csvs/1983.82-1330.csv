1983.82-1330,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.667,We will hear arguments next in Thigpen against Roberts.
1983.82-1330,0,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,45.277,68.502,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the ultimate question which we are here about today is to resolve whether the respondent was denied his rights under the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment when he was indicted, tried, and convicted of manslaughter by culpable negligence."
1983.82-1330,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,112.279,117.528,"Mr. Boyd, may I ask about the law of Mississippi?"
1983.82-1330,0,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,122.386,125.479,The death occurred instantaneously with the accident.
1983.82-1330,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,125.479,125.931,Instantaneously?
1983.82-1330,0,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,125.931,126.353,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1330,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,126.353,134.131,"Well, in that circumstance under Mississippi law could the state have tried both the misdemeanor and the felony charges in one proceeding?"
1983.82-1330,0,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,134.131,134.974,"No, sir."
1983.82-1330,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,134.974,136.288,They could not?
1983.82-1330,0,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,136.288,136.85,"No, sir."
1983.82-1330,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,164.54,176.629,"Well, was there any Mississippi statute that required the trial of those charges, the misdemeanor charges, in the justice of the peace court independently of any other court?"
1983.82-1330,0,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,176.629,178.473,None that would require it.
1983.82-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,230.996,237.435,Are the misdemeanor offenses charged by indictment in Mississippi?
1983.82-1330,0,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,237.435,237.902,"No, ma'am."
1983.82-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,238.604,239.775,It is just a traffic citation?
1983.82-1330,0,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,240.885,241.478,"Yes, ma'am, that's exactly--"
1983.82-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.478,242.351,By the policeman?
1983.82-1330,0,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,242.351,243.272,--Um-hm.
1983.82-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.743,247.459,And how are felonies charged then in Mississippi?
1983.82-1330,0,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,248.879,255.489,--The constitution of the state of Mississippi requires that one be indicted for an offense.
1983.82-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,269.387,273.076,Mississippi doesn't use a preliminary hearing type?
1983.82-1330,0,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,273.076,278.29,There are preliminary hearings once someone is arrested on an arrest warrant.
1983.82-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,298.157,304.732,And this would be at the request of the county attorney or whoever the local prosecutor is for felons?
1983.82-1330,0,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,304.732,305.328,All right.
1983.82-1330,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,396.979,397.743,Excuse me.
1983.82-1330,0,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,407.378,410.72,--There is no statutory prohibition to it.
1983.82-1330,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,410.72,413.376,"Well, that would suggest that yes?"
1983.82-1330,0,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,413.376,413.984,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1330,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,413.984,415.376,That might have happened.
1983.82-1330,0,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,415.376,416.015,Yes.
1983.82-1330,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,416.015,416.889,But it did not happen.
1983.82-1330,0,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,416.889,417.283,It did not happen.
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,1741.428,1756.343,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as the Court knows, I appear as amicus curiae on invitation from the Court to present argument in support of the judgment of the Fifth Circuit."
1983.82-1330,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1808.824,1812.321,Would you need to prove death on the first charge?
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,1812.321,1814.458,"No, sir."
1983.82-1330,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1815.803,1817.285,Would you need to prove it on the second?
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,1817.285,1820.694,"--At the second, of course, Your Honor, you have got to prove death in the manslaughter."
1983.82-1330,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1820.694,1822.113,"Pretty big difference, isn't it?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,1822.113,1835.951,"No, sir, because at the second you have proved everything else that you proved at the first, and if we allow the state, as in this instance, to try a man, and I will get to this later... there was no guilty plea to my knowledge."
1983.82-1330,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1854.24,1859.146,You dismissed the death factor rather swiftly.
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,1859.146,1861.627,"No, sir, the death factor is a given."
1983.82-1330,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1883.557,1886.587,And the evidence is the same.
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,1886.587,1889.788,"Yes, sir, where the evidence is the same."
1983.82-1330,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1889.788,1890.287,The evidence is not the same here.
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,1890.287,1894.335,"It is the same, Your Honor, for the lesser included offense, if you want to call it that."
1983.82-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1908.78,1919.121,"Of course, Brown against Ohio, Mr. Barksdale, was two separate Ohio Circuit Court prosecutions, common pleas prosecutions."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,1930.523,1945.719,"Your Honor, I don't think it does, because you may have had two different... you had the court of Kihoba County and some other... Marion County in Ohio on those two offenses, but the JP Court is a separate court in that sense from the Justice Court."
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1985.389,1988.983,"Well, we don't need to reach it, but it must be reached by somebody."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,1990.621,1991.027,--That's correct.
1983.82-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2052.689,2058.64,"Well, Mr. Barksdale, again, I think the procedural thing may be complicated by terminology."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2071.477,2072.199,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2072.199,2077.069,"And yet I gather, what, a preliminary hearing in Mississippi is instituted by a complaining witness?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2077.069,2077.6,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2115.444,2116.852,What do you make of that?
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2120.334,2122.818,"Oh, I don't criticize Mr. Boyd, Your Honor."
1983.82-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2148.824,2158.615,"Does the preliminary hearing of the kind that you reported or show was held in August, is that prosecuted by a prosecuting attorney?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2158.615,2174.997,"Your Honor, I think under the general statutes it states, and we cite in our brief at Footnote 8 at Page 58 through 60 talking about the general powers a county attorney had back in 1977."
1983.82-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2184.605,2186.368,How about Mississippi practice?
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2191.882,2192.6,"Your Honor, I do not know."
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2243.643,2247.437,What difference would it make whether he pled guilty or was tried?
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2247.437,2249.419,"--Your Honor, I don't think it makes any difference."
1983.82-1330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2263.82,2270.726,"May I ask right there about the dismissal, the nolle pros of the charges later on?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2274.099,2277.878,"I don't agree it was without prejudice, Your Honor."
1983.82-1330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.875,2294.232,"I always thought that was a voluntary dismissal, and you could always reinstate charges that had been nolle prossed, but that is not your understanding?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2294.232,2296.026,"I don't have that understanding, Your Honor."
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2302.382,2310.864,"Well, there must be Mississippi law on that, Mr. Barksdale, whether a charge that has been nolle prossed can be filed again."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2317.236,2318.909,"--I don't know, Your Honor."
1983.82-1330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2329.593,2335.87,But that is the judgment that constitutes the bar to the second trial.
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2338.09,2338.916,"No, sir."
1983.82-1330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.256,2358.095,"And then as a matter of... in your two-stage trial proceeding, he had the right to have that judgment just set aside as though it had never occurred."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2358.095,2359.518,The judgment is set aside.
1983.82-1330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2362.126,2369.34,"And then they dismiss the trial de novo, and then the judgment that has been set aside is what bars a new prosecution."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2373.45,2379.666,"Your Honor, he was awaiting his trial de novo, new trial."
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2395.815,2403.827,You say the state's only option at that point was to try him again for the misdemeanors.
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2403.827,2406.857,"I believe they could have, Your Honor, if they had done so--"
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.857,2409.31,"Well, they could have, yes, but you say that was their only option."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2411.884,2413.12,--They couldn't try him for manslaughter.
1983.82-1330,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2441.407,2450.231,"But he could have been guilty of manslaughter on any one of those, wouldn't you agree?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2450.231,2451.37,"He certainly could have, Your Honor."
1983.82-1330,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2451.37,2461.209,But he could not have been found guilty in the second stage unless there was a demonstration that someone had been killed as a result of that.
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2461.209,2462.101,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.101,2478.469,"But the... I take it your submission is that under our cases, that if in proving him guilty of the larger offense they again proved the misdemeanors that he had already been convicted of, that was double jeopardy."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2478.469,2479.67,"That is our thinking, Your Honor."
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2481.545,2482.64,Brown and Harris.
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2482.64,2483.373,--Brown and Harris.
1983.82-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2505.941,2511.953,"What do you think the Court meant by that language, that he would have a substantial double jeopardy claim?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2518.922,2521.122,"Your Honor, I wish you would ask Justice White and tell me."
1983.82-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2522.123,2523.028,"Well, you work for him."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2523.028,2526.541,"To me, as we say in our brief--"
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2526.541,2527.621,You ought to ask the Court.
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2528.542,2544.784,"--To me, as we said in our brief, we thought that Justice White was using that dictum so that he wouldn't prejudge the case on remand to Illinois, and as the dissent said, they didn't know why it was called substantial double jeopardy."
1983.82-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2612.587,2622.286,What about the case of someone who might have been injured in the traffic accident in August and who dies in November?
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2641.885,2656.036,"Your Honor, of course, that is what some of the cases have addressed, where the Court has said you cannot try the lesser included offense and then try the greater unless at the original onset you couldn't have tried the lesser included."
1983.82-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2683.964,2695.865,"Well, under your same evidence theory, even on the example posed by Justice Rehnquist, you would say double jeopardy attaches."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2695.865,2704.394,"Yes, ma'am, I would, but I would like to point out, Justice O'Connor, I am not urging the same evidence test that is referred to in Blockburger."
1983.82-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2710.157,2711.234,"Well, you are talking about the language in Vitalli."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2711.234,2711.78,"Yes, ma'am."
1983.82-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2711.78,2714.608,That is unclear.
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2714.608,2718.842,"Well, it is clear to me."
1983.82-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2732.459,2743.486,"Well, now, the Fifth Circuit didn't decide the same crime test, did they, the lesser included offense?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2743.486,2744.594,"I think they did, Your Honor."
1983.82-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2760.528,2770.069,"Well, I thought the Fifth Circuit was uncertain about the first part of the Vitalli test, and therefore went on to look at the same evidence question."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2770.069,2770.49,"--Yes, ma'am."
1983.82-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2770.49,2771.005,Isn't that right?
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2771.005,2776.113,"The Fifth Circuit said it was uncertain whether they could apply this to the judicial veneer, but I don't know why they are uncertain."
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2866.937,2872.483,"Well, of course, whatever... that language in Vitalli couldn't have been any more than just a dictum."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2878.195,2886.848,The holding was that this Court said to the Illinois Supreme Court to take another look at it under Brown and Harris.
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2886.848,2890.786,"Well, Illinois said there was double jeopardy, and we reversed them and said at that point there wasn't."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2890.786,2893.582,"You reversed and remanded, Your Honor, to have them look at it again."
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2894.627,2895.5,"Nevertheless, we reversed them."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2900.204,2902.344,"--Yes, sir, but you sent it back for them to decide."
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2902.344,2909.652,"So whatever miscellaneous advice we might have given them later in the opinion wasn't a holding, was it?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2909.652,2911.341,"Your Honor, that wasn't miscellaneous advice."
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2917.448,2926.646,"I know, but you couldn't have just reversed them citing that line in Vitalli, that there was a substantial claim."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2930.878,2933.236,"You could have reversed them under Blockburger, and that would have been the end of it."
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2933.236,2937.924,"Well, we couldn't just reverse them citing that page in Vitalli."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,2946.28,2960.756,"The state here concedes, and I think it is extremely important, at Page 19 of its brief that the evidence necessary to prove the charge of reckless driving was introduced to establish manslaughter."
1983.82-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3016.077,3031.134,"Is it your position, Mr. Barksdale, that even though there is a different element in each statutory offense with which one is charged, if the same evidence is used to prove both, it is a violation of double jeopardy?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3031.134,3046.252,"Your Honor, if the same evidence is used to prove the factual elements of the lesser offense in order to prove the greater offense, then it is our contention that that is a violation of double jeopardy, notwithstanding additional elements will have to be proved, such as death."
1983.82-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3046.252,3070.62,"Well, supposing one is tried for, say, reckless driving, and found guilty by a jury of that on the grounds of recklessness, and then the same evidence is produced on the charge of intentional homicide, that the person actually intended to run the person over."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3088.893,3109.151,"Yes, sir, because they are again proving the same offense, and it is trying the man twice on the same evidence, and they have been allowed at the first trial to work on their case and sharpen up their case to use it again and to simply say to the jury if you find A, B, C, D, and E plus F, then you can convict him a second time."
1983.82-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3114.506,3119.036,"Well, it is not a question necessarily of what is necessary, but what the Constitution forbids."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3119.036,3119.645,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1330,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3126.176,3139.247,"In the cases where the key to it is whether additional evidence or different evidence must be used, what do you think the Court was driving at?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3149.32,3174.826,"Your Honor, under the Blockburger test, which talks of, if two offenses can be proved out of the same transaction, you look, does each offense require proof of a fact that the other does not, I think that is simply the court without the evidence before it on an interlocutory appeal or before trial is ever held saying, now, this is our best way to try to make sure there is no double jeopardy."
1983.82-1330,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3174.826,3178.277,Could they convict in the second case without showing that someone had been killed?
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3178.277,3179.541,"Oh, certainly not, Your Honor."
1983.82-1330,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3179.541,3183.726,Could they make the first case without proving someone had been killed?
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3183.726,3184.287,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1330,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3184.287,3186.568,"Well, then, isn't that quite a bit of different evidence?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3186.568,3191.396,"In the severity, it certainly is, Your Honor."
1983.82-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3203.342,3204.937,What was the offense?
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3208.903,3213.011,"Your Honor, the same offense the Fifth Circuit looked to and just simply went off reckless driving."
1983.82-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3213.011,3216.539,I am asking you what was the same offense?
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3216.539,3223.055,"To me the same offense were all four misdemeanors, Your Honor, reckless driving, driving without a license, driving under the influence, and driving--"
1983.82-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3223.055,3225.068,That is manslaughter?
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3225.068,3230.722,"--Because they used that and nothing else to prove manslaughter, that is double jeopardy, Your Honor."
1983.82-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3230.722,3231.534,They had to prove death.
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3236.891,3237.581,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1983.82-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3237.581,3242.982,"Was death, d-e-a-t-h, important in both?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3242.982,3246.311,"No, sir, it was not... it is certainly important in both cases."
1983.82-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3247.793,3249.041,They didn't even need it in the first one.
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3249.041,3249.576,"No, sir."
1983.82-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3249.576,3250.761,So there is a difference.
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3250.761,3258.619,"There is a difference of one additional element, Your Honor, but for the fact of what he was tried for in the first case, he was tried again in the second."
1983.82-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3258.619,3262.991,"Without that element, you couldn't have gotten the conviction."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3262.991,3263.88,"No, sir."
1983.82-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3282.842,3289.51,"Now, has Mr. Roberts ever even paid the fine that was levied at the first misdemeanor trial?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3289.51,3290.555,"Your Honor, I do not know."
1983.82-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3290.555,3295.367,Presumably that was set aside--
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3295.367,3296.178,That was set aside.
1983.82-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3296.178,3299.914,"--in his de novo appeal, so right now there is nothing, no penalty has been attached."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3299.914,3305.99,"Your Honor, all I know is what is in the record I was given, is that those were nolle prossed."
1983.82-1330,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3312.206,3316.516,"Is he out of jail now, ever since '82?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3316.516,3320.516,"--It is my understanding that he is, Your Honor, but I haven't confirmed that."
1983.82-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3323.514,3324.746,Was he ever in jail?
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3324.746,3325.37,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3325.37,3326.387,For what period of time?
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3326.387,3336.164,"I don't know whether he was out of jail on appeal, Your Honor, from the Mississippi Supreme Court, but he was certainly in jail for at least two years."
1983.82-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3342.505,3347.115,"From the time of affirmance by the Supreme Court of Mississippi until, what, the Fifth Circuit's ruling in this case?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3347.115,3368.822,"Your Honor, we look to the finding of a manslaughter conviction before the Circuit Court as the possible parameter, outside limit of four years in jail, which now in Mississippi if you manslaughter while intoxicated, the maximum sentence is five years, based upon the new statute that we refer to in our brief and that Mr. Roberts' attorney refers to in his brief."
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3391.658,3401.637,"So if you are wrong and the other side wins, what will happen to the gentleman on whose behalf you are speaking?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3401.637,3404.822,"Your Honor, I am not speaking on behalf of Mr. Roberts."
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3406.449,3406.964,Yes.
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3413.366,3413.85,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1330,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3428.298,3430.891,What about the Blackledge point?
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3430.891,3435.185,--I think the Blackledge issue this Court should address.
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3447.058,3450.072,That is a constitutional issue.
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3450.072,3455.427,"--Yes, sir, but it is a more difficult constitutional issue it appears than the Blackledge decision."
1983.82-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3473.592,3490.725,"Well, but why should the prophylactic rule set forth in Blackledge apply when you have two different prosecuting attorneys and presumably two different charging procedures and the timing is different on the charges?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3498.239,3515.374,"--Your Honor, the main reason is because the county prosecuting attorney who would be in charge of the Justice Court case is also the attorney that presents the charges to the grand jury, and so he is the one that makes that decision, will we indict, and that would be the prosecutorial vindictiveness that this Court--"
1983.82-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3515.374,3529.677,"Well, as I understood the responses to the questions earlier by Mr. Boyd, I thought that a district attorney was involved in the Circuit Court charging of felonies."
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3529.677,3530.539,--A district attorney--
1983.82-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3530.539,3531.459,Maybe I misunderstood.
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3531.459,3535.663,"--A district attorney is involved, but the county attorney is also involved."
1983.82-1330,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3554.03,3558.043,Who decides whether to present this case to the grand jury?
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3561.26,3570.883,"The district attorney would have that ultimate decision, Your Honor, in consultation obviously with the county attorney, who would obviously have a lot of influence with the district attorney because it is his county."
1983.82-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3570.883,3575.099,"But that is enough reason not to apply the prophylactic rule in Blackledge, isn't it?"
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3575.099,3580.426,"I don't see a distinction, because as stated it is the county attorney's county."
1983.82-1330,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3597.857,3602.759,Wouldn't you be making the same argument even if the county attorney were not involved?
1983.82-1330,1,38758,rhesa_h_barksdale,,3602.759,3608.224,"I would be making the same argument, Your Honor, but I don't think it would be as persuasive."
1983.82-1330,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3621.753,3624.938,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Boyd?"
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3626.498,3629.466,"Yes, sir, I have just a couple of comments."
1983.82-1330,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3641.914,3643.244,Except it is really the grand jury.
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3643.244,3645.182,"Yes, sir, except for really it is the grand jury."
1983.82-1330,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3705.873,3728.302,"Well, suppose a defendant is convicted of robbery and then the state indicts him for felony murder, and the proof offered is that the underlying felony is robbery, and it is the same robbery that they just convicted him of, but they prove the robbery, and then they prove death."
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3732.892,3736.488,"I believe it was Hicks, Your Honor."
1983.82-1330,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3737.221,3737.736,Harris.
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3737.736,3738.438,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1330,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3738.438,3738.812,Harris.
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3738.812,3742.625,"That was also in, I believe, Whalen."
1983.82-1330,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3742.625,3757.963,"And the rationale is that they have convicted him of the underlying felony, and if that is what they prove in proving felony murder, they have violated his double jeopardy rights?"
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3757.963,3758.571,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1330,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3758.571,3759.414,Isn't that what we have held?
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3759.414,3764.085,"That is what this Court has held, but I think that case is distinguishable from this case--"
1983.82-1330,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3764.085,3765.224,That is what I am interested in.
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3765.224,3775.128,"--because, one, you do not have to prove in manslaughter by culpable negligence that a vehicle was recklessly driven."
1983.82-1330,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3775.128,3777.219,"I know, but you are going to."
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3777.219,3777.659,But you can.
1983.82-1330,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3777.659,3778.314,But you did.
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3778.314,3784.39,"Yes, sir, I understand that, but that's not what this Court has in my opinion articulated as the test."
1983.82-1330,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3792.574,3802.476,"Well, in Harris, you didn't need to prove a robbery to prove felony murder."
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3811.517,3816.018,"Robbery was a part of felony murder at that time by definition, I believe."
1983.82-1330,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3816.018,3816.626,"Well, not really."
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3819.563,3821.248,I see my time is up.
1983.82-1330,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3821.248,3827.744,"I would like to ask a question before you sit down, please, about the preliminary hearing that was held in Justice Court--"
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3827.744,3828.309,"Yes, ma'am."
1983.82-1330,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3828.309,3830.7,--in August on the manslaughter charge.
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3830.7,3833.29,We don't know that it was held in August.
1983.82-1330,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3842.602,3845.534,Why would a preliminary hearing have been held on the manslaughter charge?
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3846.318,3848.112,"I don't know, Your Honor."
1983.82-1330,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3854.845,3856.14,"Well, you know why it was held."
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3860.453,3863.67,I do not know when Mr. Roberts was--
1983.82-1330,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3863.67,3864.107,"Well, I know."
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3869.087,3881.039,"--Your Honor, there is no requirement... there is a requirement that the defendant be taken before a committing magistrate, but there is no requirement that a preliminary hearing be given such as in Coleman."
1983.82-1330,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3895.529,3897.529,But he would have been out of jail meanwhile.
1983.82-1330,2,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,3897.529,3898.371,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1330,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3898.371,3899.323,Yes.
1983.82-1330,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3899.323,3900.337,"Thank you, gentlemen."
