1972.72-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,21.415,"-- first this morning in 72-90, United States against Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad."
1972.72-90,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,29.855,34.528,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1972.72-90,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,478.378,485.535,As a matter of terminology both highway under crossing and highway over crossing could refer to the railroad structures.
1972.72-90,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,486.984,495.109,"I think it is right, they could Mr. Justice Rehnquist and in that connection, it may have been hasty of us to assume that it referred to highway structures."
1972.72-90,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,623.372,630.006,"Mr. Stone, there are other cases backed up behind this one, aren't there, involving other railroads?"
1972.72-90,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,630.006,631.815,"Yes, there are Mr. Justice Blackmun?"
1972.72-90,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,631.815,637.157,Do those cases have a terms letter wriggle to as this one does?
1972.72-90,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,637.157,646.077,"I’m not sure whether all of them do Mr. Justice Blackmun, but if -- I am told that the terms letter agreements were very widespread in the railroad industry."
1972.72-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1934.437,1936.543,Thank you Mr. Stone.
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,1939.893,1942.951,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2029.099,2039.246,"In the Detroit Edison case, did the utility company have the obligation to maintain and if necessary replace those power lines or doesn’t that appear in this opinion?"
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2039.246,2056.043,"I don’t believe it appears Mr. Justice Stewart, but I think it probably could be assumed if they want to continue in business that they would have to replace this facility although, it was not part of the agreement between the prospective customer and the Detroit Edison company."
1972.72-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2056.043,2059.956,But the lines became the property of the utility company of the Detroit Edison?
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2059.956,2060.819,Yes they did Mr. Justice.
1972.72-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2060.819,2066.69,"Presumably, they had the same obligations as your client does in this case, didn’t he?"
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2066.69,2067.168,They had --
1972.72-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2067.168,2072.125,"And in nay event the Court did not put any weight on that at all, didn’t even mentioned it?"
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2072.125,2089.507,"Not in the Detroit Edison case Mr. Justice, but we feel that the legal obligation and the practical obligation of replacement that we have makes our case more persuasive for justifying a claim for depreciation deductions on 113 (a) (8) (B) than the Brown Shoe case."
1972.72-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2089.507,2106.944,"Well, the point is that exactly the same obligation might have existed in the Detroit, so far we know did exist in the Detroit Edison case and yet the Court did not as I say, find that if it were true find it persuasive at all?"
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2106.944,2113.853,"No, because of the overriding considerations that the payments from the prospective customers in Detroit Edison."
1972.72-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2113.853,2115.507,Were part of this cost of services?
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2115.507,2116.089,Right.
1972.72-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2116.089,2117.306,And part of the prices --
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2117.306,2121.77,Yes that’s true.
1972.72-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2121.77,2135.815,"Rightly or wrongly, the Court does not seem in other words in either case, neither Detroit Edison nor Brown Shoe to have considered the fact that you are not talking about as dispositive either way, isn’t that true?"
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2155.339,2165.945,We feel that the teaching of the Brown Shoe case was that the contributions made by the local citizen proves to the Brown Shoe Company was to benefit the public at large.
1972.72-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2165.945,2166.137,Right.
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2166.137,2168.992,"In other words, the -- to create additional job opportunities with --"
1972.72-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2168.992,2170.083,Through Brown Shoe?
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2170.083,2170.994,Yes.
1972.72-90,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2252.133,2275.394,"Mr. Schreiber, I’m not sure it is important or even relevant but in recent times at least spur tracks off the railroad yard running into an industry to pick up their freight have been constructed at the cost by the railroad, that the cost of the industry."
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2282.006,2283.553,Well --
1972.72-90,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2283.553,2284.831,Industry tracks?
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2284.831,2309.818,The industry tracks if the payment is made initially by the prospective customer without any right of reimbursement that money would never appear in the respondent’s accounts because it is assumed that the prospect of customers paying for that right to have the track in there to serve his business.
1972.72-90,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2309.818,2311.756,Isn’t that quite a bit like Detroit Edison?
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2311.756,2316.022,"That is more like Detroit Edison than the instant fact situation, yes Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.72-90,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2316.022,2318.166,And how do you -- how would distinguish it?
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2324.084,2326.538,The spur track situation?
1972.72-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2407.543,2410.91,"If a spur track is constructed, who owns it?"
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2413.402,2422.784,The title would be dependent on whether or not the track was certainly on the prospective customer’s property or whether it was on railroad right of way.
1972.72-90,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2440.551,2444.757,"But some part of it is always on the right of way of the railroad, is it not?"
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2444.757,2449.543,"Probably the lead in Mr. Chief Justice, would be in order to get in to the property line."
1972.72-90,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2449.543,2454.791,But the railroads don’t claim any depreciation for that part?
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2454.791,2470.171,"Well, the prospective company would only be paying for the track that’s located on its property, in other words, a side track up to a door inside of its building in order to serve that particular company."
1972.72-90,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2484.524,2507.053,"What happens if 50 years from now, that viaduct of such and such road collapses, and just wears out, and several of them wear off, and rail roads comes in and says we can’t afford to build it, to rebuild it and the Government said, “Okay, we’ll do like we did before, we’ll give you the money?”"
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2507.053,2513.521,Maybe in regard to the possible reconstruction of the bridges and crossing signal protection devices?
1972.72-90,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2525.736,2530.57,Could the Government -- could the Government deduct from what they gave you?
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2535.857,2543.102,Could they Mr. Justice I don’t have the answer to that question whether they could or not if like congressional act --
1972.72-90,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2543.102,2547.017,"So, it would it be fair for them to do that?"
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2547.017,2566.299,"From the standpoint and the perspective of fairness, it might very well be fair and reasonable if at some future date due to a collapse of a particular railroad the obligation was placed back on the Government to replace these facilities to offset the depreciation deductions claimed."
1972.72-90,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2568.593,2572.283,"By that time all that money is gone, right?"
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2572.283,2572.891,Pardon me?
1972.72-90,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2572.891,2580.993,"By that time all the depreciation money that you got back has gone now, isn't it, 50 years from now?"
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2580.993,2585.765,"Well, it’s gone in the sense that it was available to the tax payer."
1972.72-90,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2594.962,2603.708,"I didn't mean bankrupt, I mean it was scooping along as it was in the 60’s?"
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2603.708,2606.164,"Well, as long as its still viable --"
1972.72-90,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2606.164,2612.41,"Well you have to go to a Federal Government to get the money, didn’t you and you weren’t bankrupt, am I right?"
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2612.41,2627.846,"This, the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1933 and the subsequent amendments there to were provided for the primary purpose of benefiting the public by enlarging a highway network and also to provide these safety facilities that --"
1972.72-90,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2627.846,2636.033,What is -- the taxpayer has taken money for depreciation benefiting the public?
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2636.033,2643.776,The taxpayer claiming his legitimate right to depreciation deductions is exercising the rights as provided by statute.
1972.72-90,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2643.776,2646.096,"But it isn't benefiting the public, is it?"
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2646.096,2652.354,But the project itself has the primary purpose to benefit the public although that is true.
1972.72-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2659.473,2666.643,You I think started to say something else in response to my question.
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2666.643,2668.634,In regards to the track itself.
1972.72-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2684.753,2687.279,Railroad tracks are not depreciable?
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2687.279,2694.201,"Under straight-line depreciation. They are under retirement accountings, Mr. Justice."
1972.72-90,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2800.297,2811.744,"Is there one difference that in Brown Shoe, perhaps the industry would not have come into the area at all except the contribution?"
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2811.744,2813.821,That’s correct Mr. Chief Justice that the –
1972.72-90,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2813.821,2815.678,Not true here?
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2815.678,2823.125,"That’s not the same factual situation here because we had this preexisting legal obligation to construct these facilities, yes sir?"
1972.72-90,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2823.125,2827.405,So you didn’t have any option about it that Brown Shoe had?
1972.72-90,1,40468,richard_schreiber,,2827.405,2837.185,That’s why we feel Mr. Chief Justice that the facts in this case are more persuasive to justify a claim under Section 113 (a) (8) (B).
1972.72-90,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3363.467,3365.206,Thank you Mr. Schreiber.
