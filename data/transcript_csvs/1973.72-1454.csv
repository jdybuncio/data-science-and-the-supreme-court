1973.72-1454,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.081,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-1454, Davis against The United States."
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,14.176,20.905,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.72-1454,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,236.94,246.986,What if we disagree to the Court of Appeals that 2255 -- on the availability of 2255 in these circumstances?
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,252.183,283.523,"That is certainly a possible solution Mr. Justice White, but I respectfully suggest that since that if Fox is the law and if Fox is correct, that a remand would be an unnecessary waste of judicial time on the part of the Ninth Circuit, and perhaps I even fear to think on the part of this Court, because this case has been in the Ninth Circuit on three occasions and these very arguments were brought to the attention of the Ninth Circuit."
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,294.403,301.879,"Has the Ninth Circuit continued to follow Fox since the Fox decision, conceding it beside this case?"
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,301.879,310.594,"Your Honor, we cite in our brief the one or two Ninth Circuit decisions which cite and follow Fox and we find no others and none depart from it."
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,325.439,326.154,The son of Gutknecht?
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,326.154,327.441,Yes.
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,327.441,332.17,"Okay, and so the Attorney now can prosecute him for refusing an order to take a physical exam?"
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,332.17,339.292,"Yes Your Honor, yes Your Honor which of course is the very gist of the constitutional defect in the prosecution here."
1973.72-1454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,345.396,353.579,I thought that maybe the Ninth Circuit was ruling that Fox would not be retroactive?
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,353.579,356.95,It is hard to gleam that from the Ninth Circuit’s --
1973.72-1454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,356.95,361.174,You didn’t say that [Voice Overlap].
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,361.174,380.958,"The Ninth Circuit to the extent that it said anything in the brief opinion which is reprinted in the appendix said that they do not agree that Fox changed the law, and it also made the species I respectfully suggest of the case argument."
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,392.128,393.262,Since the kind of a situation?
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,393.262,403.632,"Yes Your Honor, and in our reply brief, we recite the statement of facts from Zack against Benson which makes this clear and I am sure the Government won’t contest it."
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,403.632,408.885,What have the other Circuit’s done with the Fox if anything --
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,408.885,437.446,"Your Honor, the Fifth Circuit in the Batiste case presaged Fox, presaged the Ninth Circuit and announced the same kind of per se decision, reasoning from this Court’s decision in Gutknecht that even though it might be interesting to speculate on whether or not there was acceleration in fact, we believe that Gutknecht requires us to hold that any delinquency based induction order is per se invalid, that is the decision of the Fifth Circuit in Batiste."
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,455.4,455.972,In fact?
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,455.972,456.565,Yes.
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,477.466,484.698,"But except for Fox, Batiste, Dobie, except for Batiste and Dobie in those two circuits, the other circuits haven’t dealt with it?"
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,484.698,485.113,No Your Honor.
1973.72-1454,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,615.945,622.908,"Whatever the cause, he managed for more than two years to avoid taking the physical --"
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,622.908,625.337,We don’t know Mr. Justice Powell on the facts and the record show that.
1973.72-1454,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,625.337,626.742,The fact is he had record (Voice Overlap)
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,626.742,627.938,Although ordered to do so.
1973.72-1454,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,627.938,632.894,Although ordered to do so and although the notices was sent to the address given by him.
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,636.403,646.377,"Mr. Justice Powell, it is also a crime to violate the Selective Service regulation that requires one to keep the Selective Service board informed of current address."
1973.72-1454,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,683.374,684.95,I understand your legal position.
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,694.477,717.738,"The only I can say in response to that Mr. Justice Powell is that since there was never hearing, since there was never any due process determination, indeed, there was never even any quasi due process determination, I don’t think it’s really fair to speculate that he avoided the draft or that he had good and bona fide reasons for not responding to those notices, because no finding was ever made."
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,717.738,728.443,"Well, what would be a good and bona fide (Inaudible) on a wild goose chase, but what would be a good and bona fide reason for not responding to a direction to take a physical exam?"
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,728.443,730.995,"Oh, I presume --"
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,730.995,732.194,In fact or in law?
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,732.194,733.848,I presume illness.
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,739.389,740.632,For two years?
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,740.632,749.49,"Well, I presume that of boards often -- boards often postponed physicals upon the request of the registrant."
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,749.49,753.225,But this board didn’t get any request?
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,753.225,753.66,I’m sorry.
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,753.66,755.133,It didn’t get any request from the registrant?
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,755.133,755.598,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,755.598,760.17,Just got his absence.
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,760.17,763.975,I submit that this is not the brunt of --
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,763.975,766.52,"No, I know it isn’t."
1973.72-1454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,766.52,768.033,"Actually, it has nothing to do with the issue."
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,768.033,768.641,"No, it doesn’t."
1973.72-1454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,768.641,771.512,"Well, we cover enough the one we have to face there but --"
1973.72-1454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,771.512,777.146,"Well, probably be hearing because you’re accustomed to answer questions that are put to you by the court, aren’t you?"
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,777.146,781.567,I try to as best I can Your Honor.
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,917.031,926.805,"Is there some difference of opinion between you and your brother as to whether the Gutknecht was a constitutional decision, that is a decision based upon a constitutional violation?"
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,926.805,931.549,There is a considerable difference and it’s precisely the point that I’m about to address Mr. Justice Stewart.
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,931.549,932.785,"Okay, fine."
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,932.785,959.077,"It is our view, and this perhaps is the fundamental question in this case, though it’s very hard to find what’s the fundamental question that the Government’s argument that Section 2255 relief is only available if there is a denial of a fundamental constitutional right and that there was no such denial here, totally mis-characterizes and minimizes the holdings in Gutknecht and in Fox."
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,976.191,981.114,"Because there were not authorized by the statute to do so, was that it?"
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,981.114,986.015,Because they’re not authorized by -- because neither the President nor the Selective Service System are authorized by Congress to do so.
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,986.015,987.411,"Right, that was the basic holding."
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,987.411,988.825,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1454,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1006.803,1010.773,"What if it wasn’t the constitutional holding, does it make it any difference?"
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1010.773,1014.697,There are members of this Court Your Honor and distinct --
1973.72-1454,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1014.697,1017.028,What’s your position?
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1017.028,1017.64,Your Honor?
1973.72-1454,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1017.64,1018.891,What’s your position?
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1018.891,1021.145,My position is that it does not make any difference.
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1022.705,1027.131,"Or our position too, you have two positions if you want [Voice Overlap]?"
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1027.131,1028.079,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1155.048,1165.23,"I thought Panama Refining turned on delegation in the absence of standards, was it a constitutional holding?"
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1165.23,1176.849,"Mr. Chief Justice, you recited Article I, Section 1, and we have extracted what we believe is a fair summary and quotation from that opinion in a reply brief which we’ve just recently filed Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1973.72-1454,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1413.301,1417.737,Which is what the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said I take it?
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1417.737,1419.709,"May it please the Court, I just don’t know what the Court of Appeals --"
1973.72-1454,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1419.709,1423.034,At least they said it wasn’t available because of some idea of law of the case?
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1423.034,1424.121,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1426.524,1427.946,I dispose that idea.
1973.72-1454,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1427.946,1435.779,"I don’t think so, but there is -- as we note in our reply brief, they seem to sneak it in somewhere towards the end of their brief as a partial reason."
1973.72-1454,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1466.846,1491.738,"I think, we’ll not ask you to start for one minute, counsel we'll resume after lunch.[Luncheon Recess]"
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,1494.244,1499.171,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.0,1715.919,"I take that you’re talking about the availability of 2255 no matter what the issue is, if it’s once has been decided on appeal?"
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,1715.919,1721.784,These are general policy reasons why 2255 is narrowly available.
1973.72-1454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1721.784,1726.273,"We have to retreat from some cases to be with, wouldn’t we?"
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,1726.273,1729.475,No sir.
1973.72-1454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1766.47,1773.482,So you do make -- I ask you a question whether you would distinguish between various issues and you now say you would?
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,1773.482,1775.459,"Oh, I must -- I misunderstood."
1973.72-1454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1782.705,1787.545,And you would treat 2255 and habeas corpus together for this purpose?
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,1787.545,1788.171,Yes.
1973.72-1454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1788.171,1792.713,And right out the words or read out the words laws of the United States?
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,1792.713,1794.299,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-1454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1794.771,1797.038,About what ones do you say?
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,1797.038,1809.374,"The Section reads a prisoner in custody under sentence of a court, claiming the right to be released upon the ground of the sentence was imposed in violation of the constitution or laws of the United States."
1973.72-1454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1809.374,1811.808,And the habeas statute has comparable --
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,1811.808,1813.163,That the habeas statute has comparable --
1973.72-1454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1813.163,1815.982,Such as they are detained by a state in violation of the laws?
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,1815.982,1822.91,"That’s correct, and not a sentence of a court which is imposed after error in the trial."
1973.72-1454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1822.91,1826.782,You distinguish that from detention and violation of the constitutional laws in the habeas statute?
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,1826.782,1829.897,"No, the sentence itself is not illegal."
1973.72-1454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1864.79,1869.728,[Voice overlap] adopted by this Court -- sent to the Congress by this Court?
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,1869.728,1874.708,Sent to the Congress by this Court after this Court approved them.
1973.72-1454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1876.005,1881.29,"[Voice overlap] transmitted to them, it couldn’t approve."
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,1881.29,1881.982,"Well, --"
1973.72-1454,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1881.982,1885.844,Let’s continue the debate counsel what you probably can’t solve here.
1973.72-1454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1885.844,1890.166,That’s a house -- that’s a house debate.
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,1890.166,1894.529,The Congress has ceded in the rules as transmitted by the Court --
1973.72-1454,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1894.529,1895.343,Right.
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,1895.343,1923.491,"-- and the rules provide in Rule 33, in the motion for new trial which is the great traditional method for correction of errors after judgment in the trial court that errors or in allegations the discovery of new evidence when relief is sought under Rule 33, release should be sought within two years, and that as to all other errors, relief should be sought within seven days."
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2009.36,2012.245,Mr. Justice Powell dissented in Schneckloth?
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2012.245,2013.076,Quite correct.
1973.72-1454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2045.02,2052.284,"Well, your proposition is that habeas corpus in 2255 are fundamentally the same for this purpose?"
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2052.284,2053.786,Yes.
1973.72-1454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.786,2071.362,"State criminal trial, constitutional issue presented the state court denied conviction, conviction sustained and constitutional question decided adversely in the State Supreme Court. Petition for certiorari here denied."
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2078.42,2082.784,"No, because it’s been litigated before."
1973.72-1454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.784,2083.965,Yes.
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2083.965,2084.821,In the state court?
1973.72-1454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2084.821,2085.661,Yes.
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2085.661,2091.905,"No, we do not rely upon the aspect of the prior litigation of the issue."
1973.72-1454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.001,2097.583,Would you think the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit did?
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2097.583,2101.112,Their opinion is enigmatic and brief.
1973.72-1454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2102.992,2105.002,You disown that then?
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2105.002,2119.623,"To that, we do not rely upon the theory and the reason is that we feel that here or there has been a vigorous and effective effort to pursue all remedies."
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2597.365,2605.419,"It is Mr. Kitch a criminal offense or it’s a criminal offense to willfully fail to report for a physical examination, is it not?"
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2605.419,2607.121,That is correct.
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2607.121,2616.638,And is that an offense of the same gravity in terms of the permissible punishment as the offense of failing to report for induction?
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2616.638,2627.206,"Yes, it is my understanding that it’s all under the same Section of the statute 462 which does provide for generally -- generally for violations Selective Service regulation."
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2627.206,2640.062,"So if Fox remains the law, the Government could simply bring the charge of failing to report of the physical examination, couldn’t it?"
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2640.062,2661.072,"Well, I think that we could do that or we could -- we really have no problem after the amendment of the regulations in 1970 which eliminated the category of delinquency as a basis for issuing an induction order without a pre-induction physical."
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2673.029,2684.855,"But wouldn’t it -- with or without a declaration of delinquency, would it be procedurally proper to order a man for induction who haven’t been given a physical examination in the present --"
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2684.855,2685.643,Yes.
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2685.643,2686.302,It wouldn't?
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2686.302,2686.578,Yes.
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2686.578,2687.297,It is?
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2687.297,2689.223,Yes.
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2690.578,2698.418,Quite apart from whether or not he disregarded a direction to show up for a physical?
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2698.418,2722.893,The amendment regulation is reprinted in our brief at page -- on page 7.
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2722.893,2724.472,7?
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2724.472,2739.865,"“Notwithstanding any other provision when a registrant classified Class 1-A and so on has refused or otherwise failed to comply with an order report for and submit to an Armed Forces physical exam, he maybe selected in order to report for induction even though he is not been found acceptable.”"
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2746.723,2749.495,"Whoever refused, who have refused, but my question is can --"
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2749.495,2751.766,It is not a sole declaration of delinquency.
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2754.92,2757.85,"But it’s basically the same provision, isn’t it in substance?"
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2757.85,2759.29,"Yes, precisely."
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2759.29,2773.567,"And -- but for a person who hasn’t refused, it violates the procedures of the Selective Service Act to call a person for induction who has not been even asked to have physical examination, is that correct?"
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2773.567,2776.046,"That is correct, yes, yes, and --"
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2776.046,2777.454,And that continues to be true.
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2777.454,2778.456,That continues to be true.
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2778.456,2780.874,As it was true at the time of --
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2780.874,2781.498,Yes.
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2781.498,2794.69,"-- of Mr. Davis’ induction and it continues to be true that as it was at the time of his induction that if a person refuses a physical examination, he can then nevertheless be called for induction."
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2797.877,2808.437,"Right and therefore, we don’t have the argument that relying -- the argument can’t be made relying upon delinquency regulations under Gutknecht as a precondition for issuance of the order."
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2809.317,2817.334,"That continues to be true, therefore now as it was then that the Government been prosecuting for refusal to report for a physical examination."
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2817.334,2818.591,That is also true.
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2818.591,2823.334,And that carries the same penalty you’ve just told me as a refusal to report for induction?
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2823.334,2824.976,Right.
1973.72-1454,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2849.703,2850.117,Mr. Kitch --
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2850.117,2861.76,"Now -- but, I think is important to emphasize that under that the pre-amended procedure, the pre-Gutknecht procedure and the procedure now, the physical is still given before induction occurs."
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2884.585,2893.294,And then he cannot be prosecuted I suppose if he’s found physically disabled.
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2901.465,2914.514,"No, he could be prosecuted for that if it was within the statute limitations, but I believe it’s our policy not to prosecute for that offense alone where he has appeared for induction and then defendant that --"
1973.72-1454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2914.514,2916.175,And doesn’t pass his physical.
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2916.175,2918.55,That’s right.
1973.72-1454,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2976.118,2979.658,I think you answered the question I had in mind.
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2990.96,2992.315,That is correct.
1973.72-1454,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2992.315,2994.051,The District Judge so found.
1973.72-1454,1,22612,edmund_w_kitch,,2994.051,3000.564,"Yes, he did and that is provided for in the Armed Forces regulation."
1973.72-1454,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3129.262,3132.77,You have about six minutes left Mr. Karpatkin.
1973.72-1454,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3132.77,3144.586,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
