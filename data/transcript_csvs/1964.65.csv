1964.65,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2322.414,2331.12,Do you have an evidence of one man back at 1950 or 1939 or when it was he was thought to be a member of the party?
1964.65,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,2331.12,2333.481,"Well, I think the holding of the Board and the Court."

1964.65,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,2381.885,2382.156,Well no.
1964.65,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2410.792,2411.081,Would the appellant --
1964.65,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,2411.081,2429.009,-- I think we get a better picture of the reasonableness of that inference if I could just carry through for four or five minutes and give some of the additional extensive evidence that this Court -- that the Board did rely on in making its ultimate determination.
1964.65,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2429.009,2439.85,Well will you -- will you differentiate between that evidence that you rely on before 1950 and that between 1950 and 1954?

1964.65,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2452.184,2455.169,Thank you.
1964.65,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,2455.169,2468.908,"Now, as I indicated, there is also extensive evidence here that Earl Browder constantly reiterated that the Abraham Lincoln Brigade was a party responsibility."
1964.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2552.521,2553.432,Of the record?
1964.65,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,2553.432,2555.843,Of the record.
1964.65,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2609.249,2610.534,Who made that speech?
1964.65,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,2610.534,2618.403,"Mr. Robert Minor who at that time was a member of the Politburo, the central committee of the Communist Party of United States."
1964.65,2,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3907.93,3910.853,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.65,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3976.815,3978.38,What pages of your brief did you just say?
1964.65,2,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3978.939,3984.202,"46, and then it refers back to this kind of material few pages earlier but it gives a --"
1964.65,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3984.202,3985.189,40 to 46?
1964.65,2,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3985.189,3989.556,"40 to 46, that's right."
1964.65,3,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,4913.892,4921.898,We also think it comes quite close to deciding the case for different reasons.
1964.65,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4972.927,4993.496,"Mr. Boudin, isn't that the argument that you gave, did the Government shows in pertinent evidence that the Communist Party set out (Inaudible) for these specific purposes of carrying out their activities through defending their members and others."
1964.65,3,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,4993.496,4995.675,That would present a completely different problem Mr. Justice Goldberg.
1964.65,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4995.675,4998.025,"Well, at least that's the case --"
1964.65,3,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,4998.025,4998.923,"Well, at least that will --"
1964.65,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4998.923,5000.878,(Inaudible)
1964.65,3,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,5000.878,5006.834,"At least that might be the kind of thing that might be intended to covered, the constitutionality would be a different problem."
