2005.04-1477,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,3.77,We'll hear argument next in Jones v. Flowers.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,5.706,8.505,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1477,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,58.485,63.17,"Mr. Kirkpatrick, I don't recall what... what the rule is."
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,72.728,84.423,"Justice Scalia, in a case like this where there's valuable real property, regular mail would not be sufficient to comply with due process, and the reason why is this."
2005.04-1477,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,102.978,106.86,"Yes, but do we have a case that says that, you have to use registered mail?"
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,106.86,108.154,"No, Your Honor."
2005.04-1477,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,108.154,109.207,I didn't think we did.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,132.056,132.587,Justice Scalia--
2005.04-1477,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,132.587,143.729,And it seems... it seems mean to punish the State for going the extra mile and sending the notice by registered mail because that informed them that it didn't reach him.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,143.729,151.244,"--Yes, but Justice Scalia, the State, once informed that the letter had never reached Mr. Jones, did nothing."
2005.04-1477,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,173.377,174.919,Why?
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,174.919,175.78,--Well--
2005.04-1477,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,175.78,179.59,"In Mullane, it was regular mail."
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,180.832,182.054,"--Yes, that's correct."
2005.04-1477,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,182.054,189.427,And isn't it 100 percent clear that there were a number of those addressees who didn't get the letter?
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,189.427,192.858,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct, but--"
2005.04-1477,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,192.858,197.321,"And yet, their answers were cut out by the decision, and the Court said that was okay."
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,197.321,214.304,"--Well, the context was very different in Mullane because in Mullane there was a large number of interested parties with very small interests in a trust, and what they were being given notice of was an accounting to settle those trusts."
2005.04-1477,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,239.658,253.098,"But you have another factor here that wasn't present in Mullane; that is, the person who received notice has a statutory obligation to advise government of the current address."
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,259.97,262.958,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-1477,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,272.978,275.595,It wasn't the government in... in Mullane it wasn't the government.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,275.595,277.07,"--Well, that's right."
2005.04-1477,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,280.932,288.395,"How do... how do we... I mean, this was the problem I... I had with... with your... your brief here, and it's the same problem Justice Ginsburg has."
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,320.872,338.785,"--Justice Souter, I think it is given weight when we evaluate the reasonableness of the initial notice effort, and we do not quarrel with the State first sending notice by certified mail to the last address in the State property records."
2005.04-1477,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,338.785,344.029,And then that would be so even if there were not affirmative obligation on the property owner.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,344.029,344.28,Yes.
2005.04-1477,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,344.28,355.552,"You'd say, well, if they... if they send the... the notice to the last address they had, or if they send it... since we're talking about real estate, maybe if they send it to the... to the property, nothing wrong with that."
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,357.206,363.035,"Justice Souter, I think that there are a couple of points that need to be made."
2005.04-1477,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,369.586,370.157,No.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,389.163,396.564,"The answer is once the State was informed that the first mailed notice had failed, it gets no significance."
2005.04-1477,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,396.564,396.864,All right.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,425.68,442.142,"Justice Souter, it has no significance once the State is actually informed that the notice has failed because I think the significance of the statute is it increases the State's confidence in the address that it's initially using."
2005.04-1477,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,516.232,523.054,And he also had a continuing obligation to inform the government of his address.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,543.796,550.706,"--Approximately $6,000 because the property was sold for $21,000."
2005.04-1477,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,607.316,607.897,"How did they find him, by the way?"
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,607.897,608.127,Would you tell me--
2005.04-1477,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,608.127,608.958,--how in your opinion?
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,608.958,610.143,"--Oh, excuse me."
2005.04-1477,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,610.143,611.034,How did they find him?
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,611.034,616.93,--The purchaser served an eviction notice to the property--
2005.04-1477,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,616.93,617.101,No.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,622.765,629.215,--They should have searched three categories of sources for a better address and then tried mail again.
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,646.618,646.848,May I ask--
2005.04-1477,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,646.848,652.727,So they find 13 people called Gary Jones or G. Jones in Little Rock.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,653.498,654.702,Two things.
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,662.135,663.497,--May I interrupt with this question?
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,666.648,668.883,--No.
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,670.185,672.973,What was constitutionally mandated in your view?
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,672.973,682.441,--Reasonably diligent efforts to ascertain a correct address after the return of the first certified mail and how far--
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,682.441,687.808,So you would not include posting on the... posting a notice on the house as constitutionally mandated.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,687.808,689.935,"--Justice Stevens, I would."
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,695.49,696.904,"No, they can... they can do--"
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,696.904,696.934,Yes.
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,696.934,697.034,--a lot things.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,697.034,697.164,But--
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,697.164,699.3,I'm trying to decide what they must do.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,699.3,706.612,"--With real property, if the owner has not been notified by mail, absolutely I think they should post notice on the property."
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,708.507,710.604,Would that be constitutionally sufficient if they posted a notice?
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,710.604,719.39,--It would be constitutionally sufficient if they posted a notice because they could not ascertain a better address.
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,719.39,723.542,"Well, now so it would not be constitutionally sufficient if that's all they did."
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,723.542,724.415,That's correct.
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,725.52,728.357,So what is the constitutional minimum that would be sufficient?
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,728.357,735.939,--Reasonably diligent efforts to find a better address and if a better address--
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,735.939,740.423,It would be decided on a case by case basis depending on the particular facts in the case.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,740.423,749.329,"--Well, this Court in Schroeder v. City of New York, I think, recognized that it's impossible to have a mechanical rule to apply in every circumstance."
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,750.784,756.773,And your opponent argues very persuasively the mechanical rules are very important in this particular area of government business.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,756.773,764.687,"--Well, they are, but in this case, the State knew within 2 weeks of sending the initial mailed notice that it had not been received."
2005.04-1477,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,798.088,840.974,"But I take it in... in this case... I mean, I... you're probably right that it would have... it would have worked here, but I... I take it that in the absence of that... that hindsight, you would say that in... in the regular case that simply posting notice on the house, after the letter is returned, would not be enough, that the... that the posting on the house would be sufficient only if they had exhausted other efforts to get a better address so that in this case, going back to Justice Breyer's example, they... they'd have to follow up whatever it is, the 18 G. Joneses or Gary Joneses that they could find in the phone book before they could then fall back and resort to posting on the house."
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,842.198,843.765,"Justice Souter, you do."
2005.04-1477,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,870.043,871.176,"Well, the search of... the search of what?"
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,878.297,899.652,"--Well, if they contracted with a credit bureau, for example, or a skip tracer, it is quite easy to find people that have moved across the country, much easier today than it was, you know, years ago because technology has really expanded the amount of information that is readily ascertainable."
2005.04-1477,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,899.652,900.083,How many people--
2005.04-1477,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,900.083,910.634,"Does... does it follow from your argument that someone who purchases at a tax sale, before they conclude the purchase, should find out what the State has done?"
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,910.634,917.774,"Justice Kennedy, that would be a reasonable way to have a statutory scheme."
2005.04-1477,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,917.774,919.932,And the purchaser from that purchaser the same.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,939.5,942.308,It might be prudent to do that.
2005.04-1477,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,943.119,947.634,"Well, isn't it required to do that under your title, if you're going to have your title set aside by Jones?"
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,947.634,959.38,"--Yes, although if the title is set aside, Ms. Flowers will receive a full refund of all the money that she's paid, and that's under the Arkansas statutory scheme."
2005.04-1477,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,959.38,960.885,"Well, what about the purchaser from Jones?"
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,966.601,984.485,"That may be correct and I think when somebody goes to purchase property and they find out that title insurance is not available because of the tax sale deed, they have to consider the potential exposure."
2005.04-1477,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,984.485,994.085,So one of the consequences of your rule is to devalue any property sold by the government because it is open to this kind of challenge for deficiency in title.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,997.945,1015.668,I think only for a temporary period of time because there's a 2-year statute of limitations to challenge the sale and that's why the State tells tax sale purchasers that they should not make expensive improvements to property until that time has closed.
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1015.668,1018.418,"May I ask, Mr. Kirkpatrick?"
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1027.272,1029.56,It is a matter of public record.
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.858,1034.074,But it could be revealed by a title search?
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1034.074,1047.825,"--I don't know, Your Honor, whether a title search would reveal it, but certainly in the county records, all of the delinquent properties are entered and open to the public for inspection."
2005.04-1477,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1050.223,1052.209,Would this case come out differently?
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1088.467,1090.924,"Justice Scalia, I--"
2005.04-1477,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1090.924,1092.54,Suppose it said that explicitly.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1094.536,1097.023,"--No, it would not because--"
2005.04-1477,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1097.023,1097.183,Why?
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1120.723,1132.088,"--Justice Scalia, I believe the Federal constitutional obligation would still apply regardless of whether the State of Arkansas tried to legislate its way out of it."
2005.04-1477,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1132.088,1137.025,"Well, but there... no, but this is a consequence of violating the law of... of Arkansas."
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1141.067,1143.735,"Well, it--"
2005.04-1477,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1143.735,1150.935,"You know, and my next question is going to be, if you way it would come out differently, then isn't... isn't it sort of silly to make the State come on and say that?"
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1159.319,1177.856,"--I don't think... Justice Scalia, I don't think that's... if Arkansas had that kind of statute, that it would make this case come out differently because I think the due process analysis and the application of the Mullane standard to these facts where the initial mailed notice comes back would be the same."
2005.04-1477,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.046,1199.118,Could they fine him for not... could they fine him for not... for not keeping them advised of... of where... where his tax address is?
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1199.118,1201.383,I suppose as a matter of criminal law they could.
2005.04-1477,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1201.383,1201.574,They could.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1205.163,1207.781,"He lost about $70,000 worth of equity."
2005.04-1477,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1207.781,1210.176,"Could they fine him $70,000?"
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1210.176,1211.58,That would seem to be a very harsh penalty.
2005.04-1477,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1211.58,1214.369,"It's pretty harsh, but do you think this Court would strike it down?"
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1214.369,1215.26,I do.
2005.04-1477,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.26,1217.275,You do.
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1217.275,1225.269,I frankly don't see the difference between failing to keep the State advised as to your residence and failing to pay your taxes.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1227.636,1228.74,That's right.
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1228.74,1232.299,And should not that figure into the analysis?
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1232.299,1243.965,"Justice Stevens, it should not figure in at all because he still had a statutory right to redeem the property, and once he had that statutory right to redeem the property, due process--"
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1243.965,1244.166,"Well, no, I understand that."
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1248.207,1249.341,"--In fact, in this case he did not."
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1271.567,1273.882,"Well, this is a very unique fact situation."
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1282.66,1289.6,"Typically the homeowner certainly should, but we all make mistakes and certainly there are lawyers--"
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1289.6,1293.542,But he has to make mistakes for 2 or 3 years running before it's significant.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1293.542,1302.148,--Arkansas set up a statutory scheme that gave him a right to redeem up until 30 days after the sale of the property.
2005.04-1477,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1310.544,1317.674,"Yes, but how long do the taxes have to be in arrears before they can send him a notice and start the proceeding running?"
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1317.674,1321.564,--They wait until the taxes have been delinquent for 1 year.
2005.04-1477,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1357.392,1361.264,"--Mr. Kirkpatrick, you distinguish Mullane."

2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1422.569,1425.044,She was.
2005.04-1477,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1425.044,1425.818,Were they divorced?
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1425.818,1426.189,No.
2005.04-1477,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1426.68,1426.721,All right.
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1437.462,1442.245,"Basically, Justice Breyer, but the... the letters--"
2005.04-1477,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1442.245,1447.449,"If you have that kind of relationship with your wife, doesn't he have an obligation to watch what's going on?"
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1447.449,1451.741,"--Yes, he does have some obligation to watch what's going on."
2005.04-1477,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1467.029,1467.86,Did they leave a notice?
2005.04-1477,0,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,1467.86,1476.627,"If the letter carrier followed proper procedure, the notice would have been left, but there's nothing in the record to indicate one way or the other whether that happened."

2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1721.821,1726.143,"--Well, I mean, that's a pretty remarkable due process constitutional--"
2005.04-1477,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1726.143,1726.664,"Well, why not?"
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1736.65,1741.853,--I may... I may let Mr. Feldman defend the... the Postal Service because he is the Solicitor General's lawyer.
2005.04-1477,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1751.401,1751.785,But--
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1751.785,1753.949,--that it will get there and it will be properly delivered.
2005.04-1477,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1755.566,1769.728,"--But the whole point... at least I understand... of Justice Breyer's question is that you have taken a step to make it more difficult for the mail to get through by insisting that the person be there to sign for it, and it's obviously more likely than not he's not going to be there."
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1775.194,1779.587,"Well, the... the purpose of using certified mail is to make sure that it actually got to the person--"
2005.04-1477,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1779.587,1779.907,No.

2005.04-1477,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1811.728,1812.039,Wait.
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1824.746,1826.571,"--And as a matter of policy, I wouldn't necessarily disagree with that."

2005.04-1477,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1829.237,1830.882,This is the FedEx rule of due process.
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1831.224,1832.115,That's exactly what it is.
2005.04-1477,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1843.308,1848.374,But is the Chief Justice not correct that ordinary mail is more apt to get to the destination than certified mail?
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1848.374,1852.839,"Well, if it is, it's probably only at a... at a marginal number."
2005.04-1477,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1853.139,1853.78,But even if it's marginal--
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1853.78,1854.791,--the percentages are very small.
2005.04-1477,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1854.791,1861.01,--the... the principal purpose of the certified mail is to let the sender know whether or not the notice was received.
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1874.692,1880.759,"Well, except for this problem... I mean, the other problem you have is that we don't... all we know is that it wasn't... it... it came back unclaimed."
2005.04-1477,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1888.331,1889.634,"Well, but you also know that nobody got the notice."

2005.04-1477,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1899.764,1903.979,"Well, you would know that the letter was not opened and read by the addressee."
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1903.979,1908.241,"Well, to be sure, I know that it wasn't opened and read, but all I'm saying is that what we don't... we don't even know--"
2005.04-1477,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1908.241,1908.591,And if it isn't opened and read--
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1908.591,1909.111,--that Justice Breyer is correct.
2005.04-1477,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1909.111,1911.4,"--if it isn't opened and read, they didn't get notice."
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1912.843,1913.494,They didn't receive actual notice.
2005.04-1477,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1918.94,1922.52,May I ask one other question I intended to ask your opponent?
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1926.602,1936.563,"I... I think in their reply brief at least, they make an effort, and we didn't go and... and do a 50-State survey between a week ago and now to find out."
2005.04-1477,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1940.093,1940.754,Including... including Arkansas.

2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1955.896,1957.228,--for property... I'm sorry?
2005.04-1477,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1957.228,1969.416,"--This taxpayer... even though he failed to give notice of his current address, this taxpayer would be entitled under the current statute to personal service."
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1969.416,1974.55,"No, Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe that is true because this is not this taxpayer's homestead."
2005.04-1477,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1980.96,1981.39,I thought he still lived in--
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1981.39,1981.73,--he lives elsewhere.
2005.04-1477,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1981.73,1984.247,--I thought he still lived in Arkansas.
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1984.247,1987.276,"Well, he lives in Arkansas, but that doesn't make this his homestead."
2005.04-1477,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1987.276,1989.192,Homestead.
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1989.192,1989.694,Yes.
2005.04-1477,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1989.694,1990.094,I see.
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1990.094,1992.73,So he wouldn't... he wouldn't qualify for the--
2005.04-1477,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1992.73,1993.341,Right.
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1993.341,1994.235,--for the additional law.
2005.04-1477,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2011.275,2016.31,"Well, counsel, one thing you did... your client did was provide notice by publication in a local newspaper."
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2016.31,2017.734,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1477,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2017.734,2019.068,Why do you bother doing that?
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2019.068,2024.454,"Well, in part because we... we're putting out a notice to the public that we're selling the property."
2005.04-1477,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2033.299,2040.67,You don't... you don't rely on that as in any way discharging your constitutional obligation to provide notice to the... to the homeowner.
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2040.67,2042.995,"--On its own, it clearly wouldn't suffice."
2005.04-1477,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2086.344,2086.947,See what you think of this.
2005.04-1477,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2087.728,2088.481,What would you think of a rule that said--
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2088.481,2089.884,--I'm sorry.
2005.04-1477,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2089.884,2098.661,"--What would you think of a rule that said if you use certified mail and it returns uncollected, the additional step you must take, you just send ordinary mail?"
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2098.661,2105.662,"I think if the Court were to say the... the additional step you must take is to send ordinary mail, we could probably live with that kind of a rule."
2005.04-1477,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2149.013,2150.196,"--No, we skip that."
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2162.602,2165.783,"--It sounds like you're legislating, Justice Breyer."
2005.04-1477,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2165.783,2181.519,"No, because the purpose is to get reasonably calculated to get notice, and in the world today, there are an awful lot of houses where nobody is home, you know, and there's no convenient way for them to go to the post office without giving up a certain amount of work."
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2194.599,2204.76,"Well, it seems to me, Justice Breyer, you're adopting a rule that's designed to protect a very, very tiny minority and to impose a burden, a significant burden, on the State."
2005.04-1477,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2204.76,2206.104,Is it a tiny minority--
2005.04-1477,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2206.104,2208.059,I'm not even sure it protects that minority.
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2220.616,2241.64,"And... and the flip side of that is there's nothing that indicates why even... even the person... if somebody is unwilling to go... to take the time to find out what the Commissioner of Lands in the State has sent a certified letter for, why is it... why would you assume that whenever the letter comes in when it's addressed to Mr. Jones, that Mrs. Jones isn't going to toss it aside just as quickly?"
2005.04-1477,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2241.64,2242.161,Can--
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2242.161,2247.367,There's no... there's nothing that indicates one way or the other what... what is a preferable system to operate.
2005.04-1477,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2250.185,2253.356,--But isn't there a second purpose for... for sending it certified mail?
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2263.585,2263.855,--They do.
2005.04-1477,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2264.656,2267.615,"Whereas if you just sent it regular mail, it may have been lost."
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2267.615,2268.207,--Right.
2005.04-1477,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2268.838,2271.287,This... this assures that it reaches the destination.
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2271.287,2271.879,--Yes.
2005.04-1477,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2272.46,2305.42,"Suppose... suppose we had a case where the homeowner has kept the Lands Commissioner informed of her current address, does everything she was supposed to do except at the time this notice, certified mail notice... at the time of the delivery attempt, she's hospitalized having a quadruple bypass, so she never gets it."
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2312.681,2320.226,"--Well, I mean, I don't want... I don't want to fight the hypothetical, but you have to put a little in context in a case like this because the process here is one that's fairly protracted."
2005.04-1477,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2372.099,2373.293,But your--
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2373.293,2378.551,"--because in the vast majority of cases... I'm sorry... due process will be satisfied because notice will, in fact, be received."
2005.04-1477,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2378.551,2385.71,"--But your... your position is, though, when you've got the certified letter returned is you have no obligation to do anything further."
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2385.71,2396.222,"That's correct, because... because the difficulty is once you go past that, what... what obligation you have becomes completely unknowable at that stage."
2005.04-1477,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2396.222,2402.792,"But it seems to me that even you might not have an obligation, it seemed to me you would have a motivation to do more because you want to collect your taxes."
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2402.792,2403.073,"Well, and that's... that--"
2005.04-1477,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2403.073,2410.383,Which is sort of puzzling to me as why the States don't have a... an affirmative interest in providing the best notice that they can.
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2410.383,2412.741,"--Justice Stevens, the truth is most of them... we do."
2005.04-1477,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2480.704,2481.065,--Is it of any--
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2481.065,2482.409,"If it's not, then we're not... I'm sorry."
2005.04-1477,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2482.409,2490.493,--Is it of any relevance to consider the burden or the obligations that this rule that petitioners advocate place on downstream purchasers?
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2490.493,2510.422,"Oh, I think absolutely because it's significantly undermines the State's overall effort in trying to get its money back because it's all well and good to say we can sell the property, but if nobody is going to pay for the property anything that comes close to the value of even getting our liens paid off, then we're not going to get the revenue stream that we would otherwise be entitled to."
2005.04-1477,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2513.603,2528.094,"Oh, you would get the whole... you'd just get a little bit less because the cost of notice is borne by the purchaser and if they have to do a Google search or use one of these other services, it's going to add a little bit more to their cost, and you're just going to get a little bit less."
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2530.452,2536.319,--That assumes that there's a... that there's a purchaser that wants to undertake the burden and... and to assume that risk.
2005.04-1477,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2536.319,2537.725,For getting the property--
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2537.725,2538.939,"I mean, we couldn't sell this the first time out."
2005.04-1477,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2538.939,2543.813,"--for getting the property in this case, we're at 20 percent of its market value."
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2546.47,2552.97,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it's worth taking at least 2 seconds to focus on the market value argument here, this $80,000 number."
2005.04-1477,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2585.057,2585.568,"No, no, no."
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2594.155,2601.907,"--I'd be willing to stipulate to that, Mr. Chief Justice, but the truth is nobody showed up even for an auction on this property."
2005.04-1477,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.599,2634.797,"Your... your friend said that the $80,000 comes from the fact that it... at the... at the auction, it... the opening bid is one quarter of the fair market value."
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2635.63,2642.581,"Well, it has to be... I think it has to be a minimum that, but you know, it could be 100 percent of the fair market value."
2005.04-1477,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2642.581,2644.725,"Well... well, was the opening bid $20,000?"
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2646.56,2648.977,"Right, but it could also be 100 percent."
2005.04-1477,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2648.977,2649.708,--I see.
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2649.708,2650.679,So you don't know.
2005.04-1477,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2655.905,2659.897,"And the $20,000 would have been a permissible bid even if the market value was $40,000."
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2659.897,2660.448,Exactly.
2005.04-1477,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2663.847,2671.248,Would your argument be any different if there weren't a statutory obligation to keep the government informed of the... of one's mailing address?
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2671.248,2672.864,I think I would still make the same argument.
2005.04-1477,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2696.986,2704.497,But it seems to me unrealistic to assume that the average citizen would know that duty more clearly than he'd know the duty to pay his taxes.
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2704.497,2715.02,The... the only reason he would know that duty is because every... every property tax form has on it a change of address at the very bottom of it that's perforated.
2005.04-1477,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2720.637,2736.454,"Is there a provision of Arkansas law that if in fact they do track down the property owner and he is at an address different from the last address that he had given, that the expense of tracking him down may be charged to him, along with the delinquent taxes, penalties, and so on?"
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2736.454,2754.868,"The... the statute talks about costs, but the State has never interpreted that term to mean just sort of the out of pocket... those kinds of inchoate costs, and they usually talk about very specific costs like the cost of noticing publication and other... you know, other items that you can... you know, where you have a receipt."
2005.04-1477,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2754.868,2757.196,So in practice the answer is no?
2005.04-1477,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2757.196,2758.47,In practice the answer is no.
2005.04-1477,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2762.421,2763.392,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2775.117,2777.616,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1477,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2812.622,2815.18,"Yes, but redeliver... you have to be there to sign for it again."
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2815.18,2817.004,"Right, but they--"
2005.04-1477,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2817.004,2817.494,All right.
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2819.162,2819.532,--They do need a signature.
2005.04-1477,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2819.532,2829.171,"--I'm thinking... what I'm thinking is that where... where you're trying to reach a person, the means has to be reasonably calculated."
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2854.227,2868.288,"The Court... I believe that certified mail is... is a more reliable method than first class mail because it requires the mail person, the carrier, to get to... get a signature at... at... he has to go from a particular person."
2005.04-1477,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2877.487,2878.831,I didn't say all that.
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2878.831,2879.171,And--
2005.04-1477,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2879.171,2881.005,I said do either.
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2908.437,2933.883,"--And if the Court were to adopt that rule, it would give States an enormous incentive and people giving notice to just send things by first class mail in the first instance, which this Court has repeatedly said and has... has said is... is sufficient to satisfy due process, including in cases involving tax sales in the Mennonite case, condemnation of property in the... in the City of New York case, and similar kinds of events."
2005.04-1477,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2967.132,2972.098,"Of course, none of this would have been sufficient if we were talking about your... your client, the IRS."
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2978.427,2980.815,--I say they... they do slightly more.
2005.04-1477,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3044.908,3051.025,"Well, which way is that... I mean, the fact that he tried six times and he wasn't there should have told the State this isn't working."
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3051.025,3055.87,"Well, right, but the State under the Dusenbery case is not obligated to provide actual notice."
2005.04-1477,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3135.007,3137.645,"Well, but your position is they don't have to do anything."
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3137.645,3157.905,"Yes, our position is that the standard is if it was reasonably calculated to provide notice at the time it was sent, which in this case it was... they used the only address in the public record that ties him to this property, and their belief that they had the right address was supported by the State law that said he has to provide them with a change of address."
2005.04-1477,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3167.236,3172.882,"Well, Mullane said that we look to what a person who really wanted to find the person would do."
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3181.628,3184.065,--I... I don't think that that's necessarily true.
2005.04-1477,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3231.186,3234.082,Which... which you agree does no good at all.
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3234.493,3236.707,I don't agree it does no good at all.
2005.04-1477,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3237.071,3239.458,When is the last time you read legal notices in a newspaper?
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3239.458,3241.523,--I don't ordinarily do it.
2005.04-1477,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3241.983,3242.634,Have you ever done it?
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3242.634,3245.853,I... I can't recall.
2005.04-1477,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3245.853,3246.154,No.
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3248.932,3249.743,But I--
2005.04-1477,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3249.743,3255.329,I think a lot of people who buy property at tax sales do read those notices regularly.
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3255.329,3266.442,"--What I was going to say is I think that every year, I'm confident that there's home... there's people throughout the country probably who are notified of... of tax sales and things like that because someone sees it, someone lets them know."
2005.04-1477,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3304.038,3312.252,"But Mullane, as Mr. Kirkpatrick pointed out, involved masses of people."
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3326.464,3327.246,Right.
2005.04-1477,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3360.537,3380.336,"Why isn't... why isn't the simple answer to that concern to say, look, there's no way to tell in advance or, you know, by any general rule, at least not legislatively, how far they've got to go to try to find the correct address, but they know where the house is and they've got at that point to go to the house and put a notice on the door?"
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3383.626,3383.867,--May I respond to that?
2005.04-1477,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3383.867,3384.307,Sure.
2005.04-1477,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3384.307,3385.331,I just have two quick things.
2005.04-1477,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3415.02,3416.445,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
2005.04-1477,3,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,3420.104,3421.056,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1477,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3528.587,3543.602,"With... with respect to the fact that your client did not alert the State to its change of address, is there anything in the record about whether that his separation was permanent or is that a gradual thing?"
2005.04-1477,3,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,3546.811,3557.241,"There's nothing in the record about that, Your Honor, but certainly when he first moved out, he did not know what the future would hold in terms of the length of that separation."
2005.04-1477,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3662.819,3663.36,You may finish.
2005.04-1477,3,36106,michael_t_kirkpatrick,,3663.36,3665.575,That it was not marked refused.
2005.04-1477,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3670.932,3674.932,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
