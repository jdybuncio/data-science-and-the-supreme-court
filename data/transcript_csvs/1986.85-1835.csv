1986.85-1835,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.737,"We will hear arguments next in No. 85-1835, California against Peter Rooney."
1986.85-1835,0,16013,arnold_t_guminski,,10.689,15.843,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1835,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,63.573,66.173,xxx unclear in the record in this case.
1986.85-1835,0,16013,arnold_t_guminski,,69.042,74.26,It would be underneath the apartments themselves.
1986.85-1835,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,74.26,74.694,You mean basement?
1986.85-1835,0,16013,arnold_t_guminski,,74.694,75.279,Pardon me?
1986.85-1835,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,75.279,76.195,You mean basement?
1986.85-1835,0,16013,arnold_t_guminski,,76.195,77.712,"Basement, yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1835,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,77.712,79.231,"Well, why do you need subterranean?"
1986.85-1835,0,16013,arnold_t_guminski,,86.385,92.371,I do not know who is the specific owner of the trash receptacle.
1986.85-1835,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,98.441,99.708,"Well, couldn't you have found out?"
1986.85-1835,0,16013,arnold_t_guminski,,102.06,107.314,"--It is possible that they could have found out, yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1835,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,107.314,107.581,And let us know.
1986.85-1835,0,16013,arnold_t_guminski,,107.581,112.333,It does not... that fact is not disclosed in the record.
1986.85-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.135,193.585,Mr. Guminski?
1986.85-1835,0,16013,arnold_t_guminski,,193.585,194.218,"Yes, Justice."
1986.85-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,194.218,210.179,"Is it true that under California law as articulated in the Krivda case, that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in abandoned garbage in California?"
1986.85-1835,0,16013,arnold_t_guminski,,210.179,215.381,"I think that it can be stated, yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,224.32,229.955,But the indications are that California would recognize a reasonable expectation of privacy?
1986.85-1835,0,16013,arnold_t_guminski,,229.955,232.891,"Yes, Your Honor, and that was the holding in the instant case by the Court of Appeals."
1986.85-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,232.891,244.698,I'm curious how that interfaces then with the inquiry we would make under the Fourth Amendment about whether a particular expectation of privacy is reasonable.
1986.85-1835,0,16013,arnold_t_guminski,,254.237,255.62,We submit--
1986.85-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.62,257.422,--on what's a reasonable expectation?
1986.85-1835,0,16013,arnold_t_guminski,,257.422,264.243,"--Justice O'Connor, we submit that this Court must use a Federal, national standard."
1986.85-1835,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,295.714,302.285,"California may in fact have a higher class of trash than other states, too."
1986.85-1835,0,16013,arnold_t_guminski,,302.285,303.987,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1835,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,374.749,379.201,You want us to extend the open fields doctrine to a basement?
1986.85-1835,0,16013,arnold_t_guminski,,379.201,386.271,"--We are not speaking that it... the open fields doctrine extends to the basement, sir."
1986.85-1835,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,386.271,386.505,"Well, what are you saying?"
1986.85-1835,0,16013,arnold_t_guminski,,386.505,397.996,"We are saying that a basement, in the first place, is not within the curtilage or the house of Mr. Peter Rooney."
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,1842.967,1851.506,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1944.482,1950.336,As opposed to subterranean communal garages which are the site of intimate activities?
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,1950.821,1951.538,--Correct.
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1964.762,1965.546,--Right.
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,1972.083,1973.618,"Yes, there is--"
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1973.618,1977.737,So you're not relying on the curtilage... on the curtilage distinction?
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,1977.737,1979.688,"--I do, from this standpoint."
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.843,2015.795,"xxx whether it was horizontal or vertical distance, did we?"
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2015.795,2017.028,That's correct.
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2017.028,2018.83,You might be in good shape if we just meant horizontal distance.
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2018.83,2030.185,"That's correct, Your Honor, because the petitioners in their opening brief pointed out that Mr. Rooney lived in the northwest apartment, and it was the southeast end of the building where the trash was."
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2042.445,2044.662,Why is that so extraordinary?
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2079.701,2080.918,There is for one reason.
1986.85-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2095.092,2100.413,xxx inside of a house is not outside of the curtilage?
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2100.413,2101.698,"Well, I would submit--"
1986.85-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2101.698,2107.234,"Well, why don't you say that inside a house is not, quote, an open field, end quote?"
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2107.234,2108.602,--I do say.
1986.85-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2110.72,2111.87,"Well, where are you getting all these other problems?"
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2111.87,2116.089,"Trash outside is still not an open field, if it's not in my backyard."
1986.85-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2117.641,2120.493,"xxx open fields, is it?"
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2120.493,2123.278,--Trash inside his house is not an open field.
1986.85-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2123.278,2124.645,"Well, this trash was inside a house."
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2124.645,2126.897,It is our position that the subterranean--
1986.85-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2126.897,2127.597,"Well, why don't you stick to that?"
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2127.597,2129.765,"--Well, I do now."
1986.85-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2134.919,2143.442,"Well, the Court of Appeals said that the trash bin was located in the apartment's garage, which was an area accessible to the public."
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2143.442,2144.142,Correct.
1986.85-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2144.142,2151.446,"So when you say it's a house, you certainly don't mean it had the sort of privacy interests that you'd get inside the four walls of a house?"
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2151.446,2153.279,"I do make this distinction, Your Honor."
1986.85-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2206.514,2208.616,"If it had been at the top, we'd have a different case?"
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2208.616,2221.423,"--Clearly, if it was on the top exposed to view, then perhaps, under the auto exceptions, where an officer might be deemed to have a right to go in and look at a vehicle, for whatever reason."
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.854,2244.77,Assume that this... what was it?
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2246.222,2247.189,Five feet high?
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2247.189,2250.258,"--Right, this isn't put out on the curb for collection, right?"
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2257.512,2266.969,"There was not testimony to indicate whether the maintenance people had to take that large trash truck and put it outside for the garbage man, or whether the truck came in."
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.456,2278.36,"Well, I somehow doubt that the size of this container would allow it to be carried outside the garage, too."
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2278.36,2285.014,"If the container couldn't be carried outside the garage, I think certainly a truck couldn't come in."
1986.85-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2285.014,2299.774,Don't we have to assume that the Court of Appeals thought some of these things that are not in the record like whether the garbage truck came in or the container went out or whether the garage door was up or down made no difference?
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2308.629,2310.379,I have no quarrel with that.
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2349.687,2350.97,This case has everything in it.
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2355.857,2360.209,We're in a garage where automobiles are kept.
1986.85-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2431.354,2445.531,"Mr. Lewis, supposing that this 28-apartment building had all been inhabited by a rather wealthy person and his staff of servants, this clearly would be within the curtilage in that sense."
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2461.124,2467.028,--I don't believe it's the numbers that give rise to the loss of the privilege of curtilage.
1986.85-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2492.31,2497.147,"Well, you can take that kind of trash that you don't want people to... and bury it over in the park."
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2500.249,2510.474,"Well, that's what the petitioner suggested in their brief, that we could burn it, that we could shred it, that we could throw it down our garbage disposal, or we could eat it."
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2609.887,2612.022,I really don't follow your argument.
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2640.358,2641.691,I have no quarrel with that.
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2661.605,2665.724,"But your point here was, gee, there ought to be some way to get rid of these things that the police wouldn't find it."
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2687.303,2688.672,I don't go that far.
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2688.672,2690.322,"Well, what's the difference between them?"
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2690.322,2695.593,The difference is that you're not engaging in those intimate activities of life that one expects--
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.593,2698.111,"Well, what intimate activities of life go on in the garage?"
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2698.111,2704.615,"--Well, this is where one is compelled... some things do come to mind."
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2722.226,2730.749,"Every nonapartment dweller has the same problem, and what we do is, we keep it in our house and put it out once a week, okay?"
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2730.749,2740.807,"--Then the question is simply the expectation of privacy, the reasonable expectation of privacy that our trash will not be read by the neighbors or the police."
1986.85-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2769.807,2775.878,"Well, what did the Court of Appeal here mean by saying that this area was accessible to the public?"
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2775.878,2782.384,That someone passing by might be able to look into the subterranean garage and see this trash bin.
1986.85-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2782.384,2790.121,"Well, ordinarily, the fact that a trash bin was located in an area accessible to the public."
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2799.928,2807.832,There's nothing in the record and I think counsel would agree that there's nothing in the record to indicate that it was open to the public.
1986.85-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2807.832,2812.92,It just doesn't sound like the courts below even relied on the curtilage notion.
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2816.805,2822.259,"I'm prepared to concede that the trash can, the trash bin, is visible."
1986.85-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2822.259,2830.346,"--Well, but what I'm saying is that if the Court of Appeals had meant to say what you say it meant to have said, it would have said that this was visible to the public."
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2837.269,2846.207,"I would submit that one could go into the subterranean garage, be he a policeman or some stranger, and touch the trash."
1986.85-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2894.037,2895.604,"Well, as I understand the California rule, they don't require a warrant."
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2900.525,2900.941,--Correct.
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.514,2925.89,"Suppose the inhabitant of apartment 28 whom your client doesn't know at all is down there in the garage, and he seeks this big crate of garbage over there, and he rummages around in it, and he picks up something that your client had thrown away down there?"
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2925.89,2929.175,Mr. Rooney has a problem.
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2931.327,2937.314,"Well, would Mr. Rooney be able to get it back, do you think, if he hadn't... it's not a diamond ring that was thrown away by mistake; it's a piece of trash."
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2944.968,2949.705,Whether he's able to get it back doesn't determine his right to have it.
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2954.423,2963.596,"No, I'm talking about whether it's realistically been abandoned when it's been put down there, and whether that place is a place in which he thinks he really has privacy in what he has deposited in the garbage bin."
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,2972.618,2984.342,"If they take it out, he doesn't know about it, they turn it over to the police, it's the same problem we have with any third party who confronts the police with some illegally obtained items; it's not police conduct."
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3036.608,3039.227,"xxx feel the same way about the trash on the sidewalk, too?"
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3039.227,3039.744,Yes.
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3039.744,3047.881,"You think if my neighbor comes around and takes something out of the trash can that I've laid down on the sidewalk, I can come up to him and say, hey, give that back to me, that's my trash."
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3047.881,3049.916,"I think so, just as much as you can claim the ring."
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3060.058,3061.608,I could prosecute them for theft of it?
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3061.608,3072.866,"--I'm not prepared... if they refused to give it to you, I think you would have a cause of action; whether it would be in criminal law, I'm not prepared to say."
1986.85-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3078.369,3080.369,0 xxx.
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3080.369,3081.285,Yes.
1986.85-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3081.285,3082.754,Let's assume he owns it and he could get it back.
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3100.615,3110.221,"Well, I think one would have the right, in front of one's home or even in the subterranean garage, to keep one's trash from one's neighbors."
1986.85-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3115.292,3116.025,"Well, how far do you go?"
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3133.17,3134.789,"--I say, no, Your Honor."
1986.85-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3134.789,3136.589,He can follow it right to the dump?
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3136.589,3143.025,I follow it to the dump until such time it has been mixed with a large conglomeration of trash elsewhere and lost its identity.
1986.85-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3144.577,3146.077,I guess you really have to say that.
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3146.077,3147.013,--I beg your pardon?
1986.85-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.013,3149.798,I guess your theory just has to take you that far.
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3149.798,3164.725,"Well, it happens to, and I think one of the things I did, counsel did, was to begin to talk to friends and acquaintances about, what do you think happens to your trash?"
1986.85-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3167.26,3179.235,"Well, really, the question is, do you think... do you think that any person can have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the papers that the trashman picks up out of his trash can and dumps in his truck?"
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3194.41,3197.362,"--Well, I think against government intrusion, yes."
1986.85-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3200.898,3205.283,"Well, it just so happens, that the trashman is a government employee."
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3205.283,3211.539,--But he's not a policeman inclined to take this for whatever particular purpose.
1986.85-1835,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3287.437,3291.139,"You keep saying all the time, he put it in the bottom of the bin."
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3297.126,3297.643,--Absolutely right.
1986.85-1835,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3304.966,3308.168,Would it make my difference if it were not in a brown paper bag?
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3308.168,3312.636,"I don't think the color of course would do it, or whether it would be paper or plastic."
1986.85-1835,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3314.572,3322.76,"Well, if it were not in a bag, what if he just threw the betting tickets in the container as he went by?"
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3322.76,3332.949,"--Yes, if he threw them in the containers, and someone could... a policeman come by, because if a neighbor came by and saw it, not much would happen unless the neighbor wanted to take it to the police, and if they did, then of course the police may use that."
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3356.732,3361.318,"Well, that doesn't... that doesn't... that indicates a desire for secrecy."
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3374.526,3375.895,"Well, that's correct."
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3390.905,3393.274,So has the fellow who hides it under the bush in the park?
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3393.274,3395.59,--Because it's an open fields.
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3400.26,3404.045,He hides it under a bench on a cement street.
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3405.597,3410.616,"That isn't a part of the curtilage where one would normally expect... I say, no, he doesn't have it there."
1986.85-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3410.616,3412.618,--But you're mixing up your two arguments now.
1986.85-1835,1,16470,arthur_lewis,,3422.441,3428.328,I can't extend the privacy argument to the placing of trash in a public park on or under a bench.
1986.85-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3568.768,3571.703,"Thank you, Mr. Lewis."
