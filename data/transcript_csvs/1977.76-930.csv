1977.76-930,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,69.41,"We will hear arguments next in 76-930, Governor Ray against Atlantic Richfield."
1977.76-930,0,41407,slade_gorton,,73.156,76.89,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-930,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,206.259,210.577,"The radar which is, you are not talking about radar on the vessel?"
1977.76-930,0,41407,slade_gorton,,210.577,215.091,I am talking about the coastguard’s radar to see where the vessels all are.
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,1556.425,1570.543,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1797.017,1812.851,"Mr. Sherwood, would you still say that there was preemption or that there was a conflict if the coastguard did not announced this traffic control plan in Puget Sound?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,1812.851,1819.155,"As to the size limit, I would certainly think so because the coastguard as well as the Maritime Administration --"
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1819.155,1825.03,Would you say the existence of the power to control the size was enough?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,1825.03,1826.634,"Yes, I would, Your Honor."
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1826.634,1829.402,Under what case would that be enough?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,1829.402,1836.612,"Well, our view would be under both cases such as Lockheed or Northern States --"
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1836.612,1844.991,You think you just have to spell out some intention from the comprehensiveness of the federal law that they did not intend state interference?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,1844.991,1845.327,Yes.
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.876,1874.836,You would have a tougher case without the local traffic plan?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,1874.836,1876.611,We would have a different case.
1977.76-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1951.393,1961.222,"Yet there are some ports in the United States that 150,000-ton tanker just cannot get into even though a state were not to prohibit it, are there not?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,1961.222,1962.299,"Indeed, Justice Rehnquist."
1977.76-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1979.255,1996.439,"Well, when you talk about the failure of the Maritime Administration to limit the deadweight of ships, that does not necessarily mean that they contemplated that the larger ship they would permit would necessarily get into any port of the United States?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,1996.439,1999.349,"No, I think they were thinking in terms of two possibilities."
1977.76-930,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2021.977,2031.848,"As I understand, your argument is that you can build the tanker size you want, the state is powerless to keep it out as of today?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2031.848,2035.986,"Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall, the state is powerless to keep it out and the state --"
1977.76-930,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2035.986,2043.384,"Even though it will wreck havoc, even though there is no question that the bottom will be ripped out?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2043.384,2049.578,"Well, I think there is no evidence that the bottoms of any of these vessels will or have been ripped out."
1977.76-930,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2049.578,2052.094,This is my hypothetical?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2052.094,2059.484,"Well, in that circumstance, the coastguard has an affirmative obligation to prevent the vessel from entering Puget Sound or any other port."
1977.76-930,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2059.484,2064.828,"And if the coastguard does not act, the state is powerless?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2064.828,2068.799,It would be my position that it would be the obligation then of the state.
1977.76-930,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2068.799,2081.947,Could the state pass a law and say “we will not allow any tankers in Puget Sound in which there is a record of them having their bottom ripped out some place else?'
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2081.947,2087.101,"No, I would think again, that would be beyond the power of the state because of the scheme of regulation --"
1977.76-930,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2087.101,2089.085,So the state just lets them come in and rip the bottom of it?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2089.085,2106.638,"No, I do not think the state needs to let any vessel come in its waters because the state has the right both to go to the federal authorities as well as to seek the kind of political address which was sought in the case of the Marine Mammal Protection Act at the federal level."
1977.76-930,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2106.638,2110.615,"And until that is done, the state cannot act?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2110.615,2116.519,"That would be our position, yes."
1977.76-930,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2153.774,2159.51,"In this case, they did, the coastguard and the state did get together on Rosario?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2159.51,2161.597,"No, the state had no role in Rosario."
1977.76-930,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2161.597,2162.372,None at all?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2162.372,2163.426,No.
1977.76-930,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2183.658,2184.452,I see.
1977.76-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2184.452,2191.677,Do you say that under the federal act the coastguard could set deadweight limits on tankers?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2191.677,2193.443,"Well, they clearly could, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1977.76-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2193.443,2200.842,Would it have to set the same limits for every port in the United States or could it vary from commandant to commandant?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2200.842,2226.767,"Well, it is my understanding that rules could be laid down which would be flexible depending on particular ports and indeed the Section from the Senate Legislative Report that I read to you, contemplates that there would be no across the board size limitation that would be imposed specific area, by specific area or depending upon other conditions, weather, for example, such as the limitations now in Rosario."
1977.76-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2226.767,2235.427,"So you could have a great deal of diversity of regulation under the federal system, as you understand it?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2235.427,2245.227,"Yes, it is my understanding that the federal system contemplates that there would be diversity of regulation, but that it would be diversity of federal regulation."
1977.76-930,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2245.227,2256.537,"Well, at the present time, I suppose the regulations for vessels docking at Alexandria are quite different from those at New York, or New Orleans, or Mobile?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2256.537,2257.62,I am certain that they are.
1977.76-930,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2257.62,2258.977,Under federal regulation?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2258.977,2259.675,Yes.
1977.76-930,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2259.675,2282.517,"I understood the Attorney General Gorton’s argument to be simply that from the state’s point of view a disaster or a spill from 150,000 ton tanker is a much greater disaster than a 50,000 and you do not need any evidence for that, do you?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2282.517,2288.006,"Well, I would suggest that you would need some evidence because it is a question of whether the entire vessel is destroyed."
1977.76-930,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2311.946,2329.313,"But until the coastguard put in new regulations and limitations about bulkheads the contrary was true, was it not, that the larger tankers spilled a great deal more oil than the smaller ones?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2329.313,2331.776,"I do not believe so, Chief Justice Burger."
1977.76-930,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2356.763,2365.248,Are you addressing that to the present state of affairs or the earliest spills four or five years ago?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2365.248,2367.862,I believe both.
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2382.635,2386.61,"If it would have been four times as big, it would have been in the worst disaster?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2386.61,2388.912,"I think that is right, Mr. Justice White."
1977.76-930,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2388.912,2403.876,"I Well, thought that was about all the Attorney General was arguing that the larger tankers were potentially greater risks in these narrow straights and shallow waters?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2411.041,2420.992,All that we have in the record on this is a stipulation between the parties that there is a good faith dispute as to whether more smaller tankers creates a greater danger than fewer larger tankers.
1977.76-930,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2420.992,2436.967,"Well I take it, you would concede that smaller tankers will expose the state’s waters or these waters in Puget Sound to less hazard than a 150,000-ton tankers?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2436.967,2444.247,"No, I would not because in order to bring the same amount of petroleum in, you are going to require a larger number of smaller vessels."
1977.76-930,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2451.014,2460.801,"Mr. Sherwood, but will you not agree that a large tanker is less maneuverable than a small tanker?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2460.801,2462.991,It is less maneuverable under certain circumstances.
1977.76-930,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2462.991,2466.529,Less maneuverable.
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2466.529,2470.11,"No, I think that is a function of the equipment."
1977.76-930,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2470.11,2481.107,"Would you agree that in Puget Sound and in Rosario Straits, a huge tanker is less maneuverable than a small tanker?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2481.107,2482.553,"No, I would not."
1977.76-930,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2528.442,2541.244,Is it not true in average maritime collision case you find that the larger ship is less maneuverable?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2545.008,2551.61,"I am not familiar with Griffin on collisions, but my view on that, Mr. Justice Marshall, is that it is a function of the aging equipment of the vessel."
1977.76-930,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2551.61,2562.626,"I think what you say is that you have a large ship with a perfect steering mechanism and a small ship with a beat up one, that they are equal."
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2575.011,2599.219,"Well, if they had identical characteristics, I would suppose that a smaller vessel would be somewhat more maneuverable, but in an area that is as broad as Rosario Strait more than a nautical mile wide and as deep as Puget Sound and if you look at Exhibit B to the Appendix, you will find that Puget Sound in most places is deep enough to accommodate any vessel afloat."
1977.76-930,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2599.219,2602.779,What if they have a single file in the Strait?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2602.779,2611.53,"Because the coastguard has concluded that, as to the large vessels, it is the safer way to go."
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.53,2629.667,"Mr. Sherwood, what federal interest could not be protected here by the coastguard if it wanted to protect it or by the Secretary if they really wanted to preclude the state regulation?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2635.027,2636.832,Yes and it is our position that the coastguard has precluded them.
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2636.832,2644.637,"I know, but if there is any argument about it, the coastguard can make it unmistakably clear, could it not?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2644.637,2656.586,"I just do not think, Mr. Justice White that the coastguard is going to function in a fashion in which it is making determinations that it is barring a particular law."
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2677.657,2680.428,You are still not addressing yourself to my question.
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2684.533,2691.431,"In theory, the coastguard could say “we prohibit you in doing this,” but in practice, there is no evidence that the coastguard --"
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2691.431,2697.54,"If it said “the following requirements will be observed and no others,” it may be imposed, I suppose they could say that?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2697.54,2708.985,"Yes, it could say that, but under the statute there is no reason why they should say it when you have got on the one side the 102 (b) language which says that states are limited."
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2708.985,2725.629,There is a reason if the federal authorities think that a state should be disentitled to impose any stricter requirements than the federal rule and there are many areas where states are permitted to impose stricter requirements.
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2729.803,2740.101,"Well, the coastguard has taken the position as its Chief Counsel indicated at the time that the law was passed, that it was preempted by the Ports and Waterways Safety Act, and therefore --"
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.101,2744.6,I do not know that we were bound by the Chief Counsel of the coastguard?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2744.6,2751.374,I am confident that you are not because you are interpreting a statute of general application with a legislative history.
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2751.374,2769.767,"Well, I suppose if it were decided that the law in its present form, including the coastguard regulations, do not preempt or do not foreclose or preclude this system of regulation by the State of Washington that the coastguard, if it wanted to, could do something about it."
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2769.767,2773.024,"Yes, but the question is what must the coastguard do."
1977.76-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2836.611,2861.117,"That is almost a constitutional argument there though, is it not, because you have a grant of authority by Congress to federal administrative authorities like the coastguard, they choose to not exercise it and then you say it just creates an intolerable burden because they have used their discretion given to them by Congress not to do something?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2861.117,2880.562,"Well, I would suggest Justice Rehnquist, that you would otherwise create a situation in which each time the coastguard considers and rejects something, twin screws for example, that a state would then be in a position where it could add on the requirement so long as it was something that the coastguard had not said was prohibited for states to do."
1977.76-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2880.562,2888.575,"Well, that would be a stronger case though if the coastguard had considered it and rejected it to have the state then go ahead and add it on, would it not?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2888.575,2893.924,"Well, the coastguard has here considered and rejected each of the design features of the Washington law."
1977.76-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2893.924,2902.495,"But as I understand the design features, that requirement can be completely avoided by taking a tug boat?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2902.495,2911.568,It can at this time in Washington with the imposition of a penalty in the magnitude of some hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.
1977.76-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2911.568,2918.169,"But you mean if the vessel employs the tug boat, it has to pay a penalty too?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2918.169,2924.193,"Well, there is good faith dispute as to the efficacy of tug boats in doing anything because they are not attached to the vessel."
1977.76-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2969.931,2985.058,"If the coastguard is in charged with administering this Act and if it thought that purpose was being undermined as Justice White has suggested, it could prohibit it tomorrow and it has not?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,2985.058,2994.015,"Well, the coastguard, we submit, has acted in the only legible way that it can in dealing with the alternative regulations."
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3017.502,3041.271,"If this court suggested that whatever it has done is not enough, I suppose the coastguard would then know that it is not enough and would you say that the coastguard had the power under any of these statutes that are involved to foreclose state regulation, state redesign-requirements for example?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,3041.271,3045.866,I would believe that it clearly would and it is our position that it in fact has exercised it.
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3045.866,3052.348,I understand that.
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,3064.409,3065.915,"Yes, I believe it does."
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.915,3068.595,"Well, but you just said it contemplated uniform --"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,3068.595,3075.813,"When I say uniform, I mean uniform by one body being the umpire that is the point of the federal system is that there are political disputes --"
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3075.813,3084.16,I thought you indicated that the coastguard might put on different requirements at different ports?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,3084.16,3084.686,"As indeed, it has."
1977.76-930,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3089.363,3101.606,"So, the fact that a company might have to satisfy some requirement in Puget Sound and something different in San Diego or in New York is nothing so horrendous, is it?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,3101.606,3118.685,It is a question of how many political entities a company must deal with and the company would then be placed at the tender mercies of 50 different state legislatures rather than --
1977.76-930,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3118.685,3123.543,"But you do not have 50 different states with ports, do you?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,3124.091,3136.654,"Well, actually there are a number of inland states that have taken a position in both directions in this case, including those that are on the great lakes and those that are on the rivers as to their right to regulate and obviously it would not be 50 Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.76-930,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3136.654,3159.851,"I take it your point that if let us assume that there are 20 different ports that take tankers of 50,000 or over, that at least there is one coordinating central authority that is recognizing the reasons for a different set of standards in Mobile Bay and Puget Sound, at least the right hand knows what the left hand is doing there?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,3159.851,3161.353,Precisely.
1977.76-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3246.446,3251.741,"What about Cooley against the Board of Wardens, that involved a requirement take on a pilot, does it not?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,3251.741,3270.851,"Yes and the only historic exception, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and the only one that I am able to find aside from the limited regulation of docksides is that Pilotage since 1789 has been regarded as something where you can have a local pilot for vessels that are coming from abroad."
1977.76-930,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3284.169,3293.846,"Mr. Sherwood, in many areas, the affected states dealing with a problem like this get together with the federal government and work things out."
1977.76-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3304.313,3311.422,"Well, the record shows one letter from Governor Evans to the President."
1977.76-930,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3311.422,3316.196,"I was speaking more generally, the states generally with the federal government rather than just Washington?"
1977.76-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3316.196,3339.052,"Indeed, Mr. Chief Justice Burger, the statute contemplates that there would be consultation and each time the coastguard adapts a regulation either under Title I or Title II, there is an opportunity indeed mandated for comment by state and local authorities and there has been a wide pattern of comment by state and local authorities."
1977.76-930,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3348.173,3349.255,Your time has expired.
1977.76-930,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3377.968,3392.02,"Mr. Sherwood, am I correct, is it agreed that the District Court is to be reversed with respect to the presumption ruling concerning registered vessels as distinguished from enrolled vessel?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,3392.02,3426.807,"Well, it is our understanding, Mr. Justice Blackmun, that if the Court affirms the striking down of the entire Pilotage provision that there was a preexisting provision of Washington law which did require state pilots on all vessels which were registered and, thus, if the Court struck down that provision in its entirety from the tanker law, there would be in place a Washington requirement of pilots on the vessels that come from abroad."
1977.76-930,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3444.736,3453.3,"Secondly, and this is perhaps of no relevance, do any or all of our coast tankers carry foreign flags?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,3453.3,3453.783,Yes.
1977.76-930,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3453.783,3454.774,Is that on the record?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,3454.774,3455.31,Yes.
1977.76-930,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3455.31,3456.0,All of them?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,3456.0,3487.824,"No, the majority of the vessels owned by the company from the record are US-flag, but the bulk of the vessels that have brought foreign crude into Puget Sound for Atlantic Richfield were foreign-flag, that is, the 15 vessels that were larger than 125,000 deadweight tons were all vessels not owned by Atlantic Richfield, but rather were chartered by it and were foreign-flag vessels."
1977.76-930,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3501.488,3506.737,Can I assume they possess federal licenses from the US?
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,3506.737,3528.004,"Yes, all of the Atlantic Richfield vessels have the relevant federal licenses and permits under the Tank Vessel Act and certification under other federal statutes and similarly all of the vessels that are foreign-flag have the appropriate arrangements for reciprocal treatment under our laws."
1977.76-930,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3528.004,3529.095,That is all I have.
1977.76-930,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3529.095,3534.041,"Mr. Sherwood, may I ask you one question that I did not have a chance to ask before lunch?"
1977.76-930,1,40581,richard_e_sherwood,,3547.132,3554.37,"The record does not I believe, Justice Stevens, tell us anything other than the existence of a good faith dispute."
1977.76-930,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3591.035,3593.395,Thank you.
1977.76-930,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3593.395,3596.83,"Thank you, Mr. Sherwood."
1977.76-930,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3603.214,3629.33,"In its report which accompanied the passage of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act, the Senate stated “in terms of maneuverability, the propulsion units on 250,000-ton tankers are the equivalent to 1/3 horsepower motor on a 40-foot boat.”"
1977.76-930,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3659.61,3664.043,Is your emphasis there also on the maneuverability of such a large craft?
1977.76-930,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3664.043,3667.581,Of course it is and that is from the Senate Report.
1977.76-930,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3686.845,3690.131,Do those tankers ever go 16 knots in that area?
1977.76-930,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3690.131,3701.677,"I doubt it, they cannot among other things Mr. Chief Justice because they are required to have tug escorts and the tug escorts could not keep up with them at 16 knots."
1977.76-930,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3705.427,3720.479,"Well of course, on those figures there is a limit. In the strong wind in Rosario Strait, a canoe is smaller than a 120,000 deadweight ton vessel and yet it would be a lot less maneuverable?"
1977.76-930,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3720.479,3722.188,It would be.
1977.76-930,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3732.461,3734.907,It is not a straight line of comparison right down?
1977.76-930,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3734.907,3738.544,"No, it is not an absolute straight line comparison."
1977.76-930,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3781.256,3787.798,Are we to take that as meaning that the coastguard can step in today and take care of all Mr. Sherwood’s problems?
1977.76-930,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3787.798,3793.105,"Precisely, Mr. Chief Justice, if the coastguard wishes to do so."
1977.76-930,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3870.959,3871.591,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
