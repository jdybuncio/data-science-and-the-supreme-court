2005.04-1506,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.805,"We'll hear argument first this morning in 04-1506, Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services v. Ahlborn."
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,10.059,12.727,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1506,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,64.482,65.305,Can you tell me?
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,73.076,74.13,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-1506,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,75.404,85.113,"So after the settlement, I take it Arkansas would... still would have had the right to... to pursue its claim in the litigation, or am I wrong about that?"
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,85.113,108.924,"Well, Your Honor, after... at the point that Arkansas learned about the settlement, the case had already been dismissed out of State court with prejudice, and the respondent notified the department that if it would not accept... it would not compromise its Medicaid claim, that they would be filing a declaratory judgment action in Federal court to resolve the anti lien question."
2005.04-1506,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,110.629,115.906,"But if Arkansas was a party to the case, it didn't get notice of the dismissal?"
2005.04-1506,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,115.906,117.42,That's what I don't understand.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,117.42,120.259,They... it did not get notice of the dismissal.
2005.04-1506,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,125.635,126.979,"Well, I don't understand--"
2005.04-1506,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,126.979,128.55,How can they do that with... with a party?
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,152.291,164.127,"Arguably Arkansas could have attempted to get the case reopened in State court, but the petitioner... I'm sorry... the respondent in this case selected the Federal forum to resolve the issue."
2005.04-1506,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,164.127,166.064,"--No, but that's not at issue."
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,191.395,191.558,"Well, Your Honor--"
2005.04-1506,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,191.558,192.902,And that's the end of it.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,192.902,209.581,"--I'm not familiar with the terms of the settlement agreement, but I would assume that if Arkansas would have sued the defendant for the remainder, that there would have been an indemnification clause in the settlement agreement, which means that the money would have ended up coming right out of Ms. Ahlborn's pocket in any event."
2005.04-1506,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,209.581,211.005,"Well, I have no idea about that."
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,242.258,243.213,Your Honor--
2005.04-1506,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,243.213,245.37,They can't settle your claim out from under you.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,245.37,248.198,--That is exactly what happened.
2005.04-1506,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,251.377,252.501,"No, but the--"
2005.04-1506,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,252.501,254.386,But we're asking how that can be.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,254.386,257.014,"We don't... well, we don't know how that can be."
2005.04-1506,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,261.176,263.343,We're asking you as a matter of Arkansas law.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,263.343,273.383,"As a matter of Arkansas law, a claim should not be dismissed until all parties are... the rights of all parties are determined."
2005.04-1506,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,273.383,274.024,Why didn't Arkansas--
2005.04-1506,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,274.024,277.215,I wonder if you have a claim for incompetent counsel representing you.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,277.215,278.058,I'm sorry?
2005.04-1506,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,278.058,285.349,I'm wondering you... if you have a claim against counsel for being incompetent in letting a settlement be made without notice to the... to you.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,288.79,309.051,"Well, if... in fact, there is an Arkansas statute that if monies that belong to the department are distributed in a... in a manner that is inconsistent, you know, with the interests of the department, that it can pursue either the Medicaid recipient, her guardian, her attorney, or anyone else for that money."
2005.04-1506,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,309.051,311.487,--Then why don't we just send you back to do that?
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,311.487,313.253,Because--
2005.04-1506,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,313.253,317.053,"I mean, why are we going through this... this proceeding here?"
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,317.053,322.851,"--The reason we're going through the proceeding here, Your Honor, is because the issue of the anti lien provision was raised."
2005.04-1506,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,327.867,328.217,No.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,353.964,357.253,"Your Honor, we could have proceeded in State court if we wished."
2005.04-1506,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,361.125,365.287,"Well, wouldn't it have been easier to do that than come to the Supreme Court of the United States?"
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,365.287,368.426,"--We never expected to get, frankly, to the Supreme Court of the United States."
2005.04-1506,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,370.743,371.457,You were the petitioner.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,371.457,372.87,--before the Federal district... I'm sorry?
2005.04-1506,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,372.87,374.715,You were... you were the petitioner.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,374.715,376.16,Yes.
2005.04-1506,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,376.16,380.643,"Well, if you're filing a petition, you have to have some expectation that you might end up here."
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,380.643,384.054,"Oh, I thought you meant at the time that the State court case was dismissed."
2005.04-1506,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,385.989,390.133,--I want to go back to the Federal statutes and the State statute.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,390.133,390.343,Yes.
2005.04-1506,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,390.343,395.509,Why isn't this discussion just suggest what the answer is to the legal question raised?
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,421.837,437.484,"Your Honor, the third party liability provisions of Federal Medicaid law is what governs this case, and those statutes require that the States seek... seek reimbursement from liable third parties for medical costs for the full amount of that liability."
2005.04-1506,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,466.803,474.796,"But could she... after that assignment, could she bring a suit in her own right to do that, to recover the medical costs?"
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,474.796,477.183,"Yes, she could, Your Honor, and in fact, that is what the majority--"
2005.04-1506,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,477.183,479.902,Even though she's assigned the cause of action to the State?
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,479.902,480.374,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1506,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,491.026,495.709,Why isn't it dismissed on the basis that they... they don't have a cause of action because they've assigned it?
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,495.709,502.028,"Well, they... she is basically... a recipient is pursuing the cause of action with the... the approval of the State."
2005.04-1506,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,526.112,543.354,"You're... you're talking without reference to the statute, and as I read the statute, the phrase that keeps reappearing is payments made by a third party for health care items or services."
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,577.306,603.273,"Your Honor, what the statute requires... this is in the petitioners' brief on pages 2 and 3... at 42 U.S.C. 1396k(a)(1)(A), which is the section that talks about the scope of the assignment, she has to assign her rights to payment for medical care, not payments that she actually receives for medical care."
2005.04-1506,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,622.049,627.345,"Why isn't her response to that argument, look, I've... I've assigned you my rights?"
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,639.772,642.461,"There is nothing, though, in the--"
2005.04-1506,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,642.461,644.667,"I mean, that would be consistent with the... with the statute."
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,645.598,654.886,--The third party liability provisions do not require the State to ever seek reimbursement through the direct--
2005.04-1506,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,654.886,657.054,"No, no, but I... I'm not saying that it... it does."
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,697.353,707.582,"--Ms.... first of all, with regard to the stipulation, Your Honor, the parties have always agreed that Medicaid paid over $214,000--"
2005.04-1506,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,707.582,707.912,Right.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,707.912,709.054,--for Ms. Ahlborn's damages.
2005.04-1506,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,721.973,726.126,But you're... you're basing your argument on this statute.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,726.126,726.589,Yes.
2005.04-1506,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,726.589,728.404,And let me come back to my question.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,763.258,776.748,"Because she assigned, Your Honor, her right to recover... or her right for payments from third parties, she no longer has the right to compromise the State's claim."
2005.04-1506,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,778.967,782.295,"Well, it seems to me that that is an entirely different argument."
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,800.229,809.997,"--There's... under the statute, her assignment... she has a duty of cooperation, first of all, to cooperate with the State in receiving these recoveries."
2005.04-1506,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,818.492,820.239,Doesn't the assignment allow you to bring a lawsuit?
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,820.239,821.27,"--Yes, the assignment allows--"
2005.04-1506,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,821.27,822.354,Then why don't you bring it?
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,831.39,838.773,--But she... she opted to bring the... she opted to bring the lawsuit on her own.
2005.04-1506,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,840.327,841.208,So what?
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,842.703,845.703,"--We could sue, but the State has limited resources."
2005.04-1506,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,847.738,852.824,Let me... let me ask you this question so far as the rights of the assignee and the assignor.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,868.44,871.761,"--Yes, Your Honor, and that is encompassed within State law."
2005.04-1506,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,871.761,872.955,Okay.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,882.238,887.094,"In that situation, then the... the case would just have to go forward to litigation."
2005.04-1506,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,889.229,897.464,"Would... would it... if... suppose in the instance I put they... the... the State has... has an objection, but the settlement is made, nonetheless, for 20 cents on the dollar."
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,904.837,905.778,--Would you repeat that?
2005.04-1506,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,906.469,910.862,Assume that it's a very weak case.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,921.073,928.264,The... the Medicaid recipient can never compromise the claim of the State.
2005.04-1506,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,928.264,928.825,"The answer is yes, I take it."
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,928.825,929.616,Pardon me?
2005.04-1506,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,929.616,930.81,"The answer is yes, I take it."
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,942.273,947.62,"Well, she... in that situation, Your Honor, she can... she can compromise her own claim."
2005.04-1506,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,949.517,956.908,"So you think you're... you're entitled to 100 percent under Arkansas law, but... and I take it, that would be without regard to what the Federal law required."
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,965.465,966.035,--No.
2005.04-1506,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,974.46,979.423,"Well, if we disagree with you on that... in other words, you're saying we don't even have to reach the anti lien provision question."
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,988.271,990.416,I'm sorry.
2005.04-1506,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,991.439,993.287,"Arkansas law, as you understand it--"
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,993.287,993.898,Yes.
2005.04-1506,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,993.898,1000.788,--requires a... a full... full assignment of any expenses the State... or full recovery of any expenses the State has incurred.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,1012.565,1015.813,If Medicaid... Medicaid law does require full reimbursement.
2005.04-1506,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1034.81,1037.007,"Well, that's one of the issues, and I'm trying to understand."
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,1056.847,1057.891,"No, that is not true, Your Honor."
2005.04-1506,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1065.112,1065.393,Okay.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,1070.928,1071.842,--That would be correct.
2005.04-1506,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1071.842,1072.675,Okay.
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,1076.796,1079.416,It would be because of the anti lien provision.
2005.04-1506,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1096.959,1097.97,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.04-1506,0,34426,lori_freno,,1097.97,1098.801,Thank you.
2005.04-1506,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1098.801,1114.428,Ms. Millett.
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1114.428,1116.335,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1506,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1151.52,1152.281,What should have happened?
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1162.072,1162.583,No.
2005.04-1506,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1193.131,1200.332,"Well, I mean, why does there have to be enough money in the... take... take the... the case that we... we put to your cocounsel."
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1210.464,1211.377,No.
2005.04-1506,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1216.753,1219.562,"No, but in my... can you answer the... the question?"
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1235.921,1241.828,"--No, not straight out, but what they... they have the right to make their own decision and compromise their own claim."
2005.04-1506,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1248.808,1255.46,"But that is... that is as between the State and the third party tortfeasor, not between the State and... and the Medicare recipient, I should think."
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1255.46,1259.512,"Not when... not... not when the settlement, as here, involves the complete claim."
2005.04-1506,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1311.095,1313.553,But the State... the State could sue in the first instance.
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1324.244,1325.478,"--Two answers, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-1506,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1347.504,1349.571,But the State was in this case.
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1352.84,1353.453,Yes.
2005.04-1506,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1353.453,1364.253,"And when it... it found out about the dismissal, why didn't it go right into the Arkansas court and say, you forgot about us?"
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1365.959,1372.51,"They... they could have, and they'd be... they'd be fighting the same anti lien issue there that they ended up fighting in Federal court."
2005.04-1506,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1375.528,1378.648,Why would they be fighting the same anti lien provision?
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1394.666,1395.637,--That's right.
2005.04-1506,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1434.224,1440.523,"Well... well, if your rule is just one that you have to pay the 100 percent if there's non cooperation and a non notice, that's one thing."
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1446.391,1460.692,"Our position is the 100 percent claim... the default... as a default rule, when the State has been cut out and cannot make the reasoned judgment that the Medicaid statute charges the State with making on these claims, that's a 100 percent rule."
2005.04-1506,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1477.574,1478.506,I... I know in the case of a jury.
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1480.471,1481.325,--It's... no.
2005.04-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1492.757,1493.71,May I ask this clarifying question?
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1506.568,1509.558,--It depends on whether the State was involved in making that judgment.
2005.04-1506,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1515.867,1516.307,Suppose the State was involved but disagreed.
2005.04-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1516.307,1518.022,You're saying the State should sue here.
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1518.022,1518.696,I'm sorry.
2005.04-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1518.696,1521.243,"You're saying here the State should therefore sue, if I understand you."
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1521.243,1522.677,No.
2005.04-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1538.433,1540.251,But here it's stipulated I thought.
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1540.251,1540.731,"--No, no."
2005.04-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.971,1554.161,No.
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1561.694,1561.994,--No.
2005.04-1506,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1599.437,1603.44,Suppose the State... suppose the State is involved in the negotiations and they disagree.
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1609.848,1610.801,--That--
2005.04-1506,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1610.801,1611.394,It has notice.
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1612.798,1613.149,--Right.
2005.04-1506,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.667,1627.837,Ms.--
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1627.837,1629.109,--cover medical payments.
2005.04-1506,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1629.109,1635.127,"--Ms. Millett, you've been trying to tell us the difficulties that the State would have in bringing suit later."
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1635.127,1635.338,Yes.
2005.04-1506,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1635.338,1636.139,What are they?
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1636.84,1637.11,Yes.
2005.04-1506,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1637.693,1638.744,I'd like to hear what they are.
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1638.744,1641.833,"--The... the first one, obviously,... there's three."
2005.04-1506,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1677.09,1679.476,Why is it her incentive to reduce recovery?
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1683.237,1696.779,"--Because at this... if... if we're in a post hoc hearing to sort of allocate the settlement, she wants to keep... have as much of it put into the pain and suffering and lost wages pile and as little in the medical liability pile because she doesn't go home with that."
2005.04-1506,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1696.779,1698.876,I... I thought she and the--
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1698.876,1700.1,And then if... I'm sorry.
2005.04-1506,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1701.714,1701.904,"--Yes, yes."
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1701.904,1703.799,One would be a fight with her.
2005.04-1506,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1710.026,1710.226,Yes.
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1715.962,1720.345,"But she may if there's an indemnity agreement, which means if they have to pay to us, they will... I'm sorry."
2005.04-1506,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1728.056,1728.99,"Thank you, Ms. Millett."
2005.04-1506,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1728.99,1729.61,Thank you.
2005.04-1506,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1729.61,1731.869,Mr. Blair.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,1731.869,1734.104,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.72,1786.189,What... what incentive does she have to cooperate in that later action?
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,1795.417,1799.89,--She would not have a disincentive to cooperate.
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.012,1822.599,"Well, it... but... but don't some of the insurance policies require that if the insurance company, which has settled the first claim, ends up paying... paying additional money, that that... that that amount of money would be the... the responsibility of the... of the claimant?"
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,1822.599,1823.092,Correct.
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1823.092,1825.719,So that's a disincentive on her part.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,1827.895,1829.929,That... that is correct.
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1830.162,1850.1,"Well, it seems to me that that's a very strange system for the Federal Government to set up and to... to... I mean, to... to subsidize... to reward the failure of the... of the Medicaid benefit... beneficiary to cooperate."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,1853.331,1853.971,--Correct.
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1853.971,1859.007,And she didn't do that here because she just went ahead and settled without... without giving the State notice.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,1859.007,1860.051,"I disagree, Your Honor."
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1868.556,1869.467,Really.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,1869.467,1869.828,That is--
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1869.828,1880.913,"I mean, the State is a party to the proceeding, and she goes ahead and get the proceeding dismissed without even telling the State, and that... that isn't included in the... the responsibility to cooperate?"
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,1880.913,1883.801,"--The dismissal, of course, followed the settlement."
2005.04-1506,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1911.172,1925.958,"And I suppose if the insurance company heard from the State that the State continued to... would continue to pursue its claim, in the absence either of a more generous assignment or a more generous settlement, there might not have been a settlement."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,1925.958,1927.241,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-1506,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1927.622,1933.298,"Well, so why... why then is it unreasonable for the State to take this position, the one that the government took?"
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,1998.634,2009.766,"--Well, first of all, the... the remedy that the petitioner here proposes is one that Congress has not proposed, for openers."
2005.04-1506,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2022.045,2024.873,"But that's all consistent, of course, with their position."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2058.444,2059.857,--Correct.
2005.04-1506,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2061.462,2062.978,"Now, what's legally wrong with that?"
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2062.978,2077.08,"--Because they're... they're taking money beyond the claim for medical expense, Your Honor, because the claim for medical expense is not measured by the amount of the medical expenses in terms of its value."
2005.04-1506,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2090.889,2093.149,Did... did they have notice of the settlement proceeding?
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2093.149,2094.03,"--No, Your Honor."
2005.04-1506,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2105.876,2108.574,But they were... and they were intervened in this lawsuit.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2116.045,2130.42,"--I do not... strictly speaking, no, they were not entitled to notice because the... the intervention was secondary to the plaintiff's claim."
2005.04-1506,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2156.699,2158.141,"Suppose, though, that were the rule."
2005.04-1506,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2158.141,2163.91,The plaintiff had... had no obligation to notify the State?
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2185.315,2213.229,"Yes, there... there is... there is a general provision in Arkansas law that... that the Medicaid recipients assign their claim to notify the State of any potential liable parties, the date of the occurrence, the kind of injury they sustained, the information that would enable the State to pursue its claim should it decide to do so."
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2240.54,2245.314,The complaint... the... the intervention by the State claimed only a lien?
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2245.947,2247.451,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2247.451,2248.254,--document claimed?
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2249.106,2253.69,The... actually... actually there was never a formal complaint and intervention filed.
2005.04-1506,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2260.941,2271.203,Roughly speaking... I... I'm... there may be a few dollars and cents that... that aren't accounted for here.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2288.263,2302.024,It... it is the same percentage that the total medicals bore to what we agreed was a fair valuation of the claim or what we agreed there would be evidence to support.
2005.04-1506,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2302.024,2302.214,Okay.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2302.214,2317.92,"In other words, the State... after this dispute broke out, the respondent and the petitioner reached an agreement as to the probable value of the claim, absent any considerations of liability or financial responsibility."
2005.04-1506,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2330.499,2330.78,Well--
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2330.78,2336.175,"--Yes, but the... the other thing that you're... you're dividing that against is not liquidated."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2336.175,2337.459,Correct.
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2337.459,2349.246,"And nobody... I mean, the... where there's room for... for compromise is certainly in the pain and suffering part of a settlement, not in the medicals."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2355.695,2356.607,Your Honor--
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2356.607,2357.068,That's the compromise.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2368.157,2376.169,"--Your Honor has put his finger exactly upon the problem in this case, and that is that there was a tremendous question of liability."
2005.04-1506,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2381.394,2381.634,--Okay.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2400.011,2411.124,"The claim was... the $3 million claim was not the amount claimed in the original lawsuit, which never got to the point of a claim being made."
2005.04-1506,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2426.402,2429.681,"Well, in the original State lawsuit, did you have to state an addendum?"
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2429.681,2430.412,--No.
2005.04-1506,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2436.639,2440.22,Where did... then... then tell me again where we got the $3 million figure.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2440.22,2452.608,"By negotiation with the respondents, Your Honor, by... by looking at the... the damages, the physical damages, the loss of earnings, impairment of earning capacity, all of those things."
2005.04-1506,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2465.407,2469.479,"And is... is that in... is that in writing, along with the allocation--"
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2469.479,2476.119,"Only to the extent that it is represented by the terms of the stipulation entered before the district court, Your Honor."
2005.04-1506,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2476.119,2477.453,"--Well, I mean, is that part of the stipulation?"
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2477.453,2477.824,Yes.
2005.04-1506,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2477.824,2478.314,Okay.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2478.314,2481.252,The... the numbers are in the stipulation.
2005.04-1506,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2481.252,2492.428,Is there a contention that the medical was under valued in the settlement or... I thought it was understood that it was the same proportion of the settlement.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2499.288,2500.16,"That's... that's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-1506,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2500.16,2509.408,Because there's some... I... I wasn't clear on whether the State had stipulated that this is what you agreed with the other side or that this is a fair calculation of the settlement.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2509.408,2515.967,There was no agreement with the respondent and the tortfeasor about allocation whatsoever.
2005.04-1506,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2544.31,2555.114,Do you think under Arkansas law that the injured party as an assignor has a duty to cooperate with the assignee in pursuing the claim?
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2555.114,2566.138,"Has a duty to cooperate with the assignee to the extent that it does not impair the assignor's interest, that is--"
2005.04-1506,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2566.138,2572.315,Is that duty fulfilled by... by entering settlement negotiations and not even notifying the assignee?
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2572.315,2585.374,"--In... in this particular instance, I think it was fulfilled because settlement negotiations resulted in $550,000 that the petitioners, in all likelihood, would have never received--"
2005.04-1506,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2585.374,2591.753,"Well, but what you're saying is that there's no duty to notify the assignee if you think you might get a pretty good result for yourself."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2595.272,2612.545,--I think the duty to... to notify the assignee would be true insofar as proceeding against the third party is concerned.
2005.04-1506,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2635.184,2638.353,"Well, it certainly would have avoided about 20 minutes of questions in this Court."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2638.936,2643.992,"In retrospect, Your Honor, they would have been plastered with notices."
2005.04-1506,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2643.992,2670.582,"Just given your experience... say, think of the generality of cases like this one... would it be difficult for you, representing the victims, if the rule were that these statutes give the Government the authority that they want here, as I understand it... the Federal Government... which is to say you have an obligation to notify the State of the presence of settlement negotiations."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2696.2,2701.242,"As a practical matter, yes, it would... it would--"
2005.04-1506,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2701.242,2701.685,Because?
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2705.024,2709.8,"--It... it would be a logistical problem, Your Honor, of--"
2005.04-1506,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2709.8,2713.259,"It would just require a letter, certified."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2713.259,2737.101,"--But... but the certified letter saying that I'm going to stipulate with... I'm going to enter into settlement negotiations with XYZ corporation, would not really have served any purpose unless they were to be included in every step of the way, because these settlement negotiations sometimes extend over months and years and... and some of they seem like they go forever."
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2766.116,2770.781,Wouldn't... wouldn't the insurance company have to worry about the same problem?
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2799.508,2811.854,The... the insurance company potentially would have double liability under Arkansas law if... if the claim is settled and they know the subrogation claim and--
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2811.854,2812.455,Right.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2812.455,2819.065,--and if it's... but that's this unnamed defendant's particular problem.
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2819.065,2826.827,"Okay, but once... once the... once the... the foolish insurance company figures out that that is what is going to happen, future settlements will be very difficult I would gather."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2826.827,2833.037,"I... I cannot comment on that, Your Honor, since that has not been the... the case--"
2005.04-1506,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2833.037,2834.701,"Yes, but it's... it's relevant."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2862.786,2865.394,"--That... that may be the result, Your Honor."
2005.04-1506,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2870.941,2885.755,"I mean, it sounds as if we're going to get to the same place, that if... if you prevail, probably the insurance companies will want the State to be involved or they haven't limited their liability, and if you lose, then we would have said that you have to get the... the State involved."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2885.755,2886.536,Right.
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2896.497,2905.002,"And your argument is if it is six in one, half... half a dozen in the other, we should do it your way because that's what the text of the statute says."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2905.002,2914.541,"We ultimately rely upon the text of the statute, Your Honor, irrespective of all of the policy or the political arguments that have been made to the Court."
2005.04-1506,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2920.498,2938.16,"With respect to the text of the statute and whether the anti lien provision applies, I'd be interested in your view, as a matter of Arkansas law, as to who owned the chose in action first and, secondly, who owned the proceeds of the settlement recovery after the assignment had taken place."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2938.16,2951.624,"--First, I think there's no question that Heidi Ahlborn owned the chose in action because under Arkansas law her claim was complete by the time the glass and the metal stopped falling to the highway."
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2983.207,2984.078,You're talking about the Federal statute--
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2984.078,2984.841,--Yes.
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2984.841,2985.371,--not the State statute.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2985.371,2986.163,The Federal statute--
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2986.163,2988.38,The State statute clearly goes beyond that and says--
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2988.38,2990.365,--We lose under the State statute.
2005.04-1506,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2991.709,2996.001,"And the Federal statute provides you, you think, with a defense to the State law claim."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,2996.001,2996.865,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-1506,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2996.865,3000.627,Why... why was there Federal jurisdiction in this case in the first place?
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,3000.627,3009.995,Because the Federal question involved the preemption issue as to whether the State statute had been preempted by the anti lien statute.
2005.04-1506,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3009.995,3014.708,So... so your view of jurisdiction depends upon the Federal defense.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,3014.708,3016.152,Correct.
2005.04-1506,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3022.001,3026.964,Is that... and which of our cases say that a Federal defense supports Federal jurisdiction?
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,3026.964,3036.973,"--A Federal defense does not support the Federal jurisdiction, but the declaratory judgment act gives jurisdiction over Federal questions."
2005.04-1506,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3036.973,3045.178,"Allows you to come into court if the claim that would have been brought against you would have been brought in Federal court, and the claim that would have been brought against you would have been under Arkansas law."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,3045.178,3064.304,"The claim that was... that we were bringing was under Federal law in that we were claiming the Arkansas statute was invalid by reason of the anti lien statute, and we believed that that presented a question of Federal law and therefore brought it--"
2005.04-1506,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3064.304,3064.827,Sounds like a defense.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,3064.827,3065.458,--in district court.
2005.04-1506,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3073.732,3079.609,Do you still have a declaration that the Arkansas statute was unconstitutional because it conflicted with the Federal statute?
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,3079.609,3080.129,That's correct.
2005.04-1506,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3086.667,3101.892,"It still sounds like a defense to me, counsel, and I think it may make a difference if your argument relies on the anti lien provision as a defense or perhaps relies on the... the assignment provisions in the Medicaid statute."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,3110.878,3113.969,I believe that it is both.
2005.04-1506,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3125.694,3130.658,"But there's nothing in the assignment provision as such that limits it, is there?"
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,3130.658,3134.429,Other than its language as to what it's for.
2005.04-1506,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3134.429,3148.873,"Well, it said... I'm looking at 1396k(a)(1)(A), which refers to assign to the State any rights to payment for medical care from any third party."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,3148.873,3149.214,Yes.
2005.04-1506,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3149.214,3150.095,There's no limitation in that.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,3150.095,3179.805,"Payments... the right to payments for medical care, which we believe is the language of limitation in that the State is... in effect, is seeking an assignment of the entire cause of action not just that that is related to the right to payment for medical care, which is simply a component of the claim that may have 5 cents on the dollar value or 100 cents, depending on what the facts of the case are."
2005.04-1506,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3179.805,3184.498,Is there any reason that the Federal law would have to act as a limitation on the State law?
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,3205.659,3208.357,In the absence of the anti lien statute.
2005.04-1506,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3208.357,3208.697,In the absence of the anti lien.
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,3208.697,3219.598,"In the absence of the anti lien statute, the State statute would be, in my opinion... the State would be allowed to take a greater lien than provided by Federal law."
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3238.546,3262.347,"--But I assume the State... the State tries to get around that by saying it never... never became the property of your client, that by reason of the assignment provision, all choses in action automatically vest in the State, causes of action arising out of transactions in which there's a claim for Medicaid compensation."
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,3262.347,3263.22,--I... I--
2005.04-1506,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3263.22,3268.416,"But you say... you say they can't do that because, at the time the accident occurs, you don't even know that there's going to be a claim--"
2005.04-1506,2,26558,h_david_blair,,3268.416,3271.867,"--I say... excuse me, Your Honor."
2005.04-1506,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3360.924,3362.709,"Thank you, Mr. Blair."
2005.04-1506,3,34426,lori_freno,,3365.477,3367.122,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2005.04-1506,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3439.116,3439.587,Excuse me.
2005.04-1506,3,34426,lori_freno,,3447.499,3448.442,"--No, it does not, and it--"
2005.04-1506,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3448.442,3450.84,"Well, then it doesn't matter as far as the Medicaid funds are concerned."
2005.04-1506,3,34426,lori_freno,,3452.935,3458.311,"--It comes out of general State revenues, but the amount of general State revenues that are there are what is available to put back into the Medicaid fund."
2005.04-1506,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3484.629,3485.6,"Thank you, Ms. Freno."
2005.04-1506,3,34426,lori_freno,,3485.6,3485.6,Thank you.
2005.04-1506,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3485.6,3489.6,The case is submitted.
