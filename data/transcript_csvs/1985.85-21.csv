1985.85-21,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.934,We will hear arguments first this morning in Square D Company against Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau.
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,15.87,42.749,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue presented in this proceeding is whether motor carriers who conspire in violation of the antitrust laws, who violate their filed rate bureau agreement, and who violate provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act are immune from damage suits brought under the antitrust laws by the victims of their illegal conspiracy."
1985.85-21,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,122.748,125.746,Are you asking that Keogh be overruled?
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,125.746,127.823,"Yes, I am, Your Honor."
1985.85-21,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,127.823,129.48,Specifically?
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,129.48,130.806,Yes.
1985.85-21,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,148.736,151.017,Do you lose if we don't overrule?
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,151.017,152.626,Do I lose?
1985.85-21,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,152.626,154.921,If we don't overrule Keogh.
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,154.921,157.436,We are not able to pursue our damage claims.
1985.85-21,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,229.767,231.937,May I ask this question?
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,238.715,251.431,"I am not sure I entirely understand the question, Justice Powell, because the part of the damage claim relating to coercion would still be valid."
1985.85-21,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,269.797,279.95,"I am not sure I understand the case either, but if the filed rates had been specifically approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, would you be here?"
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,279.95,280.809,"Yes, sir, I would."
1985.85-21,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,280.809,282.151,Assuming no violation.
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,282.151,286.056,We are not attacking the ratemaking process.
1985.85-21,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,302.847,308.234,I understand the ICC has not approved this particular rate schedule.
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,322.291,327.462,--If the rates were filed and became effective after 30 days?
1985.85-21,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,327.462,327.775,Yes.
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,327.775,329.757,"Yes, we would, and the reason--"
1985.85-21,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,329.757,330.836,You would still be here.
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,330.836,331.678,--We would still be here.
1985.85-21,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,331.678,339.301,So the allegations of ignoring their own rate schedule are not essential to your claims.
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,339.301,350.937,"Well, what they ignored was the method of fixing rates which was approved by the Commission, and that is what they had statutory authority to do."
1985.85-21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,501.329,505.607,"Well, would you have any remedy at all before the ICC?"
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,505.607,510.45,"As a practical matter, the answer is no."
1985.85-21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,518.18,519.305,"I understand that, but--"
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,519.305,520.086,--Yes.
1985.85-21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.086,522.68,--why couldn't you get relief before the ICC?
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,522.68,527.583,We cannot get relief before the ICC for probably four reasons.
1985.85-21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,560.007,562.757,"The statute probably wasn't running, then, was it?"
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,562.757,565.474,--That would be a case of first impression.
1985.85-21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.644,567.847,"Well, go ahead."
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,567.847,568.894,--concealment would apply?
1985.85-21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,572.753,574.299,Why else--
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,574.299,583.92,"The third question is, another case of first impression, whether the ICC retains the authority to cancel expired tariffs."
1985.85-21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,594.508,596.289,--What would be your measure of damages?
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,596.289,599.148,--What would be the measure of damages?
1985.85-21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,603.067,609.691,"I know, but in this antitrust case what would you measure your damages by?"
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,609.691,617.734,The measure of damages would be the difference between the rates which the shippers paid and the rate levels which would have prevailed absent the antitrust--
1985.85-21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,617.734,618.5,How would you know that?
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,618.5,620.545,"--I am sorry, sir?"
1985.85-21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,620.545,621.717,How would you decide that?
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,621.717,626.948,By expert testimony just the same as in any other antitrust case.
1985.85-21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.257,642.974,You wouldn't have to resort to the ICC at all to establish what a reasonable rate would have been?
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,642.974,643.786,"No, we would not."
1985.85-21,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,688.767,690.455,Right.
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,703.199,705.387,Highly unlikely.
1985.85-21,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,705.387,713.758,"It is certainly possible, though, and it could subject carriers to very conflicting standards with respect to filed rates, it seems to me."
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,713.758,716.944,I don't believe so.
1985.85-21,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,793.131,796.693,Did the Maritime Commission have ratemaking authority?
1985.85-21,0,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,796.693,801.3,--The Maritime Commission had rate approval authority.
1985.85-21,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,886.172,895.122,Very well.
1985.85-21,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,895.965,919.049,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the complaints in this case were dismissed to seek recovery for damages under the Sherman Act, alleging that the respondents had engaged in conduct that was not approved and could not be approved by the ICC."
1985.85-21,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1022.086,1028.177,"If they violated the Interstate Commerce Act, isn't there some sort of relief before the Interstate Commerce Commission?"
1985.85-21,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1028.177,1044.78,The Commerce Commission can revoke tariffs that have been secured in violation of the kind of collaboration that is authorized by Reed-Bullwinkle.
1985.85-21,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1111.753,1114.737,There is no possibility of reparations then from the ICC?
1985.85-21,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1114.737,1126.655,Reparations are only if an unreasonable rate has been charted that is beyond the zone of reasonableness or if the tariff hasn't been complied with.
1985.85-21,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1126.655,1133.996,"Mr. Wallace, is the Solicitor General's office asking that Keogh be overruled specifically?"
1985.85-21,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1133.996,1167.889,"Keogh as it was interpreted and applied by the Court in Georgia against Pennsylvania Railroad, the broad rationale underlying Keogh, it would be possible to read the Keogh decision itself quite narrowly and say that it has been superseded by Reed-Bullwinkle in effect, but Keogh has generally been applied in accordance with its rationale, which would apply to any filed rate, whether approved by the Commission or not."
1985.85-21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.651,1178.149,What is the answer to the question?
1985.85-21,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1179.805,1184.772,"As it has been interpreted and applied in Georgia against Pennsylvania Railroad, yes."
1985.85-21,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1355.407,1357.765,"Mr. Wallace, could you refresh my recollection on the Carnation case?"
1985.85-21,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1370.245,1377.226,"My understanding is that they were, but I would have to look back to be sure about it."
1985.85-21,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1392.548,1398.311,"I understand, but of course that was an immunity case, and here the question is whether the Keogh takes away a remedy."
1985.85-21,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1398.311,1401.513,But that is a more limited implied immunity.
1985.85-21,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1415.852,1418.162,"But the conduct itself remained unlawful, as the--"
1985.85-21,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1418.162,1446.292,"That is correct, which to me cuts in favor of our position, because the respondents knew right along that their conduct was unlawful, and the question is whether they should retain the fruits of that violation or those injured should be recompensed, and it has been pointed out that very few of these rates are actually investigated and approved by the ICC."
1985.85-21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1462.38,1475.827,"--Your position would be the same in this case if the ICC had instituted an investigation of some of these rates and specifically approved them, found them to be within the zone of reasonableness."
1985.85-21,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1475.827,1496.74,"That would decide certain facts and that decision, if sustainable in the courts as a review of any administrative decision, would be controlling in the antitrust suit, but it wouldn't necessarily have decided all of the issues in the antitrust case."
1985.85-21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1496.74,1503.441,"Well, but you would still say that a suit for damages would lie."
1985.85-21,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1503.441,1508.862,"If there has been a violation of the antitrust laws that damage someone, we would take that position."
1985.85-21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1510.532,1521.215,"And you would say even though the ICC had approved the rate, the rates might have been lower except for the conspiracy."
1985.85-21,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1521.215,1538.443,"If that can be proved, and if there is a contention that the lower rate would not have been within the zone of reasonableness, or would have been discriminatory, those questions could be referred to the ICC for an answer if the ICC had not answered them in its--"
1985.85-21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.443,1547.845,You think the measure of damages in that situation would be the difference between what the rate might have been and the rate that was charged?
1985.85-21,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1547.845,1557.654,"--What it would have been, as one could reasonably show... in many antitrust cases it is not easy to prove the damages with precision."
1985.85-21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1564.058,1577.348,"Of course, if the rates had been lower, if there hadn't been a conspiracy, and the rate had been lower, all the competitors would have been paying a lower rate, too, so how would there have been damage to the business and property?"
1985.85-21,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1577.348,1582.722,"--Well, the damage might not have been in losing business to competitors."
1985.85-21,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1592.219,1595.826,"Mr. Wallace, just one quick question."
1985.85-21,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1600.903,1603.558,It does apply equally.
1985.85-21,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1615.755,1624.674,Mr. Flexner?
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,1624.674,1637.091,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this Court has never allowed plaintiffs to end run the Interstate Commerce Act by taking their rate complaints to the courts instead of to the Commission."
1985.85-21,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1710.561,1722.932,"Are you telling us that if the flaws and deficiencies in Keogh are correct, Congress should change that, not this Court."
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,1723.323,1726.556,"That is precisely right, Your Honor."
1985.85-21,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1759.058,1766.337,I did not read Judge Friendly's position as suggesting Keogh was wrong when it was decided.
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,1769.849,1771.052,"--I do not, Your Honor."
1985.85-21,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1772.052,1775.098,"And then it is changed conditions, is it not?"
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,1775.098,1800.432,"--That is the government's argument, but I think that is insufficient except as a policy rationale addressed to the Congress to justify overturning 60 years of established precedent, and we think, Your Honor, that this case simply can't be distinguished from Keogh and Georgia, as hard as petitioners have tried, Number One."
1985.85-21,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2017.874,2042.708,"Mr. Flexner, the Solicitor General suggests that the question of what the rate should have been absent the alleged collusion or antitrust activity could be referred by the Court to the Interstate Commerce Commission, so that would satisfy your concern."
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2042.708,2050.72,"Well, Justice O'Connor, there is no statutory provision that authorizes that procedure."
1985.85-21,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2107.26,2117.787,"But there is nothing inherently existing in the statutory framework, is there, to prevent a court from referring the question to the ICC?"
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2117.787,2126.971,"--Justice O'Connor, I think there is an issue as to whether or not it is congruent with what Congress wanted the Commission to do."
1985.85-21,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2207.142,2216.951,"Mr. Flexner, you said a moment ago that in Keogh the rates proposed by the defendants there could not have been approved by the Commission."
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2218.497,2249.625,"I meant to say, Justice Rehnquist, that while the rates themselves could be approved, the agreement from which the rates arose was beyond the authority of the Commission to approve or disapprove, so they were the... not rates made in compliance with the regulatory plan, but they were the product of a conspiracy which the Court at that time said was settled as illegal under the antitrust law."
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2249.625,2253.061,But nevertheless the rates were reasonable rates and were approved?
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2253.061,2265.244,"They were, Your Honor, but of course in the Georgia case the rates had neither been approved, and indeed, as here, were labeled coercive--"
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2265.244,2274.897,Keogh itself said or assumed or stated that the government could get after the conspirators.
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2274.897,2285.048,"--That is exactly right, Your Honor, and, of course, the defendants in this case have been sued by the government and are subject to very stringent injunctive provisions."
1985.85-21,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2398.299,2407.905,"Mr. Flexner, I understand your basic position, but I don't see how... there would be some situations in which a revocation of the existing rate would provide no remedy at all."
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2424.835,2435.643,"Our position, Justice Stevens, is that Congress set about to comprehensively define all the remedies that shippers would have."
1985.85-21,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2435.643,2436.065,"--Well, I understand your point."
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2443.968,2445.015,That is exactly--
1985.85-21,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2445.015,2447.186,Your treble damages and whatever changes.
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2447.186,2450.451,"--That is exactly right, and I must say--"
1985.85-21,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2450.451,2455.261,"I mean, I don't think you can argue that there are existing remedies that take care of the problem."
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2462.695,2466.599,--I would certainly concede that the Commission doesn't have treble damages and attorneys' fees.
1985.85-21,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2466.599,2473.425,"Sure, and there is nothing they can do if you preserve a rate against an otherwise... a decline that would otherwise normally follow."
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2473.425,2484.889,"But the point of their argument is that somehow this is because the remedy is different from before the Commission than it is what they would like under the antitrust laws, that that is ""unfair""."
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2484.889,2492.137,"Well, is there any... what could the Commission... what could the Commission do about rates that are no longer in effect?"
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2501.025,2531.792,"Your Honor, I think the answer is that under the new Act, the Motor Carrier Act, under nullification authority, perhaps they could nullify tariffs that were in effect in taking the rate back to the preexisting level, but the point is that Congress set up a scheme in which shippers on a day-to-day basis had rights that had no counterpart in the antitrust laws."
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2534.635,2548.911,"So you say if these people claim they were hurt by a rate that was set ten years ago and was in effect for two years, that is just tough, they should have gotten after it then."
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2548.911,2550.457,"--That is exactly right, Your Honor."
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2550.457,2551.332,So they are just barred.
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2551.332,2552.455,They are barred.
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.455,2553.674,So they have no remedy.
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2553.674,2555.485,They had the remedy.
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2555.485,2560.78,They have no remedy before the Commission except with respect to a rate that is now in effect.
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2560.78,2567.278,"That is correct, Your Honor, because that... because we are talking about a two-year statute of limitations--"
1985.85-21,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2567.278,2573.448,What makes you think the Commission wouldn't apply some tolling doctrine if there is an allegation of conspiracy and concealment?
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2573.448,2574.573,"--I don't know, Your Honor."
1985.85-21,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2577.259,2578.571,Why shouldn't they?
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2597.499,2605.106,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, there may be an argument that the Commission can decide that that is available to them."
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2929.911,2938.502,I take it if the Commission as far as money is concerned could only give reparations.
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2938.502,2953.37,"Reparations, Your Honor, and after the 1980 Act they can... and this Court's decision in ATA, there is now an additional remedy for shippers, which is the remedy to nullify the existing tariff--"
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2953.37,2961.837,"That may be so, but as far as money is concerned, there would be reparations then, but reparations would only be given if the rate was unreasonable."
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2961.837,2963.945,"--That is exactly right, because--"
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2963.945,2976.377,"So you would say that if these conspiratorial... if these rates which were set by a conspiracy turned out to be reasonable, there wouldn't be any relief before the Commission."
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2976.377,2979.984,"--Well, I would say that would be for the Commission to decide."
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2979.984,2995.4,"I know, but they would decide... they would say, well, certainly these carriers didn't abide by the right procedures to sake joint rates, but nevertheless the rates they came up with were within the zone of reasonableness."
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,2999.024,3002.257,"If the Commission made that decision, Your Honor--"
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3002.257,3003.257,No reparation.
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,3003.257,3062.17,"--there would be no reparations, and it would be because the plain language of the statute defined what rate is legal and what the shipper is entitled to, and the Commission and the courts are bound by that plain language, and in fact when the petitioners get up and they say we would like to put an expert on the stand who is going to testify that there was a competitive rate out here that would have been charged but for this alleged procedural violation, and we are entitled to a presumption that it falls within this broad band of... reasonableness, to do that, this Court would have to overrule Keogh, Montana-Dakota, and Arkdin, all of which stand for the proposition that a court may not assume anything about how a commission would apply a zone to a particular rate."
1985.85-21,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3067.23,3078.742,"I wonder, Mr. Flexner, if your argument would apply assuming there was a rate increase and the Commission took a look at it and then revoked it under the ATA case, so you wouldn't have a filed rate."
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,3080.959,3088.395,"That, Your Honor, I can say I know that is not this case, and it may be some future case."
1985.85-21,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3090.863,3092.236,Maybe they will never do that.
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,3092.236,3105.668,"--And if you proceeded on that basis given the Court's decision in ATA, you proceed at your own risk, but this is a case in which there is no dispute but that the rates were--"
1985.85-21,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3105.668,3111.447,Did the District Court have power to stay the proceeding until it found out whether the ICC might revoke the rates?
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,3111.447,3117.085,"--I think under this Court's opinions, Your Honor, on the stay and deferral procedure, it would not."
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3191.587,3195.616,What did the Bullwinkle Act do about antitrust immunity?
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,3195.616,3200.817,"It defined the circumstances, Your Honor, in which the government could prosecute."
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3200.817,3203.519,But nobody else?
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,3207.33,3219.217,"It created an express immunity because when you read the legislative history, it is clear that the need for the legislation was to create certainty where government prosecutions had been creating--"
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3219.217,3225.744,But there is no argument in this case that that express immunity would apply.
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,3225.744,3231.148,"--Oh, we would contend it does apply, Your Honor, and I must say--"
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3231.148,3235.865,Do you insist that you complied with the procedures?
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,3235.865,3237.349,"--We do, Your Honor."
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3239.536,3249.828,"Let's assume that it were proved that you did not comply, that your clients did not comply with those procedures, there would be no express immunity."
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,3249.828,3251.438,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.85-21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3251.438,3261.042,Do you think that immunity that they were talking about was just immunity from government suit?
1985.85-21,2,20838,donald_l_flexner,,3261.042,3300.885,"I believe so, Your Honor, and the reason I do is the legislative history makes it clear that with respect to rate levels and whether particular rates that arise out of what we have been calling a procedural violation violate the Act because they are unreasonable or discriminatory, that is a matter that can only be decided by the Commission according to those special standards, and there is no necessary relationship between the procedural violation and whether that legal entitlement has been undermined, and that, it seems to us, is the key."
1985.85-21,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3311.912,3317.597,Very well.
1985.85-21,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,3318.129,3354.786,"The Court just heard Mr. Flexner tell it, that if wrongdoers can violate the antitrust laws and the Interstate Commerce Act and get away with it by concealing a conspiracy for a long period of time, they get to pocket the money, they should be unjustly enriched, and the people who were victimized should lose that money, and he tells you that that is what Congress had in mind when it passed the Reed-Bullwinkle Act which gave them an express antitrust immunity."
1985.85-21,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3375.591,3389.459,Do you think that the considerations expressed by Judge Friendly and to some extent reiterated in the government's brief now have escaped the attention of Congress over the years?
1985.85-21,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,3389.459,3394.192,I think that Congress believed that it had handled that problem in the Reed-Bullwinkle Act.
1985.85-21,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3439.095,3442.407,You left out in that list of cases the Southern Motor Carrier case.
1985.85-21,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,3445.343,3453.293,"The Southern Motor Carrier... that is a case, I believe, of justifiable reliance in terms... I think that that case was only sited."
1985.85-21,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3453.293,3459.197,--Do you think the Reed-Bullwinkle Act was response to Keogh or a response to the Georgia case.
1985.85-21,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,3459.197,3471.832,"I think that the Reed-Bullwinkle Act was a comprehensive attempt to deal with it, and I think we can follow through on that analysis by asking what happens if Keogh is overruled."
1985.85-21,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3505.178,3507.364,"He was saying what his position would be at trial, I think."
1985.85-21,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,3510.176,3514.97,"--That is right, and those coercive activities never could have been approved."
1985.85-21,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3551.284,3560.031,--You say Reed-Bullwinkle was a Congressional effort to--
1985.85-21,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,3560.031,3561.171,To comprehensively--
1985.85-21,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3561.171,3564.123,--comprehensively deal with this.
1985.85-21,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,3571.948,3581.444,--I don't think that they... I think that what they thought they were doing was setting a game plan showing how you could obtain regulatory immunity.
1985.85-21,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3581.444,3583.99,"After all, Keogh was a case of statutory construction."
1985.85-21,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,3583.99,3590.644,"No, I think I would disagree with you, respectfully, Justice White."
1985.85-21,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3590.644,3592.533,"It certainly wasn't a constitutional law case, was it?"
1985.85-21,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,3592.533,3597.265,They had two statutes that couldn't be read--
1985.85-21,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3597.265,3598.156,"Well, so--"
1985.85-21,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,3598.156,3604.216,--I think that Congress dropped the ball and the Court had to come up with something.
1985.85-21,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3604.216,3607.168,"--The statutory construction had been on the books a long time, and here comes Reed-Bullwinkle."
1985.85-21,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,3618.96,3626.816,"If you look at the express words of the statute, they say you may have immunity from the antitrust laws, but there is a quid pro quo."
1985.85-21,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3685.262,3686.2,Very well.
