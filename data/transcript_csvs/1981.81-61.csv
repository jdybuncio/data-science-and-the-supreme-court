1981.81-61,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.535,We will hear arguments next in United Mine Workers against Robinson.
1981.81-61,0,22334,e_calvin_golumbic,,16.693,36.673,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the court of appeals in this case decided that the substantive terms of the collective bargaining agreement embodied in an employee benefit trust was subject to review by federal courts for reasonableness, under the sole and exclusive benefit provision of Section 302(c)(5) of the Taft-Hartley Act."
1981.81-61,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,96.628,98.18,"But it was bargaining, wasn't it?"
1981.81-61,0,22334,e_calvin_golumbic,,98.18,99.58,--Excuse me?
1981.81-61,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,99.58,100.782,It was bargaining?
1981.81-61,0,22334,e_calvin_golumbic,,100.782,116.458,"The issue was bargained from the day the bargaining commenced until, indeed, the parties decided to agree in order to agree to a final bargaining agreement in order to avoid a strike."
1981.81-61,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,193.375,195.51,Do you think those cases are correctly decided?
1981.81-61,0,22334,e_calvin_golumbic,,195.51,214.822,"I think those cases are correctly decided, Justice Rehnquist, insofar... insofar as they rest on the jurisdictional basis of a court of equity to review the discretionary acts of trustees, and insofar as they decided that in those particular instances, in those cases the trustees had abused their discretion."
1981.81-61,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,214.822,217.34,Properly decided under 302(c)(5)?
1981.81-61,0,22334,e_calvin_golumbic,,217.34,231.949,"The cases were decided on the authority of a court of equity to review the discretionary acts of trustees, and in no instance did the cases rest on a jurisdictional basis under the Taft-Hartley Act, such as Section 302(c) or 302(e)."
1981.81-61,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,496.938,504.344,Mr. Sword?
1981.81-61,1,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,504.344,513.699,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, it is important at the outset to note the limits of this case."
1981.81-61,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,562.68,569.702,"Mr. Sword, even though your opponent concedes that point, and he did in response to Justice Rehnquist's question, this Court has never so held, has it?"
1981.81-61,1,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,582.058,586.212,That issue has never been before this Court.
1981.81-61,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,596.067,604.006,"It didn't say anything about their duties being reviewable by a court, the performance of their duties being reviewable by a court?"
1981.81-61,1,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,604.006,607.892,--I don't believe that any court has ever said that their duties are not reviewable.
1981.81-61,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,607.892,610.494,"Well, has it ever said that they are reviewable, is my question."
1981.81-61,1,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,613.712,621.885,I believe that the AMAX case talks about the differences between bargaining representatives and the trustees.
1981.81-61,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,621.885,626.437,But didn't say that there are fiduciary duties on trustees?
1981.81-61,1,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,626.437,627.354,"Yes, it did."
1981.81-61,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,627.354,629.256,Subject to the supervision of a court of equity?
1981.81-61,1,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,629.256,629.922,Indeed.
1981.81-61,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,629.922,634.276,"So they are reviewable, their decisions, in terms of 302 standards?"
1981.81-61,1,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,634.276,640.846,We take the position that trustees are... their duties are reviewable.
1981.81-61,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,640.846,641.58,"Well, AMAX hardly dealt with the question of reviewing discretion."
1981.81-61,1,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,644.548,646.5,That's correct.
1981.81-61,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,674.567,680.055,But there are certainly no cases around that say that the courts may modify the eligibility requirements.
1981.81-61,1,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,688.744,708.924,"Except this one, maybe, and the Congress has shown in enacting ERISA, it has provided that trustees are to follow the trust documents only insofar as the trust documents do not cause a breach of any fiduciary duty."
1981.81-61,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,733.789,738.658,"Of course, on that point, they also would have gotten $5,000 instead of $2,000 in severance pay, wouldn't they?"
1981.81-61,1,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,738.658,741.026,--Not all persons in the respondents' class.
1981.81-61,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,741.026,741.976,"Some of them would, wouldn't they?"
1981.81-61,1,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,741.976,744.061,"Some of them would, but--"
1981.81-61,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,744.061,749.779,"Are you contending that that also violated the agreement, the disparate treatment, $5,000 for some and $2,000 for others?"
1981.81-61,1,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,749.779,750.465,--No.
1981.81-61,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,768.343,770.127,Even if he was eligible for benefits?
1981.81-61,1,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,770.127,771.629,If he was eligible or not.
1981.81-61,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.133,860.02,"Well, if that distinction is arbitrary, the distinction between the $5,000 and $2,000 death benefits is equally arbitrary, isn't it?"
1981.81-61,2,22334,e_calvin_golumbic,,860.02,885.635,"Not necessarily, because the death benefit, this $5,000, $2,000 difference is talking about a death benefit, which is a benefit that is provided to the widow of an active miner, and there could be some considerations for the payment of a larger benefit to the widow of someone who is actively working at death."
1981.81-61,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,889.087,901.929,"Well, I thought it was the other way around, that the one who was the widow of a retired miner got the $5,000, and the widow of a pension-eligible worker who still worked... Do I have it backwards?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,901.929,902.912,Yes.
1981.81-61,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,919.755,920.155,I see.
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,920.155,921.521,"--would receive $5,000."
1981.81-61,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1022.216,1030.62,"Well, isn't the question rather whether it can immunize it from judicial review or whether judicial review is permissible, or authorized?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1030.62,1045.647,"--Well, be contented that judicial review is clearly authorized, that without judicial review these beneficiaries of these funds would in no way have protection."
1981.81-61,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1045.647,1050.765,"Well, that doesn't answer the question, to say that someone is without protection, I mean, if there is no judicial review."
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1057.019,1066.81,"We contend that that authority is within Section 302 of Taft-Hartley, and within the cases that have interpreted that provision."
1981.81-61,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1197.076,1210.502,"Mr. Sword, there really isn't anything, is there, in the legislative history that shows a Congressional intent to set a substantive standard for eligibility retirements, is there?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1210.502,1228.897,"--There is nothing in the legislative history to show, you know, the substantive requirements as far as how many years of work or anything along those lines, but the legislative intent does show that Congress couched Section 302 in trust terms so that the workers would be protected."
1981.81-61,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1228.897,1241.973,"Well, isn't every indication that the sole and exclusive benefit to prevent provision in the legislation was to prevent the union officials from using the trust funds for their own benefit?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1247.259,1258.25,"The sole and exclusive benefit language shows that Congress wanted these funds to be used for the benefit of the workers, and not for the benefit of the union."
1981.81-61,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1258.25,1258.75,Right.
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1258.75,1278.063,"We contend that the evidence in this case shows one example of, if there is no judicial review, of what the trust... how the trust could be used to further union benefits, because it is clear in the negotiations in this case that the collective bargainers were not concerned with the merits of any of the classes."
1981.81-61,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1351.278,1353.144,"Well, there is another reason for that, too, isn't there?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1375.56,1376.094,--Yes.
1981.81-61,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1381.214,1389.051,"But would you not agree that they could have... if they had denied benefits for all widows of previously deceased miners, you would have no case."
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1389.051,1400.425,"We would have a case if they were granting, as they did in this provision, benefits to the widows of men who had quit work in the past."
1981.81-61,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1408.548,1414.685,"Well, say they denied benefits to all widows of deceased miners and all families of retired miners."
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1414.685,1417.387,--And if they were only providing benefits to--
1981.81-61,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1417.387,1418.371,Current workers.
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1418.371,1424.208,--Then we would not have the situation that we have in this case.
1981.81-61,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1424.208,1425.409,"You wouldn't have any case at all, would you?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1425.409,1426.526,Then we would not have a case.
1981.81-61,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1446.923,1467.486,"What if they found a situation in which they didn't think they had enough money to provide all the benefits that they wanted, and they just arbitrarily said, we will provide benefits for the people in Pennsylvania, but not in Ohio, and if we tried to do it equally the benefits would be so small they are not worth anything, so we would rather have substantial benefits for one group and for the others."
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1469.521,1472.14,The trustees contend that that would not even be reviewable.
1981.81-61,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1507.295,1511.598,"Well, the purpose always will be, I suppose, whenever you deny a class benefit, you save a little money."
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1511.598,1516.9,"Well, the cases have shown that the mere saving of money is not a justification."
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.837,1708.324,"Why do you sue the trustees, though?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1708.324,1715.362,"Under ERISA, suit can be brought against the trustees, and also under the very trust--"
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1715.362,1721.916,"Well, I know that solves your case for you very easily, but the people who are at fault are the settlors."
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1747.484,1749.501,"--That's correct, Justice White."
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1754.638,1761.058,Why didn't you sue the union and the management to have their agreement declared illegal under federal law?
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1761.058,1781.122,"The very wage agreement in this case and the trust documents themselves, Justice White, both provide that the trustees are to reform these trusts to comply with federal law, that the trustees are to reform this trust to comply with any court decisions."
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1782.888,1783.822,Against whom?
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1783.822,1786.24,--Against--
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1786.24,1791.244,Against court decisions... maybe court decisions against the union and the management.
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1791.244,1794.846,--Even the District Judge Gesell--
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1794.846,1808.439,"You mean, the trustees... you suggest that the trustees may look at the trust agreement and say, gee, we think this violates federal law, this collective bargaining agreement and the terms of the trust, so we just aren't going to pay out the benefits."
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1813.843,1827.067,"--We contend that when it was apparent to the trustees that this provision was arbitrary and unlawful, they could have gone back to the settlors and said, this is arbitrary, or they could have asked for a declaratory judgment."
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1827.067,1829.936,"I know, but you wouldn't say they could act on their own, would you?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1829.936,1833.638,"Under the trust documents, because the provision was unlawful--"
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1833.638,1834.304,"You mean, you suggest--"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1834.304,1836.94,--they had the ability to change the trust.
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1836.94,1838.04,"--Well, how do they know it was unlawful?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1838.04,1841.625,"When it was brought to their attention, they could see it, or--"
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1841.625,1842.375,"Well, by whom?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1842.375,1844.61,--When it was brought to their attention by--
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1844.61,1845.11,By whom?
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1845.11,1846.793,--Gracie Robinson and Juanita Hager--
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1846.793,1850.312,"Well, I know, but why do they have to take their word for the fact that it is illegal?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1850.312,1852.447,--They don't have to take their word.
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1853.08,1854.132,"Well, whose word do they take?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1854.132,1857.418,"--They could go to court, ask for a court's determination--"
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1857.418,1858.218,"Well, wouldn't they at least have to go to court?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1858.218,1861.62,"--They could go to court, and they could go back to collective bargaining."
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1861.62,1865.356,"Well, wouldn't they have to before they could vary... disregard the trust instrument?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1865.356,1867.123,They would not have to.
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1872.677,1873.693,If it is illegal.
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1873.693,1875.295,If it is--
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1875.295,1876.145,If it is illegal.
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1876.145,1877.081,--If it is unlawful.
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1877.081,1880.366,"Well, how do you know it is unlawful until somebody decides it?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1880.366,1885.418,If... they could go to court and have the court determine that.
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1885.418,1886.287,"They would have to, wouldn't they?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1886.287,1891.589,"They could, or they could have gone back to the collective bargainers and asked for--"
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.589,1892.089,I know.
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1901.028,1905.313,--Then the trustees should have asked for a judgment.
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1905.313,1906.598,"Well, I suggest you sued the wrong people."
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1906.598,1917.62,"We did not, because the trust documents themselves provide, and also under ERISA there is a provision that the plan itself can be sued."
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1917.62,1921.108,I don't think the trustees can give you relief by themselves.
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1921.108,1943.105,The district court found that the provision in the contract and a provision in the trust document both provided that the trustees were empowered to change this trust document if it was shown that the exclusion of this class was arbitrary and capricious.
1981.81-61,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.105,1943.972,Shown where?
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1943.972,1950.877,"If a court determined that the exclusion was arbitrary and capricious, the trustees were to change the documents."
1981.81-61,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1950.877,1955.329,"But the district judge thought otherwise, didn't he?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1955.329,1967.303,"The district judge concluded that based on the fact that it was collectively bargained, that therefore we were not entitled to relief."
1981.81-61,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1967.303,1969.422,"He said, bad bargain or not, it is a bargain, didn't he?"
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1969.422,1975.159,"He said that this provision was the result of collective bargaining, and so therefore it was--"
1981.81-61,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1975.159,1977.445,"Yes, and good or bad, it was a contract."
1981.81-61,3,35086,larry_franklin_sword,,1977.445,1986.717,"--That is what the district court found, and that is the incorrect standard to apply to a Section 302 trust."
1981.81-61,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2285.409,2292.663,"Your time has expired, Mr. Sword."
