2007.06-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,6.42,The Court will hear argument in Warner-Lambert against Kimberly Kent.
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,10.309,50.683,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Six years ago, this Court in Buckman recognized that policing fraud against Federal agencies is hardly a field the states have traditionally occupied."
2007.06-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,137.773,157.374,"Mr. Phillips, what if the statute didn't have that provision, but it just said you can bring a State tort action when the conditions approved by the FDA for the marketing of this drug have not been complied with?"
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,163.137,176.148,"I will acknowledge that's a fundamentally different issue, Justice Scalia, because there you are talking about what duties are owed to the public that are enforced by the FDA and potentially are enforceable by the states as well."
2007.06-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,180.896,184.753,It's a duty that is defined by the FDA.
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,188.909,193.437,"--That suit would not be barred, I don't think, by Buckman."
2007.06-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.136,233.827,"It doesn't seem to me... what I worry about is that if we say in this case it treads too much into the FDA's own responsibility to say what material should have been provided to the FDA, it seems to me the next what could be more central to the FDA... to the FDA's job than determining whether the conditions the FDA prescribed for the marketing of the drug have indeed been observed?"
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,235.046,239.748,"--I don't think it is an unreasonable next step, but it is clearly the next step that has to be taken."
2007.06-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,271.562,297.927,"But one can also reason in the opposite direction; that is to say, one can know from the medical devices portion of the FDA that Congress has no objection to private tort actions that... where the medical device manufacturer has not observed the requirements that the FDA's approval impose, right?"
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,323.932,341.565,"--It seems to me that the same argument you just made, Justice Scalia, would have led the Court to the opposite result in Buckman, because what's the... you know, if Congress didn't care about allowing State tort law to be... to serve as the enforcement mechanism, then why wouldn't you allow them to do that in that context as well?"
2007.06-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,350.687,360.698,"Well, It is... it is more of a stick in the eye of the Federal Government to create a cause of action that consists of defrauding the Federal Government, which is what was at issue in Buckman."
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,371.819,384.112,"Well, when you say ""here"" what we're talking... what we're talking about here is a very unique State statute that is the sole basis on which the tort liability is set aside."
2007.06-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,429.576,452.692,"Mr. Phillips, isn't... isn't the standard... in the standard tort claim, no Michigan statute, but a defense that's available to a drug manufacturer who is charged with putting on the market a defective drug, its regulatory compliance, right?"
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,452.692,453.645,Yes.
2007.06-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,453.645,462.595,And so the State of Michigan has said: Drug dealers... I'm sorry... drug sellers...--
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,511.886,520.227,"Well, I think what you're basically arguing for is an argument I think one of the amici made on the other side, which is: Does the greater power include the lesser power?"
2007.06-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,535.16,538.878,"You're arguing an unconstitutional condition, in effect."
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,538.878,541.002,"--Well, I think it is an unconstitutional condition."
2007.06-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,552.466,564.757,"If you're right in your argument, the Michigan statute provided two things: One good for the manufacturer, immunity; two, a qualification on it."
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,585.311,588.794,"Justice Ginsburg, that's clearly a question of State law."
2007.06-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.747,631.464,"Mr. Phillips, May I ask this question that's related to Justice Ginsburg's, but not the same."
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,637.273,637.727,Correct.
2007.06-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,637.727,651.096,"What if you didn't have a statute at all and you just had a common law lawsuit in which you defended on the ground of compliance with the Federal statute shows, the Federal program, shows a lack of negligence."
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,661.483,664.623,I think the question goes to how far that response goes.
2007.06-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,691.441,692.316,Let me just finish with one other thought before--
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,692.316,692.784,Sure.
2007.06-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,692.784,698.485,"--In one of your arguments and the government's argument, this is very burdensome to the FDA because we have all this litigation."
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,712.244,717.165,"I mean, the government is probably in a better position to evaluate that than I am."
2007.06-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,718.179,722.6,Because It seems to me that we have three or four States that have these statutes.
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,722.6,722.881,--Right.
2007.06-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,722.881,724.396,But most States don't have these statutes.
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,729.035,750.511,"Well, I think what the Court said in Buckman about that probably applies equally here, which is that, rather than look to see whether there is, in fact, going to be an interference, we ought to recognize that this is a territory that is locked off exclusively to the Federal Government's control, and we shouldn't... and there shouldn't be that external pull, the extraneous pull, that State law provides under these circumstances."
2007.06-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,763.521,771.127,"--Do you think there can also be the same argument for pre-empting the section, the subpart (b) of Michigan statute, the bribery exception?"
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,771.127,771.642,No.
2007.06-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,802.208,821.951,"What about the defense itself, which says that the defense is available if not only the drug was approved for safety and efficacy, but also if the drug and its labeling were in compliance with the FDA's approval at the time the drug left the control of the manufacturer?"
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,821.951,824.543,"Well, I think--"
2007.06-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,824.543,828.745,"Is it wrong to say that that's... you know, that that's interfering with the FDA's bailiwick?"
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,828.745,829.853,"--Well, I think when the--"
2007.06-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,829.853,831.01,Are you going to let a jury decide that?
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,831.01,832.917,"--No, I'm not going to let a jury decide that."
2007.06-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,838.774,839.274,Uh-huh.
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,839.274,844.943,"And, candidly, I think that is going to happen 99.999 percent of the time, because that's not going to be the issue."
2007.06-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,868.558,872.463,It seems to me what you are saying is: We're going to win this case even if there were no pre-emption.
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,872.463,878.319,"Even if there is no pre-emption on... on the... well, I hope I win this case regardless."
2007.06-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,878.319,884.208,"Because they have such a burden of proving that the drug wouldn't, in fact, have been withdrawn and so forth."
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,884.208,887.472,"Right, well... you mean I would have won this case on the merits of it?"
2007.06-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,887.472,887.878,Yes.
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,887.878,892.33,"Well, I mean, clearly we know that the FDA didn't withdrew this as a consequence of fraud."
2007.06-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,905.293,913.29,Let's just say you use something like primary jurisdiction said that they actually have to... to withdraw it.
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,930.409,931.954,"We don't have any problem with that, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,931.954,932.484,You don't have any problem.
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,932.484,933.579,"No, we were very--"
2007.06-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,933.579,933.922,That's not--
2007.06-1498,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,933.922,936.78,"--If the Court wanted to go that way, that's fine."
2007.06-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,945.105,948.51,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,958.037,971.188,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The Michigan statute presents the same conflict this Court found in Buckman, because it requires the determination of fraud on the FDA as a necessary predicate for establishing liability."
2007.06-1498,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,979.184,991.695,"Does your argument carry to the point of the same argument when regulatory compliance is raised as a defense, or regulatory violation is raised as a ground for liability?"
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,991.695,1004.238,"--It could depend, because in our view what's pre-empted here is a State court determination... under Buckman, what's pre-empted is a State court determination of whether the FDA was defrauded as part of FDA's approval process."
2007.06-1498,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1013.203,1028.992,"Well, whenever you... whenever you raise FDA compliance, there is at least the potential for a response that they... they defrauded the FDA; they didn't tell them what they should have, and... you know, vice versa, when... when it's raised on the other side."
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1034.538,1040.785,"Well... and what we would say is not pre-empted... I mean, it's hard to analyze this in the abstract without a record as to what a jury was actually being asked to do."
2007.06-1498,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1085.954,1090.64,"So it's the withdrawal element, withdrawal of approval that kills it here?"
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1090.64,1092.297,That's part of it but not all of it.
2007.06-1498,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1108.336,1127.984,"But if you get beyond the element of what the FDA would have done if it had known, then it seems to me you get into an issue which is likely to arise by... whenever, by one side or the other, the question of regulatory approval is... is offered as a mere matter of evidence."
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1127.984,1153.052,"Well, if it really is a mere matter of evidence, and that's not what the jury is be asked to find... and by the way, it's not at all clear that there's... that there's... it's settled common law tradition in this type of litigation, because the context here, where a Federal agency does a product-specific approval based in part on a submission of information from a manufacturer, that's not a... that's a question that, first, is of relatively modern vintage and, second, is not terribly common."
2007.06-1498,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1161.829,1169.701,"No, but that's what you've got here, except that the mere admissibility of the evidence turns in part on what the... the FDA would have done."
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1169.701,1170.358,"--Well, no--"
2007.06-1498,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1170.358,1192.489,"But essentially... I mean you... the fact is the evidence of the FDA approval is made admissible and conclusive, and whether that in fact may be admitted is subject to the... what is it... clause (b) that you object to, but it comes down to a question of admissibility."
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1192.489,1202.516,"--Well, it's not because the statute expressly requires, as a predicate for liability, a finding that the information disclosure requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act were violated."
2007.06-1498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1263.818,1265.225,May I ask this sort of general question?
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1288.09,1290.699,Nothing that... that that's beyond the--
2007.06-1498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.699,1291.699,The whole theoretical problem.
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1291.699,1295.573,"--Well, it's also a relatively new problem, and what... because... because it's--"
2007.06-1498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.573,1297.65,"The litigation is not, not new."
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1297.65,1305.645,"--Right, but the product-specific approvals, and the desire to probe into the circumstances surrounding a product-specific approval, is of relatively modern vintage."
2007.06-1498,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1318.797,1323.358,"Leaving aside Buckman, what's your strongest case in support of your position?"
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1328.589,1329.855,"Well, it is."
2007.06-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1364.061,1366.56,"Mr. Joseffer, let's assume that... that you're right."
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1401.592,1403.309,Right.
2007.06-1498,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1413.025,1414.071,"It was decided by the Sixth Circuit, wasn't it?"
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1414.071,1414.883,It was.
2007.06-1498,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1454.805,1456.867,This... this tracks somewhat Justice Stevens' question.
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1465.409,1465.721,Right.
2007.06-1498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1507.095,1510.469,"May I ask would you... is the bribery exception also pre-empted, do you think?"
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1510.469,1512.827,That's a... there's a very different analysis there.
2007.06-1498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1512.827,1513.358,I understand.
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1514.358,1534.601,"But we do think that that would be pre-empted because... for a slightly different reason, which is that the relationship between... the bribery of a Federal official in connection with his Federal duties is obviously a matter of paramount Federal concern, and when the... especially when the State is looking at that for purposes of essentially second-guessing the validity of a regulatory determination that FDA had made--"
2007.06-1498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1534.601,1538.067,--Supposing the... supposing the official pleaded guilty to bribery.
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1541.363,1546.424,"--Obviously, it still gets much closer, and at that point, I'm not sure that it would be."
2007.06-1498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1546.424,1554.717,It seems to me we've got a lot of theoretical litigation out here without much actual experience with any of these cases.
2007.06-1498,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1554.717,1571.554,"You know, what I was going to say is there are a lot of interesting issues surrounding this case, but none of them actually seem to be presented in this case, because here... I mean, the statute clearly requires a determination of fraud on the FDA, including all the elements I mentioned, as a necessary predicate for recovery; and, two, FDA has not made such a determination."
2007.06-1498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1572.273,1573.023,Thank you very much.
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,1580.8,1589.89,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Warner-Lambert marketed a defective product."
2007.06-1498,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1743.25,1751.043,The converse of that is that the discovery is exhaustive and quite burdensome.
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,1767.256,1768.225,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1790.356,1807.582,"All that makes... makes it worse, in a sense, because what you're saying to me anyway... and you can explain why I'm not right... that all of the three things that you mentioned are only aspects of something much more fundamental that underlies all these cases... Medtronics, drugs, all of them."
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,1870.166,1870.574,Well--
2007.06-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1870.574,1872.869,--because you want the jury to do it.
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,1885.989,1900.077,"--Well, I think I have a... State law torts suits aren't seeking to make a determination about whether the product should have gone on the market."
2007.06-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1918.538,1934.703,"Ms. Zieve, it doesn't object to a system where the... a court... the State would come in and give you your tort suit if it's really true that the agency would withdraw this drug."
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,1953.961,1954.523,But that is not--
2007.06-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1954.523,1959.615,--they want to save people whom you say they shouldn't because the drug shouldn't be there.
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,1963.192,1966.737,"--Well, this case doesn't seek to pull Rezulin from the market."
2007.06-1498,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1997.099,2002.175,"Your premise still is, is that the drug should not have been marketed, or is that your premise?"
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2002.175,2007.533,"--Well, under Michigan law, the plaintiffs can only--"
2007.06-1498,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2007.533,2013.983,"I know your purpose is different, but the premise on which you operate is that the drug should not have been sold."
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2013.983,2022.825,--The... if I can just back up to... to the structure of the Michigan statute--
2007.06-1498,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2022.825,2024.809,You can back up as long as you want as long as you come forward and answer.
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2025.044,2025.559,--I promise will.
2007.06-1498,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2095.858,2099.545,Aren't you going to tell this jury that the drug should not have been on the market?
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2099.545,2103.762,Yes.
2007.06-1498,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2162.582,2165.518,I thought under the Michigan scheme you don't have to show that.
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2170.047,2196.209,"--There are no Michigan cases explaining just what you need to show to satisfy the defense, so it is unclear whether you have to show that you met... if it is the right chemical formula, with the label originally approved, or does compliance with approval mean that you also had to show... one of the terms of approval is that you continued to update your label when you become aware of new safety information; would you have to show... a manufacturer have to show that to show that the defense was satisfied."
2007.06-1498,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2199.677,2204.706,It seems to me that you could prove that the... an exception to the defense applies and still lose your lawsuit?
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2204.706,2207.063,"--Absolutely, we could."
2007.06-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2242.331,2259.698,Would you explain why you think Mr. Joseffer was wrong when he argued that having a jury decide whether the FDA would have approved the drug or would have withdrawn it from the market if additional or different information had been supplied is incorrect?
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2265.351,2272.647,"Well, of course, in the specific facts of this case it wouldn't, because Rezulin is off the market and unapproved."
2007.06-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2308.585,2312.661,There wouldn't be discovery of internal processes within the FDA?
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2317.581,2322.814,"--Well, the parties may seek discovery."
2007.06-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2341.4,2367.062,"Wasn't... in this case one of the charges was that the original FDA examiner had recommended against approval for this drug, and then something happened inside the FDA, and that examiner was taken off the matter, and another one who approved it was put on?"
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2376.244,2383.475,"--Well, those are some of the background facts that happened here."
2007.06-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2429.271,2438.345,"Well, what evidence would you introduce to prove the... to prove the exception if the Second Circuit's decision stands?"
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2438.345,2444.703,"Deposition testimony from that medical officer, for example."
2007.06-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2483.203,2493.792,The question is: Would we be disrupting the FDA by taking depositions of examiners to find out what went on at the FDA?
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2493.792,2498.448,--No more so than product liability litigation in any other State.
2007.06-1498,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2573.463,2577.868,"I assume... I assume... you don't stop between sentences, so I hate to interrupt you."
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2627.99,2633.097,"--I don't know if they still could, but presumably sometime in the past they could have."
2007.06-1498,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2633.097,2639.485,Do you think we could have two different rules: One for drugs that are still out there and one for drugs that have since been withdrawn?
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2660.179,2673.017,"Well, the job the FDA is going to do, even if it agrees with a plaintiff, is to sanction the company, perhaps, or to ask it for different information."
2007.06-1498,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2675.876,2682.513,"No, but once it sanctions the Plaintiff, the Government can't make the argument you are interfering; you are second-guessing the FDA."
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2688.823,2710.799,"--There's no way for a plaintiff to compel the FDA to look into a situation of a manufacturer being dishonest for the... or to... even if the FDA starts a process for a plaintiff to compel the agency to make a finding that the company withheld material information, and we would not have approved it otherwise."
2007.06-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2734.134,2745.067,"Yes, but it will lead to the drug being withdrawn, in which case there may be just as many people on the other side who are dying, dead, no breadwinner, et cetera, because they didn't get a necessary drug."
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2763.31,2764.918,"But, again--"
2007.06-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2764.918,2766.746,So the the question is: Who is more likely to be right?
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2766.746,2786.128,"--With respect, I don't think that's the question, because if the jury... if a Michigan jury is wrong about what would have happened if Warner-Lambert hadn't acted so badly, the result is that Ms. Kent and the other Plaintiffs get to litigate their claims."
2007.06-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2788.456,2797.077,Then you think they should be able to litigate a claim where the FDA has approved a drug.
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2820.052,2822.363,--That is the law in every State.
2007.06-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2822.363,2823.129,So--
2007.06-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2823.129,2826.096,"That's been contested, and we are going to hear that case next term."
2007.06-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2826.096,2826.784,--That's the next issue.
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2826.784,2827.268,That's right.
2007.06-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2827.268,2827.628,Right.
2007.06-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2828.237,2828.565,I see.
2007.06-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2828.565,2835.858,"--at least since the 1930's, State tort litigation of the very kind that Justice Breyer has described has gone on."
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2853.508,2854.82,Absolutely.
2007.06-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2854.82,2855.477,That's how... that's how--
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2855.477,2855.693,Yes.
2007.06-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2863.675,2864.378,Why?
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2873.811,2874.952,That's right.
2007.06-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2876.593,2876.921,Thank you.
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2876.921,2890.134,"--to... not to create a new claim as the plaintiffs tried to do in Buckman, but, rather, to take a traditional claim and restrict plaintiff's ability to prevail on it."
2007.06-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2897.334,2931.243,"--Well, would you say that my characterization of it when Mr. Phillips was presenting his case, that this is an invigorated regulatory compliance defense, that it is more favorable, far more favorable, to the manufacturer than the standard regulatory compliance because it says that the manufacturer is immune, totally immune, unless... and then the exception that we are debating here."
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2943.331,2945.565,And I would go even further.
2007.06-1498,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2992.734,3001.839,And in your view could a State prohibit introduction of evidence by the defendant that the drug was approved by the FDA?
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3001.839,3010.399,Only to the extent that they simply thought it wasn't relevant.
2007.06-1498,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3011.351,3014.054,And all they say in the statute: We just think... they just think this is irrelevant.
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3014.054,3014.944,--Sure.
2007.06-1498,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3017.537,3019.037,But I don't think that's consistent with your position.
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3019.629,3039.746,"--There are States that don't allow compliance evidence if the plaintiff shows material misrepresentation, ""material"" being that it could have... could have influenced the agency without a finding that it did or would have influenced the agency, but just that it was pertinent information."
2007.06-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3065.579,3069.749,"So to me, which is a good answer, is you are saying: Look at the basic tort system here."
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3076.764,3087.556,"--If... if the traditional tort system as it exists in most every State is not pre-empted, then Michigan's statute is not pre-empted."
2007.06-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3087.556,3090.758,"Ms. Zieve, how many States have a statute like Michigan's?"
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3090.758,3102.753,The Michigan statute is unique with respect to the finding... the requirement that there be a finding of how the FDA would have acted if the manufacturer had not made certain representations.
2007.06-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3102.753,3103.034,No other State does that?
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3103.034,3106.642,Texas has a similar statute except it doesn't have that last element.
2007.06-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3126.9,3128.758,But was there any experience with this in Michigan?
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3133.429,3137.66,I believe it went into effect in March of '96.
2007.06-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3139.847,3145.627,"Have there been many trials to test this theory that it would be disruptive, that--"
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3145.627,3154.529,We were unable to find any reported cases or Westlaw discussion of--
2007.06-1498,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3154.529,3155.856,What's the Sixth Circuit case?
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3157.45,3166.228,"--Well, in the Sixth Circuit the plaintiff said: We can't prove the exception, but it is pre-empted and not severable."
2007.06-1498,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3169.149,3169.43,I see.
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3189.343,3203.51,"Well, in footnote 4 of the Second Circuit's decision, Justice Calabrezze points out that certification to the Michigan Supreme Court would also be an option, and an option that the court doesn't... that court didn't even get to."
2007.06-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3203.51,3207.087,"--The discussion in the Sixth Circuit was not very extensive on this point, on this--"
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3207.087,3208.429,"No, it wasn't."
2007.06-1498,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3223.346,3225.016,I want to be sure I understand something.
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3232.497,3233.341,That's right.
2007.06-1498,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3233.341,3234.372,I see.
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3235.918,3237.887,Yes.
2007.06-1498,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3243.665,3246.57,So the defendants kind of take the risk when they make the argument they are making.
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3248.695,3252.162,"--Well, that's right."
2007.06-1498,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3260.707,3264.799,"If there is no severability, the defense is gone, period."
2007.06-1498,2,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3264.799,3266.017,--That's right.
2007.06-1498,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3297.707,3298.098,Thank you.
2007.06-1498,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3303.69,3305.017,"Thank you, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-1498,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3332.006,3335.067,There was special consideration because of military considerations.
2007.06-1498,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3335.067,3338.005,"Well, I think that's what made it a uniquely Federal interest."
2007.06-1498,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3362.805,3369.46,"--I didn't think that the Second Circuit discussed severability, but I can go back and check."
2007.06-1498,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3369.46,3370.552,"Well, if you... if you--"
2007.06-1498,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3370.552,3376.13,"I thought that it had been raised there, but they didn't get to it because they--"
2007.06-1498,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3376.13,3392.92,"--I would suggest you read the Petition Appendix 14a, where it says on the one hand, under Factors we are bound to follow Garcia's conclusions as to questions of Michigan State law, and then the footnote reflects that the Sixth Circuit in Garcia had clearly decided the severability issue here."
2007.06-1498,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3393.451,3404.089,"--In a very, very quick... it isn't a very thoroughly reasoned discussion."
2007.06-1498,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3405.541,3407.821,--To be sure.
2007.06-1498,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3413.273,3420.003,"I mean, because it is odd... I mean, it is odd that you'd have a statute that says: Manufacturer, we're going to give you immunity, but there's an exception."
2007.06-1498,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3435.841,3438.214,"Oh, but there is a discussion of that in the Sixth Circuit decision."
2007.06-1498,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3461.127,3475.216,But the question is whether the legislature would have passed the statute that it did if in a case like this one the manufacturer could have the immunity without the exception.
2007.06-1498,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3475.216,3486.602,"All I'm saying is I think the Court addressed that in Garcia and specifically concluded that the legislature in fact would have passed that; And that traditionally, the Second Circuit would defer, as would this Court."
2007.06-1498,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3486.602,3490.74,It would be... it would be open to the Second Circuit on remand because it's not foreclosed.
2007.06-1498,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3490.74,3491.974,"No, clearly it's not foreclosed."
2007.06-1498,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3491.974,3495.677,"Well, unless they choose not to change their mind."
2007.06-1498,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3501.361,3501.767,Exactly.
2007.06-1498,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3501.767,3505.874,They said that: We are bound by Garcia as to questions of State law.
2007.06-1498,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3505.874,3506.28,Exactly.
2007.06-1498,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3527.444,3530.787,Does restitution for victims include damages?
2007.06-1498,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3530.787,3539.22,"--Well, whatever injuries... yeah, I mean, I don't know exactly what the sweep of restitution would be, but disgorgement of profits would certainly provide a mechanism for providing--"
2007.06-1498,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3539.22,3546.421,"Well, you're not talking about profits when you have an injured... a patient who died as a result of malpractice or something."
2007.06-1498,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3549.919,3551.075,--I understand that.
2007.06-1498,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3561.539,3568.225,"It couldn't give recovery to a class action of a couple of hundred plaintiffs who were injured, could it?"
2007.06-1498,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3571.349,3578.642,"--Well, as I understood the FDA's position is that they have pretty broad remedial authority and that it extends to some form of restitution to the victims."
2007.06-1498,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3578.97,3592.777,The government told us in its brief that the FDA has no system for addressing public complaints... this was in their brief at page 24... because that would divert attention from their primary mission.
2007.06-1498,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3599.369,3605.272,"--Well, I mean, there is a provision for citizen petitions that exists, that's cited."
2007.06-1498,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3606.741,3610.068,But The FDA doesn't have to do anything about it?
2007.06-1498,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3610.068,3610.349,"Well, no."
2007.06-1498,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3636.136,3637.62,The case is taken under advisement.
