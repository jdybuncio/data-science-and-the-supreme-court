1988.88-412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.378,"We will hear argument now in Number 88-412, Martin Hoffman versus Connecticut Department of Income Maintenance."
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,11.159,16.283,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,189.801,191.523,Where did you bring it?
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,191.523,195.176,"I brought both of these actions, Your Honor, in the Bankruptcy Court."
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,195.176,196.356,Before whom?
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,196.356,199.298,Before The Honorable Judge Krechevsky.
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,199.298,200.65,The bankruptcy judge?
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,200.65,201.381,The bankruptcy judge.
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,422.84,429.235,What about some claim against the state unrelated to their claim?
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,429.235,440.842,"No, they couldn't... they could not do anything unless they filed a voluntary... voluntary proof of claim in accordance with 106(a) and (b)."
1988.88-412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,442.533,450.259,But why would you need 106(a) after you have you 106(c)?
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,452.891,455.112,106(a)--
1988.88-412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,455.112,457.203,Assuming you read 106(c) the way you read it?
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,457.203,457.783,--The way I read it.
1988.88-412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.783,458.134,Um-hum.
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,458.134,474.114,"Well, 106(a) and (b) cover those situations where... one of the two ways that the state can obviously be brought before the court is one is to waive their jurisdiction and file a proof of claim, which they would do under (a) and (b)."
1988.88-412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.114,474.315,Right.
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,474.315,478.258,"But, as I'm here today, they didn't do it under (a) and (b)."
1988.88-412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,483.342,489.797,But you wouldn't need a waiver if you have a mandatory elimination of state sovereign immunity.
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,499.534,546.466,"I think that what happened was because the way the code section was codified and the way Congress worked at it, they had (a) and (b) and they had worked on it, and then they came to the situation where in the... except where they file a proof of claim, where they don't file a proof of claim and not assuming their... not withstanding their... their... their... they're assuming that they... they have sovereign immunity... not over... I'm sorry... not withstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity that they're... they would still... the trustee would have the opportunity to sue the state as long as it's under those certain situations that they give it to them because--"
1988.88-412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.466,557.072,"Well, I understand what you're saying, but... and... and maybe you give me an explanation for why it's such a strange statute, but it still is a very strange statute that you're... that... the way you're asking us to interpret it."
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,570.943,573.264,"--Only under certain circumstances, though, Justice Scalia."
1988.88-412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.264,577.458,"Well, what circumstance is covered by the first part that isn't covered by the second part?"
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,583.659,606.315,"Well, as I have stated in my brief, I've said that there are certain circumstances where there's lien avoidance, post-petition claims that in those particular circumstances that the state would not be bound unless they filed proof of claim."
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,608.728,621.426,But that... your interpretation of section... of (c) isn't the only interpretation that (c) is subject... is that is not the only way it might be interpreted.
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,630.743,631.744,"Yes, that is correct."
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,631.744,637.858,"And whether or not they filed claims, if you know from the books that you owe them, you list them, don't you?"
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,637.858,638.94,If the--
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.94,639.781,Don't you?
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,639.781,641.013,"--No, Your Honor."
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,641.013,645.265,Don't you anymore file a list of claims against the estate?
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,645.265,645.515,No.
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,655.041,655.472,"Yes, yes."
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,655.472,657.145,And they provided services.
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,657.145,657.325,Yes.
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,657.325,661.038,"They went out and they gave services to the state, and people--"
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.038,670.333,"In an ordinary liquidation bankruptcy, do you... do you ever allow a claim that... that some creditor hasn't filed for?"
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,670.333,672.986,"--No, they have to file a proof of claim."
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,672.986,681.012,You don't... you don't... you never allow... you never allow a claim that... that there hasn't been a proof of claim filed on?
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,681.012,684.793,Unless it's... no.
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.793,690.569,"When you know... when you know that the estate owes something, you don't say we should pay them?"
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,690.569,697.522,"If the state... if the estate owes an administrative claim, yes, we do pay them."
1988.88-412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,705.148,709.653,What about a creditor in possession of a secured in... a secured property?
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,713.716,734.412,"A creditor... a creditor that has secured property, Your Honor, if his property is liquidated by the Trustee, liquidated by the Trustee, then the lien... a lien as to the assets will attach, and he will get that money if he's entitled to it."
1988.88-412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,838.132,851.423,"It can't be unmistakably clear, if only because of the first phrase with which the... with which (c) is introduced which, as far as I can ascertain, is utterly meaningless."
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,857.539,858.268,"No matter what they... oh, I'm sorry."
1988.88-412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,873.028,873.278,--Well--
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,873.278,874.44,--the code sections.
1988.88-412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,874.44,877.762,"--But, boy, people don't talk that way."
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,906.281,913.277,"Well, except that it took... it took Congress 10 years to write 106(c)."
1988.88-412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,921.034,926.39,Do you think it would have been better if they had done it in a shorter time?
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,926.801,936.629,"Your Honor, it's true, though, but Congress is still changing and correcting the Bankruptcy Code and making it more clear."
1988.88-412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,951.29,962.407,"Well, why isn't the Second Circuit's reading and the District Court of Connecticut's reading just as plausible as yours, that (a) and (b) waive sovereign immunity when the state files a claim."
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,973.176,1005.726,"Well, the reason it is wrong... I mean, not... the reason that I take... I object... I say that it's different the way that I interpret it, the way the Seventh Circuit interprets it is because I look at creditor, entity and governmental unit as the words... I read the Bankruptcy Code as a whole, and they tell me to go to 542(b) to 547(b) and 550(a), which tell me that I can recover a monetary judgment against the state."
1988.88-412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1014.913,1021.038,"So, you don't rely on the specific language, then, of section 106?"
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1021.038,1024.911,I do as it encompasses the code as a whole.
1988.88-412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1024.911,1026.18,"Well, what does that mean?"
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1026.18,1052.928,"What it means, Your Honor, is that if there is a word in this statute 542(b) which has that word in there, and I can utilize that because all this says is that sovereign immunity is waived in those code sections such as 542(b) which has the word entity and says that I can collect a monetary debt."
1988.88-412,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1115.8,1118.191,May I just ask one other question.
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1143.209,1143.689,--Yes.
1988.88-412,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1148.374,1156.861,"So, your point is that (a) and (b) apply to 545 and 549, but do not apply to 542 or some of the others that have these triggering words in them?"
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1156.861,1161.735,"540... 545, 549, unless they file a proof of claim, it wouldn't apply."
1988.88-412,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1161.735,1170.882,"So that the... your answer, then, to Justice Scalia is that... is just that it depends on what the particular section... whether the particular section contains the triggering word or not?"
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1170.882,1173.814,"I think that what Congress... yes, Justice Stevens."
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.547,1229.212,"Well, the Court of Appeals didn't think that (c) was surplussage either, did they?"
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1229.212,1230.343,It did not.
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1230.343,1237.869,"It ruled against you, even though... even though... even... even in... in footnote 5 they thought that (c) had its own meaning."
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1237.869,1238.26,Yes.
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1259.978,1260.657,Yes.
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1260.657,1262.93,But--
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1262.93,1263.909,You were still hungry.
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1265.692,1271.054,"--Well, as it... well, I'm looking at the aspect of the Chapter 11."
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1311.955,1320.322,"Well, the state knows that if they just stay out of the... at least they thought if they just stay out of the proceeding, they won't have to pay the money."
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1320.322,1320.963,That's correct.
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1320.963,1323.116,Unless they're sued... unless you sue them in their own court.
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1323.116,1324.586,That's correct.
1988.88-412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1358.141,1363.476,"As you read this provision, it would apply even if you couldn't bring suit in state court."
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1391.625,1392.046,"Well, the--"
1988.88-412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1392.046,1394.998,That's a strange intent to attribute to Congress.
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1394.998,1411.19,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I think the... the nature of the Bankruptcy Code is to... to give an even distribution of assets to the creditors, not to the debtor, but to the creditors, those people that are owed money by the bankrupt estate."
1988.88-412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1442.04,1448.064,"Well, if they try... if they file a claim, you have them under section (a) and (b), don't you?"
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1448.064,1448.594,That is correct.
1988.88-412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1448.594,1453.169,"So, how do they get their tax claim paid without filing a claim?"
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1453.169,1454.09,They don't.
1988.88-412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1454.09,1460.503,"Well, then, aren't you out... you're actually going to be able to get your... what you regard as your just deserts... just deserts?"
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1460.503,1462.256,"It's not me, Justice Rehnquist."
1988.88-412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1466.27,1467.822,It's bigger than both of us.
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1469.071,1470.002,My name's on it.
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1470.522,1477.057,"Of course, the state may owe $4,000 and you may owe it only a thousand."
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1477.057,1479.508,That's correct.
1988.88-412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.508,1481.93,"So, they'd just as soon as keep the three."
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1481.93,1486.013,It does defeat the bankruptcy scheme.
1988.88-412,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1573.466,1585.475,Is it your position that the bankruptcy clause gives Congress any more extensive authority to subject states to liability than the commerce clause?
1988.88-412,0,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,1585.475,1588.267,No.
1988.88-412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1588.267,1592.408,"Thank you, Mr. Hoffman."
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1593.98,1605.317,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-412,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1666.739,1668.71,I thought you just did take a position on it?
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1668.71,1671.112,How so?
1988.88-412,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1671.112,1674.023,I thought you said that they were right on that point.
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1677.646,1677.826,"No, no."
1988.88-412,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1679.598,1679.839,Oh.
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1679.839,1688.245,"--the court can avoid reaching the constitutional question because the statute, properly construed, does not waive state sovereign immunity for actions for monetary relief."
1988.88-412,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1831.157,1832.118,I don't understand that.
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1833.54,1841.335,"Well, a good example would be your typical discharge situation, which can occur under a variety of sections of the code."
1988.88-412,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1856.516,1864.68,Your opponent says that... says that that's just a figment of the imagination because of the... you never unless... he says he never lists a creditor unless there's a claim filed.
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1867.622,1867.822,"Well, I--"
1988.88-412,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1867.822,1873.055,"--you... especially in a Chapter 11, the trustee files a list of creditors, doesn't he?"
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1873.055,1874.707,"--That's my understanding, Justice White, yes."
1988.88-412,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1881.222,1883.193,"Well, then it may be allowed."
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1884.984,1888.757,"--But if it's disallowed, then the creditor has not asserted any rights--"
1988.88-412,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1888.757,1888.907,Exactly.
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1889.718,1892.632,--at the end of the proceeding the discharge order is entered and that creditor is bound.
1988.88-412,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1892.632,1892.871,Right.
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1892.871,1897.054,"What 106(c) is saying, in effect, is that when the government's in that situation, it's bound."
1988.88-412,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1932.419,1933.799,You cite those in your brief?
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1933.799,1935.281,"Yes, they're cited in our brief."
1988.88-412,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1935.281,1935.512,Okay.
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1963.661,1965.641,"I have no explanation for that, Justice Scalia."
1988.88-412,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1965.641,1971.636,"Well, if you have no explanation for that, then... then... then the suggested reading you're proposing is not a very plausible suggested reading."
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1976.25,1978.632,"I don't think so, Justice Scalia."
1988.88-412,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.072,2056.185,Would your interpretation be any less plausible than it now is if subsection (1) were simply totally eliminated?
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2064.362,2068.576,"Well, there are some subsections that do not contain one of the triggering words."
1988.88-412,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2076.261,2076.431,I see.
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2076.431,2078.562,--and subsections of the code that do not contain these three words.
1988.88-412,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2078.562,2083.705,"And with respect to those, you would not be able to... your theory is you would not be able to bind--"
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2083.705,2084.196,That's correct.
1988.88-412,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2084.196,2084.426,--governmental.
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2084.426,2084.877,That's correct.
1988.88-412,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2086.779,2089.791,Do those provisions make any sense from a policy standpoint?
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2091.474,2099.358,"--I'm not sure whether it makes sense to... I mean, the list of ones that are included or the ones that are excluded, I'm not sure it make a lot of sense."
1988.88-412,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.358,2099.579,Yeah.
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2099.579,2105.315,We have not gone through and read every single section of the code that contains one of these triggering words.
1988.88-412,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2178.645,2180.387,"Yes, but, Mr. Merrill, may I interrupt you right on that point?"
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2180.387,2180.548,--Sure.
1988.88-412,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2180.548,2191.978,"If you incorporate by reference the sections that contain those words, you do incorporate 547(c), which talks about transfers that are avoidable as preferences."
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2209.949,2211.671,"I think you're right, Justice Stevens."
1988.88-412,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2215.524,2220.838,"On subpart (2) it gives you the consequence of it, namely the determination pursuant to this section is binding."
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2222.4,2223.281,--That's right.
1988.88-412,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2248.873,2249.403,They don't in (a) or (b) either.
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2249.594,2251.514,"--Well, (a) and (b) use the word ""claim""."
1988.88-412,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2251.514,2252.606,"--Well, I understand that."
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2252.606,2255.466,"And the word ""claim"" is defined by the Bankruptcy Code as a right to payment."
1988.88-412,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2279.726,2281.937,I don't know how you would introduce the word claim in it the way they've done it.
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2292.746,2299.89,"But not only is the word claim difficult to introduce, but any language that suggests an in personam type action is difficult to introduce in subsection (c)."
1988.88-412,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.89,2305.404,Is setting aside a voidable preference an in personam or an in rem transaction?
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2305.404,2307.635,We think it can be both.
1988.88-412,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.635,2310.788,"Well, then haven't you given your distinction away?"
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2310.788,2311.909,"Well, no."
1988.88-412,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2359.935,2362.607,Or recovery of monetary preferences?
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2365.409,2372.665,"Well, we think that that would fall under the... the retroactive monetary relief side of the line rather than the in rem side of the line."
1988.88-412,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2372.665,2377.866,"Mr. Merrill, I don't suppose you have any more explanation than anybody else of the magic words,"
1988.88-412,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2380.099,2383.021,"I don't have a great explanation for that, Justice Scalia."
1988.88-412,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2443.634,2445.966,"Thank you, Mr. Merrill."
1988.88-412,2,19928,clarine_nardi_riddle,,2446.717,2457.245,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-412,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2549.738,2561.976,May I ask at that point you think the Eleventh Amendment applies both to the exercise of Article III jurisdiction by courts and also the Article I jurisdiction by courts that are created pursuant to Article I?
1988.88-412,2,19928,clarine_nardi_riddle,,2561.976,2562.407,Yes.
1988.88-412,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2562.407,2563.058,You do.
1988.88-412,2,19928,clarine_nardi_riddle,,2568.103,2569.082,Absolutely.
1988.88-412,3,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,2927.672,2929.074,"Yes, I do."
1988.88-412,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2986.523,2990.356,"That was the situation in the Chandler Act, wasn't it?"
1988.88-412,3,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,2990.356,2992.927,--The Chandler Act was in 1938.
1988.88-412,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2992.927,2994.008,"Well, I know, I know, I know."
1988.88-412,3,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,2994.008,2994.329,And that was--
1988.88-412,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2994.329,2997.771,"So, in this respect you say the new law changed things?"
1988.88-412,3,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,2997.771,2999.334,"--That's right... correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-412,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3023.47,3025.273,"Yes, and they are allowed for that."
1988.88-412,3,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,3025.273,3026.842,They are allowed in a Chapter 11.
1988.88-412,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3026.842,3027.023,Yes.
1988.88-412,3,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,3038.53,3039.962,Unless the trustee objects to it.
1988.88-412,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3039.962,3040.603,"Yes, exactly."
1988.88-412,3,35973,martin_w_hoffman,,3051.332,3056.976,"It's a footnote, Your Honor, which... it's a little footnote that says 545 and 545(a)."
1988.88-412,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3149.668,3150.67,"Thank you, Mr. Hoffman."
