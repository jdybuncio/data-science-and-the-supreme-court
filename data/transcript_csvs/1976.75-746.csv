1976.75-746,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,19.024,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 75-746, Atlas Roofing against the Occupational Safety and Health Commission and the related case Irey against the Commission."
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,23.135,26.151,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,468.381,472.657,What’s your interpretation of the case?
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,472.657,491.863,"Mr. Justice, our interpretation of Jones & Laughlin merely stands for this doctrine that Congress can vest an administrative agency with traditional acquirer roles that is the seize and desist power, which is an equitable injunction remedy and an incidental back pay remedy which is a classic restitutionary remedy."
1976.75-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,499.478,503.358,What if the NLRB in that case had ordered only back pay?
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,507.141,514.705,"If the back pay is a restitutionary type of remedy, I would say that would be permissible in that case."
1976.75-746,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,539.037,545.821,Do you limit your argument to cases where the sanction is a money sanction.
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,545.821,554.978,"We, in this case, we are not trying to invalidate any abatement powers of the court."
1976.75-746,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,595.285,612.079,"Do you recognize that the administrative regulatory agencies can sometimes decide the questions involve not $5,000 but millions of dollars without the intervention of a jury trial."
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,612.079,629.757,"Yes sir, we do recognize that and as did as I cited Professor Davis, in his plea, he said, they can involve regulatory orders involving millions of dollars, but they cannot asses $20 in a penalty, in Professor Davis’ plea that we have cited to."
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,641.336,646.581,"At what stage in this procedure, do you think jury trial attaches?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,658.644,660.643,"It’s, yes sir."
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,660.643,660.749,Could you describe a little bit?
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,660.749,672.489,"Mr. Justice, at any stage either under the normal regulatory penal powers, they either have to bring the penalties originally in court or they have de novo review."
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,672.489,673.0,Before a jury.
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,673.0,685.557,"In this case, neither is provided, as a matter it’s expressly stated that it will not be provided, but -- and it even has conclusions that the facts of the Commission are supported on substantial evidence."
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,688.173,701.285,"But your submission of the Seventh Amendment would be satisfied, would it, if the jury trial were provided either to try the original assessment of the penalty or by de novo review later at the end of the proceeding?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,701.285,702.92,That’s profound Mr. Justice Stewart.
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,703.783,707.205,"The Seventh Amendment, in your submission, would be satisfied in either event, is that it?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,707.205,707.857,Yes sir.
1976.75-746,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,707.857,711.546,"Before whom, a court?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,711.546,713.477,"Before a court, an Article III Court."
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,713.477,713.996,And a jury.
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,713.996,716.131,And a jury or a --
1976.75-746,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,716.131,716.354,Then you may --
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,716.354,722.282,"A jury -- it doesn’t stipulate, of course, as to whether the local preserver would be an Article III Court, we would submit it."
1976.75-746,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,722.282,723.517,Or at District Court?
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,723.517,723.929,At least a court.
1976.75-746,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,723.929,726.012,Court of Appeals even have a jury.
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,726.012,727.137,Court of Appeals would not have a jury.
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,727.137,729.041,"There is a Court of Appeals review now, isn’t there?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,729.041,734.512,There is a limited Court of Appeals review where they have a substantial evidence test.
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,734.512,734.936,Right.
1976.75-746,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,734.936,735.965,Universal Camera.
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,735.965,741.767,"Universal Camera, but in Universal Camera there was no fines being sought."
1976.75-746,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,755.123,769.098,"Mr. Stokes, going to your broad position that you can’t commit this power of executives, supposing, there were that two stage procedure, where there was, first, the determination of the violation and an order to comply; and then a refusal to comply with that order."
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,776.326,779.154,There is a similar -- yes sir and that would be in a separate proceeding.
1976.75-746,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,797.141,801.726,"I understand that’s not directly involved, and I am wondering if your argument would cover that situation as well."
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,801.726,803.005,"Well, that would be a separate proceedings."
1976.75-746,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,806.256,809.325,But do you contend there would be jury trial required in that procedure?
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,809.325,812.88,"Right, yes sir, Mr. Justice."
1976.75-746,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,824.33,838.073,"But why wouldn’t there be, why wouldn’t the answer to the jury trial requirement be that that’s analogous to an equitable proceeding where there has never been a requirement of a jury trial and contempt for violation of the injunction?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,838.073,840.606,"Again, they are seeking a monetary penalty."
1976.75-746,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,870.166,877.256,"Well, violation of an injunction, the suit for money for violating an injunction would not be a classic suit at Common Law."
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,877.256,885.32,"That could -- yes sir; that could be that it is not and that depending on the penalty, it would be in a nature of a contempt type of case."
1976.75-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,885.32,897.709,"Well in your FTC enforcement proceedings, they go the Court of Appeals and if you disobey an order, the Court of Appeals, enforcing the administrative order, you are subject to contempt and you don’t have a jury trial in the Court of Appeals, do you?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,897.709,916.14,"On the contempt issue, but it’s my understanding that procedure is correct that you do not have a jury trial, but if you do not comply with the order of the Commission, you then face, I believe it is up to a $5,000 a day penalty, which is brought directly in court."
1976.75-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,916.14,916.686,In the District Court?
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,916.686,922.623,"In the District Court, in the FTC regulations; it’s my understanding."
1976.75-746,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,923.355,942.793,"But, in your case if the ruling is that you seize and desist what you are doing, put your place in safe order, stop killing people, and incidentally pay $5,000 fine, you are not contesting the whole first part, you are contesting the last part."
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,942.793,944.61,"It is the $5,000 fine which we --"
1976.75-746,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,944.61,946.042,The rest is okay without a jury trial?
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,946.042,957.273,"In this case, there was no contention that there was not abatement once the ditch was closed up immediately and it was never an issue in the case, in the Frank Irey case."
1976.75-746,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,957.273,967.117,"And in the old traditional case where you get an injunction and damages, you say that in the second part you have that with jury and in the first part you don’t."
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,967.117,971.17,That would be our interpretation Mr. Justice Marshall.
1976.75-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,999.783,1008.899,"Why is the power that Government, under the Commerce Clause, so much less than its power under Tax Clause or under the Immigration Clause, if there is an immigration?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1008.899,1023.886,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, under the -- traditionally the Government has always had, the legislative part of Government executive part of Government, albeit all governments, have had the power to control its boards free from the interference of courts."
1976.75-746,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1075.544,1076.373,Mr. Stokes?
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1076.373,1077.147,Yes sir.
1976.75-746,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1077.147,1081.414,"Going back to my brother Marshall’s question, what kind of trial would you have in the District Court?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1082.889,1089.05,"There would be de novo review on the facts, which is very similar to the other statutes with which we are familiar with."
1976.75-746,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1090.977,1092.789,No res judicata at all?
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1092.789,1093.841,Not on the penalty cases.
1976.75-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1102.708,1109.555,Even though the administrative finding has been sustained on appeal.
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1109.555,1110.953,That would be our position.
1976.75-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.953,1117.786,"Well, let’s suppose that it has been tried out before the administrative agency and it goes to the Court of Appeals on the record, is that right?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1117.786,1118.866,"It goes on the record, sir."
1976.75-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1118.866,1120.411,And it’s sustained.
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1120.411,1121.53,It’s sustained.
1976.75-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.53,1127.537,And then you would say that the Government wants to sue you for occurrence and it’s de novo in the District Court.
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1127.537,1130.482,If you do not give de novo review on the facts in the District Court --
1976.75-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1130.482,1132.44,"That’s right, but you don’t have a right to jury trial."
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1132.44,1138.045,"That’s right, you have no right to jury trial and there is nothing left."
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1138.045,1152.401,"I am following up my brother Brennan’s question, the issues would be at least two in your submission, whether or not there was a violation and that assuming there was a finding, there was a violation of what the amount of the penalty should be?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1152.401,1159.522,"That would be opposition, of course, fines could be determined judicially since fines are traditionally determined judicially."
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1159.522,1167.703,"Well, normally a jury assess damages and normally a judge imposes, if it’s in his discretion, to impose punishment, which would it be here?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1167.703,1170.093,It would be the fact of the violation.
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1170.606,1172.324,It would be the fact of violation not the --
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1172.324,1172.7,"Yeah, the fact of violation."
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1172.7,1179.087,-- whether or not the monetary award was -- not what a monetary award should be or the penalty should be?
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1179.087,1186.853,"And Mr. Justice Stewart these are within the traditional realm of juries, the typical facts."
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1186.853,1199.05,"Usually the jury determines the amount too, except when it’s a criminal punishment, then, where there is some exceptions in some states, in most of the states I think the judge determines what the sentence shall be."
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1199.05,1200.142,"Of course, in this Congress should --"
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1200.142,1202.681,"Well, which would it be here in your submission?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1202.681,1215.274,"Well, in our original brief and in our original petition for certiorari, which was not granted on this issue, we took the position that a civil penalty is noting more than a penal fine, and certainly to a corporation."
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1224.465,1228.611,But the court finally addresses you on that and we did not grant certiorari on that question.
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1228.611,1230.153,Yes sir.
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1230.153,1239.958,"But in any event on this question, the Seventh Amendment question, would it be open to the jury to decide how much the penalty should be in your view?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1239.958,1250.802,"We would say that that would be up to Congress to determine, Congress, within its power, could say, that would be up to the judge, but as to the facts the Seventh Amendment, we say, is quite --"
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1250.802,1251.957,Whether or not there was a violation.
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1251.957,1253.003,That’s right.
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1253.003,1255.844,At least that much you think is triable by a jury under the Seventh Amendment.
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1255.844,1258.07,That is our entire position.
1976.75-746,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1288.031,1291.36,Mr Stokes you keep saying being realistic.
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1319.777,1322.257,That is precisely our point Mr Justice Marshall.
1976.75-746,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1322.257,1324.891,"But it’s something wrong, you still get $5,000."
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1324.891,1341.183,That presupposes that the jury finds us guilty and we have a right to a jury of our peers and the interposing of a jury between the judiciary albeit in this case; it’s not judges would like tenure; it’s administrators.
1976.75-746,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1341.183,1342.422,I thought you misunderstood.
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1353.174,1357.952,That would be our position sir.
1976.75-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1359.247,1367.227,You wouldn’t think you would have any right to enjoin the administrative proceeding pending some jury trial?
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1367.227,1380.139,"There is some -- in the Beacon Theatres, a Dairy Queen trilogy, there is language that would indicate that there is a possibility that there would be --"
1976.75-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1380.139,1381.519,"Well, what’s your position; what’s your position?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1381.519,1389.963,"We would say that that would be in discretion of the judge handling it, but in this case we would say that the abatement would go on."
1976.75-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1410.455,1416.304,Did the statute sound like this when you would think the administrative proceeding should abate until the jury trial?
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1416.304,1420.001,"Correct -- no, we would say the administrative proceeding would go on and you would have de novo review."
1976.75-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1421.815,1429.687,"So you wouldn’t say, in this case, you would have any right to enjoin an administrative proceeding until there is a jury trial."
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1429.687,1433.225,I would not think that that would be right.
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1433.225,1452.225,"Is it your claim that because of the failure to provide a jury trial at some stage of the proceeding here, this legislation is simply constitutionally invalid or is it your position that judicial decisions can sooner patch it up?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1452.225,1452.857,Mr Justice Stewart there is no provision in here for jury trial.
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1452.857,1467.762,"But in other words, is it your position that -- under your submission should the Court hold this legislation to be invalid constitutionally and then leave it to Congress to enact some new law providing, at some stage, the gain at jury trial?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1467.762,1475.142,The penalty provision should be held unconstitutional without -- unless and until a jury trial is provided at some stage in the proceeding.
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1475.142,1475.915,By Congress?
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1475.915,1477.115,By Congress.
1976.75-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1477.115,1482.4,"That would leave the abatement and all the other kind of orders perfectly constitutional, I take it."
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1482.4,1489.738,"Just like the National Labor Relations Board type of proceedings, seize and desist type of proceedings, and many others."
1976.75-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1527.316,1535.116,Do you suggest there is a right to a jury trial in connection with involuntary proceeding in bankruptcy?
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1535.116,1537.838,"Yes sir, in a preference, in a plenary action where you don’t have --"
1976.75-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1537.838,1542.894,"No, but how about just the matter of declaring a person bankrupt?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1542.894,1547.151,"Well, there you go, you voluntarily submit, you are declaring bankrupcy or involuntarily."
1976.75-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1547.151,1550.503,[Laughter] I said involuntarily.
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1550.503,1552.251,Involuntary preference where you are seeking --
1976.75-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1552.251,1553.026,Well no I am talking --
1976.75-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.026,1554.246,(Inaudible)
1976.75-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1554.246,1574.828,"Just when you all of a sudden find that the creditors have filed the petition, have you declared the bankrupt, and you say I demand a jury trial because this will -- the net effect of this would be to transfer all my property to the trusty immediately upon -- and so I demand the jury trial."
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1576.101,1577.512,You don’t have a jury trial for that.
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1588.013,1589.426,"It’s just part of history, is it?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1589.426,1590.225,"Yes sir, it’s a traditional --"
1976.75-746,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1590.225,1593.235,"The whole test as a matter of -- is a historic test, is it not?"
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1593.235,1594.35,"Yes it is, yes sir."
1976.75-746,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1594.35,1599.183,Mr. Stokes is it part of your position that this kind of proceeding must be committed to an Article III Court?
1976.75-746,0,36669,mcneill_stokes,,1599.183,1600.213,Yes sir.
1976.75-746,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1603.532,1606.624,Very well.
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1608.073,1610.348,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-746,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1657.694,1663.217,"Mr. Solicitor, you are not suggesting if the abutment of provisions are not valuable in the enforcement."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1663.217,1670.724,"They are valuable, but I think they are not as valuable as they -- nearly as valuable as they are with this penalty proceeding."
1976.75-746,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1703.173,1716.315,"In addition to the penalties that Mr. Stokes was talking about, that is, just the imposition of $2,000, $3,500 whatever, and that’s what he was talking about that that requires a jury trial, as I understand it."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1730.743,1731.69,"Well, there are other sanctions."
1976.75-746,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1742.136,1745.188,"Yes, and they would be left untouched."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1745.188,1750.438,They would be left untouched by this indeed they might be much more severe than any penalty provided here.
1976.75-746,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1787.392,1800.953,"I suppose as a matter of practical operation and administration of this statute nothing really happens until, in most cases at least, until an employee is injured or killed; that seems to be the case in these two cases."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1800.953,1804.867,"I think probably is the case, but I cannot speak with authority to that."
1976.75-746,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1804.867,1805.687,I mean with that many --
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1805.687,1809.917,But that would draw the attention of a program which has a relatively small number of inspectors.
1976.75-746,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1809.917,1819.005,"Well, maybe it comes out of informer or something, but generally, these are not -- are these just routine, and are there any just routine inspections?"
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1819.005,1819.752,Yes there are.
1976.75-746,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1824.278,1825.814,And that’s I think what happened in both of these cases.
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1825.814,1827.283,Both of these cases.
1976.75-746,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1827.283,1835.724,"Mr. Solicit General, is there any history of unions, for example, in various plats, acting in the role of informer?"
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1835.724,1843.479,"I do not know, but I assume there is -- I am certain that they are -- I do not have an example at my command but I am certain that that takes place."
1976.75-746,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1843.479,1852.012,"Mr. Solicitor General, my understanding is that routine inspections are routine; they are regularly conducted --"
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1852.012,1852.422,"They are, but --"
1976.75-746,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1852.422,1854.166,-- on a very extensive basis.
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1854.166,1854.507,Well they are.
1976.75-746,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1862.949,1863.503,Right.
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1863.503,1865.367,And the --
1976.75-746,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1865.367,1866.969,May I ask this question?
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1879.891,1888.763,"No, as I understand the scheme of the Commission, it may review or may not, but then the employer -- if the Commission does not review, I understand the employer has an appeal to the Court of Appeals."
1976.75-746,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1888.763,1893.776,"Yes, but he then appeals from the decision of the law judge."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1893.776,1898.041,"That’s, as I understand it Mr. Justice Powell."
1976.75-746,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1898.041,1907.126,"Mr. Solicitor General, in National Independent Coal Operators case last year against the Secretary of Interior."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1930.42,1944.239,"Well, I think of there is another case like that the Turner Elkhorn case where the same lack of a challenge to a scheme of this sort was present."
1976.75-746,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1980.663,1982.958,"Let me interrupt you once more, Mr. Solicitor General."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1997.259,2000.306,I think it’s entirely true that a number of regulatory schemes will --
1976.75-746,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2000.306,2007.391,"I was just standing the opinion, our last year’s opinion, it has no reference to it, because obviously the parties didn’t raise it."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2007.391,2014.195,"Well, as we know, the Eastern District of Kentucky now is I think very backed up with penalty cases."
1976.75-746,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2035.038,2049.744,"Assuming that your position is correct as applied to the limits of the penalty in this case under this statute, do you think that would be true without reference with the amount of the penalty?"
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2049.744,2052.868,"Yes Mr. Chief Justice, I don’t think the amount of the penalty is the crucial factor."
1976.75-746,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2147.866,2163.917,"Well, your public right analogy, it seems to me, that creates a rather strange hiatus, because you have a -- when the government proceeds against the person criminally, they clearly, the defendant clearly has the right to jury trial under the Sixth Amendment."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2179.531,2180.819,That’s quite right Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1976.75-746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2248.519,2259.053,"Mr. Solicitor General, if your argument is valid, I think it would follow, would it not that Federal Trade Commission could be given the power to imposed penalties for price fixing?"
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2259.053,2262.417,Penalties for -- Federal Trade Commission could be -- civil penalty?
1976.75-746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2262.417,2265.292,"Yes, of $10 million."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2265.292,2265.781,I beg your pardon.
1976.75-746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2265.781,2267.922,"Of $10 million, because the amount is irrelevant."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2267.922,2273.73,"Oh, I think amount probably is relevant Mr. Justice Stevens, at least I have never seen a case in which the amount was thought to be relevant."
1976.75-746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2296.355,2302.562,Would you do agree that your argument would apply with equal force to the Federal Trade Commission imposing a penalty for price fixing?
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2302.562,2304.882,I think it would Mr. Justice Stevens.
1976.75-746,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2304.882,2315.852,"So far as you know Mr. Solicitor General, has the Government ever before taken the position even argumentatively that the Seventh Amendment does not apply to any civil action in which the United States is one of the parties?"
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2315.852,2323.86,"No, so far as I know that position Mr. Justice Stewart was evolved in my office primarily by Mr. --"
1976.75-746,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2323.86,2327.848,"Somebody got a very bright idea over in your office, then you just pursued it.[Laughter]"
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2327.848,2333.121,He got a very bright idea and then left for England with me to argue the basic.[Laughter]
1976.75-746,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2333.121,2342.965,"Because that’s in a very extreme position and a fascinating one, I must say or it’s contrary to at least a good deal of dicta in this Court’s decisions and another court’s decisions."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2342.965,2343.092,Oh!
1976.75-746,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2345.121,2348.401,"And contrary to good many assumptions that we have made, isn’t it?"
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2348.401,2354.294,"I think it is Mr. Justice Stewart, but I think that the demonstration, that our case doest not rise a (Voice Overlap)."
1976.75-746,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2354.294,2358.694,"Oh, I know, but if you spent about half of your brief on that proposition, then it’s an extraordinary one."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2358.694,2364.64,"It’s extraordinary, but I think Mr. Justice Stewart if one looks at the way the set of the memo is framed."
1976.75-746,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2395.089,2400.006,"We do not need to accept your broad sweetening argument in order to sustain your position, do we?"
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2400.006,2407.981,"No Mr. Chief Justice, that’s why I pointed out that we have three propositions, all of which point in the direction of sustaining these judgements below."
1976.75-746,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2407.981,2418.582,"Mr. Solicitor General, one other point, if we have to have a jury trial, do you agree that it has to be an Article III Judge?"
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2418.582,2443.396,"I don’t think so Mr. Justice Marshall, because I would hate to see the law developed in a way, that is, there must be a jury and there must be an Article III Judge, because I think with the regulation that exist in the society and the one that fairly predict will come to exist in the society, that would be a terrible blow to the federal judiciary."
1976.75-746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2457.584,2463.788,"Mr. Solicitor General it only be impossible that the extended penalties were imposed in the first instances, isn’t that true?"
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2463.788,2476.572,"Well, what I think Mr. Justice Stevens that that’s going to be a fairly useful feature because -- unless we multiply the number of enforcement personnel enormously."
1976.75-746,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2490.641,2502.006,You say you would hate to see the law developed in this way but what we are talking about is a historical provision adopted in 1791 and it is not a broad general provision at all.
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2510.181,2511.669,"No, no, quite right Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1976.75-746,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2531.314,2545.208,"Are you suggesting in response of Justice Marshall’s question that we could say a jury trial is required and you would nonetheless have the administrative law judge, someone of an ire."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2545.208,2557.779,"I would hope Mr. Justice Rehnquist that that position could be sustained in another case because of the reason I gave to Mr. Justice Marshall, but that isn’t a case we have before us today."
1976.75-746,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2646.199,2649.314,You couldn’t have them imposed civil penalty.
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2649.314,2651.907,"No, It’s there argument, I believe Mr. Justice Rehnquist it is broader."
1976.75-746,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2686.09,2692.628,"Well, I thought what it was that the agencies could do anything that an Equity Court could do."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2696.111,2706.08,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall that maybe their point or maybe that they have two points, but it seems to me that at one point in their reply brief beginning about page 33 I think."
1976.75-746,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2721.56,2725.369,"I should say, they say that and that closes up all the agencies, and say that --"
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2725.369,2729.715,"I think that’s what, they have loosed upon in their argument."
1976.75-746,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.715,2734.44,"Well it didn’t sound like the argument you were thinking, your colleague was making this morning."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2734.44,2747.719,That is quite true Mr. Justice White but I think it is in the brief and I thought I had mentioned the fact that the argument is somewhat diffused and I think they have implications that haven’t been analyzed fully.
1976.75-746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2770.796,2774.699,Is that article applied in personam of judgements as well as (Voice Overlap) that you are pointed at.
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2774.699,2785.615,"Oh yes, oh yes, they were -- I understand Mr. Justice Stevens but the fines and penalties and so forth being administered were in personam and they were regulatory."
1976.75-746,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2938.319,2952.33,General I can’t think it -- but I don’t see it cited and I need at least what was the case in which we held a petty offense is subject to not more than six months in prison maybe tried without a Jury.
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2952.33,2963.006,"Well, that’s a case Mr. Justice Brennan, which his case my memory be, but that was the case that came up in argument, the Muniz against Hoffman case, which was the question of criminal contempt."
1976.75-746,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2963.006,2965.227,Can you help me out; can you remember another that (Voice Overlap).
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2965.227,2970.897,Well I think about; I think about to be able to help you out sir.[Laughter].
1976.75-746,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2974.466,2975.342,Hamlin (ph)?
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2975.342,2983.58,"Hamlin (ph) (Inaudible), but I remember we discussed that in the Muniz against Hoffman case."
1976.75-746,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3049.61,3072.917,"Well they have lost full of paradoxes and the fact is as the Seventh Amendment guarantees a jury trial in civil actions and other provisions of the constitution guarantee a jury trial in criminal cases and other provisions of the constitution, at least implicitly based upon historic reasons, do not provide for a Jury trial in a contempt action."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,3085.736,3085.954,That’s quite true.
1976.75-746,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3085.954,3090.04,Not logic maybe and maybe paradoxical but it’s history.
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,3099.786,3106.12,My point Mr. Justice Stewart was that it would be paradoxical and that the paradox need not be created.
1976.75-746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3149.026,3177.499,"Mr. Solicitor General, with your emphasis on history I wonder because it was really not discussed in the briefs and I am not sufficiently familiar to know, does the history of the Seventh Amendment indicate perhaps that one of the concerns of that amendment was the relationship between the Federal Government and the States and one reason was that the one thing the drafters of the amendment were concerned with was the problem with excessive federal power, and mightn’t that be relevant to our problem here?"
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,3177.499,3189.214,"It might be; there is no discussion anywhere, so far as I am aware Mr. Justice Stevens there is no discussion in the drafting or the framing of the proposals that go into the Seventh Amendment, nor in the ratification debates of the Seventh Amendment."
1976.75-746,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3251.081,3251.567,"Well, that we -- go ahead."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,3251.567,3261.37,"The column is worth, entirely used to government litigation in which fines and penalties were imposed for regulatory purposes without a jury, because they wanted the speed they wanted uniformity."
1976.75-746,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3261.37,3278.592,"Were these matters of speed and convenience underlying the decision of Congress when they passed the Trucker Act and The Federal Tort Claims Act to have no juries in those cases which are, of course, are strictly civil cases, aren’t they?"
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,3278.592,3280.634,They are indeed.
1976.75-746,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3305.492,3324.215,"But that again is justifiable on a quite independent grounds that frequently when you are counterclaim sued, you can be treated as if you had brought the suit in the first instance, that you maybe subject to many rules that you wouldn’t be subject to if the counterclaim were entirely independent of the original suit."
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,3324.215,3338.869,"Well, I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist that that would probably not be the case if one sued in equity and somebody came back with a damage action and the first party wanted a trial as to the damage action."
1976.75-746,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3359.233,3363.881,But that isn’t a classical action for damages?
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,3363.881,3371.128,"Well, I don’t know Mr. Justice Rehnquist in what sense that is not a classical action for damages."
1976.75-746,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3386.29,3391.585,Well you can treat it as an actual reaffirmation of the contract; the Renegotiation Board then.
1976.75-746,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,3391.585,3406.522,"Well, one can, I suppose, apply that term to it but the fact is that the government is going for money from a contractor and no jury is required; no jury is required in the government’s counterclaim."
1976.75-746,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3427.061,3428.43,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
1976.75-746,2,36669,mcneill_stokes,,3431.898,3452.445,"We have, in our brief, cited the People versus One 1941 Chevrolet, I believe, where the Supreme Court of California went through this same exercise and they went through every state in which they determined that a suit for fine and forfeiture would have been an action that Common Law trialed by a jury."
1976.75-746,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3515.262,3550.242,"I understand the Government’s position to be that the possibility of a fine would be persuasive to augment reading the act and following it, and that wouldn’t be true if the only penalty would be if he violated the act and everything in the world went wrong, then eventually if the Court of Appeals around to it, he would be put on an order, and his, the Government’s position, that the they first does tend to make the employer follow the act."
1976.75-746,2,36669,mcneill_stokes,,3550.242,3551.338,Mr. Justice Marshall so does every other --
1976.75-746,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3551.338,3552.446,"You agree to that, don’t you?"
1976.75-746,2,36669,mcneill_stokes,,3552.446,3552.909,Yes sir.
1976.75-746,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3560.371,3567.237,What’s your understanding of the law in a criminal case where the only authorized penalty is a fine?
1976.75-746,2,36669,mcneill_stokes,,3567.237,3570.661,Of $500 is that -- and it’s even that --
1976.75-746,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3570.661,3574.806,"Well, that’s unconstitutional, what’s the constitutional rule?"
1976.75-746,2,36669,mcneill_stokes,,3584.846,3593.049,We would take the position of that as unconstitutional; that is certainly more than a petty fine which is my understanding of the case as has been defined that the $500 range.
1976.75-746,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3594.885,3596.615,The test is whether or not it’s a petty offense?
1976.75-746,2,36669,mcneill_stokes,,3596.615,3598.218,Yes sir.
1976.75-746,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3598.218,3605.048,"Mr. Stokes you call our attention to a case called People against Chevrolet or Plymouth or something, I don’t find it in your brief."
1976.75-746,2,36669,mcneill_stokes,,3605.048,3606.195,"It’s in our reply brief, sir."
1976.75-746,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3606.694,3607.358,In your reply brief?
1976.75-746,2,36669,mcneill_stokes,,3607.358,3612.164,"Yes, sir I am sorry."
1976.75-746,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3667.727,3669.295,Thank you.
1976.75-746,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3669.295,3670.053,Thank you gentlemen.
