1995.95-5015,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.958,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 95-5015, Larry Lonchar v. Albert Thomas."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,12.019,14.743,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-5015,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,48.095,56.17,"Well, are you suggesting that one would have to be mentally ill in order to resist efforts to challenge the appeal, to appeal your case?"
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,56.17,59.152,"Not in every instance, Mr. Chief Justice, but in this instance, yes."
1995.95-5015,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,71.47,91.503,"Mr. Verrilli, do we take this case on the assumption, as the... I guess it's the Eleventh Circuit found, that the petitioner is seeking Federal habeas for purposes of delaying his execution and not to vindicate any constitutional right he might have?"
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,91.503,94.976,There is a factual finding to that effect--
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,94.976,95.386,To that effect.
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,95.386,96.478,"--Justice O'Connor, yes."
1995.95-5015,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,96.478,98.148,And so do we take the case on that assumption?
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,98.148,99.76,"No, Justice O'Connor."
1995.95-5015,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,100.46,101.291,And why not?
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,101.291,117.992,"--In our view, Justice O'Connor, the record shows that the district court found both that Lonchar seeks, genuinely seeks to pursue these claims, and that his motive for doing so is solely to achieve delay."
1995.95-5015,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,143.138,148.25,"Well, I suppose, though, that you do acknowledge that habeas is an equitable remedy."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,148.25,149.783,"We do, Justice O'Connor, yes."
1995.95-5015,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,149.783,166.513,"And are we limited to what Rule 9 provides in that regard as to delay in filing, or could conceivably equitable considerations allow a Federal court to deny even a first Federal habeas?"
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,166.513,170.827,"Justice O'Connor, I think there are two separate issues woven together there, and if you'll permit me--"
1995.95-5015,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,170.827,171.205,Sure.
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,171.205,172.136,--let me to try to separate them.
1995.95-5015,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,172.136,172.807,Fine.
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,172.807,181.743,"The first is the passage of time up to the point in June of 1995 when Lonchar's Federal habeas petition, the petition at issue here, was filed."
1995.95-5015,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,207.569,213.023,"Well, Mr. Verrilli, what if the motive is, you know, to really make a laughing stock out of the Federal courts."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,213.023,216.836,"Your Honor, that's a serious question here."
1995.95-5015,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.918,224.223,"Well, take it just as a hypothetical, not necessarily this case, but you're saying motive is immaterial."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,234.647,241.122,"I think, Your Honor, if there are substantial claims on the merits, and it's a first petition, that they must be adjudicated."
1995.95-5015,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,264.147,270.171,"But if the petition on its face shows that it's frivolous and/or malicious, it could be dismissed."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,270.171,271.743,"Very definitely, Justice Ginsburg."
1995.95-5015,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,296.588,297.228,"Well, do you think--"
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,324.667,330.899,"There may be a very, very limited and narrowly circumscribed discretion to do so, Your Honor."
1995.95-5015,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,343.219,344.42,Can you give me a concrete example--
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,344.42,344.921,Well--
1995.95-5015,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,344.921,346.19,--of what such a case would be?
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,346.19,357.359,--there... the traditional equitable doctrine of unclean hands is the only additional equitable principle that I think is not already encompassed within 9(a) that might be brought to bear here.
1995.95-5015,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,357.359,362.982,"Well, is 9(a) an exclusive statement of the doctrine of laches?"
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,362.982,367.494,"Our view, Justice Kennedy, is that it is definitely an exclusive statement of the doctrine of laches."
1995.95-5015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,383.316,406.229,"Well, would you take that so far as to cover a case in which the prisoner in effect requested various next friends to file next friend petitions in bad faith, knowing perfectly well that he was competent, and to do so solely for the repeatedly delaying the execution date?"
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,429.395,439.522,"No, Justice Souter, and that's why, in response to Justice Ginsburg, I indicated that I thought there was some narrow room for the traditional equitable principle of unclean hands to operate even beyond 9(a)."
1995.95-5015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,439.522,441.553,How is that consistent with your... maybe I didn't understand what you said.
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,445.576,451.22,"Because, Justice Souter, laches is about delay and the consequences of delay."
1995.95-5015,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,455.221,462.707,"But suppose the State were to show that the evidence were stale, and it would be more difficult for the State to prevail on retrial."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,484.229,486.002,"--That's correct, Justice Kennedy."
1995.95-5015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,514.519,525.559,"Mr. Verrilli, may I go back to the earlier point about the finding that he had taken the action he had solely for purposes of delay."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,599.735,600.736,"Justice Souter, you've put it beautifully."
1995.95-5015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,625.384,636.189,So you can that in terms of our usual terminology there really isn't any contradiction between the two findings that you've pointed out of the lower court in this case.
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,636.189,637.652,"--That's precisely right, Justice Souter."
1995.95-5015,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,637.652,640.702,"Mr. Verrilli, I thought a moment ago you said they were inherently contradictory."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,640.702,671.133,"If one reads them as I understood Justice O'Connor to have been reading them I think they are contradictory, but what I tried to suggest is that the two can coexist in the sense that, as the facts here show, a person can have a substantial claim, can have a good faith belief in the substantiality of the claim, and can nonetheless be pursuing it for purposes that are other than the purpose of achieving substantive relief, and that's why we think there just shouldn't be an inquiry on a substantial first Federal habeas petition into that issue."
1995.95-5015,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.133,690.954,"It's strange that that shouldn't be considered by an equity court when even in civil law, if you pursue a right that is a genuine right, but you pursue it solely for the purpose of harassment, that's actionable."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,690.954,694.647,"Well, I take it Your Honor is referring to the tort of abuse of process."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,694.647,695.228,Yes.
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,695.228,698.16,"Well, I think that there are significant differences here."
1995.95-5015,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,735.033,738.966,Why is it clear that Rule 9 itself doesn't cover this case?
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,754.318,755.786,"I do not, Your Honor."
1995.95-5015,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,773.26,785.867,"I see, and you think that a court of equity cannot even take into account the fact that this would have come under 9(a) anyway in deciding whether the court of equity could decide that habeas corpus won't lie?"
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,785.867,788.388,"Well, I don't think it would have come under Rule 9(a) anyway."
1995.95-5015,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,788.388,789.53,"Well, that's a different argument from the one--"
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,789.53,789.83,Yes.
1995.95-5015,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,789.83,790.611,--you were just making.
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,790.611,793.494,"It is, but there is a threshold point here of some importance."
1995.95-5015,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,793.494,799.236,"I'm asking whether a court can consider whether, had 9(a) been alleged, that wouldn't have sufficed anyway."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,799.236,807.171,what this Court has said is that the timing of the filing of a petition can be considered.
1995.95-5015,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,826.575,844.454,"So you'd say, even with a later petition if the petition comes in, you know, 2 minutes before the execution and the State is supposed to respond and a court consider the State's response and rule on the matter within those 2 minutes, that wouldn't be a violation of Rule 9?"
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,844.454,848.418,"That's not the kind of prejudice that we think Rule 9 addresses, Your Honor."
1995.95-5015,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,848.418,850.939,"Well, Rule 9 is... it must be a very poorly drawn rule, then."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,866.831,870.013,"With respect to a second Federal habeas, no, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-5015,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,883.63,888.105,"But the State has to plead abuse in a second Federal habeas, doesn't it?"
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,891.327,896.17,"That rule is clear, Mr. Chief Justice, and has been clear for years, that the burden is on the State to plead abuse."
1995.95-5015,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,896.17,916.994,"Well, if this were... so the question, it seems to me, is whether we should consider as effectively a second habeas what is technically a first habeas that's been filed after the proceeding has been delayed numerous times, not by this petitioner but by people related to this petitioner, seeking to proceed as next friends."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,921.986,923.047,Justice Scalia--
1995.95-5015,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.047,924.267,--in the way I've just suggested?
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,924.267,930.781,"--I think that is the crux of the case, Justice Scalia, but I think this Court cannot do so, and there are three reasons for that."
1995.95-5015,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,949.084,954.017,"Excuse me, why do you say... what about delayed petitions, 9(a)?"
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,968.826,976.482,"--Yes, but I took it that Your Honor was asking me why shouldn't the Court treat this as though it were a successive petition, and I'm trying to suggest--"
1995.95-5015,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,976.482,981.465,"For purposes of whether 9(a) is applicable, not 9(b)."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,985.947,986.638,--Well--
1995.95-5015,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.638,1004.188,"You say that we shouldn't apply 9(a) strictly to the first petition, and granting that, although 9(a) doesn't say anything like that, but even if that is true, why should I consider this to be the first petition for that purpose when in fact there have been several others filed on this prisoner's behalf?"
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1004.188,1008.693,"--Well, I think the Court has to consider it a first petition because it is."
1995.95-5015,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1017.589,1021.51,"Mr. Verrilli, 9(a) could be applicable to a first petition, could it not?"
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1021.51,1022.131,--Certainly.
1995.95-5015,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1022.131,1028.526,"If there had been delay, and as a result the prosecutor was unable to answer a point that he might have answered earlier."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1028.526,1029.808,"Certainly, Justice Ginsburg."
1995.95-5015,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1029.808,1034.53,"So 9(a), it doesn't matter whether it's the first or the tenth, 9(a) could apply."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1034.53,1038.153,"That's certainly correct, Justice Ginsburg, and I didn't mean to suggest anything to the contrary."
1995.95-5015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1058.846,1060.275,"Yes, but that could happen in either of two ways."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1067.692,1068.723,"--Correct, Justice Souter."
1995.95-5015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1068.723,1075.466,"On the other hand, the fact that those next friend petitions were pending, or there were proceedings on them, didn't bar him from coming in with his own petition."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1080.398,1090.316,"That's right, Justice Souter, but in terms of whether those prior proceedings created an unjustified delay, I think we have to look into whether... we have to look into the way those--"
1995.95-5015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1090.316,1122.506,"Well, I'm prepared... I think what I meant to suggest by my two questions is, I'm prepared to say that to the extent those prior next friend proceedings dragged things out, I guess there's no evidence that would support the argument that we should attribute them to him as opposed to the next friends, but I'm also suggesting that those next friend petitions really don't necessarily explain the delay, because there could have been 10 next friend petitions going on, and he could still have walked in with his own petition at any time."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1122.506,1127.561,"--That's correct if there were some obligation on his part to do so, and--"
1995.95-5015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1127.561,1131.372,"Well, the question is why... that's... I guess that's the question."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1142.859,1144.231,"--Yes, Justice Souter, nothing precluded him from doing that."
1995.95-5015,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1151.505,1158.531,"Well, if there's no obligation to come forward at any time, then the provision of delay in 9(a) really doesn't mean much."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1172.599,1178.513,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there is no statute of limitations on habeas."
1995.95-5015,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1195.547,1200.952,"Are you saying, then, that our more recent decision in Gomez... there's Hillery and Vasquez, which you rely on."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1207.484,1210.766,"--Yes, but the context of Gomez is quite different here."
1995.95-5015,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1219.772,1224.097,"Well, it's preceded by a sentence that says the claim could have been brought more than 10 years ago."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1224.097,1224.665,--Yes--
1995.95-5015,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1224.665,1229.94,It was not geared to successive... you're quite correct there were successive petitions in that case.
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1229.94,1261.63,"--Your Honor, as I read that opinion, what it seemed to be saying is that precisely because there had been four prior opportunities to raise that claim in Federal habeas in the normal course of events and it was not raised, that this section 1983 action in Gomez ought to be considered and truly was an end round, a run... an end run around the abuse of the writ principles that would normally have foreclosed consideration of that, and that section 1983 ought not to be used in that manner."
1995.95-5015,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1261.63,1289.517,"But Mr. Verrilli, it is your position, if I understand it correctly, that a condemned prisoner can routinely wait until the last minute, 1 minute before his execution, to file his first Federal habeas, and that's no problem, that you get one free postponement of the execution by just filing a Federal habeas, so long as you make a claim that is, as you say, a substantial claim, not necessarily true, but a substantial claim."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1289.517,1292.031,"I think that's where the law is, Justice Scalia--"
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1292.031,1292.449,Is that right?
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1292.449,1294.832,"--and where it's been since Barefoot v. Estelle, that a--"
1995.95-5015,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1294.832,1308.982,"But is that true even if, because of the lateness of the filing, the State is unable to present what could well be a claim showing how the State has been prejudiced by the delay?"
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1308.982,1328.733,"--Yes, I think so, Justice O'Connor, and particularly... and the circumstances of this case are somewhat anomalous in that respect because actually because of the next friend proceedings the State has known since 1991 in this case what the claims are, and therefore that sort of surprise issue, though it might be present in another record, actually isn't present on this record."
1995.95-5015,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1348.048,1371.001,"Well, certainly Barefoot says that Federal habeas is not essential to the validity of a death penalty, and so supposing I am a Federal district judge sitting in Atlanta, and I'm brought a petition 5 minutes before an execution is scheduled for, and I simply say, I can't possibly digest the contents of this petition at this time, it's so late."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1372.452,1374.915,--I think a limited stay is in order--
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1374.915,1375.334,Why?
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1375.334,1376.125,--in those circumstances--
1995.95-5015,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1376.125,1385.04,"The petitioner has to persuade the judge that there's some Federal flaw in the punishment procedure, or the guilty phase, don't they?"
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1385.04,1395.008,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but a limited stay in situations where that inquiry can't be done simply on the face of the papers in short order, which I imagine--"
1995.95-5015,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1395.008,1396.758,But it's the fault of the petitioner that it can't be done.
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1396.758,1403.714,"--I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that it's the result of a system in which there is no statute of limitations."
1995.95-5015,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1403.714,1409.327,"Okay, there's no statute of limitations, and nobody is saying that you're barred because of the statute of limitations."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1424.527,1426.618,"Well, I don't think the facts would support that result here, but--"
1995.95-5015,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1426.618,1427.039,"No, no."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1428.341,1440.046,"--I understand, Mr. Chief Justice, but even in another case, it seems to me a very short stay would be in order in those circumstances simply to permit the evaluation of whether there are substantial Federal claims in the petition, and that's--"
1995.95-5015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1440.046,1444.219,"Mr. Verrilli, take the Chief's example with one further fact added."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1488.549,1492.903,"--There may be circumstances, extreme circumstances--"
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1492.903,1493.674,How about my circumstances?
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1493.674,1499.388,--Extreme circumstances like those circumstances in which there is proof of bad faith.
1995.95-5015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1508.885,1509.245,All right.
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1522.242,1530.988,"--Absent a finding of bad faith and unclean hands, it seems to me there's no basis for denying a stay in those circumstances."
1995.95-5015,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1530.988,1531.348,All right.
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1539.302,1541.395,"Very definitely, Justice Breyer."
1995.95-5015,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1541.395,1543.817,He's made it clear that he wants this case to be brought here in the Court?
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1543.817,1547.759,"My communications with this client have left me with no doubt about that, Your Honor."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1547.759,1548.219,"Okay, thank you."
1995.95-5015,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1548.219,1549.872,"I'll reserve the balance of my time, if I may."
1995.95-5015,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1549.872,1551.18,"Very well, Mr. Verrilli."
1995.95-5015,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1552.572,1558.096,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-5015,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1582.933,1587.185,"Ms. Westmoreland, could the State court have done, in effect, the same thing?"
1995.95-5015,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1598.561,1601.754,"The first one that Mr. Lonchar actually filed himself, yes, sir."
1995.95-5015,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1601.754,1602.595,That's right... not the next friend petitions--
1995.95-5015,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1602.595,1602.845,That's correct.
1995.95-5015,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1602.845,1603.336,--but the first one of his.
1995.95-5015,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1603.336,1603.937,That's correct.
1995.95-5015,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1603.937,1624.069,"Is there any reason why the State court judge could not have said at that point, this is your chance to bring a State habeas petition, and this is the only one you're going to get, and I'm going to... you either go forward with this, raising whatever you can raise, or I'm going to dismiss it with prejudice, not without prejudice, but with prejudice."
1995.95-5015,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1626.079,1630.293,"Your Honor, in fact we discussed that issue at the hearing before the judge in 1994."
1995.95-5015,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1636.447,1637.207,Right.
1995.95-5015,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1637.207,1638.248,--to change his mind again.
1995.95-5015,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1656.701,1657.901,"Yes, but the order was without prejudice."
1995.95-5015,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1657.901,1658.972,--The order definitely was without prejudice.
1995.95-5015,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1658.972,1660.394,But that's a question of Georgia law.
1995.95-5015,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1660.394,1661.022,Yes.
1995.95-5015,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1661.022,1689.522,"So isn't it fair to say that Georgia made the decision at some level that in fact this would be without prejudice, whereas Georgia could have made the converse decision and said, it's going to be with prejudice, in which case there would have been a... I... there would have been a, I suppose, a state bar to raising anything that once an appeal from that was exhausted openly to this Court--"
1995.95-5015,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1689.522,1691.132,That's correct.
1995.95-5015,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1691.132,1694.886,"--that would have barred anything that could have been raised and we really wouldn't be in this position, would we?"
1995.95-5015,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1694.886,1696.135,It would have barred the claims.
1995.95-5015,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1697.547,1699.688,It would have barred all the claims that he could have brought at that point.
1995.95-5015,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1699.688,1700.169,--Right.
1995.95-5015,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3245.632,3249.795,"If the Court has no further questions, we're prepared to submit."
1995.95-5015,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3249.795,3255.63,"I have just one question I would... I should know this from the papers, but what method of execution does Georgia now use?"
1995.95-5015,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3255.63,3256.491,Electrocution.
1995.95-5015,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3256.491,3257.61,It still uses electrocution.
1995.95-5015,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3257.61,3258.526,Very well.
