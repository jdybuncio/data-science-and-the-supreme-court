1990.89-1647,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.288,"We'll hear next in argument No. 89-1647, Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc., v. Eulala Shute."
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,55.057,58.34,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1647,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,92.451,96.255,"Mr. Willard, you say this question you're about to discuss is the first question in the case."
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,104.148,111.945,"Each question, Justice Scalia, is independent and the Court could certainly resolve the case in our favor by deciding the second issue, the second question presented--"
1990.89-1647,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,111.945,114.366,"And this one's a constitutional question, isn't it?"
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,114.366,115.856,--That is correct.
1990.89-1647,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,115.856,116.817,And the other one is not.
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,116.817,118.568,And the other one is not a constitutional question.
1990.89-1647,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,118.568,120.541,"We'd normally do the other one first then, wouldn't we?"
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,120.541,123.903,The Court has certainly indicated that that is appropriate.
1990.89-1647,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,132.887,133.909,Please do so.
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,133.909,149.769,"The court of appeals, although it rejected generalist jurisdiction, found specific jurisdiction, because it said there was a sufficient nexus in this case between the Carnival's advertising activities in the State of Washington and the resulting... and the ultimate accident."
1990.89-1647,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,340.113,344.727,"The complaint alleges negligence, does it not?"
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,378.568,392.976,"Well, certainly, Justice Kennedy, if she were to sue on the basis of fraudulent or false advertising, that would be like the Keeton case in which the contact with the forum gave rise to the cause of action, because the advertising itself would cause the injury."
1990.89-1647,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,409.239,413.91,"Well, but the context... do the context have to be necessary to the cause of action under your test?"
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,416.943,419.444,In our view it has to have a substantive relationship.
1990.89-1647,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,445.102,457.161,"Mr. Willard, what if you... I understood your brief to suggest that the outcome here would be different if the cause of action had been for breach of contract."
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,468.889,478.084,"Well, that would be certainly a stronger case for the assertion of specific jurisdiction where the act took place in the forum."
1990.89-1647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,503.47,504.672,May I ask this?
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,518.129,533.03,"That would be our general view, although it's certainly possible that there would be a situation where some act of negligence in another case would have taken place... correct."
1990.89-1647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,533.03,537.371,"No, I'm talking about this case, where the act of negligence allegedly was she slipped in what she... visiting part of the ship, as I remember."
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,537.371,538.713,"That's correct, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-1647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,538.713,547.809,"So that even if the ship had docked in Seattle but still not often enough to support general jurisdiction, but she had gotten on board the ship and sailed, and so that still would not justify it then?"
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,547.809,554.063,"That would be our position here, because there's no allegation of an act of negligence on the land portion of the journey."
1990.89-1647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,554.063,554.373,Right.
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,554.373,561.296,"The allegation is that water was spilled on the galley during the cruise, and so all of the acts occurred outside of any State."
1990.89-1647,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,561.296,564.799,"Well, didn't the cruise ship operate out of Los Angeles though?"
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,571.495,577.038,"Our view is, Mr. Chief Justice, there would not be, although there would certainly be a stronger tie there."
1990.89-1647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.026,590.505,"Well, where could the plaintiff sue?"
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,590.505,591.957,"Well, it could sue--"
1990.89-1647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,591.957,592.198,Anywhere?
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,592.659,597.891,--The plaintiff could sue anywhere where she could obtain general jurisdiction over the--
1990.89-1647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,597.891,598.582,"Well, where is that, for example?"
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,598.582,609.308,"--In this case, it's Florida which is where Carnival has its principal place of business and also where, in the forum selection clause in the ticket, it is implicitly consented to jurisdiction."
1990.89-1647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,609.308,620.666,"For the purposes of our analysis and yours on this part of the case, would it make any difference if she could not have sued in Florida, if she would have had to go to a foreign country?"
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,622.957,625.999,In our view the analysis is the same.
1990.89-1647,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.494,724.214,"Mr. Willard, before you get into those two arguments, is it clear to you and should it be clear to us that this is a question of purely Federal law and it doesn't matter how the State of Washington would have treated this forum selection clause?"
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,724.214,725.586,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1647,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,731.86,734.031,When did we do that?
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,734.031,742.236,"--Well, The Majestic, which of course, predated Erie was a decision on a passenger ticket condition."
1990.89-1647,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,742.236,743.187,What about post-Erie?
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,747.729,752.354,"I don't believe this... well, under Bremen, the Court viewed that--"
1990.89-1647,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,752.354,752.751,It wasn't argued.
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,752.751,756.444,"--If it wasn't argued in the Bremen, then this Court hasn't decided it."
1990.89-1647,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,780.481,787.056,Even if the agreement is entered into within a particular State where jurisdiction is asserted?
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,787.056,789.426,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, that's our position."
1990.89-1647,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,798.613,801.173,So you'd say Washington has to follow us.
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,812.801,822.659,"Well, that raises a slightly different question as to whether a suit brought under the Savings to Suitors Clause in State court, whether the state court would be required to apply Federal admiralty law."
1990.89-1647,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,841.419,845.163,Is that somewhat at odds with the Erie principle?
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,845.163,857.952,"In our view it's not at all at odds with the Erie principle, because this falls in the area of admiralty and maritime law where there is a very strong need which the framers of the Constitution recognized to have a uniform body of law."
1990.89-1647,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,918.059,919.511,This is a Federal statute?
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,919.511,921.391,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1647,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1029.935,1041.882,"Well, it will be the most reasonable if you have to pick one place, but it could have designated on all its... you know on its tickets that all suits brought by citizens of Washington shall be brought in Washington."
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1048.074,1060.393,"Well, one reason why it is reasonable to have a single forum is that the time a cruise occurs it's difficult to know where all of the witnesses in evidence will be months or years later when a lawsuit occurs."
1990.89-1647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1073.072,1074.194,But doesn't that indicate Miami as unreasonable?
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1076.195,1078.235,"Well, the reason--"
1990.89-1647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.235,1080.077,You suggest that you don't know where the witnesses will be.
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1080.077,1084.869,"--That's correct and so Miami is chosen, because that's where the company is headquartered."
1990.89-1647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1182.293,1186.107,Don't the Federal rules have some kind of provision for consolidating all these cases when you have a large accident like this?
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1186.107,1192.231,"That's certainly true if they file in Federal court, Justice Stevens, but under the Savings to Suitors Clause, they can file in State court."
1990.89-1647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1192.819,1193.52,Can't you remove?
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1193.52,1197.104,"--If there is not complete diversity, you cannot remove."
1990.89-1647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.474,1202.055,"But you're talking about individual suits by 200 different plaintiffs, and each one of those, I suppose, there would be complete diversity?"
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1202.055,1203.527,"--Well, it depends on who else they name."
1990.89-1647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1209.662,1210.042,I see.
1990.89-1647,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,1210.042,1215.305,--in order... and some John Doe defendants under State practice in order to defeat diversity and prevent removal.
1990.89-1647,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1248.227,1249.596,"Thank you, Mr. Willard."
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1251.279,1258.983,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1421.088,1432.378,Do you agree that the accident must be said to have arisen out of the acts of the defendant in the State?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1432.378,1433.277,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1437.109,1438.722,"Well, that's all you're relying on, isn't it?"
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1438.722,1439.881,--That's the Ninth Circuit decision.
1990.89-1647,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1448.427,1450.457,"Now, did you argue general jurisdiction at any point?"
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1450.457,1455.512,"--We did in the Ninth Circuit, Your Honor, and the Ninth Circuit disagreed with us."
1990.89-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1466.9,1467.34,Mr.--
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1474.553,1483.059,"--It arose out of the minimum contacts of the defendants with the State of Washington, one of which was the sale of tickets."
1990.89-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1483.059,1486.441,The solicitation in Washington and the sale of the ticket to this person?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1486.441,1487.242,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1647,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1487.242,1497.22,"Mr. Wall, I thought as far... maybe I got my facts mixed up... but I thought as far as Carnival Cruise Lines is concerned, the sale took place in Florida."
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1506.586,1509.637,"I suppose it's a matter of one's view, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1647,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1559.978,1564.212,"Well, it's clear that her purchase occurred in Washington."
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1576.652,1586.099,"According to her affidavit, which is in the respondents' appendix, she forwards the money to Carnival."
1990.89-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1613.875,1614.756,"Well, how did they advertise?"
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1624.103,1629.475,"The petitioner advertises both in the national media, Your Honor, and also in the local media."
1990.89-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.475,1631.407,--In newspapers?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1631.407,1642.175,"In newspapers, magazines, as well as providing brochures, and in fact, then... the record indicates that they regularly run large ads in the largest newspapers in the State of Washington."
1990.89-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1642.175,1644.255,Travel agents have their brochures?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1644.255,1645.304,That's correct.
1990.89-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.362,1659.685,Do you know exactly how this particular purchase took place?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1668.161,1671.144,That is precisely how it occurred and the record would... has her affidavit.
1990.89-1647,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1671.144,1672.813,And has the travel agent suggested this?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1672.813,1679.127,That's... the affidavit of Mrs. Shute is part of the record and she says she went to the travel agent.
1990.89-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.66,1688.414,So she didn't see any of these advertisements in this... she just... the whole thing happened with the travel agent?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1688.414,1691.506,--The travel agent is certainly the largest part of it.
1990.89-1647,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1694.838,1696.739,Does her affidavit indicate that she did?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1696.739,1697.941,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
1990.89-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1773.81,1775.69,"Burger King was a contract case, wasn't it?"
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1775.69,1784.866,"It was a contract case, Your Honor, in which the... in fact it was a contract case in which a choice of law section was imposed."
1990.89-1647,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1800.919,1807.462,"Well, if the forum selection clause is enforceable, it doesn't matter whether there was special jurisdiction."
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1807.462,1810.805,"If the forum selection clause is enforceable, Your Honor, you're correct."
1990.89-1647,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1917.734,1922.218,But that's general jurisdiction... I mean it sounds like general jurisdiction you're talking about.
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1930.512,1933.584,"--Well, we know she was induced by a travel agent who provided with the advertisements, Your Honor."
1990.89-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1949.534,1952.067,So you say at least it says specific jurisdiction?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1952.067,1956.62,"It is at least specific jurisdiction, because it arises out of their contacts with the State."
1990.89-1647,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1981.674,1986.178,Why do you... why do you say there must be substantial business contact?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,1999.696,2000.077,Correct.
1990.89-1647,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2000.077,2003.609,But where do you get the requirement of a substantial business in the State?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2003.609,2009.653,Because the Court... this Court's decisions in the area of due process have said that you must have some substantial business connection.
1990.89-1647,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2023.201,2024.233,Yes.
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2024.233,2031.028,"--things that operate the long arm statute, but then it also says it must arise out of the transaction of business."
1990.89-1647,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2031.028,2036.131,What if this company had never sent any other advertising into the State... in fact didn't even send in this advertising.
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2052.232,2054.203,"No, and I would agree that it is not enough."
1990.89-1647,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2082.67,2083.382,"Well, I wonder if you mean that."
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2098.441,2100.472,--We would sue the corporation if she were in the course of her employment.
1990.89-1647,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2100.472,2101.754,"Yes, I'm assuming she is."
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2101.754,2104.135,But probably not under this particular statute.
1990.89-1647,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2111.681,2112.711,I see.
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2119.506,2120.735,"Yes, I understand the Court's position."
1990.89-1647,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2181.636,2184.538,"Mr. Wall, can I review my ignorance in a question to you?"
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2193.224,2195.174,Helicopteros discusses it.
1990.89-1647,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2195.174,2196.266,Helicopteros does it.
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2196.266,2205.302,"Particularly, Justice Brennan's dissent discusses it, and it is discussed to some extent in the Burger King case, too, I believe, Your Honor."
1990.89-1647,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2205.302,2217.918,"It seems to me that you're kind of asking for sort of a middle type... and I'm not saying it's an impermissible argument, but it's not the classic specific jurisdiction case, and it's not the classic general jurisdiction case either."
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2217.918,2220.871,We've... in our brief we've talked about a sliding scale--
1990.89-1647,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.871,2221.221,Right.
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2221.221,2227.575,"--whereas if they have a lot of activity but it's not quite enough for general jurisdiction, then perhaps it should be a somewhat more liberal arising out of--"
1990.89-1647,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2227.575,2232.978,Does this sliding scale notion originate in that same law review note that the Washington Supreme Court relied on or is that--
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2232.978,2237.583,"--I don't know exactly what they relied upon, Your Honor, but I suspect that it may come from that, yes."
1990.89-1647,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2237.583,2241.764,--They say the whole thing started in some Georgetown student's law review note as I remember it.
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2241.764,2258.637,"It could be, but I think they looked at it in this case in the sense that if you're really there doing business, there's no requirement in any case I know of that says that the type of contact and the type of injury have to be identical, which is what the petitioner is arguing here."
1990.89-1647,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2261.188,2270.574,Is there anything in the record about the contract between the agent and the... and the line?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2270.574,2278.65,Only that it is acknowledged by the petitioner that they pay a 10 percent commission on all sales.
1990.89-1647,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2278.65,2282.462,But there's no responsibility or anything on the record?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2282.462,2288.885,"There's nothing to that extent, Justice Marshall, other than the commission and the fact that they are not the exclusive agent."
1990.89-1647,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2306.388,2308.71,"Well, what law governs do you think?"
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2308.71,2317.255,"--Justice O'Connor, that is a question which occurred to me when it was asked by I believe Justice Stevens here or Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1647,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2339.108,2342.239,"Is that what was applied, do you think, by the Ninth Circuit?"
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2342.239,2343.031,"--Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1990.89-1647,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2345.452,2347.934,I didn't get that impression at all from the opinion.
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2347.934,2361.284,"As I say I didn't really address this in the brief because I didn't realize it was that much of a question, but I think they did apply Federal maritime law, since I don't recall them citing any particular Washington State cases of California State cases."
1990.89-1647,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2411.816,2415.109,What's your authority for that proposition?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2415.109,2419.31,"Your Honor, basically the Bremen case."
1990.89-1647,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2429.097,2431.228,"Well, now the Bremen didn't put it that way."
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2436.872,2441.487,The Court could be correct on that and I'm not sure.
1990.89-1647,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2454.783,2457.976,So you would draw a negative implication from the language of the Bremen?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2457.976,2458.727,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1647,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2461.549,2480.733,"Well, why do you say there's an overwhelming bargaining... this is a big corporation and just one individual, but you know when I go into a showroom and decide whether or not I'm going to buy a car from General Motors, General Motors and I are even-Steven as far as bargaining power is concerned, it seems to me."
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2501.744,2516.854,"Disparity in bargaining power... there are different aspects to every transaction, Your Honor, and one of them... the hypothetical you just cited... certainly you have a great deal of bargaining power by not buying the car... in this case my client did want to go on a cruise... or about the price of the car or the terms."
1990.89-1647,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2525.46,2527.533,"Oh, well, that doesn't go to bargaining power."
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2534.455,2535.677,She is entitled--
1990.89-1647,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2535.677,2538.398,It's a different point from the one that Bremen was making.
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2538.398,2547.595,"--Your Honor, I would disagree with that, because in this case if the plaintiff wants to buy this product, she has to go to a cruise line."
1990.89-1647,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.741,2574.152,Isn't that what the Bremen meant by disparity of bargaining power?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2574.152,2589.923,"I think that the Bremen means is that if you have two commercial entities who can bargain over the contract terms and those contract terms are accepted, fair or unfair, you know, advantageous or disadvantageous, you're stuck with it."
1990.89-1647,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2652.683,2654.776,Of course the Federal statute doesn't say that.
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2663.96,2665.532,--It doesn't specifically mention that.
1990.89-1647,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2694.681,2698.213,Where are these... the witnesses in your particular case?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2698.213,2706.518,Most of the fact witnesses and the... all the medical witnesses with the exception of an unknown Mexican doctor are located in the State of Washington.
1990.89-1647,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2710.542,2713.604,They were fellow cruise passengers?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2713.604,2714.393,--That's correct.
1990.89-1647,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2784.41,2800.61,"Well, do we look at the forum selection clause from its overall fairness standpoint, just kind of a facial attack or do we look at it with reference to the reasonableness of its application to the plaintiff in this case?"
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2800.61,2806.284,Our position is that it should be applied to this case and to persons in a similar class.
1990.89-1647,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2806.284,2809.265,"Well, then the California example has nothing to do with it."
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2809.265,2814.889,"It does, because if you're in California they get the same clause and they have to go to Miami."
1990.89-1647,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2814.889,2816.692,"Well, but the analysis might be different."
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2816.692,2833.972,"I agree, Your Honor, and I don't mean to restrict it to just this case, but I think... the point I was trying to make is that we don't feel that a forum selection clause was outlawed by Congress per se or that they're invalid per se, because I think they do have a reasonable commercial purpose."
1990.89-1647,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2845.8,2848.742,"Well, what if your clients had filed in the Superior Court of King County?"
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2848.742,2856.066,"In that case, I think State law because it probably is a procedural matter, would control whether or not this is to be enforced."
1990.89-1647,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2856.066,2860.449,"No, I mean there certainly couldn't be any transfer to Florida."
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2860.449,2868.765,"Unless it was removed under... because it's an admiralty action and I will confess, Mr. Chief Justice, that not all admiralty actions are removable and I don't know if this one is or not."
1990.89-1647,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2967.66,2969.922,You're not saying it's something that they ought to have.
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2991.904,2993.787,"--In a word, Your Honor, no."
1990.89-1647,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2993.787,2994.926,That wouldn't have been okay either?
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,2994.926,3000.151,"No, because the question here is not whether it has been reasonably communicated to them or whether they knew about it."
1990.89-1647,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3003.744,3003.982,xxx.
1990.89-1647,1,26237,gregory_j_wall,,3003.982,3009.878,"If my client had bargained for this and said, yes, I agree to that specifically, then I would agree with Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1647,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3020.915,3022.014,"Thank you, Mr. Wall."
1990.89-1647,2,40682,richard_k_willard,,3025.797,3030.492,"Mr. Chief Justice, and my it please the Court:"
1990.89-1647,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3054.405,3075.259,And the court... the Ninth Circuit also said alternatively that there was an independent justification for refusal to enforce the clause... I'm looking at page 24a... because of the lack of inconvenience and lack of relationship between the chosen forum and the transaction.
1990.89-1647,2,40682,richard_k_willard,,3075.259,3076.982,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-1647,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3133.029,3134.578,"Thank you, Mr. Willard."
