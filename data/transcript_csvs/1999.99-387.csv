1999.99-387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.785,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-387, Thomas Raleigh v. the Illinois Department of Revenue."
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,11.08,15.016,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,86.92,89.413,"Now, the respondent disputes that, Mr. Radasevich."
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,94.542,102.539,"We recognize in our moving papers, Your Honor, that there was aberrant authority that took the position that taxing authorities did not bear the burden of persuasion on their claims."
1999.99-387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,102.539,104.685,There was no decision from this Court.
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,104.685,106.359,"Correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,106.359,111.215,So that you characterize as aberrant one side rather than the other.
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,112.672,122.505,"The basis, Your Honor, is the decisions that come down and the volume of the decisions that came down on the side of the equation that taxing authorities bear the same burden."
1999.99-387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,162.535,175.681,"Mr. Radasevich, what was the head count of cases on your side versus those on the other side under the previous legislation?"
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,175.681,182.701,--Many of the cases that were cited in the appellant's brief we don't believe stood for the proposition that the taxing authorities bore the burden of persuasion.
1999.99-387,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,182.701,187.056,How about Judge Posner's opinion on B-8 of the appendix?
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,196.595,198.703,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,220.42,220.595,But then we--
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,220.595,221.066,--Excuse me.
1999.99-387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,221.066,233.302,"--in that mixed picture I think would have the obligation to decide which is the better view, since we're not bound by one side or the other of that pre-code split."
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,248.905,249.398,Yes.
1999.99-387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,286.061,293.652,"Well, wouldn't we normally look to State law for the substantive law giving rise to any claim?"
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,296.964,298.231,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,298.231,310.399,"And if the State law provides that the burden of proof is on the taxpayer, why wouldn't we follow that, or vice versa?"
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,310.399,318.398,The validity of claims under nonbankruptcy law is not the same as the allowance of those claims in the bankruptcy estate.
1999.99-387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,332.445,334.724,Bankruptcy Act.
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,334.724,335.228,--Bankruptcy Act.
1999.99-387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,363.532,376.414,"Well, but the code... the Act gives tax claims priority, which indicates a certain preference, in a sense, for paying the taxes."
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,376.414,378.473,"Absolutely it does, Your Honor."
1999.99-387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,417.631,424.669,"Well, one might argue that the view of the Seventh Circuit here does not really favor taxing authorities in that sense."
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,436.291,437.39,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,451.826,457.968,"You don't deny, I take it, that that is a part of the State law of Illinois, the burden of proof."
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,457.968,461.805,"Burden of proof were matters of substantive law under Erie, yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-387,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,461.805,502.257,"I guess the question is, is whether we in effect would be chipping away at the concept of the validity of the claim if we did not recognize the burden-of-persuasion rule, and the argument, I suppose, that we would be chipping away at it, that we really would not be recognizing validity 100 percent, is the argument that the burden of persuasion is so important to the Government's claim that you really cannot conceive of the claim in traditional terms without conceiving of it as one upon which the taxpayer has the burden."
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,534.122,566.737,"I think that is precisely the argument of the Government, Your Honor, and our response is that bankruptcy historically alters debtor-creditor relationships as a matter of fact in every single case, and burdens of persuasion which exist outside of a bankruptcy context and are meant to allocate risk, are designed to allocate risk between litigants, we don't think apply in a bankruptcy context when parties in interest are different."
1999.99-387,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,598.178,626.442,"True, but I mean, I'm not sure that that gets to the, really to the heart of the point, that by adjusting, we'll say, the relations of fairness as between the original parties, the original taxpayer and the Government, you are in fact, or you would in fact, under the Bankruptcy Code, be changing the nature of the claim because you simply cannot understand the claim except in terms of who has the burden."
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,661.933,688.082,"Your Honor, if you start with the presumption that the Government's claim is based... their tax claim is based upon something, often their internal audits and internal assessments, if we look at what happens when they file a claim under section... under the Bankruptcy Code, and the prima facie validity of that claim that ascribes under section 3... under Bankruptcy Rule 3001(f), it's not the Government's initial burden at that point to do anything."
1999.99-387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,719.401,743.25,"Mr. Radasevich, I think you're now talking about the distinction between the burden of coming forward, which you concede that the taxpayer would have, and the ultimate burden of persuasion, but it is the ultimate burden of persuasion that's critical here, and why isn't it part and parcel of the substantive right?"
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,781.559,791.132,"--Justice Ginsburg, I think that the burden of proof attendant to tax claims is as much substantive of those claims as the burden of proof on any other claim."
1999.99-387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,880.929,885.879,"Well, did the objector here introduce some sort of evidence of the kind you're talking about?"
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,892.275,898.07,The Illinois Department of Revenue's evidence consisted of the notice of penalty or liability that was issued by the--
1999.99-387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,898.07,900.164,"I mean, what about the objector?"
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,904.6,905.243,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,905.243,906.215,Was that done here?
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,906.215,906.837,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-387,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,978.945,985.093,"Why didn't you just call him to the stand, Stoecker, and say, look, did you get the letters to the lawyer?"
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,1013.385,1019.27,"--Your Honor, Mr. Stoecker is currently a guest of the Federal Government, residing at a facility in Wisconsin, and--"
1999.99-387,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1020.395,1021.406,I didn't know that.
1999.99-387,0,40290,robert_radasevich,,1021.406,1022.333,During the trial--
1999.99-387,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1023.734,1025.738,But it might be easier to locate him.
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,1568.196,1572.984,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-387,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1719.441,1740.506,"I thought, Mr. Goldgar, that Mr. Radasevich had said if there were other claims that were like the tax claims, his rule would be the same, but he said on inspection there weren't many, that most of the others were affirmative defense cases."
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,1740.506,1741.922,"Yes, he did say that, as a matter of fact."
1999.99-387,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1751.382,1751.746,Are there?
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,1758.267,1760.931,I don't know of any myself.
1999.99-387,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1760.931,1761.64,You don't know of any.
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,1761.64,1764.112,"That doesn't mean there aren't any, but I couldn't name any for you now."
1999.99-387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1787.064,1795.088,"But of course your argument assumes that the burden of proof, or the burden of persuasion is part of the substantive law that governs the claim."
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,1795.088,1796.615,"Yes, that... we do assume that."
1999.99-387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.971,1812.619,"But you're... I mean, I don't think it's fair to say that the trustee here is asking to single out for some discriminatory treatment one particular class of creditors."
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,1819.324,1821.578,"Well, I don't--"
1999.99-387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1821.578,1825.776,"The black lung cases, maybe that's another, but--"
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,1825.776,1827.74,"--Well, let me--"
1999.99-387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.74,1851.302,"--The argument being made is, this is a very strange provision that does not exist in the common law normally and the purpose of it is to enable the Government, which normally does not have in its control the documents necessary to prove its case, to collect taxes that are due, and that when you shift over into a bankruptcy context the situation changes."
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,1859.254,1861.349,--Let me answer that a couple of ways.
1999.99-387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1876.929,1878.042,That's playing word games.
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,1878.042,1878.331,--Well--
1999.99-387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1878.331,1886.876,"I mean, you had to prove it the way the State law said you had to prove it, which is not the way everybody else has to prove it, that is, by a preponderance of the evidence, right?"
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,1886.876,1891.269,"--That's the burden of proof, though, that attaches to their claim, whatever it may be."
1999.99-387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1892.948,1925.112,"But this is a distinctive burden of proof that has been singled out for tax claims, and the argument being made is, there are good reasons for that, but those reasons don't apply in bankruptcy, and therefore this particular very weird element of, you don't have to bear the burden of proving your claim, should not be carried over into bankruptcy law, and there were many courts that came out that way under the old Bankruptcy Act, and Collier on Bankruptcy, the only bankruptcy authority I ever used, agreed with that."
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,1925.112,1928.439,"--Well, some courts came out that way and many courts did not."
1999.99-387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1958.729,1962.343,"Yes, but that's... look, he had very good answers to my questions."
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,2034.431,2038.409,"We should win because... well, for a couple of reasons."
1999.99-387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2042.344,2055.351,"Oh, no, I understand that's the conclusion, but the... to get to that conclusion you're going to have to show some kind of history, tradition, or reason, and those were the parts that I wanted to hear your answer to."
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,2055.351,2060.052,History or tradition or reason of the burden of--
1999.99-387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2060.052,2081.978,"The reason why, for example, although you have a good reason for saying the taxpayer should pay the burden where it's State v. Taxpayer, namely Taxpayer has the ability to keep the records, et cetera, you do not have that good reason where it's State v. Widows and Orphans, and the taxpayer is equally inaccessible to all of you."
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,2081.978,2082.284,Well--
1999.99-387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2082.284,2087.603,I'm not... I just want to know what your response is to what I take to be his responses to what I asked.
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,2087.603,2096.047,"--First of all, even if... I don't agree that that is the particular playing field we should be on."
1999.99-387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2096.552,2098.674,"But still, I'm just curious what the answers are."
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,2098.674,2109.445,"--But I take... you know, for the sake of argument, even if the set of facts that Mr. Radasevich posits is true here, or even occasionally true, it's certainly not always going to be true."
1999.99-387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2156.037,2160.357,I don't understand why you claim it's an ad hoc balancing.
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,2176.91,2179.609,"These would be nondischargeable, yes."
1999.99-387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2179.609,2184.832,"Right, so you could go after the taxpayer without ever making a claim in bankruptcy."
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,2184.832,2192.306,"Well, in this instance the taxpayer who, as Mr. Radasevich pointed out, is a guest of the Federal Government, and--"
1999.99-387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2192.306,2197.177,"Presumably won't always be, and the State can go after him in the future."
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,2197.177,2197.493,--Well--
1999.99-387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2197.493,2199.241,This is a nondischargeable debt.
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,2199.241,2200.374,--Two points about that.
1999.99-387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2211.14,2217.278,"But if you never made a claim through the bankruptcy proceeding, presumably the State can always go after the taxpayer."
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,2217.278,2239.375,"--Well, in that event, Justice O'Connor, the Government is put to an impossible choice, because in that instance we either have to choose, apparently, between making our claim in the bankruptcy and suffering a different burden of proof than we would have if we made the claim in the State court, or waiting until the bankruptcy is concluded, in which case the assets have been distributed hither and yon, and--"
1999.99-387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.375,2240.409,Why can't you do both?
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,2257.435,2257.598,--Well--
1999.99-387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2257.598,2259.435,--if you lost the bankruptcy action at all.
1999.99-387,1,16016,a_benjamin_goldgar,,2259.435,2261.167,--I'm not sure if we could or we couldn't.
1999.99-387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2264.296,2264.988,Right.
1999.99-387,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2636.82,2654.898,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-387,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2957.958,2960.959,"Mr. Wallace, it's not just Erie, is it?"
1999.99-387,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2986.18,2989.142,"Well, I'm just... I'm talking about the spirit of Erie."
1999.99-387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3145.262,3145.351,--I'm not sure that's an incongruity.
1999.99-387,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3150.235,3162.413,"They are as very strong evidence of the claim and it's often argued that they're res judicata, but there's nothing in the code about other kinds of judgments."
1999.99-387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3193.985,3222.394,"But they'd be bound by other sorts of judgments on some issues which, if the... if there had not been a judgment, and the issue were presented to the bankruptcy court, the bankruptcy court might well determine that issue differently from the way the State court... I mean, let's assume it wasn't an issue of burden of persuasion, but an issue of, I don't know, something that the forum decides."
1999.99-387,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3222.394,3227.297,--I don't mean to suggest that they should not be bound by other kinds of judgments.
1999.99-387,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3258.742,3259.34,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1999.99-387,3,40290,robert_radasevich,,3264.241,3265.752,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1999.99-387,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3313.421,3321.874,"Was there a defaulted administrative proceeding in the Illinois Tax Commission, or whatever body it is in Illinois that decides those sort of things?"
1999.99-387,3,40290,robert_radasevich,,3326.571,3332.258,"It was a claim that had not been administratively adjudicated except for the issuance of the NPL, which is the assessment."
1999.99-387,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3356.709,3361.082,Which would have been a circuit court challenge to the administrative adjudication?
1999.99-387,3,40290,robert_radasevich,,3361.082,3362.957,"Correct, Your Honor, and--"
1999.99-387,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3362.957,3371.151,"And the bankruptcy court, Judge Posner... or the bankruptcy court could have lifted the stay and allowed that circuit court proceeding to go forward?"
1999.99-387,3,40290,robert_radasevich,,3371.151,3371.47,--Sure.
1999.99-387,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3371.47,3375.679,In which case the burden would have been the burden that you don't like?
1999.99-387,3,40290,robert_radasevich,,3375.679,3376.735,Absolutely.
1999.99-387,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3376.735,3380.768,So it's going to be up to the bankruptcy judge whether you're going to have the burden or not?
1999.99-387,3,40290,robert_radasevich,,3380.768,3381.516,Absolutely.
1999.99-387,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3381.516,3382.608,Why--
