1987.86-1461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,62.802,"Mr. Cohen, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,62.802,65.629,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,183.441,184.817,Why?
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,184.817,185.801,For two reasons.
1987.86-1461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,189.879,191.236,Whether this hand billing was coercive?
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,191.236,194.016,"Correct, and, if so, whether it was protected by the 1st Amendment."
1987.86-1461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,474.704,476.187,"Mr. Cohen, can I ask you this question?"
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,490.713,493.962,--If the intention is to cause substantial harm to the secondary--
1987.86-1461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,493.962,495.071,"Well, it's the same intention here."
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,495.071,496.321,--That is correct.
1987.86-1461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,496.321,503.537,That's precisely the same because they don't want people to be going to the shopping center and buy in these stores until High gets its wages up.
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,506.756,507.334,That's correct.
1987.86-1461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,512.739,513.02,"No, no."
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,525.219,536.152,"--In our opinion, yes, because that predictably encourages a secondary boycott, and that's the test of coercion as this Court has set it in Safeco and Allied."
1987.86-1461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,536.152,542.728,Would it matter in this case if nobody ever paid any attention to the hand billing?
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,542.728,547.866,The question would come up at the outset of the hand billing.
1987.86-1461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,571.965,572.09,Were there--
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,572.09,580.915,"The union could come in and say, well, no one paid attention, it wasn't effective, it didn't have those foreseeable consequences, then, of course, that would be counter-evidence the Labor Board would have to assess."
1987.86-1461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,580.915,583.899,--Were there findings in this case as to what the consequences of the hand billing were?
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,583.899,591.1,The finding of the Board was that the union's conduct would cause substantial loss to secondary employers.
1987.86-1461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,597.723,627.008,"Well, Mr. Cohen, suppose we think the statute was intended to reach this kind of activity, how do you deal with Organization for a Better Austin, that case, that says even coercive hand billing is entitled to 1st Amendment protection, and what standard do we then apply?"
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,627.008,646.576,"The difference is this case arises under the Labor Act, where you have a delicate balance, to use Justice Blackmun's phrase, between the public interests, public interests in precluding this threat of labor discord on one side, public interest, as opposed to the interest in communicating the message."
1987.86-1461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,658.15,659.962,The language was very broad.
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,659.962,667.6,"--That's correct, but it wasn't done by a labor organization which, here, has many ways to express its message."
1987.86-1461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,711.912,713.755,And what tests do we employ?
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,717.252,728.639,"We look to the test of whether we're regulating this type of conduct, is there a strong government interest, does the statute directly advance that strong government interest, and does it advance it no further than necessary--"
1987.86-1461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,728.639,730.686,Some commercial speech standard.
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,730.686,731.748,--It's akin to the commercial speech.
1987.86-1461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,737.261,740.619,Is that a standard applied in the picketing?
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,740.619,748.258,"It's a standard that was applied in Safeco, we believe, and it's the standard that was applied in Allied, which was not a picketing case."
1987.86-1461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,749.195,751.741,Were there five on that constitutional holding?
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,751.741,758.098,"In Safeco, there were six members of the Court that reached the constitutional issue."
1987.86-1461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,758.098,758.442,And--
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,758.442,759.832,And found that that was constitutional.
1987.86-1461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,759.832,760.785,--that was constitutional.
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,760.785,761.238,That's correct.
1987.86-1461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,819.605,821.917,"We'll resume there at 1:00, Mr. Cohen."
1987.86-1461,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,846.485,855.232,"Unless the Court has additional questions of me, I think this is probably an appropriate time to save the rest of my time for rebuttal and turn it over to the Government."
1987.86-1461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,855.232,859.777,"Very well, Mr. Louis Cohen, we'll hear now from you."
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,859.777,871.195,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.588,989.414,Who is being coerced in this case by the hand billing?
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,989.414,1023.479,"The objects of the coercion in this case are the other stores in the mall who have no relation to any of the parties, either of the parties to the dispute, but who the union felt would be in a position to bring pressure on the mall owner, to bring pressure on their co-tenant, Wilson's, to bring pressure on its contractor, High's, to offer better wages and conditions to its employees."
1987.86-1461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.479,1028.554,That's the coercion the Board identified?
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,1028.554,1034.302,"It is the coercion of the neutral stores in the mall, yes."
1987.86-1461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1034.302,1042.799,"But how does that coerce in the ordinary sense of the word, other than by the persuasive power of the idea?"
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,1042.799,1075.239,"The coercion takes the form of asking shoppers not to patronize the neutral stores so that the neutral stores will be afraid that they will lose business, unless they become involved in somebody else's dispute and enter that dispute on the union's side."
1987.86-1461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1075.239,1084.064,"So, even though the message to the shoppers from the hand bills is not coercive, the result on the neutral stores could be coercive?"
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,1084.064,1085.22,Yes.
1987.86-1461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1125.907,1129.671,That's the same kind of coercion that would be involved in picketing.
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,1129.671,1135.123,"It is exactly, we think, the same kind of coercion as would be involved in picketing."
1987.86-1461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1135.123,1136.637,In the same degree as well.
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,1136.637,1138.34,I think that the--
1987.86-1461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.34,1142.463,"It's just a difference in the message to the shopper, I suppose."
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,1142.463,1154.491,--I think that the effectiveness of the delivery of the message can vary in a picketing case and can vary in a hand billing case.
1987.86-1461,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1166.69,1181.45,"Mr. Cohen, I asked your Petitioner's counsel whether the issue would be the same as a matter of statutory construction if the communication was in a different form, say a radio or sound truck or something like that, and he said it would be the same statutory issue."
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,1198.304,1200.583,We think it is the same constitutional issue.
1987.86-1461,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.968,1226.775,"So, you would say it's correct to judge this case as really a pure speech case in which the prohibition is justified entirely on the basis of the message and the audience that's involved?"
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,1226.775,1239.833,"I think it is a case of regulation of tactics which are, by their nature, expressive tactics in a labor dispute."
1987.86-1461,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1252.625,1261.246,"And you say it's proper for us to judge the case, even though there's absolutely no element of physical concern by the people receiving the hand billing?"
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,1270.93,1276.616,I think it should be judged on the assumption that this was an effective communication with a message.
1987.86-1461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1315.742,1317.787,The picketers usually carry the message anyway.
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,1317.787,1319.834,The picketer carries a message.
1987.86-1461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1319.834,1330.83,"I mean, something that you can read, not just his conduct carrying the message, but there's signs and manners and I suppose."
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,1330.83,1332.61,Yes.
1987.86-1461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1382.557,1412.03,"Mr. Cohen, suppose Congress is concerned about the trade imbalance and it makes it unlawful to picket in order to make somebody cease doing business with a foreign country, and you have a labor union that pickets the same mall, say this mall is selling products of South Africa or you pick your country, the Soviet Union or whatever, could the Government enforce that prohibition?"
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,1412.03,1424.197,"Well, in the labor context where what you had was not picketing but other signalling to union members--"
1987.86-1461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1424.197,1426.431,"Well, they do the same thing."
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,1439.848,1441.909,"--I think probably, I think probably not."
1987.86-1461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1441.909,1443.237,What's the--
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,1443.237,1444.547,Probably Congress cannot do that.
1987.86-1461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1444.547,1445.359,--Why?
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,1445.359,1459.932,"Because that is raising an issue of public importance on which there is a fully-protected constitutional right to speak, but--"
1987.86-1461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1459.932,1467.523,He wasn't watching.
1987.86-1461,1,34284,louis_r_cohen,,1469.584,1472.333,--I tried that once.
1987.86-1461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1472.333,1475.066,Even Homer nodded.
1987.86-1461,2,34526,lawrence_gold,,1478.191,1482.048,That might have been discretion rather than valor.
1987.86-1461,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1657.135,1662.789,Whether it's made at the entrance to the mall or whether it's a full-page ad in the morning paper?
1987.86-1461,2,34526,lawrence_gold,,1662.789,1664.023,That is correct.
1987.86-1461,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1686.53,1687.545,What if it wasn't?
1987.86-1461,2,34526,lawrence_gold,,1691.497,1722.921,"Well, we believe, based on the decisions of this Court that if the statute was directed at leafleting, in other words, if Congress said that the streets are close to union that want to communicate this message with this viewpoint, that would be unlawful because leafleting has always been regarded by this Court from Schneider v. State on as a form of pure speech."
1987.86-1461,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1819.196,1820.571,"But that's not unusual, Mr. Gold."
1987.86-1461,2,34526,lawrence_gold,,1878.8,1893.637,"--Well, it seems to me that insofar as Congress regulates the underlying actions, you have a different case."
1987.86-1461,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1936.62,1941.853,"Well, if you limit it to consumer, I can't think of a parallel, but it seems to me what I've just given you is a precise parallel."
1987.86-1461,2,34526,lawrence_gold,,1975.404,1980.23,--I really am hard-pressed.
1987.86-1461,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2033.506,2035.552,Doesn't it depend on the purpose of it?
1987.86-1461,2,34526,lawrence_gold,,2057.824,2059.574,"--Well, I don't--"
1987.86-1461,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2059.574,2061.98,"If you pay me $30 a month, I won't tell them."
1987.86-1461,2,34526,lawrence_gold,,2062.401,2066.728,--I don't know of any state that doesn't have a blackmail law.
1987.86-1461,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2066.728,2075.444,"--Right, and one can do that, even though the customers are entitled to know how dirty the place is and you have a 1st Amendment right to tell the customers how dirty the place is."
1987.86-1461,2,34526,lawrence_gold,,2082.988,2145.836,"Well, I'm just not certain of that, and there's no social purpose of the 1st Amendment which is furthered by non-communication in exchange for money, but if the 1st Amendment doesn't protect your communication at least when you're not talking about commercial speech, not in the Posados controversy that, you know, the Puerto Rican gambling case that the Court had two years ago, I don't know of any case which says that a communication advising people of the facts and making an argument to them and asking them to do something which they have a lawful right to do and which is not banned in any way would withstand constitutional muster."
1987.86-1461,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.639,2198.863,"You don't think there's any difference between a union who's got a labor dispute with some tenant in the mall doing this hand billing than, say, some community group that's just a do-good community group saying we just don't like people to pay sub-standard wages, so they take out a big ad in the paper, they can do that?"
1987.86-1461,2,34526,lawrence_gold,,2202.471,2203.095,No.
1987.86-1461,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2241.471,2266.836,"Do you think, Mr. Gold, that Safeco and decisions like that rest at bottom on the understanding that in the labor law context, unions have been given certain powers and corresponding duties and the same with employers in that context and that has somehow changed the standard a little bit under which we view some of these regulations?"
1987.86-1461,2,34526,lawrence_gold,,2269.366,2273.957,"--As the losing advocate in Safeco, I--"
1987.86-1461,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.957,2276.02,Let's hear a good argument for Safeco.
1987.86-1461,2,34526,lawrence_gold,,2276.02,2283.938,"--I'm not about to try it, but I would hate to redouble my losses."
1987.86-1461,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2376.011,2378.339,Did Gibboney involve picketing?
1987.86-1461,2,34526,lawrence_gold,,2378.339,2389.787,"Gibboney was a case which involved picketing in part, but it also involved secondary strikes under union discipline."
1987.86-1461,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.16,2476.644,Isn't part of the question involved here whether this is commercial speech or not?
1987.86-1461,2,34526,lawrence_gold,,2476.644,2477.097,Yes.
1987.86-1461,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2644.684,2654.212,"Mr. Gold, if a standard approaching to used in commercial speech cases were applied here, would your client lose?"
1987.86-1461,2,34526,lawrence_gold,,2654.212,2667.598,I don't know whether this interest that is asserted ought to suffice even in that context.
1987.86-1461,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3097.051,3099.176,That's the explanation.
1987.86-1461,2,34526,lawrence_gold,,3109.079,3118.732,"--My point is that was the only example over raised in the debates, even insofar as the debates talked about picketing."
1987.86-1461,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3118.732,3125.93,"But if the reason for including it is to show we don't mean speech to be covered, they wouldn't have put in there distributed by another."
1987.86-1461,2,34526,lawrence_gold,,3131.975,3144.111,"Justice Scalia, I'm not arguing that they the issue was either posed or answered in those general terms."
1987.86-1461,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3266.909,3268.86,"Mr. Gold, your time has expired."
1987.86-1461,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3272.937,3282.59,Let me be clear at the outset exactly what it is the message that's being limited in this case.
1987.86-1461,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3355.529,3365.869,"You think, I take it, or do you, you say the full-page ad in the morning paper reproducing this hand bill would also be bad?"
1987.86-1461,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3365.869,3366.946,--I would say--
1987.86-1461,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3366.946,3370.976,That would be also illegal under the--
1987.86-1461,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3370.976,3376.989,--If the foreseeable consequences of that advertisement--
1987.86-1461,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3376.989,3381.238,"--What if the Board found that it was coercive, just as coercive as hand bills?"
1987.86-1461,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3381.238,3382.207,"--Then, it would be impermissible."
1987.86-1461,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3382.207,3384.55,And then it would be just as constitutional--
1987.86-1461,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3384.55,3390.002,Because what's impermissible is not to say we have a dispute with High or High pays sub-standard wages.
1987.86-1461,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3396.936,3397.639,"--Then, you don't think it's--"
1987.86-1461,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3397.639,3400.076,"Because however they communicated it, if that's--"
1987.86-1461,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3400.076,3407.885,"--You don't think the place that this took place, where this occurred, is really very significant?"
1987.86-1461,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3407.885,3408.915,--That's correct.
1987.86-1461,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3444.527,3448.041,But that is a distinction under our constitutional cases.
1987.86-1461,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3448.041,3449.697,That is--
1987.86-1461,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3449.697,3452.977,Picketing is always thought to be speech plus or something more.
1987.86-1461,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3452.977,3456.585,"--Let me indicate that in many contexts, it may be."
1987.86-1461,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3482.513,3486.59,But there are non-union members who won't cross a picket line.
1987.86-1461,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3486.59,3516.796,"There are going here, if they make a choice of not shopping at the center, whether it's because of the picket sign or hand billing, they are going to do it not because they're fearful of union discipline, they're going to do it because they have made a reasoned decision and that reasoned it's not if a customer, whether he's a union member or whatever beliefs, decides I don't want to shop at East Lake Square Mall, it's not because, as he would in a single picketing case, he's fearful that the union is going to discipline him if he does anything."
1987.86-1461,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3566.37,3572.586,"Or somebody who is somebody who has a union sign on them then handing out a hand bill, too."
1987.86-1461,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3572.586,3573.024,That's correct.
1987.86-1461,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3614.118,3615.32,"Thank you, Mr. Cohen."
