2001.00-1406,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,8.545,11.683,Mr. Shapiro.
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,11.683,24.975,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: According to the National Institutes of Health, hepatitis C kills 8,000 to 10,000 people in this country every year, and it's the largest cause of liver transplants."
2001.00-1406,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,105.677,107.452,"Where do we find that, Mr. Shapiro?"
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,107.452,112.199,That is found on page 59a of the petition appendix.
2001.00-1406,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,112.199,113.563,59a?
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,113.563,115.997,"59a, Your Honor, yes."
2001.00-1406,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,115.997,118.969,"Actually it's 58a, 1211(a), at the bottom--"
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,118.969,125.945,"It begins on 58a, but the pertinent provision, 12113(a), is right there on 59a."
2001.00-1406,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,125.945,127.226,--You first referred to the general rule.
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,127.803,138.66,And the general provision says it is permissible to use qualification standards and tests that are job-related and consistent with business necessity.
2001.00-1406,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,147.0,148.774,Which one is the general provision?
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,148.774,154.43,"--The... the first part is 12113(a), which states: in general."
2001.00-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,181.673,190.589,"And why isn't it an exhaustive description at least of that category, of the category of direct threat to health or safety?"
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,222.252,239.63,"We think the... the phrase, may include, is illustrative of matters that might fit into the general description that comes just before and that injury to... to other persons and injury to self are... are both matters that fit within the general description of business necessity, public safety--"
2001.00-1406,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.63,249.761,"Well, there's some legislative history that suggests that indeed it wasn't intended to allow review of danger or risk to the employee himself."
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,249.761,257.257,--We found several instances that we cite in our brief where Congress was talking about injury to... to the individual himself.
2001.00-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.008,269.434,It's... surely it's exclusive to some extent.
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,282.809,284.75,That might be an inference from that language--
2001.00-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,284.75,285.455,Right.
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,285.793,286.979,--that that would be inconsistent with the express language.
2001.00-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,286.979,287.351,--Right.
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,291.603,309.27,We think it's... it's particularly weak because the... the provision that comes right before this provision that deals with discrimination makes it clear that the employer may use medical examinations and may make an offer of employment contingent on the results of those medical examinations.
2001.00-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.378,312.947,--Where... where is that now?
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,313.236,318.77,"That is in section 12112(d), which is quoted in our reply brief at page 7."
2001.00-1406,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,318.77,319.717,--Where do we find that?
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,320.749,322.857,At reply brief page 7.
2001.00-1406,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,361.04,388.077,"Well, Mr. Shapiro, as I go through this statute, under your theory of the case, beginning on page 58a, 12118, do you concede, for purposes of the statutory analysis, that the employee here was a qualified individual?"
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,388.077,390.512,We... we deny that he was a qualified individual.
2001.00-1406,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,399.307,416.146,"So, as... as you see the case, could we dispose of the case by reading just 1211... 121118 and end it right there--"
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,416.146,417.055,Absolutely.
2001.00-1406,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,417.055,424.403,--and find what we're talking about in defenses just does not bear on our determination one way or the other?
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,430.43,432.0,"I... I would agree with that, and we--"
2001.00-1406,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,432.0,441.038,It's hard to say he's not qualified when he worked there for the other contractor in the same circumstances for 20 years or so.
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,441.038,448.097,--The qualification standard focuses on whether he can perform the job on an ongoing basis in the near term.
2001.00-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.808,463.208,But 12113 specifically deals with qualification standards.
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,479.555,482.731,There is linguistic overlap and there is practical overlap.
2001.00-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,484.134,494.165,"I mean, you wouldn't... you wouldn't say that... that a person is not a qualified individual if he would pose an indirect threat to the health or safety of others, would you?"
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,513.856,517.571,--Our view is that there's overlap between qualification and business necessity.
2001.00-1406,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,517.571,518.48,Are we ultimately--
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,518.48,519.307,But they're not coextensive.
2001.00-1406,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,519.307,522.567,"--Are we ultimately asking the question, is he qualified?"
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,522.567,524.259,That's the first question.
2001.00-1406,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,534.456,549.993,"Well, but let me... when we go through the whole statute, including 121113, do you ultimately say we come to the conclusion that after reading the whole statute, he is not qualified, as that term is used in 8?"
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,549.993,551.258,That's our principal submission.
2001.00-1406,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,552.205,555.095,"Now, you don't even rely on the EEOC regulation?"
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,557.324,561.493,"--We... we... it's one of our... we have several arguments in the alternative, yes."
2001.00-1406,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,561.493,565.58,The regulation specifically says the individual... the threat to the individual can be considered.
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,565.58,567.233,We believe we... we can win the case on that ground.
2001.00-1406,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,567.233,571.031,But the Ninth Circuit thought that went beyond the clear terms of the statute.
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,571.031,585.931,"Yes, and we think that that regulation is perfectly consistent with... with the general defense provision, and we believe we can win the case under that regulation and, indeed, that it's entitled to Chevron deference because this agency had legislative rulemaking power to issue that standard."
2001.00-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,585.931,593.611,"But then you give the... then you give the agency no deference at all when the agency says, yes, of course, he's a qualified individual."
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,611.566,612.103,We--
2001.00-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,612.103,616.578,"So, it's kind of when you like what the agency says, you respect it, and when you don't like it, you don't respect it."
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,616.578,626.881,"--Well, I would note that the... the agency in its cert stage amicus brief said that the qualification issue is whether the individual can perform the job in the near term."
2001.00-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,630.513,639.058,"Well, if you agree with what they said... they have spelled it out what their position is in their brief, and they said, in no uncertain terms, this is a qualified individual."
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,639.058,641.166,--But you'll... you'll note--
2001.00-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,641.166,642.568,"That's just in the brief, though."
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,645.374,646.117,--Absolutely.
2001.00-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,646.417,649.272,"And we're... we're not paying any attention to what they say in briefs, are we?"
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,650.37,652.849,"--Well, they say... they say helpful things in the brief too."
2001.00-1406,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,674.769,678.234,"Just out of curiosity, why does he want to kill himself?"
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,678.234,680.463,"--It's an old story, Your Honor."
2001.00-1406,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,685.087,685.643,All right.
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,695.574,700.525,"--Well, if you read the cases that we've cited, it's amazing how frequently people with--"
2001.00-1406,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,700.525,704.406,"In all those other cases, it seemed to me... in all the cases that you cited--"
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,704.406,704.983,--Yes.
2001.00-1406,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,704.983,709.236,"--there was a different issue at stake, and that in part was whether he could do the job."
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,716.462,718.114,We... we don't assume that.
2001.00-1406,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,718.114,718.42,All right.
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,733.263,737.889,We say he... he is like the steel worker with vertigo who can fall--
2001.00-1406,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,737.889,737.889,Fine.
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,737.889,737.889,--off the beam at any moment--
2001.00-1406,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,737.889,738.465,Fine.
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,742.84,743.377,--I hope not.
2001.00-1406,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,743.377,744.37,"No, all right."
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,778.465,787.216,"This statute rejects that thesis in the medical examination provisions, recognizing that the employer has a stake in this issue."
2001.00-1406,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,789.817,800.469,Is it the case that it would violate the Occupational Safety and Health Act for Chevron to hire this person under those circumstances?
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,801.417,806.179,"Arguably it would, Your Honor, because this is a known hazard."
2001.00-1406,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,806.179,810.333,Does that have to be considered then in the balance of qualification?
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,812.934,821.562,It should... it should factor into the business necessity evaluation because we do have a business necessity to avoid violating State law and Federal law.
2001.00-1406,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,823.708,828.992,What section of the OSHA would you point to on that?
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,828.992,830.207,--I would point to the general duty--
2001.00-1406,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,830.207,832.048,And is it... is it in the material before us?
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,832.048,841.829,"--Oh, I... I see we... we didn't put it in our appendix, but it's the general duty provision of the OSHA statute cited in our opening brief and our reply brief."
2001.00-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,849.259,852.232,Where... where is the text of that that you're reading now?
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,852.232,854.255,It's the general duty clause--
2001.00-1406,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,854.255,858.137,Maybe you can supply it later rather than take your time now--
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,858.137,858.509,--Yes.
2001.00-1406,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,859.662,860.488,--because we would be interested.
2001.00-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,860.488,869.654,You were... you were about to say why the... the employer has an interest other than the mere charitable one in not letting an employee kill himself.
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,869.654,870.519,Yes.
2001.00-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,870.519,872.338,What... what is... what are the interests?
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,872.338,873.286,There are several--
2001.00-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,873.286,874.4,Other than not violating OSHA.
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,874.4,875.349,--several interests.
2001.00-1406,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,882.408,885.38,Does Workman's Comp go up if... if he suffers?
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,885.38,886.494,It... it could.
2001.00-1406,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,887.487,897.147,"Suppose the Federal statute said this is... this preempts any inconsistent duty, that the employer is not liable for compliance with this statute."
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,897.147,903.796,"Well, we would hope that preemption would work that way, but preemption issues in the States court often do not."
2001.00-1406,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,903.796,904.289,Let's assume... let's assume it does.
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,905.692,907.261,"Oh, yes, there still is."
2001.00-1406,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,907.261,907.716,And what is that?
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,907.716,914.32,"That's... that's preservation of employment relations, avoidance of adverse publicity, and... and fear of criminal responsibility."
2001.00-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,977.767,991.846,Wasn't that the argument that was made in Johnson's Control that this is unsafe the... the... allowing a woman of child-bearing capacity to work... was it... what was the toxic substance--
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,991.846,992.234,Yes.
2001.00-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,992.234,999.936,"--that... that the same kind of evidence that you have about how dangerous it was, it's as dangerous to the woman, dangerous to the fetus?"
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,999.936,1006.102,"That was evaluated under a different legal standard, the BOFQ standard, which is much more stringent."
2001.00-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1026.602,1030.112,But I thought the BFOQ goes together with an explicit sex--
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1030.112,1031.06,Yes.
2001.00-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1031.06,1031.886,--what do they call it?
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1032.796,1033.372,Exactly.
2001.00-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1033.372,1040.431,And that here... and the business necessity goes with neutral rule disparate effect.
2001.00-1406,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1043.031,1051.205,Business necessity applies to any screening test or medical examination or qualification standard that the employer uses.
2001.00-1406,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1070.691,1072.177,"Very well, Mr. Shapiro."
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1073.413,1091.906,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I could first address just how the statute works with respect to whether an individual is qualified."
2001.00-1406,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1149.825,1151.432,I... I have one question.
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1184.869,1187.115,"Well, the context is very important here."
2001.00-1406,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.622,1223.136,"Perhaps Congress thought like Justice Breyer, that it's quite implausible that anybody would want to kill himself."
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1237.996,1248.316,"The threat to self context can come up where an employee wants to either, A, assume the risk or, B, there's a disagreement about whether that risk in fact exists."
2001.00-1406,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1316.47,1320.762,"Well, they have a physician's exam and report."
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1321.671,1326.295,--The regulations require it to be based on objective or other medical examination.
2001.00-1406,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1326.295,1326.667,"Well, so this--"
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1326.667,1327.493,And that may... well may be.
2001.00-1406,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1327.493,1330.754,"--So, is that enough in... in the view of the Government?"
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1330.754,1335.462,"In the view of the Government, if the medical opinion is reasonable, then that's enough."
2001.00-1406,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1337.07,1340.785,But you take the position in the brief that perhaps it isn't.
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1342.521,1355.274,"--The position that the EEOC argued to the Ninth Circuit, which the Ninth Circuit did not address and would be available on remand, was that there was a factual dispute that summary judgment should not be entered on whether there was a reasonable determination."
2001.00-1406,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1362.787,1364.728,Can I ask you a question about the reg?
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1418.598,1431.397,"With all due respect, Justice Breyer, what the... what the agency did... and it's on page 60a of the petition... is said that a valid qualification standard includes a requirement that there not be a direct threat to the individual."
2001.00-1406,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1436.737,1438.289,And you left out three things.
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1454.348,1470.156,"But what... what the agency did, as a matter of administrative convenience in protecting the rights of disabled persons, is that in... in crafting a regulatory threat to self defense, it wanted to ensure that the same protections would be given to workers and that there had to be a showing of a significant risk of substantial harm."
2001.00-1406,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1500.045,1501.903,"May I ask you, Ms. Blatt?"
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1506.648,1515.482,"Yes, on the... the EEOC argued that the summary judgment on... on direct threat with respect to petitioner's argument."
2001.00-1406,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1521.222,1543.141,"Is the district court saying that those two other doctors don't count because they weren't before... I thought you had just said, in response to an earlier question, that that would be open if the... on remand, the question of whether this person was in fact a risk to himself because, as I understand it, there were two witnesses that said he... he was not."
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1543.141,1550.322,Petitioner is arguing that its medical... physicians advised that there was... that there was a direct threat here.
2001.00-1406,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1559.488,1560.807,But the district judge said they didn't.
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1568.255,1583.387,"--It's... but what's relevant is not that the opinions were submitted late, it's whether at the time... the... the relevant inquiries at the time the employment decision is made, but you can still ignore what the medical literature says and make an unreasonable decision."
2001.00-1406,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1583.387,1590.983,"--So, you think... you're saying the district court erred as to that extent in saying summary judgment, no trial."
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1594.715,1599.612,"The United States hasn't independently briefed it, but that is what the EEOC argued to the Ninth Circuit."
2001.00-1406,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1616.99,1624.587,"But do you have a position on the question whether, as a matter of law, the defendant has sustained the burden of proof that it was a reasonable medical decision?"
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1624.587,1627.598,--The EEOC argued below no.
2001.00-1406,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1627.598,1629.334,I'm not asking what the EEO argued below.
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1632.427,1638.388,"I don't know what the United States' position on that is, but we don't have any reason to disagree with the EEOC."
2001.00-1406,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.167,1648.197,Was inappropriate.
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1648.197,1657.941,"Inappropriate, right, that there was a genuine fact dispute about whether the direct threat test was met here, and we think the Ninth Circuit should be able to... to address that in the first instance."
2001.00-1406,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1657.941,1663.263,Address whether... whether that argument is true or not.
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1663.263,1673.294,"Right, that because there is a valid regulation that the EEOC promulgated and it's entitled to deference, it should be upheld, and there's just a question about whether it was met in this particular case."
2001.00-1406,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.294,1683.491,"Ms. Blatt, I... I find it peculiar to say he was a qualified individual but he didn't meet the employer's qualification standards."
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1691.171,1693.316,"May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?"
2001.00-1406,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1693.316,1693.772,Yes.
2001.00-1406,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1693.772,1696.949,It's just... if I could give you the example of the airline pilot with a contagious disease.
2001.00-1406,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1706.98,1707.723,"Thank you, Ms. Blatt."
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1711.892,1712.47,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.00-1406,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1768.835,1778.023,"Just tell us, if you would, why the employee would want to take a job where the doctor says it's going to kill you?"
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1778.023,1779.304,"--Well, I... I think that--"
2001.00-1406,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1779.304,1783.058,These toxins will cause your early death.
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1785.37,1788.342,"--Well, I think there aren't really employees who want to do that."
2001.00-1406,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1809.808,1810.717,And what is it here?
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1810.717,1814.516,And... and here I think it's clear there's a dispute about the nature of the risk.
2001.00-1406,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1851.046,1852.532,May I interrupt you just for a moment?
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1861.243,1863.306,"--I think that... I think that is correct, Your Honor."
2001.00-1406,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1874.618,1875.461,How sure can you be about that?
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1889.934,1894.885,"Well, I... I think they have... they have the same right as people who don't have disabilities."
2001.00-1406,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1900.624,1904.71,"Well, I... I want to also get your view on that because there's another aspect of the case that I'm puzzled by."
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1916.805,1921.8,"--Well, I... I think that the testimony of... of the two experts on our side of the case... this is why I say it's disputed."
2001.00-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1941.119,1953.092,Is it conceivable that someone would not be disabled but still be in a position where the... he would propose a risk to himself similar to this?
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1953.092,1955.321,"--I... I... of course, it's possible."
2001.00-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1958.043,1961.098,Surely the employer can say no in that situation.
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1961.098,1971.418,"--Well, I think... I think what the employer can do... the employer can certainly do whatever it wants with respect to people who don't have disabilities as defined in the statute, at least as far as the ADA is concerned."
2001.00-1406,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1991.358,1997.014,But the reason you make... I think the reason you make that argument is essentially the... the paternalism theory.
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2031.954,2035.031,I think... I think we can say that.
2001.00-1406,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2047.291,2051.378,"Well, as I understand... I want to come back to that, but go ahead."
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2051.831,2054.35,"Well, I... I was done with that point."
2001.00-1406,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2054.35,2074.206,"--I was just going to say with respect to... when you get to the regulation itself, one answer from the Government was that the... the reason the regulation mentioned threats to others is that there was... there was case law on the point, and there's... there really isn't comparable case law on threats to individuals."
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2084.897,2097.341,"Well, I think... I think that... that I may misconstrue their argument, but... but certainly... certainly as to the state of the Rehabilitation Act law at the time the ADA was adopted, there was a specific regulation by the EEOC."
2001.00-1406,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2151.771,2162.052,"Well, isn't there some room, though, for the argument that it... there may be a business necessity not to hire somebody who's going to be killed as a result?"
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2185.745,2188.43,"Well, I think... I think there may be arguments there."
2001.00-1406,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2196.808,2206.384,"Maybe but notwithstanding the regulation, just looking at the provisions of the act as applied in this case, how do we deal with that business necessity argument?"
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2206.384,2209.606,"--Well, I think I'd say two things about that."
2001.00-1406,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2244.529,2247.706,"Well, I thought Justice O'Connor's question was somewhat broader."
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2264.963,2266.57,Certainly--
2001.00-1406,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2266.57,2276.973,"It seems to me that that's a very, very important policy to further, and your position wants an employer to take a position that could be completely barbarous."
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2298.482,2309.339,"--Well, I think that this Court confronted basically the same argument in the Johnson Controls case, that the employer said... the employer said, look, we have a moral interest in the safety of our employees."
2001.00-1406,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2309.339,2322.259,But wasn't that a case involving a broad category of all women of child-bearing age whether or not you were dealing with a specific individual who had been told by the doctor you better not do this.
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2342.01,2344.511,"Well, I... I mean, two points with respect to that."
2001.00-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2388.184,2408.125,"But once... once you eliminate the stereotyping as, you know, Justice Souter was... was inquiring about, I don't see why Congress would be so adamant about paternalism for the handicapped but not adamant about paternalism for everybody else."
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2449.696,2451.015,"--Well, I think two... two points."
2001.00-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2482.883,2483.914,By doctors?
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2486.765,2491.345,"--By doctor... by doctors, company doctors, as occurs... as occurred--"
2001.00-1406,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2491.345,2495.681,"You're against even the most extreme case, which this may not be."
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2526.6,2529.384,"--Well, I don't think it's a question of... of whose ox is gored."
2001.00-1406,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2531.408,2531.985,"Well, explain why it isn't."
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2531.985,2532.522,--Right.
2001.00-1406,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2545.238,2550.355,You tell me how I write this sentence in the paragraph that says the reg doesn't matter?
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2558.241,2562.449,"Well, I... I think that deference doesn't apply when Congress has explicitly--"
2001.00-1406,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2562.449,2568.931,"If it's clear, that's right, but I find it pretty hard to say it's clear when you start talking about extreme cases."
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2586.226,2589.942,"--So, two... two points about the extreme cases, I mean, if that's what we're focusing on."
2001.00-1406,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2605.34,2605.711,No.
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2624.493,2634.318,"--Well, I think that... I think that one of the... one of the changes that the ADA makes in the direct threat provision is broadening that from contagious diseases to all other kinds of risks, number one."
2001.00-1406,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2634.318,2635.6,You tell me about the reg.
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2635.6,2636.547,"Right, right."
2001.00-1406,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2652.69,2654.093,You're not telling me about the reg.
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2669.984,2686.248,"--Well, I... I think that the question... the question is, as I said, whether Congress has spoken to the matter with respect to whether an employer can exclude an individual based on risk to self, and we say that Congress has spoken to that matter in 12113(b), the direct threat provision."
2001.00-1406,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2686.248,2688.273,"Sure, but the... the question is how plainly."
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2747.92,2748.746,Okay.
2001.00-1406,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2770.583,2773.1,"Absolutely, but I don't know how to draw the line."
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2774.009,2807.28,"--And... and I think the contextual point helps answer that with the... the consistent statements both in the statutory findings and in this provision, the change from the... from the Rehabilitation Act regs, and consistently in the legislative history, including that specifically referring to this particular provision saying the reason why we cut this language out basically is in order to say that paternalistic determinations, determinations by employers for the safety of employees, for the safety of the particular excluded employees, should not be permitted to justify--"
2001.00-1406,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2807.28,2808.478,Okay.
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2832.998,2836.259,"--Paternalism for everybody, the non-disabled, as well as the disabled--"

2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2836.542,2839.309,--taken as a whole... I... I agree is taken kind of as part of the OSHA.
2001.00-1406,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2884.634,2894.127,"So, that may... that may simply get us down to a very important point but not a point here, and that is, the... a sufficiency of evidence point or a... or a sufficient specificity of evidence point."
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2895.78,2897.266,"--Well, the problem... right."
2001.00-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2925.13,2926.987,Did it say that?
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,2936.481,2948.164,"--Well, I think that... I think that the closest is that just as the direct threat provision excludes an indirect threat as a basis for... for excluding someone, so too does the threat to others language there exclude threats to self."
2001.00-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2948.164,2955.428,"Yes, but you... you have to push beyond the analogy from direct threat to indirect threat to... to get that far out."

2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3044.016,3047.898,I think that that would be a neutral qualification standard.
2001.00-1406,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3054.79,3065.276,"So, if the... if Standard Oil had a... had a qualification that anyone with hepatitis beyond a certain degree is ineligible for employment, that would be okay?"
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3065.276,3069.939,"--Well, I think the point... the point of its neutrality in the lifting hypothetical--"
2001.00-1406,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3069.939,3077.741,"Some... some neutral standard that whatever... they phrase it in medical terms, and if you cross the threshold, you're at too much of a risk and we'll... we won't employ you."
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3077.741,3086.74,"--Well, I think if they have to ask themselves what is your medical condition, do you have hepatitis C, which hepatitis C is a disability in this case, then it's no longer neutral."
2001.00-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3097.432,3097.432,"Well, then you're discriminating against people with hernias probably."

2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3261.81,3262.841,--Right.
2001.00-1406,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3284.844,3289.052,"Well, that goes to the issue on remand if there is one."

2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3290.622,3291.819,--I... I agree with that.
2001.00-1406,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3293.405,3306.392,"--But if we're focusing on our concern about extreme cases, of which this may not be one, have you thought of a form of words that might cabin those off if they ever occur, which would give some meaning to the reg?"
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3306.392,3307.257,--I--
2001.00-1406,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3307.257,3308.621,And what's the form of words?
2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3308.621,3311.715,--I don't know that I can give any meaning to the reg that's--
2001.00-1406,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3311.715,3322.301,"If you can... if you apply it, you could think of an extreme case where the person is... you know, the suicidal worker, I'm going to die with my boots on and I hope tomorrow."

2001.00-1406,2,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3388.498,3406.247,"--I... I think outside of the situation... the first two situations that I spoke of where the person isn't qualified or where the person is excluded under a neutral job-related and consistent with business necessity qualification standard, that I would suspect excludes everybody except what we've now described as the really extreme cases."
