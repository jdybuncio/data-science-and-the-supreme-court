2006.05-493,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.286,We'll hear argument next in Ayers versus Belmontes.
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,6.475,9.907,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,109.371,127.504,"Mr. Johnson, would you comment on the footnote on the... on the... drawing the distinction with regard to the dance contest that the defendant won in that case, between... it's over here; I'm asking the question... between facts that occurred before the crime and facts that might have occurred after."
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,127.504,128.414,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,202.133,203.703,"It doesn't have to be forward... looking, does it?"
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,212.29,213.25,--Yes Your Honor.
2006.05-493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,236.584,237.215,Well it was--
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,237.215,237.605,--evidence.
2006.05-493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,237.605,241.619,--it was addressing itself to the fact... to the words of the factor (k) instruction.
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,249.264,255.298,It does not... it does not relate to the seriousness of the... of the crime at all.
2006.05-493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,256.579,263.572,"Well, I mean, it has to relate to the gravity of the crime, under the words of factor (k), doesn't it?"
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,263.572,273.549,"--It would relate to the gravity... to circumstances that extenuate the gravity of the crime, for purposes of a jury's sentencing determination."
2006.05-493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,321.151,321.662,"Well, now, do you--"
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,321.662,322.34,--of parole.
2006.05-493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,322.34,331.637,"--do you have an instruction that supports what you've just told us, that the jury is told they have to make a single moral determination?"
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,334.0,334.199,"No, that's--"
2006.05-493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,334.199,335.02,--instructed in items of factor (k)?
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,335.02,335.27,--The--
2006.05-493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,335.27,344.697,"And I think you have to rest on your argument, that what we are talking about is the gravity of his crime ""for purposes of sentencing""."
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,360.318,363.949,"--No, they are... and I may have been misleading."
2006.05-493,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,377.639,378.149,Well--
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,378.149,385.364,"--light of that determination, jurors, naturally, would understand that they could take into account anything that extenuated the gravity of the crime."
2006.05-493,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,385.364,386.706,"--Well, that's what they were told, right?"
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,392.429,393.04,Yes.
2006.05-493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,395.802,397.361,May I ask you about that?
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,426.6,454.289,"--It would have been constitutional, to the extent that it would have allowed the jurors to give some use whatsoever to Belmontes' proffered evidence in mitigation, and that's what this Court's prior cases has... and, particularly, the various Texas cases have said that jurors must be given an avenue to make use of the evidence."
2006.05-493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,455.22,457.421,I'm not sure you've answered my question.
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,472.782,476.453,--It would appear to... no.
2006.05-493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,477.623,480.986,"Because that would have foreclosed consideration of the Skipper-type evidence, right?"
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,480.986,485.61,"--It would have... well, it would foreclose consideration of all present good-character evidence, I believe."
2006.05-493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,490.713,501.668,"So, then the question in this case is whether the jury might have understood factor (k) to limit them to the consideration of factors that extenuate the gravity of the crime."
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,501.668,512.217,"Well, the... yes, the question is whether the jurors would reasonably understand the instruction to preclude the consideration of constitutionally... of relevant evidence."
2006.05-493,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,512.217,524.526,"This Court, in Payton, said that it was not unreasonable to conclude that evidence of remorse extenuated the gravity of the crime."
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,538.795,551.163,"Well, to the... to the extent... the jurors would have likely understood that, it... that instruction in Belmontes and in Payton, to extenuate the gravity of the crime for purposes of their sentencing determination--"
2006.05-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,551.163,552.575,"Well, that's what I thought your position was."
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,552.785,552.985,--Yes--
2006.05-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.985,560.169,"--then you back off of it, and you say, ""extenuate the gravity"" of the crime doesn't relate to anything that's after the crime."
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,566.854,568.677,--That's precisely my argument.
2006.05-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,568.677,571.589,"Well, then your answer to Justice Stevens should have been different."
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,571.589,575.412,"Well, if... and I apologize if I was misunderstood."
2006.05-493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,575.633,575.943,Do you think--
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,575.943,576.264,--question--
2006.05-493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,576.264,581.807,"--that the jury in this very case understood that, given the questions that were asked?"
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,581.807,582.779,"--Oh, yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,621.962,623.735,What about the... what actually went on?
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,652.413,666.004,"Well, there... to answer your questions, Your Honor, first, there was no indication at this conference that the jurors were, in fact, confused about whether they could consider any particular evidence as being mitigating."
2006.05-493,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,676.99,681.672,"Well, that may be why they had the conference, but they got into the colloquy that Justice Ginsburg described."
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,756.972,759.023,"Respectfully, no, Your Honor."
2006.05-493,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,760.665,767.048,"Well, I... I'm not necessarily saying that's my position, so you don't have to be respectful to me about it."
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,767.408,770.07,"--I'll be respectful anyhow, Your Honor."
2006.05-493,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,770.07,771.482,--knock it down if you can.
2006.05-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,771.482,773.112,Be respectful anyway.
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,773.112,773.933,Yes.
2006.05-493,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,801.992,804.383,"Well, except for the language of factor (k) itself."
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,814.081,827.321,"--No, Your Honor, it's not a stretch at all, because any evidence relating to the defendant's background and character, his present character in court, could be seen as extenuating the gravity of the crime for sentencing purposes."
2006.05-493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,827.321,827.328,Well--
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,827.328,827.849,And the jurors--
2006.05-493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,827.849,834.194,--California itself recognized that there was a problem here of jury confusion.
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,841.559,845.621,"--That's correct, Your Honor, in People v. Easley the California--"
2006.05-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,845.621,851.614,Or maybe they thought that was a problem of Ninth Circuit confusion rather than jury confusion.
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,858.139,872.468,"--Well, they... what they were doing was certainly a prophylactic measure here, to... they recognized that perhaps there might be some concern of confusion, and so they wanted to forestall any chance of that happening."
2006.05-493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,895.152,897.386,Where does this factor (k) come from?
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,899.336,912.915,"--The factor (k), as the entire standard instruction given in these cases, recites verbatim the language of the California statute, which is California penal code section 190.3."
2006.05-493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,949.068,955.202,"General Johnson, I don't mean to interrupt you, but I want to be sure you answered your... you stick to your answer on... to my question, earlier,--"
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,955.202,955.833,--Okay.
2006.05-493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.833,962.498,--because you... I think you changed your answer after Justice... the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia suggested you might have made a mistake.
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,975.235,989.126,"Yes, Your Honor, because the jurors would... even if that instruction were given, the jurors would understand that an instruction that extenuates the gravity of the crime would encompass any relevant character evidence."
2006.05-493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,992.747,992.977,Is--
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,992.977,993.368,That--
2006.05-493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,993.368,1007.346,"--that answer consistent with the position of defense counsel, who said he would not insult the intelligence of the jury by suggesting to them that the religious conversion of the defendant did not extenuate the gravity of the crime?"
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,1007.346,1008.497,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.05-493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1025.758,1026.339,That's right.
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,1026.339,1033.324,"--directs the jurors to consider any other circumstance that extenuates the gravity of the crime, even though it's not a legal excuse for the crime."
2006.05-493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1068.137,1073.67,"If that were true would that have extenuated the gravity of the crime, if he could get along in prison?"
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,1073.67,1080.735,"--Yes, for purposes of jurors... at jury's sentencing determination, absolutely, because it would be viewed as good-character evidence, precisely--"
2006.05-493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.735,1087.448,And you think juries would clearly understand that what he did in the future in prison would extenuate the gravity of the crime.
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,1087.448,1100.778,"--Yes, Your Honor, because, in light of everything that's been said and done in this trial, as the Boyde Court noted, jurors do not parse instructions for subtle shades of meaning; they understand instructions in a commonsense manner, and in--"
2006.05-493,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1100.778,1106.913,"The prosecutor didn't object to any of this mitigating... mitigation evidence that was submitted by the defendant, did he?"
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,1106.913,1109.894,--The prosecutor objected to none of this evidence.
2006.05-493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1122.32,1129.235,"Well, the prosecutor's closing was schizophrenic, because he said, ""But really this shouldn't matter""."
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,1129.235,1146.607,"--He acknowledged it was something that... this argument was something that was proper for consideration, but... however, he argued that the evidence of Belmontes' religious conversion, which happens... you know, and then lapsed immediately before he committed the murder, in this case... was very weak evidence."
2006.05-493,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1155.042,1157.426,"But, didn't he go beyond saying it was weak?"
2006.05-493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1160.976,1161.877,Yes.
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,1161.877,1168.712,"He's... yes, the prosecutor first stated that the factor (k) was a catchall, a true catchall."
2006.05-493,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1168.712,1174.486,"So, the prosecutor, I take it, would have answered Justice Stevens's question the other way."
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,1184.612,1196.499,"No, Your Honor, because in the... in the previous page, the prosecutor did State that it was a catchall, you know, which, by implication, incorporates everything, but... and the prosecutor's argument, that,"
2006.05-493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1305.563,1315.581,"Mr. Johnson, when I asked you about the derivation of factor (k), you gave me a California statutory cite, but is there... does it come from any model code?"
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,1320.924,1324.507,Of the... the actual wording of this instruction?
2006.05-493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1324.507,1332.15,How many States have an instruction that talks about extenuating the circumstances of the crime?
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,1332.15,1334.151,"I'm not sure, Your Honor."
2006.05-493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1354.195,1358.187,"Which... California hasn't had it since 1983, right?"
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,1358.187,1359.549,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
2006.05-493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1359.549,1364.351,California hasn't used this instruction since 1983.
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,1364.351,1365.373,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1370.495,1372.806,"So, is this a one-of-a-kind case?"
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,1386.066,1386.607,Yes.
2006.05-493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1414.113,1414.413,And--
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,1414.413,1414.814,--whereas--
2006.05-493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1414.814,1417.205,"--that wouldn't wash out, on the other grounds?"
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,1417.205,1424.811,"--Right, that... and... that are still pending, and that are... unlike Payton, are not governed by the AEDPA."
2006.05-493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1424.811,1428.672,But you're saying those convictions are more than... more than 23 years old?
2006.05-493,0,36082,mark_a_johnson,,1428.672,1429.513,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-493,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1444.243,1445.205,"Thank you, Counsel."
2006.05-493,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1447.005,1453.009,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-493,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1595.914,1600.875,When did the defense counsel say that this evidence did not fit within factor (k)?
2006.05-493,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1600.875,1604.528,"Your Honor, it occurred in argument."
2006.05-493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1636.411,1636.792,Why does that--
2006.05-493,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1636.792,1637.182,--any other factor.
2006.05-493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1637.182,1638.013,--Why does that matter?
2006.05-493,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1643.653,1645.576,I'm more than--
2006.05-493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1645.576,1648.928,"It probably didn't fit into factor (h), either, but it doesn't matter."
2006.05-493,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1648.928,1669.991,"--Well, it has... if it... oh, Your Honor, the... calling your... or you've called my attention to the instruction that said that the set... in the prior set of... or in the general set of instructions, that the enumerated factors were merely illustrative."
2006.05-493,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1733.473,1741.458,You said this case is different because both counsel told the jury that the evidence that you're relying on did not fit within factor (k).
2006.05-493,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1742.81,1743.46,Okay.
2006.05-493,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1743.46,1748.704,"Now, as to defense counsel, are you referring to what you quoted on page 9 of your brief, where he says,"
2006.05-493,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1757.5,1767.895,"That's one of the passages that I am referring to, and it came as a direct response to the District Attorney, in effect, calling out the defense attorney,"
2006.05-493,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1786.781,1787.112,Isn't he--

2006.05-493,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1787.873,1789.372,--saying something very different there?
2006.05-493,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1801.96,1811.327,"--Your Honor, this Court has used the terms ""extenuate"" and ""excuse"" as synonyms in Boyde and--"

2006.05-493,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2191.553,2198.505,--there was extensive testimony about his prospects for doing good in a prison setting.
2006.05-493,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,2198.505,2199.537,"Well, certainly, Your Honor."
2006.05-493,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2199.537,2207.093,And the jury must have thought there's some reason why the judge allowed that evidence in.
