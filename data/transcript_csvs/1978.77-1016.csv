1978.77-1016,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,60.359,Well hear arguments next in United California Bank against the United States.
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,65.263,69.891,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1978.77-1016,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,243.744,250.443,Mr. Gother in your primary brief you didn’t say it Foster Lumber?
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,250.443,251.142,"No, we do not."
1978.77-1016,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,251.142,257.303,You cited it in or rather collaterally in your reply brief.
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,261.457,266.605,I believe it has no significance for a couple of reasons.
1978.77-1016,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,278.371,279.158,That’s conceded --
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,279.158,285.715,"It was not dealing with the taxation of within an estate, which is I think a major factor here."
1978.77-1016,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,298.136,313.245,"But isn’t the -- we know a lot, isn’t the general principle the same however, here is the fairly -- here’s a statute that seems to say one thing and they conceded intent of Congress the other way."
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,320.461,323.182,I don’t believe so Your Honor at all.
1978.77-1016,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,334.312,343.255,"What we get down to then and your approach is, it is whether the estate is a conduit, nothing more?"
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,343.255,357.225,"In part there, in part and whether that conduit system is applicable to the 1201 (b) (2) alternative tax rate calculation, yes."
1978.77-1016,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,685.476,686.627,Can I interrupt you Mr. Gother.
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,690.731,691.215,No.
1978.77-1016,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,691.215,691.612,You don’t.
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,691.612,695.047,It’s just not in a fiduciary context.
1978.77-1016,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,695.047,704.326,Then you take the position that the word excess of a long-term gain over net short-term capitalized means thing for a fiduciary and another thing for an individual tax --
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,704.326,705.231,I believe that’s correct.
1978.77-1016,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,705.876,711.368,And how do you reconcile that with the fact that 1201 (b) refers to any taxpayer?
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,711.368,712.437,Any taxpayer?
1978.77-1016,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,712.437,712.548,Yes.
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,712.548,716.622,Well I think you’re talking about the taxable income of that taxpayer.
1978.77-1016,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,719.149,730.339,"1201 (b) starts out, if for any taxable year then that long-term capital gain of any taxpayer and it goes on and I would read it as prescribing the same procedure for individual taxpayers as for fiduciary."
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,734.695,749.985,"Well, my literal argument says that -- of any taxpayer is, it presupposes that you’re talking about the taxable income of that taxpayer not in the fiduciary context."
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,834.821,839.177,So they wouldn’t take that out of the fiduciaries?
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,839.177,839.513,They would.
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,839.513,841.399,Part of capital gain.
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,841.399,851.005,"And yet if you want to read that as literal as the Government seems to read it literally that shouldn’t happen, that the tax should be on 25% of the 100% of the gain."
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.005,858.46,Or at least you’re saying that it ought to be the same for both thoughts for both the charity and for the --
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,858.46,860.301,"That’s exactly my position, yes sir."
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,860.301,862.378,And the Government says that they can be different.
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,862.378,863.644,That’s correct.
1978.77-1016,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,863.644,874.712,"I take it to the Government not only does not object but it actually concedes that with respect to a taxable distributee, this is the correct method under the statute?"
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,874.712,890.789,"I haven’t seen that in their briefs but we have computed, we have given a exhibit in our reply brief of the instructions in computing your tax under 1041 and in the example of working it out in the form."
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,962.1,969.138,"But the Government position doesn’t reduce the amount distributable to the charity, does it?"
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,969.138,972.515,"Well, that’s correct that’s their position here is that no the charities are somehow different."
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,972.515,982.185,"It’s just that there’s not much and there’s just less money in the estate, I mean you pay out more tax."
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,982.185,983.94,You pay out more tax.
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,983.94,987.508,But it doesn’t reduce the amount distributable to the charity?
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,987.508,993.933,"That would depend upon how the tax is allocated under your will, how the tax burden is allocated."
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,995.442,999.298,"Well how about in this case, does the charity hurt?"
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,999.298,1006.933,"Yes, any tax payable out in the residue of this estate is going to reduce the amount going to charity under the terms of Mr. Disney’s will."
1978.77-1016,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1006.933,1008.987,The will was specific in that respect?
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1008.987,1014.832,"The will is specific and that the charity shared in the net residue, 45% of the net residue this would be a residue charge."
1978.77-1016,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1014.832,1017.015,Is the will in the record incidentally --
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1017.015,1019.251,Yes it is Your Honor.
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1277.022,1286.364,What does the -- in this case what is the basis for saying that current income is distributable to a charity?
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1286.364,1289.102,"Excuse me, I’m not sure I followed the question."
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1289.102,1296.443,"Well, the question is what’s the estates income tax for a year, is that right?"
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1302.578,1304.753,"Keep going again, I’m still --"
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1304.753,1306.071,Is this an income tax case?
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1306.071,1306.601,Yes it is.
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1306.601,1308.956,Is it a question about the income tax of an estate?
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1308.956,1309.779,Yes.
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1309.779,1310.656,For a year?
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1310.656,1312.02,For a year.
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1312.02,1313.639,That’s -- now we're together.
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1313.639,1316.861,Okay.
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1316.861,1325.33,What’s the basis in this case for saying that the income that was earned in the years in question was distributable to a charity?
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1325.33,1328.588,The terms in the will provide that 45% of our --
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1328.588,1330.496,Of all current income?
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1330.496,1332.218,That would include current income.
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1334.902,1348.268,"That’s what I meant, the will say currently distribute this year’s income to a charity or was it just a question of saying whenever you call the estate give the -- 45% of the residue to the charity."
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1348.268,1349.621,It’s the latter.
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1349.621,1365.969,"So if I die and I have a business in my -- I tell my executor operate my business until you can sell it, then sell it, sell all my stocks and bonds and then take the cash that’s all left and give it to a charity."
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1374.26,1375.779,"No it does not Your Honor, never."
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.073,1393.359,"And even though the charity gets only the residue you can’t take out of the residue, any income earned before you distribute?"
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1393.359,1394.442,That’s correct.
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.442,1395.371,Is that law?
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1395.371,1396.744,"That’s the law, the law would say that all of the in --"
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1396.744,1398.258,Is there any argument about that law?
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1398.258,1412.712,"No, all of the income earned during the course of the estate proceeding, in an estate where the will provides that ultimately, all of the assets are to pass to charity, all of the income, even if that estate were open ten years would be free of tax."
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1412.712,1413.718,Now there’s now question about that?
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1413.718,1414.472,No question about that.
1978.77-1016,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1414.472,1422.465,"What you’re saying when you say that is that the tax exempt entity is the de facto owner from that instant of death, are you not?"
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1422.465,1434.567,"We are, we’ve even cited the probate code section in California which embodies that concept that in an estate proceeding, the assets of an estate really title vest in the beneficiary subject only."
1978.77-1016,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1434.567,1446.194,And you are saying that Congress has indicated that in these statutes that that exemption should attached from the outset and it continue wherever it goes?
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1446.194,1446.785,Exactly.
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1447.762,1456.06,"So in this case you were saying that the Government’s position in effect reduces the amount distributable to the charity contrary to will of Congress, has it?"
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1456.06,1458.525,"It has to, yes Your Honor."
1978.77-1016,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.358,1466.426,If you help me in one problem I have with the whole case.
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1485.797,1486.456,That’s right.
1978.77-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1486.456,1490.849,And do you make the same contention with respect to the word excess in 1202?
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1490.849,1491.821,Identical.
1978.77-1016,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.821,1494.187,"You contend its $275,000.00 in either case."
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1494.187,1494.849,That’s correct.
1978.77-1016,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1494.849,1502.757,"But you did not so compute it when you stipulated what the ordinary tax would be, that’s one thing that puzzled me."
1978.77-1016,0,39312,ronald_e_gother,,1516.131,1519.143,Not when we get to the computation of the alternative tax?
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,1659.695,1663.363,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1683.824,1710.911,"What would you say Mr. Ferguson about Justice White’s hypothetical case, if the entire state you were given to the University of California or some totally recognizable tax entity that was exempt, income on these earnings during the period of probate proceedings?"
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,1710.911,1723.563,"Sir I would have to say that first of all, the estate is nonetheless a tax payer, a private tax payer under the provisions of the code as it would be in any other case."
1978.77-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1723.563,1731.645,"You mean until distribution, the entity takes on the cloak of the decedent and not the cloak of the legatee?"
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,1731.645,1735.344,I think that is one way of looking at it.
1978.77-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1735.344,1737.247,Isn’t it just that simple in the long run?
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,1737.247,1738.306,I think it is that simple.
1978.77-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1738.306,1741.783,"Does it pay -- does it pay taxes or doesn't it, on its current income?"
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,1741.783,1755.62,It depends upon whether or not the provisions with respect to the ultimate distribution to a charity qualify as a charitable deduction for the state.
1978.77-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1755.62,1756.176,Let’s assume it does.
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,1756.176,1761.325,If it does then the charitable deduction would eliminate any taxable income assuming --
1978.77-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1761.325,1763.139,"While the state, while the estate is open?"
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,1763.139,1764.612,That is correct.
1978.77-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1764.612,1768.785,So that essentially you agree with your brother’s answer?
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,1768.785,1769.707,I agree.
1978.77-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1769.707,1773.167,With the qualification that it's a qualified charitable deduction?
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,1773.167,1784.027,I agree that as long as it’s a charitable deduction which qualifies and the amount of that deduction equals the gross income there would be no net tax due from the estate.
1978.77-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1784.027,1792.666,"In other words, it has the same status under that theory as though the decedent had made an inter vivos gift on the last day of his life?"
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,1792.666,1794.063,Exactly.
1978.77-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1809.645,1827.483,"But you seem to agree that that was the basic intent of Congress to put the ultimate legate to the legatee, the ultimate distributee in the shoes of the -- just who made the gift inter vivos?"
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,1827.483,1843.716,"No Your Honor I don’t, I think that the ultimate intent of Congress was to treat the estate as a tax payer separate and apart from the decedent on the one hand and separate and apart from the distributees and beneficiaries on the other hand."
1978.77-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1843.716,1848.908,If I hear you correctly you’ve answered the same question in two different ways now Mr. Ferguson?
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,1848.908,1858.799,"Your Honor your example posited a particular kind of estate, one in which the entire residue was to go to charity."
1978.77-1016,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1932.717,1941.819,"Mr. Ferguson in the government’s view, who held title to this share of the residue?"
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,1941.819,1960.048,"We do not dispute that under the provisions of California law, title to all parts of the residue personality and realty was vested as of the moment of death in the ultimate takers, charitable and non-charitable."
1978.77-1016,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1960.048,1963.184,So you do concede that legal result?
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,1963.184,1966.359,"Oh! Indeed we think however, that is irrelevant."
1978.77-1016,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2113.08,2143.183,"This maybe elementary Mr. Ferguson, but I take it the Government’s submission is and perhaps as conceded by both parties that for income taxation an estate is treated as an entity in a way that it is not in a way, in most states for purposes of decedents' estates where you have the executor as an individual and the distributee as an individual, but the estate is simply an accumulation of assets for income taxation an estate is an entity?"
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2143.183,2145.161,Yes sir that is correct.
1978.77-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2327.77,2331.296,Because there is no really no argument about any of these?
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2331.296,2331.592,I had not thought so.
1978.77-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2331.592,2333.133,I have not thought so either.
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2333.133,2364.757,We come now to the question of whether the estate in computing its -- its tax on its net taxable income can achieve a lower rate by using the so-called alternative tax under 1201 (b) by combining this deduction for charitable contributions with the 1201 (b) alternative lower tax rate by off setting it against capital gains.
1978.77-1016,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2407.587,2410.989,But the Ninth didn't follow this in the circuit.
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2410.989,2411.332,I beg your pardon.
1978.77-1016,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2411.332,2415.323,Isn’t it true that the Ninth didn’t follow Judge Friendly’s opinion in the circuits?
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2415.323,2416.899,That’s quite true Your Honor.
1978.77-1016,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2454.516,2459.787,Mr. Ferguson is that quite fair to treat the Weil case because that wasn’t’ an estate case obviously?
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2459.787,2463.827,The Weil case was a charitable deduction case involving an individual.
1978.77-1016,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2463.827,2466.404,An individual so it really didn’t’ present this problem?
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2466.404,2466.787,I think that's correct.
1978.77-1016,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2466.787,2479.901,"And if you’re right that in the alternative tax computation 1201 (b), you do not reduce capital gains by deductions which maybe taken against ordinary income."
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2491.348,2497.3,That Your Honor is a place where we do depart from the literal language of the statute.
1978.77-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2612.947,2613.7,That’s a requirement?
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2613.7,2627.52,"Right, that’s a requirement, but since each will make their own individual computation, the applicability of 1202 or 1201 (b) to each beneficiary will be separately determined."
1978.77-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2633.267,2651.768,"What -- if in this case the income had been currently distributable in these years to a charity, would you agree then that the charity should be treated like the taxable distributees?"
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2651.768,2656.061,"Your Honor, there are two cases below which involved just --"
1978.77-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2656.061,2657.813,I would have thought you would have said yes from your description?
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2657.813,2659.274,No.
1978.77-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2695.977,2719.036,"And it’s that difference Mr. Ferguson that makes you say that the administrative practice with respect to non-charitable distributees described in your petitioner’s reply brief is not inconsistent -- under which you basically do follow the conduit concept, is not inconsistent with the arguments you’re making in this case?"
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2719.036,2719.902,That’s right Your Honor because --
1978.77-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2719.902,2721.3,And it’s that difference?
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2721.3,2722.006,That is the difference.
1978.77-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2722.006,2725.665,That a charity cannot be a beneficiary or is not a statutory beneficiary?
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2725.665,2727.789,Right and distributees are.
1978.77-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2727.789,2728.711,And distributees are.
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2728.711,2737.239,So that a charity -- that the allowance for a charity is the charitable deduction which is a true deduction from taxable income.
1978.77-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2774.402,2775.641,Real deductions?
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2775.641,2776.758,Real deductions.
1978.77-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2784.995,2786.373,But it’s called the deduction?
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2786.373,2805.93,Indeed it is and as you know the United States had a great deal of difficulty in accepting that line of cases but the cases themselves distinguished the 691 (c) deduction from the deduction which we are here considering and I think properly so.
1978.77-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2865.838,2882.742,"Mr. Ferguson earlier I said you seemed to answer the same question two different ways and I realized that in this exchanges here a word here or there can make the difference and let me try again, even if there is an over simplification."
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2907.224,2924.994,"Assuming, Your Honor if I may add one more fact I can agree with you, assuming that the gross income of the estate could be off set by a deduction under 642 (c) which met the various requirements of that deduction section I would agree."
1978.77-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2924.994,2945.407,"In other words, the tax exempt ultimate to distributees takes hold at the instant of death, rather than having the executors stand in the shoes of the decedent?"
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,2945.407,2949.027,"Well, Your Honor again I have to disagree."
1978.77-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3032.951,3043.932,"But if it does in the Chief Justice’s question even though the entire income is capital gains income, you wouldn’t need the alternative tax, you would just make the deduction which --"
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,3043.932,3047.037,"Clearly in that case, the lower tax would be the regular tax and there would be a zero rate."
1978.77-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3047.037,3055.052,"Regular tax without the alternative tax, without any you’re required to figure the alternative tax I guess but you’d figured and discard it."
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,3055.052,3056.239,Clearly.
1978.77-1016,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3056.239,3059.741,I am surprised that had nothing to do with the estate law at all?
1978.77-1016,1,35785,m_carr_ferguson,,3059.741,3081.622,"No Your Honor we don’t feel it does, we think that that has been decided long ago that the placement of title is irrelevant to custody and management of the assets which is the activity generating tax liability and the reason that Congress has seen fit to treat the estate as a tax payer."
1978.77-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3251.825,3254.887,Very well Mr. Ferguson.
1978.77-1016,2,39312,ronald_e_gother,,3257.668,3260.198,"Thank you Your Honor, just one quick point."
1978.77-1016,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3286.219,3288.427,"Well, some deductions are unlimited?"
1978.77-1016,2,39312,ronald_e_gother,,3288.427,3289.752,Some deductions are unlimited --
1978.77-1016,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3289.752,3290.161,And there are limitations for another.
1978.77-1016,2,39312,ronald_e_gother,,3290.161,3292.381,-- but only if you pay them out.
1978.77-1016,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3292.381,3293.892,Yes but your second point is --
1978.77-1016,2,39312,ronald_e_gother,,3293.892,3296.192,"My second point is that you don’t even have to pay it out, but it’s on."
1978.77-1016,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3296.192,3298.58,And that’s contrary to the ordinary concept of a deduction?
1978.77-1016,2,39312,ronald_e_gother,,3298.58,3311.86,"Also, the deduction that you get for distributing amounts to a taxable beneficiary under 661 to a taxable beneficiary is worded as a deduction."
1978.77-1016,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3321.979,3337.441,What do you have to say just before you sit down Mr. Gother about then Mr. Ferguson’s explanation of the administrative practice pointed out in your reply brief that you assert is inconsistent with his -- the position of the Government takes in this case.
1978.77-1016,2,39312,ronald_e_gother,,3338.377,3339.613,No.
1978.77-1016,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3339.613,3386.284,"The government's treatment of non-charitable devices, legatees, distributees is said to be in your -- administratively as said to be in your reply brief inconsistent with the argument that the Government is making in this case in that, that administrative treatment of non-charitable distributees seems to rely upon or recognize the conduit theory and now you heard Mr. Ferguson’s explanation of the difference, i.e. that charities are not beneficiaries within the meaning of the statute and that that explains the difference in practice which he concedes does not follow the literal terms of the statute with the respect to non-charitable distributees but what --"
1978.77-1016,2,39312,ronald_e_gother,,3386.284,3395.377,"The answer to that is that the charitable entity doesn’t need this deduction, this distribution."
1978.77-1016,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3422.54,3430.238,"Is that to avoid double taxation of the taxable distriburtee in part, that deduction allowance?"
1978.77-1016,2,39312,ronald_e_gother,,3430.238,3432.998,No I don’t think it relates to the double tax issue.
1978.77-1016,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3432.998,3438.464,Well if it's tax in your estate as income and then taxed again to the distributee as income?
1978.77-1016,2,39312,ronald_e_gother,,3438.464,3452.234,"Oh yes that‘s right, you need the distribution out to cause -- to eliminate the double tax on that and in the case of the charity, you don’t have that, you’re not eliminating a double tax."
1978.77-1016,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3452.366,3453.104,Thank you gentlemen.
