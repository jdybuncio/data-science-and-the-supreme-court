1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.758,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-8986, Arnold Hohn v. the United States."
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,16.091,21.605,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-8986,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,61.523,76.642,"Well, I think in light of House v. Mayo, I think it's very hard to argue that there is statutory certiorari jurisdiction unless we want to overrule that case."
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,76.642,86.397,--I submit that Nixon v. Fitzgerald has already called into very serious question the underpinnings of the statutory certiorari decision in House.
1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,97.444,101.477,Did the Nixon case discuss the jurisdictional point at length?
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,101.477,102.669,"It did not, but it--"
1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,102.669,114.997,"Well then, our rule is that jurisdiction that has been assumed without any elaborate discussion is not really to be regarded as contradicting a prior case that did discuss jurisdiction."
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,115.946,123.803,"--Mr. Chief Justice, we do not claim that Nixon v. Fitzgerald has even sub silentio overruled House v. Mayo."
1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,129.145,138.861,"But our precedents say that if jurisdiction is assumed sub silentio, without a discussion of the jurisdiction, that simply doesn't count."
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,138.861,140.534,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-8986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.605,175.686,Might have made a mistake.
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,175.686,176.507,--We should be--
1997.96-8986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,176.507,190.896,"Especially in a case entitled United States v. Nixon, or Nixon v. Fitzgerald, and that's why we have that rule, that where we haven't thought and spoken about jurisdiction you shouldn't draw any conclusions from our entertaining of the case."
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,190.896,191.176,--The--
1997.96-8986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.176,191.727,I thought that's the rule.
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,191.727,197.43,--The Court thought very carefully about its jurisdiction in both Nixon v. Fitzgerald and the United States v. Nixon.
1997.96-8986,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,199.501,202.714,"In fact, there's much more discussion of jurisdiction in those opinions than in House v. Mayo."
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,202.714,203.145,--That's--
1997.96-8986,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,203.145,206.317,"House v. Mayo, they didn't even get a response from the State, as I remember it."
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,206.317,209.837,"--Indeed, that's so, and the petition for certiorari was written by House's mother."
1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.529,262.503,"Well, what about a motion before the court of appeals to expedite a particular case for hearing before the court of appeals?"
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,262.503,265.615,In our view that also would fall within the plain language.
1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,296.247,303.189,"But don't you run in there, Ms. Penner, to our cases that say that piecemeal appeals are frowned upon?"
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,321.953,324.555,"I think there are two answers, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,335.131,335.401,Well--
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,335.401,343.775,"--review of an appeal unless a certain thing happened in that gate keeping decision, which is a decision to allow the appeal to proceed, but the second--"
1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,343.775,356.875,--Do you really think that Congress in... having thought about this thing intended that we have jurisdiction to review a decision of the court of appeals not to grant a certificate of probable cause or a certificate of appealability?
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,356.875,371.815,"--In my view, the plain language of section 2253, particularly when compared with the plain language of 2244(b)(3)(E), leaves no doubt that Congress expressly intended this Court to retain the certiorari power it has been exercising for the past half century."
1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,465.886,468.788,"That has to... those have to be an aid of jurisdiction, do they not?"
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,468.788,469.809,"They do, Your Honor."
1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,469.809,475.984,And by hypothesis here we would not have jurisdiction under the statutory certiorari?
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,475.984,478.255,"By hypothesis here, yes."
1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,478.255,484.81,So wouldn't it be rather hard to say that that was an aid of our jurisdiction if it was... if our jurisdiction depended on issuing that writ?
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,484.81,494.314,It is an aid of the appellate jurisdiction that this Court could exercise over the appeal that the court of appeals has pretermitted by denying the certificate of appealability.
1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,549.671,550.62,"Well, but maybe that's what Congress wanted."
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,550.62,558.027,"When the Court was interpreting the All Writs Act in... I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice, are you speaking of section 2253?"
1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,558.027,562.979,"Well, I'm speaking about... of that and whatever else is applicable."
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,570.974,579.822,"In my view, it's a question of comparing the statutory intent in 1254, 1651, and 2253."
1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,632.355,641.091,"But the issuance of a certificate of appealability by a justice of this Court could accomplish much the same purpose as you say that accomplishes, couldn't it?"
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,641.091,648.155,"--In many cases, it will accomplish the same purpose for the question of individual justice for a single petitioner."
1997.96-8986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,673.502,674.882,"Well, you just lost me."
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,679.627,680.736,--Here--
1997.96-8986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.736,684.99,"You're saying it means in aid of somehow the court's role in the society, or--"
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,684.99,687.361,--I believe that its purpose is to permit both.
1997.96-8986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,695.545,696.397,--That's--
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,696.397,699.078,"In addition, it is appropriate and--"
1997.96-8986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,699.078,701.309,--But that one could be handled by... by--
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,701.309,703.062,--By a... that's correct.
1997.96-8986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,703.062,706.815,"--By the application to a justice, who could refer it to the whole Court."
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,706.815,719.081,"That's correct, Your Honor, but the application is an ineffectual and cumbersome tool for the Court to accomplish its appellate functions of ensuring uniformity among the circuit courts."
1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,719.081,721.963,"But its appellate functions are defined by Congress, are they not?"
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,733.142,748.199,"Had Congress indicated an intention to prevent this Court from exercising its common law certiorari power, a slightly different question might be presented, but here there simply is no indication of that in section 2253."
1997.96-8986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,765.163,774.787,"Ms. Penner, why wouldn't referral by the circuit justice to the full Court suffice to protect the appellate jurisdiction in the sky aspect of the whole thing?"
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,776.98,794.301,"I guess one question is, if I... if Congress intended to eliminate the Court's certiorari power it seems unclear why it would have intended the Court to perform what is essentially the same function as that which it performs on certiorari through use of the application process."
1997.96-8986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,813.665,823.743,"Well, maybe not, but it seems to me that the burden is on you if you want to have an... you know, an original writ issued to show that it is necessary and that there's no other way to get this thing done."
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,823.743,830.695,--The All Writs Act speaks of the... a power being... existing when it is either necessary or appropriate.
1997.96-8986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,897.701,912.57,"So you think if we agree with you that you can get a... you know, a certiorari writ when you do get an application to a single justice, and I probably get more of them than anybody else, I don't have to worry about all of these cosmic questions?"
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,912.57,913.469,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1997.96-8986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.469,932.313,"Well, you say that one of the disadvantages of not agreeing with you on the certiorari point is that each justice to whom an application is submitted would have to worry about such questions as establishing what the law ought to be in circuit conflicts and all of that."
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,948.421,962.202,Surely the burden on a single justice to consider those issues of whether a question of national importance is raised or whether there is a circuit conflict will be significantly less if the Court clearly establishes that the petition for certiorari remains an available route.
1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1006.862,1012.005,"Well, what do you see as the test of a certificate of appealability, Ms. Penner?"
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,1036.641,1044.945,I understand Your Honor to be... are you questioning about the standard that the courts of appeals should be applying?
1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1044.945,1051.979,"Yes, and I mean, would a justice of this Court apply the same standard that a judge of the court of appeals applies?"
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,1051.979,1061.376,"The Government has argued that a higher standard should apply, that this Court should only issue certificates in the most extraordinary circumstances."
1997.96-8986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.134,1215.387,"Well, excuse me, could... but how does that work?"
1997.96-8986,0,22952,eileen_penner,,1222.153,1230.267,"It's true that the Court could combine those two issues, but only if it affirms that is retains the certiorari power."
1997.96-8986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1249.628,1250.69,"Very well, Ms. Penner."
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1253.462,1261.739,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-8986,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1283.974,1296.231,"What if Congress had said that, you know, this Court is going to review cases by certiorari and define the terms and the time limits and so forth?"
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1306.87,1308.019,No.
1997.96-8986,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1340.76,1353.199,"But couldn't one infer from... perhaps not even infer, but the... part of the holding of House v. Mayo is that we don't have statutory certiorari jurisdiction here."
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1355.471,1370.931,"--It is the Government's position that House was correct and the Court doesn't have statutory certiorari, but the codification of statutory certiorari did not repeal this Court's ability under the All Writs Act to exercise common law certiorari."
1997.96-8986,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1370.931,1373.101,In aid of its jurisdiction.
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1373.101,1374.872,"In aid of its jurisdiction, and--"
1997.96-8986,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1374.872,1383.437,"If we don't have statutory certiorari jurisdiction, why should we be able to use another writ to simply substitute for that to give us jurisdiction?"
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1383.437,1387.912,"--Well, it's not to substitute for that to give the Court jurisdiction."
1997.96-8986,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1397.008,1404.182,Why isn't the case in the court of appeals for the purpose of deciding whether a certificate of appealability will be ordered?
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1404.182,1407.276,"Well, House v. Mayo held that the case was not in the court of appeals."
1997.96-8986,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1407.276,1411.969,"Then there's a lot of practice after that that seems to go the other way, so if... is that the only basis?"
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1448.653,1457.676,"Well, it's certainly a close question, Justice Breyer, as to whether an application for a certificate is a case in the court of appeals."
1997.96-8986,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1457.676,1464.932,"I mean, the Solicitor General... my point is, the Solicitor General I would think believes that we're right in taking those cases that I've mentioned."
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1464.932,1466.081,Yes.
1997.96-8986,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1466.372,1466.802,All right.
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1480.721,1490.01,"--It's a distinction, and the distinction is that here Congress has set up a two stage process with a screening mechanism to decide whether petitioner's case is in the court of appeals."
1997.96-8986,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1506.559,1522.909,"Well, in your view, do we have common law certiorari jurisdiction to review the denial of a court of appeal... a certificate of appealability and also jurisdiction to review the merits of the appeal?"
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1522.909,1531.385,"House holds that the Court has jurisdiction to review the denial of the certificate and, if it determines that the certificate was improperly denied, to review the merits."
1997.96-8986,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1531.385,1532.887,And that's your position here?
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1532.887,1534.145,And that is our position here.
1997.96-8986,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1559.855,1567.96,"Of course, all we have to do, I suppose, if we accept your view of House, is review the certificate of appealability determination and stop there."
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1570.191,1571.252,No.
1997.96-8986,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1637.253,1644.9,"Now, in this Court the petitioner applied to this Court for a certificate of appealability, or at least to a justice, did it not?"
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1644.9,1645.38,Yes.
1997.96-8986,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1645.38,1657.169,And I think that the Government opposed that on the grounds that the petitioner didn't demonstrate exceptional circumstances.
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1657.169,1657.769,Yes.
1997.96-8986,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1667.964,1674.589,And yet to exercise common law certiorari jurisdiction we have to determine there are exceptional circumstances.
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1676.57,1684.794,The exceptional circumstances are not met in the case of a certificate because the petitioner hasn't demonstrated an entitlement to a certificate.
1997.96-8986,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1736.139,1742.042,"Mr. Roberts, may I ask you about an earlier piece of this somewhat confusing puzzle?"
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1750.698,1757.383,It is an oddity of the way the applications for a certificate work.
1997.96-8986,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1777.506,1785.032,"So it's the circuit's practice, but the circuit's practice could be otherwise compatibly with the statute?"
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1785.032,1785.423,Yes.
1997.96-8986,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1801.241,1803.332,Thank you.
1997.96-8986,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1825.057,1837.125,"It's that Congress has set up a separate process to determine whether the case can go forward, and has explicitly mandated that unless the petitioner survives that hurdle, the case can't go forward."
1997.96-8986,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1847.802,1849.244,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1851.127,1858.501,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1997.96-8986,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1964.701,1971.084,"If you focus right on that decision, there is a decision that Congress is asking a circuit judge to make."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1974.797,1975.278,Yes.
1997.96-8986,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1975.278,1976.197,That's the decision.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1991.367,1993.981,"Well, of course, it is being made by a circuit judge, but I would submit--"
1997.96-8986,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1993.981,1994.399,And where?
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1995.42,1998.232,--The circuit judge is obviously in his chambers.
1997.96-8986,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1998.232,1998.602,"Yes, all right."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2010.22,2015.223,"But Your Honor, actually... but actually, Your Honor, your question gets to a fundamental point."
1997.96-8986,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2019.757,2020.048,--I'm not--
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2020.048,2021.618,--consistent interpretation--
1997.96-8986,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2021.618,2033.478,"--I'm trying to get... what I'm focusing on is that particular decision, and I'm trying to think if there's some reason to say, no, no, that decision isn't being made in the court of appeals."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2044.535,2051.949,--I think for the same reason that this court would not review a 1292(b) decision by the court of appeals.
1997.96-8986,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2072.502,2087.69,"I thought that wasn't because of where it was located, whether in the court of appeals, except 22... in 1292(b) Congress has made it highly discretionary at two levels, and you've got to have them both."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2100.01,2104.174,"--Well, maybe I'm... I may be misunderstanding the question, Your Honor, but it really seems quite similar."
1997.96-8986,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2118.624,2122.615,"1292(b) is a question of when, not whether."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2146.683,2150.897,"--Well, Your Honor, since I'm not getting very far on that analogy, let me try to make another point."
1997.96-8986,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2180.807,2188.461,One of the issues that's arisen is whether that presents any different situation from what the Court had in House.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2194.004,2197.206,This is the question as to what the state of the law was in 1945?
1997.96-8986,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2197.206,2197.476,Yes.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2197.476,2198.478,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-8986,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2272.877,2275.177,But you will concede that House was a rather skimpy opinion.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2281.222,2284.742,"--Well, they all get respect from me anyway, Your Honor, and I--"
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2295.872,2296.521,"Well, there has been one thing."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2296.521,2297.001,--Excuse me.
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2297.001,2299.463,"There has been one thing, and maybe you would comment on it."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2309.83,2310.351,Yes.
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.351,2316.574,"Which if I understand your position correctly, that... Congress could have omitted that entirely and the law would have been exactly the same."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2316.574,2321.146,"Absolutely not, Your Honor, and I'm glad I have a chance to deal with that issue."
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2353.401,2356.633,"Why didn't they do it as to the first habeas as well as the second, then--"
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2356.633,2357.024,--They didn't--
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.024,2358.103,--and make it perfectly clear.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2358.103,2376.594,"--They didn't need to, because under statutory certiorari every single decision of this Court, every single decision of the Court that was on the books indicated that there was no statutory certiorari jurisdiction, so they didn't need a clear statement there and, precisely because, as I indicated in responding to Justice Souter's question, the law had changed since 19--"
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2376.594,2384.459,Your view is they needed a clear statement for a second successive but they didn't need one for a first habeas because that law was already very clear with respect to first?
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2384.459,2388.913,"--Sufficiently clear to not need a clear statement, yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2388.913,2390.435,I find that rather puzzling.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2390.435,2395.839,"But, Your Honor, let's... well, I think the law was settled as to statutory certiorari."
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2430.03,2443.519,"Probably you can't, because I... you still seem to think that it was absolutely necessary to spell out that there shall be no review of the denial of a second, but there's no need to do it for the denial of a first because the law was... I just find that mind boggling."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2443.519,2445.391,"Well, maybe I'm not making clear why--"
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2445.391,2446.74,Maybe I'm just stupid.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2446.74,2448.774,"--No, I'm sure that it's an opposite problem."
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2461.021,2461.85,"Well, if that's true why can't--"
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2461.85,2462.191,--under settled law--
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2462.191,2464.762,"--If that's true, why can't we review this case?"
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2469.547,2471.617,"--No, Your Honor, because the statutes changed."
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2481.355,2485.516,"Well then, if that's true you don't need a special provision for the second habeas, either."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2485.516,2488.527,--I'm not sure I follow that.
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2488.527,2502.296,"I don't understand, under that argument, why it was necessary for Congress to enact a grant or a denial of an authorization by the court of appeals to file a second or a successive application shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2502.296,2503.788,Because House was still on the books.
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2516.037,2525.544,"Well, are you saying... let me just be sure I... you're saying that if they had not enacted (E), they could have... we could have accepted review in second habeas but not in first?"
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2525.544,2526.233,"--Yes, absolutely."
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2527.264,2528.296,That is remarkable.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2528.296,2529.835,"But, Your Honor, that's House."
1997.96-8986,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2532.486,2536.41,"In House, I take it that the Court issued All Writs review, is that right?"
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2536.41,2536.84,Yes.
1997.96-8986,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2536.84,2548.037,"All right, and so then the question was, well, why can't we do that in this decision about certificate of appealability, and I take it your answer to that was, well, the reason they issued All Writs review before is because there was no other way to get it."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2548.037,2548.668,Yes.
1997.96-8986,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2548.668,2552.839,"But here, there was a way to get it now."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2554.571,2555.162,Absolutely.
1997.96-8986,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2555.162,2555.842,--All right.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2568.52,2570.183,I think I've kept track of that.
1997.96-8986,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.771,2572.964,That's the letter you filed.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2572.964,2573.933,--That is the letter I filed.
1997.96-8986,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2573.933,2577.716,"And the letter... the answer to that... I mean, you see, they've made it very parallel."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2581.379,2586.111,"Their argument... I want to make sure I've made their argument clear, because I don't think I did the first time through."
1997.96-8986,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2589.514,2589.714,Right.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2589.714,2591.685,--in 1945 included a justice of this Court.
1997.96-8986,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2591.685,2591.885,Right.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2591.885,2602.654,"So that's their argument, and to make that argument they've looked to a definition they found in title 28 that says, judge of the court of appeals can include circuit justice, so at that point, that's a pretty good argument."
1997.96-8986,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2605.436,2606.247,I thought it was very good when I read it.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2607.927,2619.303,--The response to it is that that definition comes from the 1911 act the Congress enacted that dealt with the judicial code.
1997.96-8986,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2678.923,2709.311,"Is there any reason, by the way, since you brought common sense into it, which I think is very helpful, is there any reason why Congress, assuming that the statute language allows it, would have singled out, out of all the things this Court can review, which is virtually all kinds of things, is there any reason that anybody would have wanted to pick out this set of cases, which would have let so... an egregious, really controversial refusal to grant a certificate of appealability that's the kind of thing we might review?"
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2720.34,2727.103,"In other words, are you saying that they would have wanted to preserve the jurisdiction for the rare case, or why would they eliminate--"
1997.96-8986,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2727.103,2727.313,Yes.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2732.068,2732.459,--Right.
1997.96-8986,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2732.459,2741.892,"And assuming the language allows it, the All Writs Act, or whatever, is there any reason, really, Congress would have wanted to take this set of cases and say no, those are the ones you can't review--"
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2741.892,2742.373,Right.
1997.96-8986,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2742.373,2751.76,"--even for what we would likely review, a rare instance where it was an absolutely wrong grant, refusal to grant the certificate, or there's a big legal issue involved, something like--"
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2751.76,2758.225,"Well, as the Powell commission report indicated, direct review was not working and has not been working."
1997.96-8986,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2783.109,2787.693,--The Congress wanted cases deemed frivolous by lower court judges to cease.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2787.693,2789.794,"Absolutely, and to be terminated."
1997.96-8986,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2825.968,2830.252,"Well, what if you just have All Writs Act common law jurisdiction?"
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2830.252,2831.923,"--Well, we... I don't--"
1997.96-8986,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2831.923,2833.843,This Court has rarely exercised it.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2836.444,2851.775,"--Well, Your Honor, if... once the Court says there's power, that message will get to the inmates, and the inmates will say, if there's power, there's always a reason to file, and filings experience has shown are not always based on whether there's merit, so I think one of the fundamental goals of the act would be undermined."
1997.96-8986,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2866.004,2866.495,Yes.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2869.827,2878.632,"No, I do, and I guess the point I'm making, and perhaps not very well, is that if you allow All Writs Act jurisdiction on top of that, you're left with two track review."
1997.96-8986,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2879.453,2881.344,"Well, but maybe we have another problem."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2949.809,2952.601,"--When you say leave House on the books, you're including the All Writs Act interpretation--"
1997.96-8986,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2952.601,2971.034,"That's right, and apply it here whether your distinction holds up or not, because that's the... that's in effect the only alternative that would honor what I suppose was a congressional expectation without taking a total reexamination of House itself."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2971.034,2973.706,"--Well, Your Honor, a couple of things."
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2999.772,3004.467,"Let me suggest a way in which the circuit justice might... you know, it takes four votes to grant certiorari."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3022.218,3022.729,--No.
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3036.256,3038.207,"I've acted on my own on many, many occasions where I've denied relief."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3038.207,3052.338,"--Perhaps I'm wrong in this understanding, but I had always thought circuit justices act as surrogates for the whole Court, so that they did not take... keep in mind just their own views of a particular matter but are sensitive to what other justices may... how they may view the matter."
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3052.338,3057.972,"Oh, but I've voted to grant certiorari when I thought... or I... put it the other way."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3070.958,3075.673,"Well, again, I'm... I don't want to suggest what the Court's practices should be, but--"
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3075.673,3081.076,"But your argument is that there is no loophole, that everything will be subject to review by the Court, and I just don't think it would be."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3081.076,3089.442,"--Well, I think the view that there's no loophole is the trust in the Court both as an institution and as its body of nine individual justices."
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3089.442,3091.483,"You assume no one justice will make a mistake, is what you're saying."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3091.483,3092.834,Not after a district--
1997.96-8986,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3092.834,3093.245,And I've made a lot of them.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3093.245,3100.928,"--Not after a district... keep in mind, the Court only gets involved after a district court judge in most circuits has denied it and after a court of appeals has denied it."
1997.96-8986,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3119.14,3123.733,At the court of appeals level does the court of appeals judge act as a surrogate for the court of appeals?
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3123.733,3129.807,"As this Court indicated in Burrell in 1956, that is up to the court of appeals."
1997.96-8986,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3133.861,3141.444,"Well, what would you think under the statute if they're... if a single circuit judge acts, is he acting as a surrogate for the court of appeals?"
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3141.444,3145.437,--It depends on that court of appeals' rules and practices.
1997.96-8986,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3151.452,3157.956,Would the practice be any different in the courts of appeals than under the old certificate of probable cause?
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3157.956,3159.196,"--No, Your Honor."
1997.96-8986,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3184.874,3209.979,"Well, they... I wouldn't impute to Congress any knowledge that we had somehow formally reexamined House, but I guess I do think we should impute to Congress the knowledge that we are, in fact, reviewing these decisions, that we are, in fact, acting as if we had statutory cert jurisdiction in certain of these cases and my imputation of knowledge doesn't go beyond that."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3209.979,3210.33,--Well--
1997.96-8986,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3210.33,3231.364,"But if it goes that far, then it's difficult, it seems to me, to argue, as I think you were suggesting, that there is a kind of overwhelming restrictive premise in AEDPA which goes so far as to assume, or as to include a congressional assumption that we could not review in these circumstances."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3231.364,3238.409,"--Well, I think there clearly is when it comes to statutory certiorari, because there's not a single case that discusses that issue and says there is--"
1997.96-8986,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3238.409,3241.82,But there are single cases in which we apparently were doing it.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3241.82,3242.341,--But--
1997.96-8986,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3242.341,3243.552,We didn't say so.
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3243.552,3244.103,"--But, Your Honor--"
1997.96-8986,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3244.103,3245.543,"We didn't discuss it, but we did it, didn't we?"
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3245.543,3256.941,"--I don't mean to quibble, but as between decisions that discuss the issue and decisions that silently ignore it, I think the better rule is to assume Congress knows about the decisions that discuss the issue."
1997.96-8986,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3256.941,3259.064,"Mr. Sutton, shouldn't we just stick to the language of the statute?"
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3266.448,3275.775,"Your Honor, I've no idea, as you will agree, what they meant or what they knew, but that's exactly why we give them the benefit of the doubt."
1997.96-8986,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3276.536,3281.888,"Mr. Sutton, you were appointed as amicus curiae by this Court and we thank you for your performance in this case."
1997.96-8986,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3281.888,3282.579,Thank you.
1997.96-8986,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3282.579,3284.159,"Ms. Penner, you have 3 minutes remaining."
1997.96-8986,3,22952,eileen_penner,,3284.159,3304.393,"Justice Ginsburg raised an issue which is precisely the sort of issue that this Court could not reach but for its certiorari power and that is the question whether, after In Re Burwell, a single dissenting judge on a court of appeals panel, his vote in favor of a certificate is sufficient to mandate that a certificate be issued."
1997.96-8986,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3311.128,3319.151,"Do you think it's vitally important that that be the same Nation wide, that one court of appeals follow one practice, it would be terrible if the other followed the other practice?"
1997.96-8986,3,22952,eileen_penner,,3319.151,3320.713,The question is whether Congress did.
1997.96-8986,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3374.239,3378.581,Do you have any explanation for the dearth of any applications in that period?
1997.96-8986,3,22952,eileen_penner,,3378.581,3389.22,"We don't... I personally cannot say that there is a dearth, because there... it's extremely difficult to search this Court's records from that period in applications that would have been decided in chambers, so I don't think--"
1997.96-8986,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3389.22,3390.449,Mr. Sutton said there was.
1997.96-8986,3,22952,eileen_penner,,3390.449,3396.444,--I think that... I am uncertain that Mr. Sutton would be able to make a declaration that there were no applications.
1997.96-8986,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3453.841,3455.091,Could I ask you a quick question?
1997.96-8986,3,22952,eileen_penner,,3467.149,3469.122,"I'm sorry, could you--"
1997.96-8986,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3469.122,3474.846,"If we accept the position that it's not in... is it all right if I ask this, Chief--"
1997.96-8986,3,22952,eileen_penner,,3495.117,3496.127,--Yes.
1997.96-8986,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3496.127,3496.547,All right.
1997.96-8986,3,22952,eileen_penner,,3502.441,3504.254,It may have the same implication.
