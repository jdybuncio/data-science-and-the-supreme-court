2003.03-5165,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,33.971,"We'll hear argument next in No. 03-5165, Marcus Thornton v. the United States."
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,70.707,75.571,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-5165,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,111.741,120.471,"Well, now, Belton did involve a car search after the suspects had left the car and were under arrest."
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,123.843,128.457,"--They were within reaching distance of the vehicle, Justice O'Connor."
2003.03-5165,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,128.457,129.037,And arrested.
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,129.037,134.416,They... they were standing by the side of the car at the... at the moment of arrest.
2003.03-5165,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,134.416,137.686,"Right, but then they were disabled by the arrest."
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,162.039,173.109,"Well, Your Honor, I... I believe that when you focus on the word recent, it's not a very bright line test unless you flesh it out and give it some definition."
2003.03-5165,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,183.765,184.945,Do we know from the facts here?
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,184.945,197.776,"--a lot less... the facts here show a lot less time, but recent doesn't give the kind of clear bright line that Belton said it was trying to draw because it... it's open to a lot of interpretation."
2003.03-5165,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,198.489,200.647,How about moments?
2003.03-5165,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,200.647,220.368,"You conceded... the Fourth Circuit said that it was conceded in the... that he was in close proximity to his vehicle when Officer Nichols approached him, and the record does conclusively show that Officer Nichols observed Thornton park and exit his automobile and then approached Thornton within moments."
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,222.773,223.223,--No.
2003.03-5165,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,287.013,294.915,But there was no search until the... Belton was... wasn't he in... in the patrol car by the time they started the search?
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,294.915,296.925,"So was Mr. Thornton, Your Honor, and I--"
2003.03-5165,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,296.925,303.796,But... so I... that's what I don't... it's quite different from search into... incident to arrest.
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,329.161,345.361,"--I would agree with that 100 percent, Your Honor, but the converse of that position is that in order to do the search, the... that he's allowed to do under the Fourth Amendment, that... that right to search fixes at the moment he effects the custodial arrest."
2003.03-5165,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,385.001,399.428,"So you don't object to the search taking place when there's no danger to the officer, but you say in order to do that non-dangerous search, the officer has to put himself in danger when he makes the arrest."
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,399.428,400.821,--That's... that's right.
2003.03-5165,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,428.458,436.442,"Was there... were there reasonable grounds here, do you concede that, for the Terry pat-down of petitioner?"
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,436.442,438.95,"--Your Honor, there may or may not--"
2003.03-5165,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,438.95,440.111,Is that contested?
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,440.111,446.95,"--The... that ground, that exception to the warrant requirement was not advanced by the Government below."
2003.03-5165,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,446.95,447.482,All right.
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,454.602,455.5,That's correct.
2003.03-5165,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,456.329,456.859,Of the vehicle.
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,456.859,457.59,--We have not--
2003.03-5165,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,457.59,470.089,"Now, had... had the officer not made an immediate search of the vehicle, presumably the police would have to have taken precautions to safeguard the car and make an inventory search of it."
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,472.463,476.629,"--Well, Your Honor, the... the Fourth Circuit did not address--"
2003.03-5165,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,476.629,477.907,Isn't that right?
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,477.907,479.4,"--Well, not necessarily, Your Honor."
2003.03-5165,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,503.503,511.074,"Well, it seems to me that Justice O'Connor's questions are... are getting to your comment that Belton is a... is a fiction."
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,543.209,551.61,"You could make the same argument with regard to the house in Chimel, that we limit the search to the area within reaching distance in the room that the man is in."
2003.03-5165,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,557.052,559.576,Houses are... houses are stationary and cars are not.
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,561.27,573.337,"Well, it... the... if the... the justification in Belton for allowing the vehicle search says it's not a departure from Chimel, and it limits the search to an area within the reaching distance."
2003.03-5165,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,594.236,599.365,"Well, then... then Belton should have been... if you're right, Belton should have... not have been decided the way it was."
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,599.365,602.735,"Your Honor, Belton was decided absolutely correctly I believe."
2003.03-5165,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,628.347,645.378,"Well, suppose this... this officer lets Mr. Thornton go to the shopping mall but is standing guard next to the car and Mr. Thornton then comes back, enters the car and just as he enters, the police officer says, you're arrested."
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,646.64,650.673,--In my view he would not be able to do a Belton search.
2003.03-5165,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,664.684,665.448,--So if--
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,674.909,682.578,If... if the... if the car was... if he could... he could search for anything within reaching distance of the person he's arresting.
2003.03-5165,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,682.578,683.54,What about the answer to my question?
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,683.54,688.604,"If he could reach into the car, he could... he could get anything within the man's reach."
2003.03-5165,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,688.604,689.549,Why is that reasonable?
2003.03-5165,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,705.818,718.317,"Well, I... I agree with Your Honor that if he hasn't arrested the man and he has an opportunity to let the man move away from the car before he conducts the arrest, he's certainly acting as a prudent officer in protecting his own safety."
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1593.902,1605.955,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1674.211,1679.988,May I just point out that the question presented in Belton defined it as an occupant of the vehicle?
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1679.988,1687.026,"--That's correct, Justice Stevens, but the Court did use the term recent occupant at page 460 of its decision."
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1687.026,1689.218,It also used occupant several times in the opinion.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1689.218,1691.824,"That's true, and... and in describing the category of--"
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1691.824,1700.903,"And... and the examples that it gave, as your opponent indicated, all were... except one possible exception, all were occupants, weren't they, in... in the cases that Justice Stewart--"
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1700.903,1701.351,"--No, Justice Stevens."
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1757.391,1759.334,"--Yes, but if you emphasize the clarity... and that's what Justice Stewart did."
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1765.775,1768.547,"It's... it's artificial, Justice Stevens, and it's--"
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1768.547,1770.656,"Well, I agree it's artificial, but is it not equally clear?"
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1770.656,1772.149,--That is a clear--
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1772.149,1772.895,"In fact, is it not more clear?"
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1775.584,1778.539,"--Well, with respect, we think it's an artificial rule, and... and if I could--"
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1778.539,1779.469,It is an artificial rule.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1784.829,1785.76,--No.
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1790.788,1797.43,"Because the reason it's artificial is it explains that normally Chimel would control, and he said we want a special rule for... for arrests of occupants of cars."
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1803.638,1804.334,--But... but it--
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1804.334,1806.659,And the entire... all... all containers in the vehicle I mean.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1806.659,1808.832,--If I could respond in this way.
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1817.465,1819.988,"Yes, but the contact with the police is when they're occupants."
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1819.988,1820.518,"Well, that's true."
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1825.449,1827.226,"Well, I'm trying to get an answer to this question."
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1846.364,1849.302,"Well, let me answer both questions."
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1876.839,1879.595,But would your rule apply to someone who was out of the car for 5 minutes?
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1879.595,1889.606,"--Well, the... the recency test that the Court... that we think the adopted or described in Belton is one that's tethered to the proximity of the automobile."
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1892.445,1894.803,"Well, I'm trying to understand what your definition of recent is."
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1894.803,1903.018,--It's... it's someone... it's the person who has gotten out of the car and who's in the same proximity to the car that he would have occupied if he had been ordered out.
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1903.018,1907.219,"But is... in other words, geography is part of the time dimension of recency."
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1907.219,1909.176,"Well, and it is in a typical Belton case."
2003.03-5165,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1983.029,1983.992,Why... why does that matter?
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1992.423,2002.399,"--That's absolutely correct, Justice Souter, and that's an important aspect of the generalization that the Court drew in Belton and... and that underlies the search incident to arrest cases which is--"
2003.03-5165,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2002.399,2012.327,"No, but the... the point of Justice Stevens' question is why should we go beyond... strictly why should we go beyond the generalization in Belton?"
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2017.687,2027.516,"--My... my point, Justice Souter, was that the officer safety justification for Belton is going to be squarely implicated regardless of the reason that the person got... got out of the car."
2003.03-5165,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2027.516,2049.492,"No, but it seems to me that you get into... into deeper water if you say that because the... to me the incoherence of Belton is that it... it purports to be an application of Chimel with a bright line, but at the point at which the actual search is made, any danger to the officer is over."
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2096.386,2097.033,Sure.
2003.03-5165,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2119.426,2125.484,"But is... is your criterion then going to be a time criterion, the recency of his exit from the car?"
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2125.484,2130.681,It's... it's going to have both... and the court of appeals emphasized it in this case at page--
2003.03-5165,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2130.681,2132.955,"Well, is it time or is it space?"
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2132.955,2137.901,--It's both space and time and it's going to encompass a situation where the person has just gotten out of the car--
2003.03-5165,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2137.901,2147.047,"So if... if I get out of my car and I run as fast as I can run for 15 seconds, and I get across the parking lot, that is very recent in time."
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2149.322,2152.757,"--Well, under the position that petitioner advances--"
2003.03-5165,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2152.757,2153.138,No.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2161.405,2168.128,"--Justice Souter, as in the case of any Fourth Amendment case, there... there are going to be situations at the margin."
2003.03-5165,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2171.132,2173.987,"No, but bright line rules are... are there to... to avoid marginal problems."
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2176.178,2188.943,"--If the hypothetical is the person sees the police officer and races away from the car, the police officer arrests the person in the vicinity of the car, then no, I don't think it matters if he got 15 feet or 20 feet or 30 feet."
2003.03-5165,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2206.389,2207.965,What if he... what if he didn't see the police officer?
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2223.105,2223.536,--Well--
2003.03-5165,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2223.536,2230.226,He's... he is in the spot he would have been if the police had arrested him or had apprehended him in the car and told him to get out.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2231.088,2233.595,"--Of course, there's something absent there which is the positive linkage."
2003.03-5165,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2242.741,2243.355,But if they see him... if--
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2243.355,2243.921,I think the police--
2003.03-5165,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2243.921,2246.36,"--if they see him get out of the car, can they then search in my hypo?"
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2246.36,2251.473,"--I... I think in that situation where the person was arrested right by the car, we think that Belton probably would apply."
2003.03-5165,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2318.366,2319.878,The Arizona Court of Appeal.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2319.878,2321.82,The Arizona Court of Appeals held in that case.
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2352.961,2354.886,"Well, you said a little while ago there are cases on the fringe."
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2364.629,2365.892,"--Yes, we are."
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2367.484,2373.344,"What if, for example, the... the officer saw a person speeding, he pulls into a gas station, he gets out, goes to the men's room and comes back out."
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2375.619,2378.971,"--If... of course, that's... that's not the fact pattern here."
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2378.971,2379.386,No.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2380.033,2381.163,"Yes, I think he probably would be able--"
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2381.163,2384.35,--I'm wondering about the integrity of your statement that there's a real bright line rule there.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2386.126,2388.632,--In... in that case where the person--
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2388.632,2392.833,He's... this... the officer saw him speeding but he didn't turn the light on.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2399.041,2408.187,"--If the person comes out and is right next to the car in the place he would have been when he had been ordered out, yes, we think that... that Belton would apply in that situation."
2003.03-5165,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2501.792,2519.438,"If the... if the suspect is handcuffed and is in the police cruiser, is there any danger to the officer at that point that can't be equally avoided by simply having an inventory search later?"
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2519.438,2522.358,"There is danger, Justice Kennedy."
2003.03-5165,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2523.968,2525.047,Assume a single occupant.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2525.047,2525.777,--Right.
2003.03-5165,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2572.157,2580.805,"I know it applies, but it's just not clear to me why an inventory search can never be, which... I have only one factual question here."
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2587.08,2602.949,"--The... I believe the answer to that is... is no because the record doesn't... what the record shows... and this is on page 50 of the J.A. I think... is that the officer arrested petitioner, put him in the car and then went back and searched the car."
2003.03-5165,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2746.916,2761.69,Would he have to at least see the suspect in the car or would it be all right under the rule you're proposing where the police that come upon the scene just after the suspect exits from the car?
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2761.69,2788.282,"--Well, we think that the... the most important thing for the Court to hold in this case... that we would ask the Court to hold in this case is in the commonly recurring situation where police see the person exit the car and confront him moments later in the same vicinity that he might have occupied if he had been ordered out of the car, that it doesn't make a difference for the purposes of applying Belton as to whether or not the police succeeded in initiating contact or succeeded in initiating contact in a sufficient way."
2003.03-5165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2814.144,2817.331,It seems to me your argument is that we don't want a bright line rule.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2829.034,2829.731,--No.
2003.03-5165,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2871.845,2875.363,"Justice Stewart wrote both Chimel and Belton, did he not?"
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2875.363,2878.036,"That's absolutely correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-5165,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2899.598,2902.47,What do the police departments normally tell the policemen?
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2907.334,2915.237,In terms of... of... I... I can tell you what the practice is at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.
2003.03-5165,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2924.051,2924.449,No.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2940.665,2942.177,"--That's... that's correct, Justice Breyer."
2003.03-5165,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2942.177,2942.558,All right.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2946.459,2947.556,And... and if it's--
2003.03-5165,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2947.556,2951.754,So... so inevitably we're in the business of trying to say what's just got out of.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2955.986,2956.453,--No.
2003.03-5165,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2959.557,2959.921,All right.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2961.647,2968.537,"--Well, let me... let me say affirmatively that this case we think places a proper temporal--"
2003.03-5165,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2968.537,2969.051,This is well within it.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2969.051,2971.143,--and spatial limits on it where it's clear that the person--
2003.03-5165,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2971.143,2974.163,And you'd say certainly a day is too long I imagine.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2974.163,2974.728,--Of course.
2003.03-5165,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2974.728,2975.275,Yes.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2975.275,2976.188,That's correct.
2003.03-5165,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3000.075,3002.847,Then perhaps we could use words like just got out of.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3002.847,3004.226,Or within moments.
2003.03-5165,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3005.735,3006.401,Seconds?
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3006.401,3008.574,--Seconds would be fine.
2003.03-5165,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3009.669,3010.466,And what about in this--
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3010.466,3010.947,I don't--
2003.03-5165,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3010.947,3012.276,--what about in this... this is a serious question.
2003.03-5165,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3014.549,3019.414,"--Well, and... and that's... that's a different fact pattern that has arisen."
2003.03-5165,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3139.545,3140.938,"Thank you, Mr. Garre."
2003.03-5165,2,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,3143.396,3147.412,"I have four brief points, Your Honor, that I'd like to make, if I could."
2003.03-5165,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3306.253,3307.698,May I ask you a question--
2003.03-5165,2,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,3307.698,3308.112,Yes.
2003.03-5165,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3308.112,3308.908,--if your time is up?
2003.03-5165,2,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,3320.179,3325.973,I believe an inventory search does not allow you to search opaque containers within the car.
2003.03-5165,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3325.973,3329.325,"Thank you, Mr. Dunham."
