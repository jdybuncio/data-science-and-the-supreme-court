1996.95-2031,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.548,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-2031, Thomas Young v. Kirk Fordice."
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,9.687,12.89,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,81.374,84.927,"Well, may I ask you a question right here about that?"
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,125.685,126.874,"--Yes, it could Your Honor."
1996.95-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,137.222,151.62,"Well, even in the face of the fact that the NVRA requirements expressly state that they govern only Federal elections?"
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,151.62,153.603,"--Well, Your Honor, in this case--"
1996.95-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,153.603,163.879,There seems to be some indication in the statute itself that it never... Congress never purported to require a change in requirements for State and local elections.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,163.879,165.379,"--It doesn't require that, that is true."
1996.95-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,167.452,172.545,But you think that the Attorney General can make that a condition of any approval?
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,172.545,177.247,"--Well, it depends in part upon the State's specific history and the practices it had."
1996.95-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.247,181.331,In any section 5 State you think the Attorney General can insist on that?
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,181.331,188.446,Mississippi had a unitary system by statute at the time the NVRA came into effect.
1996.95-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,188.446,188.857,Yes.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,188.857,193.709,And we contend that the implementation of a dual system reflects a change from that unitary system.
1996.95-2031,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,193.709,196.301,It still does have the same unitary system in place.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,203.676,204.177,But you have a--
1996.95-2031,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.177,206.227,Now you have an additional option.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,219.896,221.388,"--Well, our contention is this."
1996.95-2031,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,221.388,221.979,Except for the false start.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,224.4,237.319,"Leaving the false start out of it, you now have a system under which there is a class of citizens that once registered is not permitted to vote in State and local elections, and that is not a unitary system under any meaningful sense of the term."
1996.95-2031,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.319,249.645,"By reason of the special grace provided by the Federal statute, but the same system that existed for multiple registration prior to the NVRA is still in place in Mississippi."
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,249.645,255.339,"There was no system of multiple registration, though, because one registration made you eligible for all purposes."
1996.95-2031,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,255.339,255.9,Eligible... well--
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,255.9,288.271,"And the real purpose of our lawsuit here is to say that whatever choices Mississippi made in implementing the NVRA, whatever plan it decided to adopt ultimately had to be submitted for preclearance so that the Attorney General could review exactly how that procedure was going to be implemented, and there are many, many discretionary choices that a State makes in deciding to set up a system either on a dual basis or, even if it's on a dual basis, there are different ways and different choices that a State makes that will have a major impact on whether the voters--"
1996.95-2031,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,288.271,289.512,--Could you give me a few illustrations of that?
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,293.975,297.898,"--That's right, and also, for example, the registration forms themselves."
1996.95-2031,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,324.385,325.056,In Federal?
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,326.847,343.797,"--In Federal... that you would only be able to vote in Federal elections, that's correct, and so it was vital, because of the risk of confusion, and the risk of people believing that they may already be registered for all purposes when in fact they are not that the Attorney General reviewed these procedures, each and every one of them."
1996.95-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,343.797,369.515,"Well, I can understand that, but to ask the further question whether the Attorney General, assuming the forms make it clear that it's only for registration for Federal elections as the law indeed says is necessary, whether it can go beyond that and say, moreover, State, you have to make this a unitary system now and follow the Federal plan for all, even State and local."
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,369.515,380.702,"But if there were evidence before the D.C. District Court or the Attorney General that a dual system had been reinstated for the very purpose of discriminating against minority citizens, certainly--"
1996.95-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,380.702,391.889,"Not reinstated, kept, unchanged from the past, but following the new law for Federal elections."
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,391.889,410.291,"--But Your Honor, the cases such as City of Lockhart v. United States recognize that even when a State maintains certain procedures but changes other aspects of its registration system, the procedures that are unchanged themselves may be subject to section 5 review."
1996.95-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,410.291,423.121,It just seems so counterintuitive in the face of language in the statute whereby Congress expresses the intent not to require a change for State and local registration purposes.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,426.721,432.324,But cases such as City of Lockhart recognize... in that case the numbered post requirement had not been changed at all.
1996.95-2031,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,432.324,436.848,That wasn't in connection with the Federal Voter Registration Act.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,436.848,459.954,"No, it was not, but it was a situation where one provision that called for numbered post remained unchanged, and the Court held that it nevertheless was a change when the city applied that numbered post requirement to an election system where additional seats had been added, because the Court held that you have to examine a change in the context of the entire election system."
1996.95-2031,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,459.954,460.565,"Ms. Wright, why--"
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,494.677,505.876,"But Your Honor, the Attorney General is entitled to examine the effect that this particular method of implementation will have on voting and registration in State and local elections."
1996.95-2031,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,505.876,513.561,"Whatever its effect is is the fault of the Federal Government, so long as the procedures for implementing the Federal scheme themselves are fair."
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,513.561,514.212,Well--
1996.95-2031,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,514.212,525.168,"Now, it may discourage people from voting in State elections who find it easier to register for Federal only, but that's the Congress' fault for applying this new system only to Federal elections."
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,525.168,537.497,"--We argue, Your Honor, that because of the decision in Allen v. State Board of Elections it's clear that even if a change, a particular change is mandated by the Voting Rights Act itself, it is subject to preclearance requirements."
1996.95-2031,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,537.497,544.373,"Your argument goes considerably further than Allen, which itself went to me to the extreme of construing this statute."
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,557.298,557.889,No.
1996.95-2031,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,560.331,560.722,Yes.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,565.055,566.816,--Well--
1996.95-2031,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,566.816,569.928,"Or perhaps she'd act wrongfully if she refused to, but that's not before us, is it?"
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,569.928,579.885,"--The question of actual discriminatory intent or effect is not before this Court and it was not before the court below, and that is why we contend that the Court exceeded its jurisdiction."
1996.95-2031,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,579.885,588.263,"Is it not true that even if it's perfectly clear that the Attorney General would have had a duty to preclear the existing system, you would nevertheless prevail?"
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,588.263,589.342,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-2031,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,590.864,596.087,Then are you actually asking as well to submit all the changes that weren't made?
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,629.399,629.91,--That's right.
1996.95-2031,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,635.683,637.556,--But isn't all of that premature?
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,649.274,650.095,That is correct.
1996.95-2031,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,650.095,654.169,All we know is that we have a change prompted by the Federal law.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,662.344,669.34,"Well, we certainly agree that there is no necessity of determining what the ultimate outcome of the--"
1996.95-2031,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,669.34,672.36,Or even what constitutes a satisfactory submission.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,675.423,676.312,--Yes.
1996.95-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,676.312,682.396,But it might be important to other members of this Court to know just how far the Attorney General's position goes.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,684.078,685.63,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-2031,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,685.63,690.012,"And in that respect, may I rephrase Justice O'Connor's question?"
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,690.012,691.263,Yes.
1996.95-2031,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,691.263,705.842,"It isn't your position that as a practical matter... as a practical matter, the State must ask for preclearance of its former voting procedures."
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,705.842,719.902,"It need not Gubmit those procedures, but we do believe that if the State is going to change from its current statutory policy of a unitary system it does need to obtain preclearance for that alteration of its important policy, and that would be part of--"
1996.95-2031,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,719.902,730.48,So you're saying that as a practical matter the State cannot leave in place its previous precleared procedures without further amendment and alteration of those procedures.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,730.48,742.789,"--Because it's current... but that's only because its current system contemplates a unitary system of registration, and I do want to emphasize the very narrow character of the inquiry that we have here."
1996.95-2031,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,749.941,751.333,Even though the change was brought about by the Federal Government.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,751.333,752.262,That's right.
1996.95-2031,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,752.262,753.063,And not by the State.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,753.063,753.995,That's right.
1996.95-2031,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,753.995,755.335,"None of our cases support that, do they?"
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,755.335,759.128,I believe Allen v. State Board of Elections and McDaniel v.--
1996.95-2031,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,759.128,761.058,Was that change brought about by the Federal Government?
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,761.058,761.509,--Yes.
1996.95-2031,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,779.281,780.553,But that's not what we're--
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,795.702,797.723,"--Well, we contend that--"
1996.95-2031,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,797.723,799.796,And that was not involved in any earlier case.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,799.796,806.919,"--That comes into play, though, because of Mississippi's clear statutory policy of having a unitary registration system."
1996.95-2031,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,806.919,809.551,"Well, you pick on that and you say that that has been changed."
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,831.275,832.184,"Well, we do argue--"
1996.95-2031,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,832.184,833.546,"I mean, that's a loaded question."
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,839.3,850.827,"--What we argue, Your Honor, is that the State has been highly selective in deciding which provisions of existing Mississippi law it must continue to comply with and which it cannot change."
1996.95-2031,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,868.548,869.6,--I don't agree--
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,869.6,870.89,--on a unitary basis.
1996.95-2031,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,870.89,886.12,"--If you ask me what would constitute the least change that Mississippi could make in order to comply with the Federal law, I would say it is precisely what Mississippi did here, leave its current registration procedures entirely in place."
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,903.251,918.121,"We would argue from the perspective of the voters it certainly is not the least change possible, because if you think about election day the registrars are now required to keep two sets of poll books, one for NVRA registrants only allowed to vote in Federal elections, and one for other registrants."
1996.95-2031,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,930.91,931.571,No problem.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,934.523,935.463,--But Your Honor--
1996.95-2031,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,935.463,937.025,Just the way it was before.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,937.025,962.56,"--But because the NVRA does require that the States administer these procedures, the State, we contend, has an obligation to identify exactly how it wants to go about implementing the NVRA and obtain preclearance for all of those decisions specifically spelled out in a proceeding either before the Attorney General of the United States or the D.C. District Court, and that is what has not happened here."
1996.95-2031,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,964.473,967.975,"Well, may I ask you a fact question?"
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,997.943,999.685,"Well, the... yes."
1996.95-2031,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1010.542,1011.454,"Oh, I realize that."
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,1011.454,1012.272,--set of procedures.
1996.95-2031,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1012.272,1019.057,"That if you take the totality of the submission, that totality in fact has not been followed."
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,1019.057,1019.738,That's right.
1996.95-2031,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1019.738,1021.499,The provisions of that totality have not been followed.
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,1021.499,1022.11,That's right.
1996.95-2031,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1022.11,1030.816,"But with respect to the provisions for the implementation of the Federal act, have they been followed or not?"
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,1030.816,1035.868,We believe that Mississippi is following the provisions as they respect Federal elections.
1996.95-2031,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1035.868,1051.589,"Okay, so the only fact difference, then, is it didn't make changes to conform its old State system to the new procedures which it, which everybody agrees it's following for the limited Federal registration."
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,1051.589,1067.991,"But there are further differences because of... by necessity, when you implement a dual system you have to make changes in your practices to take into account the fact that you now have two separate sets of registration requirements that may result in confusion for voters."
1996.95-2031,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1077.154,1083.329,"When... well, I just wanted to ask about your benchmark view."
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,1105.986,1127.26,"Well, we contend that it's not necessary to determine the status of those early 1995 procedures in order to dispose of this case, but we do contend that Mississippi was actually implementing a unitary NVRA plan, and that it could not make a change from that system that was in effect in the early part of 1995."
1996.95-2031,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1127.26,1136.905,"From an unlawful system, they just couldn't treat that as a nullity and say, we had a pre-January 1 system and a lawful post-January 1 system?"
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,1136.905,1146.081,"We contend no, because you simply cannot treat as a nullity the registration of thousands of voters who registered under the assumption that they were eligible for all elections."
1996.95-2031,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1146.602,1148.024,Why not just give them notice?
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,1154.455,1160.87,--Preclearance would have to be obtained for a change that makes such a dramatic difference in the registration status of so many voters.
1996.95-2031,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1162.392,1168.396,"Ms. Wright, as I understood your submission, it is not that the whole State was acting de facto this way, although unlawfully."
1996.95-2031,0,18138,brenda_wright,,1185.73,1216.348,"Well, we contend that even though only some of the circuit clerks put voters actually on the rolls for all purposes, the unitary NVRA plan was actually being implemented on a State-wide basis, because in each of these counties when you went into the agencies the forms that you were being given and the procedures that were being followed were to the knowledge of the voters procedures registering you for all elections, and that was going on in every county regardless of whether the circuit clerks immediately put you on the rolls for all purposes, and that's how we say there was in fact State-wide implementation here."
1996.95-2031,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1217.089,1218.561,"Very well, Ms. Wright."
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1220.111,1231.979,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1297.049,1331.342,"Well, even if we agree that the State's proposals to administratively and by State law implement the requirements of the new Federal act have to be submitted to the Attorney General for preclearance, do you also take the position espoused by Ms. Wright that the Attorney General may require the State to go to a... the same system for its State and local voter requirements?"
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1331.342,1341.718,"--If the State had made clear from the outset that it intended to implement the NVRA on a Federal election-only basis, it would then have submitted the procedures--"
1996.95-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1341.718,1371.247,"Well, the procedures it did submit to the Attorney General contained within them a proposal for changing State law to go to a system that would be the same for Federal as well as State, but I thought the Attorney General's own requirements and that of Federal law in this area did not permit the Attorney General to act on something on the basis of laws that had not been passed."
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1371.247,1371.888,--That's correct.
1996.95-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1372.9,1378.723,"So the Attorney General, instead of acting on this, should have just said we can't act on it at this stage."
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1378.723,1379.714,"--Well, the submission--"
1996.95-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1379.714,1380.504,Shouldn't it?
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1380.504,1381.385,"--No, I don't believe so."
1996.95-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1381.385,1381.716,No?
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1381.716,1382.106,Well--
1996.95-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1382.106,1383.238,That's what the Federal law requires.
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1383.906,1390.562,--The Attorney General certainly could not appropriately have purported to preclear legislation that had not been passed.
1996.95-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1390.562,1391.453,But that's what it purported to do.
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1391.453,1394.144,"With respect, Your Honor, I don't believe that's the case."
1996.95-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1395.053,1397.196,I was surprised it dealt with it at all.
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1405.181,1425.143,"--But the submission did include the draft legislation, but it also included procedures for implementing the NVRA beginning on January 1, 1995, and in our view the unmistakable tenor of the whole submission was that those procedures presupposed a regime in which NVRA registrants would be eligible for State and local elections as well."
1996.95-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1425.143,1431.908,"Well, of course it did, but it also quite clearly and on its very face presupposed a new statute that hadn't been passed."
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1431.908,1443.215,"Again, with respect, the statute was included, but the submissions did not make clear that passage of a statute was essential to treatment of NVRA registrations."
1996.95-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1443.215,1449.66,"Well, you're not contending that the Attorney General wouldn't have known from the submission that the statute had not, in fact, been passed?"
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1449.66,1452.16,We knew from the submission that the statute had not been passed.
1996.95-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1460.846,1461.768,How could that not be--
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1461.768,1462.178,Well--
1996.95-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1462.178,1466.082,--when you had State law that said this is how you register for State--
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1466.082,1471.014,"--Well, one of the respects in which this record is fairly hazy is--"
1996.95-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1471.014,1472.715,--You don't have to be a very good lawyer to figure that out.
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1476.057,1486.783,"--In fact, Mississippi has never identified with any clarity the precise State statute which is supposed to bar the treatment of NVRA registrants as eligible to vote in State and local elections."
1996.95-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1491.236,1492.048,You don't need one that bars it.
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1516.483,1517.134,--That's correct.
1996.95-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1517.134,1519.275,And you see the Mississippi statute doesn't permit this.
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1530.574,1546.845,"No, what we knew was that the State had begun to adopt the plan outlined in the submission as of January 1, 1995, and again, this is not a situation in which the State could decide at a later date what elections these people were registered for."
1996.95-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1597.86,1610.108,"Well, that certainly isn't clear from the language of the act that Congress passed, which seemed to leave in place, if States chose, their existing system for State and local elections."
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1613.507,1627.899,"Again, we're not... we acknowledge that the NVRA itself does not require these procedures to be used in State and local elections, and we're not arguing that the Attorney General has some blanket authority to require that as a matter of her own discretion."
1996.95-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1628.568,1633.203,"Well, I thought that was what Ms. Wright argued, and I thought you were arguing in support of her."
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1633.203,1637.734,"--I don't understand that to be Ms. Wright's position, and it certainly isn't ours."
1996.95-2031,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1664.762,1681.894,"So there is a significant possibility that Mississippi cannot implement the motor voter... MRV statute without also changing precleared, preexisting procedures for elections, for State election registration?"
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1681.894,1684.705,"--I would say a theoretical possibility, but I think Mississippi--"
1996.95-2031,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1684.705,1690.061,I think it's a significant possibility based upon the comment that you've... and the explanation you've just given us.
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1690.061,1711.692,"--Well, at least our primary concern at this point is that the method by which Mississippi is implementing the NVRA creates a particular risk that NVRA registrants will be dissuaded from registering separately for State and local elections, because the forms on their face give the message that the registrant is eligible to vote in all elections."
1996.95-2031,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1711.692,1719.71,"Well, the way to cure that is simply to deny the preclearance with respect to the simple implementation of the Federal act."
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1722.101,1724.462,"Again, all we want at this--"
1996.95-2031,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1724.462,1725.163,Isn't that so?
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1725.163,1726.214,"--Yes, I think that is so."
1996.95-2031,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1751.93,1764.599,What would be the position of the State of Mississippi if you failed to preclear its implementation of the new Federal statute?
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1764.599,1767.641,"Well, part of this--"
1996.95-2031,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1767.641,1771.926,"Could it go, could elections at the State and local level proceed but not at the Federal level?"
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1771.926,1777.829,"--Well, I think part of this depends upon the benchmark that would be used."
1996.95-2031,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1816.406,1823.37,Is it your position that in a picture like this the State would be required to preclear twice?
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1842.374,1853.301,"They could have as far as section 5 is concerned but not as far as the... well, as far as the NVRA is concerned, they would have been required to implement the statute for Federal elections because of the effective date of the NVRA itself--"
1996.95-2031,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1853.301,1853.741,Yes.
1996.95-2031,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1853.741,1856.223,--and section 5 would have precluded their doing so without preclearance.
1996.95-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1856.223,1857.893,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,1861.546,1863.427,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1905.325,1911.139,Does that mean that there were no discretionary matters that the State could decide in implementing the motor vehicle registration act?
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,1911.139,1911.579,"No, Your Honor."
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1916.693,1919.535,"Well, with respect to those, was there a duty to preclear?"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,1919.535,1921.376,Possibly.
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1922.027,1922.748,"Well, yes or no?"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,1922.748,1929.47,"--Well... all right, I'll say yes if the amount of discretion is considered to be significant."
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1931.212,1933.384,"Well, isn't the standard just whether there's a change?"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,1933.384,1943.699,"--Well, to the extent that the State of Mississippi has discretion in implementing the mandates of the NVRA, arguably those discretionary--"
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1943.699,1944.611,Should have been precleared.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,1944.611,1945.302,--Are subject to preclearance.
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1945.302,1946.851,And they were not.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,1946.851,1948.634,"Oh, yes they were, Your Honor, I'm sorry."
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1949.015,1955.239,"Well, let me ask you, is it your position that there was no duty to preclear, or that you did get preclearance?"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,1955.239,1957.229,"--Well, on parts of it there was no duty."
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1986.659,1986.909,All right.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,1986.909,1990.732,"We made a designation of five or six agencies, and arguably--"
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1990.732,1994.466,Was not that designation something you had to preclear?
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,1994.466,1995.297,"--Yes, sir, and it was precleared."
1996.95-2031,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1996.018,1997.779,But it wasn't under your view.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2042.808,2048.282,"--Well, we characterize her actions as both erroneous and partly as a rogue official."
1996.95-2031,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2058.929,2062.42,But I thought you said nobody knew of her December 20 letter.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2062.42,2063.101,--No one did.
1996.95-2031,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2084.346,2093.402,"Well, I thought they indicated on their face that these are legislative proposals that will be submitted but they haven't been adopted."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2093.402,2094.023,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-2031,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2094.023,2095.141,"I mean, that was clear on the face."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2108.802,2109.222,Well--
1996.95-2031,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2109.222,2115.637,--so that it is clear to those people that they will be registered only for Federal purposes and not State?
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2115.637,2116.647,"--All right, let me make clear--"
1996.95-2031,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2116.647,2118.898,"I mean, I would think that would be a natural part--"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2118.898,2119.699,--Let me make clear--
1996.95-2031,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2119.699,2121.111,--of the preclearance part.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2121.111,2125.933,"--Those purported changes that required legislative action, we submit, were not properly precleared."
1996.95-2031,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2127.976,2142.986,"I'm talking about the materials submitted to the people who come in to get a driver's license, and the language used to explain to the voters in Mississippi the Mississippi position, that you will be registered for Federal elections only."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2142.986,2143.765,--I understand.
1996.95-2031,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2143.765,2146.297,"And to register for the State you have to do A, B, C, and D."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2146.297,2146.968,"Yes, such as the--"
1996.95-2031,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2146.968,2156.644,"Now, presumably the Attorney General could take objection to Mississippi's apparent failure to advise voters of the situation."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2156.644,2157.215,--All right.
1996.95-2031,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2184.683,2196.469,"He precleared it, or purported to preclear it... she... as part of a package which included... which included... in a way, you two sides deserve each other."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2210.521,2210.971,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-2031,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2294.925,2301.138,"But it can be said, can't it, that what the Attorney General precleared was what you submitted."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2301.138,2301.9,That's right.
1996.95-2031,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2301.9,2307.513,And what you submitted does not conform to the law or practice of Mississippi today.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2308.895,2310.304,Yes.
1996.95-2031,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2317.961,2318.342,All right.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2334.441,2336.251,"And were precleared, yes."
1996.95-2031,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2336.251,2337.633,Just that they--
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2337.633,2337.944,"Oh, yes."
1996.95-2031,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2337.944,2340.034,"--That they must be precleared, must be subject to preclearance."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2340.034,2344.409,"To the extent that they represent significant discretion, they must be precleared."
1996.95-2031,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2389.506,2420.137,"Mr. Sanders, wouldn't the most important thing to preclear, perhaps the only thing once Mississippi decides it's going to do a different Federal-only registration, is to tell people who come into the motor vehicle bureau in big letters, this will register you for Federal elections only, and such a thing was never precleared because the first submission didn't suppose there was going to be that system."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2420.137,2425.971,"Well, of course, the National Voter Registration Act doesn't require that we set forth any such disclaimer or warning."
1996.95-2031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2430.512,2440.289,It also says at each voter registration agency the following services shall be made available: assistance to applicants in completing voter registration forms.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2444.554,2445.362,All right.
1996.95-2031,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2464.907,2472.831,"Yes, but the means by which you do that, however you are informing them, has never been submitted to the Attorney General and has never been precleared."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2472.831,2473.282,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-2031,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2473.282,2478.654,"Because the premise of your first submission was that you wouldn't be telling them that, isn't that correct?"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2478.654,2482.578,"Well, it just... the first submission did not contemplate that at all."
1996.95-2031,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2482.578,2492.543,"That's right, so that the Attorney General neither had before her, nor precleared, whatever means you are using to get this information to the voters."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2492.543,2492.864,Again--
1996.95-2031,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2492.864,2493.835,"That's true, isn't it?"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2493.835,2503.742,"--That's true, yes, sir, but I would just contend that the transmission of information, helping someone understand his or her voting status, is not a change in any event, especially within the meaning of section 5."
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2514.65,2521.143,"Oh, but counsel, the adoption of the form that you use for the voter to fill out and so forth, that certainly was a change, wasn't it?"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2521.694,2524.405,"--Well, it's a new form mandated by the Congress, of course."
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2524.405,2529.648,"Right, but was the language... all the language in the form mandated by Congress?"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2529.648,2530.229,Virtually all of it.
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2530.229,2531.171,Virtually.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2531.171,2537.065,"The FEC requires, or allows us to incorporate into the form those... as I said, those things that would disqualify--"
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2537.065,2547.15,"But isn't it fairly clear that if at the time of your submission you had realized what the ultimate outcome would have been, you would have put on that form, this is good only for Federal elections?"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2547.15,2554.786,"--Well, of course, if the Attorney... if the Mississippi Attorney General's Office had known at the time that a submission was about to have been made, a lot of things would have been done differently."
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2561.98,2563.201,"Well, they didn't interject themselves."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2572.939,2574.288,"--Well, I beg to differ, Your Honor."
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2603.13,2614.277,"No, it isn't that, but it seems to me that we're off on sort of a tangent about whether they should or should not preclear a unitary system or not, but it seems to me it's a very simple case."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2623.814,2624.222,Yes--
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2624.222,2628.256,"Now, whether they should be precleared is... maybe you're dead right on that."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2629.187,2631.589,"--Well, but I contend they were precleared."
1996.95-2031,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2647.918,2649.3,"Mr. Sanders, if there had been no--"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2671.323,2672.625,"--No, ma'am, I don't think it does."
1996.95-2031,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2691.137,2695.52,"I'm not talking about the State registration, just the Federal registration."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2695.52,2695.86,Okay.
1996.95-2031,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2695.86,2696.491,It's a change.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2708.58,2711.601,"Well, I think any State-initiated change has to be precleared."
1996.95-2031,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2711.601,2720.428,But the State is initiating a form that isn't dictated in every particular by Congress.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2720.428,2726.02,"Well, it is largely dictated, and is almost exclusively dictated by the Federal Election Commission."
1996.95-2031,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2733.173,2746.513,"Then you... what your answer to me now seems to me inconsistent with the position that you repeated twice in your brief when you said that the statute requires preclearance of any change, and that arguably--"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2746.513,2747.475,Arguably.
1996.95-2031,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2747.475,2751.086,"--Yes, but now you're changing your arguably to no."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2751.086,2755.27,"No, I'm just saying... what I'm saying is, arguably it did."
1996.95-2031,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2760.232,2768.436,"You're not conceding, are you, that the publication of a form is a change in practice or procedure?"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2768.436,2771.598,"--No, not one that's initiated by the State and subject to section 5 preclearance."
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2772.239,2775.692,So you're now taking the position the forms did not have to be precleared?
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2775.692,2776.083,No.
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2782.167,2791.764,"Yes, but your argument that they were precleared, if I understood you before Justice Ginsburg asked you some other questions, was that the February 16 letter in effect ratified the prior preclearance."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2791.764,2792.262,--That's correct.
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2792.262,2797.638,"That's surely not a fair reading of that letter, which is asking... which is telling you in so many words there's been no preclearance."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2797.638,2798.196,All right.
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2818.07,2825.657,"It says, a review of this matter indicates that the implementation of this dual voter registration system and purge system has not been submitted for review."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2825.657,2836.033,"--That's correct, and they suggest that we submit a... make another submission, but they never do anything to diminish the fact that they precleared those agency selections, they precleared the form, their--"
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2836.033,2840.877,"But as part of a general submission that you say was improper, and which was clearly not--"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2853.563,2863.15,"--Well, my position is in the February 16 letter all they had to do was say, well, if this is not part of a unitary system, then we hereby lodge a conditional objection and we will resolve it later on."
1996.95-2031,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2866.863,2868.954,"Well, let me ask you a what-if question."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2868.954,2869.334,All right.
1996.95-2031,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2869.334,2877.619,What if we don't agree with you and think this whole preclearance bubble... mess... doesn't amount to anything.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2882.304,2884.085,Well--
1996.95-2031,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2884.085,2886.955,Let's just suppose that's what we think.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2886.955,2887.807,--All right.
1996.95-2031,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2913.854,2924.39,And probably forms that make clear to people who register at driver's license time that they are not registered thereby for State and local elections.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2924.39,2931.965,"--Oh, certainly I think if this Court were to remand we might make that change, but frankly I do not think that that would be--"
1996.95-2031,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2931.965,2932.356,Might.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2932.356,2934.228,"--Well, I do not--"
1996.95-2031,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2934.228,2937.561,You said a moment ago you didn't think that was a practice or procedure.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2937.561,2938.052,"--No, I don't."
1996.95-2031,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2940.973,2965.518,"But in your brief you said twice the choice of NVRA forms those agencies would use were administrative changes affecting voting that arguably required section 5 preclearance, and now as I understand your answer to the Chief Justice you're saying you were wrong to say arguably require preclearance because they weren't changes that needed preclearance."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2965.518,2966.72,"--Well, I don't--"
1996.95-2031,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2966.72,2968.981,But you said it twice so you must have thought about it.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2968.981,2970.741,"--Well, frankly, I mean, I didn't put as much--"
1996.95-2031,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2970.741,2972.814,"You think it's an argument, but it's a bad argument is what you're saying."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2972.814,2973.244,--That's correct.
1996.95-2031,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2974.153,2985.892,But didn't you also... didn't you also in this argument just a moment ago in responding to Justice O'Connor refer to the need to submit something about the forms?
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2987.604,2988.005,Right.
1996.95-2031,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2990.015,2993.699,"The construction of the form, by which you mean the format and its content?"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2993.699,2995.939,"--Well, really what--"
1996.95-2031,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2995.939,2996.6,What do you mean by construction?
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,2996.6,3002.213,--As I indicated earlier the NVRA says that persons may register--
1996.95-2031,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3002.213,3003.242,May I interrupt you just for a second?
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,3011.85,3019.804,"--If the State of Mississippi had decided to put a lot of additional material on the form, then we would have been constructing in a material sense."
1996.95-2031,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3046.173,3046.774,Okay.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,3046.774,3049.656,Now... so Mississippi put Mississippi's qualifications in there.
1996.95-2031,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3058.642,3067.749,"So you agree that insofar as you include those, in effect State law conditions and limitations you must submit the form for preclearance."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,3067.749,3068.317,--I'm just... no.
1996.95-2031,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3088.751,3090.513,Or if you omitted material.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,3105.883,3110.466,"--Well, I'm not sure that not putting something in there amounts to a section 5 change."
1996.95-2031,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3110.466,3112.847,"Well, you say you're not sure."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,3118.679,3119.811,"Well, all right."
1996.95-2031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3124.143,3124.744,Okay.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,3178.153,3182.866,"Well, I think at most of course you should just simply remand it."
1996.95-2031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3216.789,3217.157,Mr. Sanders--
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,3230.12,3231.62,"--No, that's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-2031,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3231.62,3253.114,"Mr. Sanders, I'm reluctant, as some others seem to be to say that you have to submit forms for preclearance, because if we adopt that principle we'll have to use it not just in this case but in all cases in the future, and the notion that all forms are submittable whenever you make any change is a rather expansive one."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,3272.106,3273.928,And Your Honor--
1996.95-2031,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3273.928,3287.416,"If we can't be sure by requiring the forms to be submitted, how can the Attorney General prevent the State of Mississippi from misleading citizens that way?"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,3287.416,3298.085,"--Well, obviously through a section 2 challenge or any Fifteenth Amendment-based challenge, but our position is that the Attorney General should not be able to do that through the device of section 5 preclearance."
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3327.971,3349.937,"Is there any significance to the fact that the motor vehicle statute has a specific section in it saying that this doesn't limit the application of the Voting Rights Act and doesn't modify it in any way, and doesn't it follow that if you adopt a new form to be used to register voters, that that's a change or practice, blah, blah, blah, within the meaning of section 5?"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,3349.937,3365.318,"I read that language in the NVRA simply to mean the same... or I read it the same way I read footnote 29 in Allen, where this Court says that State-initiated changes, even when made to comply with section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, must be submitted for preclearance."
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3374.972,3391.685,"But the fact that the Federal Government, the Federal statute required them to do some things, made them print a new form with respect to elections, is it not still true that the distribution of a new form to people who are being registered, a form you never used before, is a change in a voting practice?"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,3391.685,3392.944,--Not within the meaning of section 5.
1996.95-2031,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3392.944,3393.325,You don't think so.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,3393.325,3393.916,No.
1996.95-2031,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3403.944,3417.832,"Well, if the... without reference to the NVRA, the State of Mississippi decided to have a new form advising voters of the effect of their registration, where they could register and so forth, would that have to be precleared?"
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,3417.832,3419.421,If it was just a--
1996.95-2031,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3419.421,3426.888,It's an instruction mailed to all voters with respect to an explanation of registration procedures.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,3428.308,3428.758,--Absolutely not.
1996.95-2031,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3435.494,3437.414,"Suppose it's a new form, new wording, et cetera."
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,3437.414,3438.215,"--It doesn't matter, Your Honor."
1996.95-2031,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3444.59,3446.49,This is not a voting practice or procedure.
1996.95-2031,2,40426,robert_e_sanders,,3446.49,3447.191,"No, of course not."
1996.95-2031,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3478.7,3483.075,"Thank you, Mr. Sanders."
