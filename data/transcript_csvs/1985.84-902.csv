1985.84-902,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,98.195,"Mr. Hansen, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,98.195,102.679,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-902,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.379,286.355,"Well, Mr. Hansen, in Japan Line I think the Court at least expressed considerable concern, reliance upon the asymmetry that would exist, and here, I guess, Canada imposes a tax on fuel under the same circumstances that Florida does."
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,286.355,288.965,"Yes, you are quite right, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-902,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,305.472,312.594,"But, certainly... It certainly cuts back on the reliance you can place on Japan Lines in my view."
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,312.594,316.624,"--Well, no, I respectfully disagree."
1985.84-902,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,360.731,365.668,"Well, isn't the Canadian counterpart provincial rather than national?"
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,365.668,368.025,Yes.
1985.84-902,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,369.244,372.587,"It is not imposed by the dominion of Canada, it is imposed by a couple of provinces."
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,372.587,379.318,"--It is imposed by the provinces, just like Florida is imposing a tax here."
1985.84-902,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,480.138,492.211,"Mr. Hansen, just to clear up one point for me to be sure I am right on it, you do not contend, as I understand your position, that there is a violation of any specific treaty between the United States and your executive agreement?"
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,492.211,495.57,By the Florida tax?
1985.84-902,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,495.57,498.225,"Yes, or by the provincial tax in Canada, either one."
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,498.225,504.533,"Well, I can't answer insofar as Canada is concerned."
1985.84-902,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,536.474,544.471,"Well, just more narrowly, as I read your brief, you did not contend that the Florida tax violated that convention."
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,544.471,570.319,"Well, I did insofar as it violated the... what those tax exemptions demonstrate and they demonstrate just what this Court concluded was demonstrated by the Customs Convention on Containers in Japan Line."
1985.84-902,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,577.832,583.924,"But, that all is support for your basic argument that Japan Line controls as a matter of constitutional law."
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,583.924,584.329,--Yes.
1985.84-902,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,584.329,592.748,"But, as I understand, you do not independently argue that the convention itself provides a federal reason for holding a state tax unconstitutional."
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,596.825,606.789,There is no specific exemption from a state tax in the Chicago Convention or the Nonscheduled Air Services Agreement.
1985.84-902,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.594,1128.828,May I ask you one question that goes back to Japan Line.
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,1128.828,1129.125,--Okay.
1985.84-902,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1129.125,1132.404,What was the tax?
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,1133.824,1134.435,"Yes, that is right."
1985.84-902,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1134.435,1135.794,--And here we have a sales tax.
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,1135.794,1136.56,Yes.
1985.84-902,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1140.949,1144.37,Do you think Japan Airlines would have made it unconstitutional for California?
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,1149.4,1149.853,"Yes, I do."
1985.84-902,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1149.853,1150.414,--You do?
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,1150.414,1150.977,Yes.
1985.84-902,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1150.977,1162.143,"And, you think this is the same as if they imposed a property tax on the... If they imposed a personal property tax on the value of the gasoline while it was in the state or something like that?"
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,1162.143,1162.518,Yes.
1985.84-902,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1162.518,1163.409,You think it is the same?
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,1163.409,1164.783,"Yes, I do."
1985.84-902,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1193.461,1198.098,You mean even in the absence of a convention?
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,1198.098,1213.498,"In the absence of the... With the circumstances which we have in this case, it is our position that they did not have the power."
1985.84-902,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1213.498,1218.325,Even without... Supposing there had been no convention in this case.
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,1218.325,1219.06,"Oh, yes."
1985.84-902,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1271.757,1278.269,Does your principle apply to an American carrier which buys gasoline in Florida just for its overseas flights?
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,1278.269,1284.33,--That question has not been brought to this case.
1985.84-902,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1284.33,1284.828,I understand that.
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,1284.828,1285.5,To this Court.
1985.84-902,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1307.617,1312.553,I was just wondering whether your evaluation of your own principle would apply in that case or not or you just don't know.
1985.84-902,0,44904,walter_d_hansen,,1312.553,1348.132,"If it is construed to be foreign air transportation and not a question of a domestic power such as was contained in the Containers Corp. of America with just resinouses of foreign commerce, but strictly involved foreign commerce and foreign air transportation, then I would say that Florida would violate the Constitution."
1985.84-902,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1361.392,1366.765,"Your time has expired now, counsel."
1985.84-902,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1370.17,1374.559,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-902,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1414.386,1426.21,"Is there some argument... some plausible argument to be made, Mr. Lauber, do you think, that although the Florida tax does breach reciprocity the Canadian provincial tax don't?"
1985.84-902,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1426.21,1431.661,"Well, I can imagine arguments Canada might try to make to defend the tax."
1985.84-902,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.966,1456.387,You mean just something out of the air.
1985.84-902,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1465.463,1481.345,--By that we mean the international consensus that aviation fuel used by foreign carriers in foreign commerce should be exempt from all taxes except those imposed by the home country of the airline and that--
1985.84-902,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1481.345,1484.564,"Where do you find that consensus reflected, in some document or--"
1985.84-902,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1484.564,1498.605,"--Well, the Chicago Convention by its terms says that foreign carriers are to be exempt from tax on aviatic fuel they bring into a country, exempt both from national taxes and local taxes."
1985.84-902,2,31949,joseph_c_mellichamp_iii,,1997.559,2004.136,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-902,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2375.239,2387.39,"But, Florida, counsel, reserves the right to tax other foreign airplanes besides Canadian planes on their fuel, doesn't it?"
1985.84-902,2,31949,joseph_c_mellichamp_iii,,2387.39,2389.108,"Yes, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-902,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2389.108,2403.26,"So, that may be a good defense to this case, but how about Florida's assertion of a power to tax, say, you know, a plane flying from Miami to London, a British plane, or a Belgium plane flying from Brussels to Miami?"
1985.84-902,2,31949,joseph_c_mellichamp_iii,,2403.26,2419.174,"None of the agreements that are before this Court, Justice Rehnquist, affect or discuss or pre-empt or prohibit state excise taxes or sales taxes involved in this case."
1985.84-902,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2432.544,2444.227,"Well, do think then the fact that the Canadian provinces that are imposing a tax here... Is it kind of a make weight argument for your side or is it a pretty important argument or does it really not amount to very much?"
1985.84-902,2,31949,joseph_c_mellichamp_iii,,2444.227,2477.355,"When you are looking to see what these agreements cover and how the people that negotiated them, the nations that negotiated them, felt were covered, what were covered in these agreements, it has considerable weight, because in this case, the other nation in this case considers the agreements not to prohibit such taxation by their subnational units of government and in that respect it has some weight."
1985.84-902,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2574.114,2577.269,"Thank you, gentlemen."
