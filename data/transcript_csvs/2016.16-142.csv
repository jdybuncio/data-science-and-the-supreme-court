2016.16-142,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.52,"We'll hear argument next in Case 16-142, Honeycutt v. United States. Mr. Unikowsky."
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,7.52,22.285,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner's brother obtained nearly $270,000 in proceeds from the sales of Polar Pure. Petitioner obtained nothing, yet the government seeks to hold him jointly and severally liable for the entire amount."
2016.16-142,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,101.9,111.04,"But doesn't it seem that there's some back and forth about what's new and what's old in the government's theory, is that part of what's changed in the government's theory or not?"
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,111.04,111.21,Yeah.
2016.16-142,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,292.72,299.425,"Well, I -- I suppose their answer would be that under Pinkerton, when you're talking about the defendant, you're also talking about co-conspirators."
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,299.425,303.56,"Your Honor, first of all, the government doesn't make that argument in their brief and actually I think it doesn't work."
2016.16-142,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,318.93,321.56,What -- what's your authority for that proposition?
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,321.56,322.29,Well --
2016.16-142,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,322.29,331.25,"And under Pinkerton, the -- the need to reach the substitute assets because of dissipation wouldn't be attributed to the co-conspirator."
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,331.25,338.18,"I think that Pinkerton itself includes a requirement that attribution requires the act to be in furtherance of the conspiracy, so I think the Court would have to ask the --"
2016.16-142,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,338.18,346.76,"Well, but it's -- it -- in furtherance of the conspiracy, we're looking -- the act at issue here is dissipation of tainted assets and the need for substitution."
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,356.21,391.235,"Well, that may be, but I -- I think that when the text of Section 853(p) imposes a requirement that specifically because of an act or omission of the defendant, and that's what 853(p) says, that is a prerequisite to obtain forfeiture against the defendant, I think the government either has to show that that's -- the defendant did something to -- to cause the property to be unavailable, which the government hasn't shown and -- and can't necessarily show in general, or that the act that triggers the substitute forfeiture, which is the dissipation, is attributable to co-conspirators, which the government doesn't think it has to prove and hasn't proved here. And I point out on the facts of this case, there's no showing of unavailability."
2016.16-142,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,434.605,436.46,I have just a practical question.
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,436.46,436.9,Yes.
2016.16-142,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,436.9,442.615,"Would our -- how would our ruling here affect the RICO forfeiture statute, 1963?"
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,442.615,443.22,So --
2016.16-142,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,443.22,445.36,The language is very similar.
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,445.36,445.82,Yes.
2016.16-142,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,446.07,450.28,"So if we rule in your favor, does that mean we undo the RICO statute as well?"
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,450.28,452.28,I think there's a pretty good likelihood of that.
2016.16-142,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,466.939,474.805,RICO may be easier to prove the joint-and-several concept because RICO is an enterprise as defined.
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,474.805,476.22,That -- that is true.
2016.16-142,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,491.995,523.88,"Well, how would this work -- how would your rule work as a practical matter in a drug conspiracy case or a racketeering case where the government can prove that a certain amount of money was taken in by the conspiracy over a period of time and then it was divide -- presumably, it was divided up in some way among the members of the conspiracy and -- do they have to show how much each of them got? I mean, they're not going to do this by check."
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,528.515,540.065,"Well, I think that Section 853(d) solves at least some of the government's problems in this area, which is this presumption that if you get money during the conspiracy and there's no other likely source, it's attributable to the conspiracy."
2016.16-142,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,563.955,566.65,Did the government ever try to invoke (d) here?
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,566.65,569.24,"No, Your Honor, there -- there's no record of that at all."
2016.16-142,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,576.39,586.85,"And what do you do in the situation that's similar to what I just -- I just described, where members of the conspiracy have -- have spent a lot of money."
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,599.545,606.17,"Well, I think that, first of all, Section 853 has several powerful tools to determine how much each person obtained."
2016.16-142,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,609.4,609.92,"Oh, come on."
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,617.89,640.37,"Well, no, but if you have evidence the person spent money somewhere, you can go to the place where he allegedly spent the money and try to figure out how much he spent. Yes, it's true, I can't -- I can't deny that there's probably some category of cases where forfeiture will be harder under our rule than the government's rule, and we think that's just part and parcel of the statute that requires forfeiture of tainted property except as certain substrate assets are met."
2016.16-142,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,735.23,739.77,"It does have a number of courts -- courts of appeals on its side, doesn't it?"
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,739.77,743.96,"That is certainly true, and the split does favor the government, we agree."
2016.16-142,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,789.16,794.485,"Is there any -- any circuit case on the other side, other than the D.C. Circuit case?"
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,794.485,795.13,"No, Your Honor."
2016.16-142,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,807.87,816.325,Is there -- is there any indication in the text of 853 that those who framed that and adopted it had conspiracy in mind?
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,816.325,817.7,"I think so, yes."
2016.16-142,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,838.1,849.59,"This is a -- a bit off topic, but the statute refers to proceeds that the person obtained directly or indirectly. Do you have a view as to what that ""indirectly"" is doing there and what it encompasses?"
2016.16-142,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,849.59,849.95,Yeah.
2016.16-142,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,903.0,908.93,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fletcher."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,908.93,923.605,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The law treats conspiracy as a partnership in crime, and for that reason it has long been the rule that the acts of every member of the conspiracy in furtherance of the common plan are attributed to every other member of the conspiracy."
2016.16-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,938.19,956.325,"Well, that, Pinkerton, it -- it's based on a fiction, right? I mean -- I mean, the defendant may not have been there when the acts committed; somebody else may have done it, but because he's a conspirator, you treat it as if he had done that. I'm not sure that that theory works when you're talking about a more focused statute here, where you tamper only the tainted property."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,965.89,968.54,"So I -- I -- I disagree, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.16-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1028.235,1036.4,"If -- if they both have -- was carrying it, they both have the duffle bag and all that, and you say, well, they are both liable for what's in the duffel bag."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1046.065,1046.5,Right.
2016.16-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1047.86,1056.72,"And your theory also is if the other guy, you know, just dropped the person off, had nothing to do with getting the duffel bag or whatever, the same thing happens."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1059.775,1061.485,"If it's foreseeable to him, yes."
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1095.22,1098.78,So do you have to show one of these five preconditions in (p)?
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1098.78,1106.81,"To invoke (p), (p) is a procedure that allows the government to for -- forfeit specific substitute assets in a defendant's hands, a car or a house, something like that."
2016.16-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1112.545,1114.87,"As to one person, though, not to the other."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1141.835,1142.49,That's correct.
2016.16-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1147.19,1149.19,"Listen, I wonder why you call them traceable."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1164.315,1176.725,If the Ferrari's wouldn't -- if the government has the ability to forfeit the -- Ferrari still falls under subsection 853(a)(1) it's property -- any proceeds the person obtained directly or directly or indirectly and that property derived from the proceeds.
2016.16-142,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1185.92,1202.845,"But -- but it's odd that you use P, which would apply to substitute property -- you apply it even though this particular defendant or the particular person did nothing himself to place the proceeds beyond the reach of -- of the court."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1202.845,1203.48,That's right.
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1231.2,1243.955,"So in other words you're saying, the defendant in (p) is the same as the person in A and both includes co-conspirators as well as the actual defendant or person?"
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1243.955,1245.39,I think we agree with the result.
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1267.33,1267.49,Where --
2016.16-142,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1267.49,1268.65,So what is --
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1268.65,1277.305,"Where does it say that? I mean -- I didn't take that point -- you're saying the word ""property"" in A1 is the tainted property."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1277.305,1277.97,Correct.
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1277.97,1278.17,Okay.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1288.075,1288.695,Correct.
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1288.695,1296.86,And it doesn't say in A1 that a person who doesn't have the tainted property is liable in an equivalent amount.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1340.925,1346.85,"I think in two ways: Both of them rely on background principles of conspiracy liability, but they do so in slightly different ways."
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1361.48,1372.705,"Here the person didn't obtain it in any odd common English thing until you're saying -- that word ""obtained"" means is property he didn't obtain."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1372.705,1374.7,Justice Breyer --
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1374.7,1389.87,"Co-conspirators came and you say let's look to the common law and the common law made that argument impossible because if you look to the history of it as I said you had to have the property itself in an in rem proceeding, so that's why I asked the question."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1389.87,1399.16,"I -- I understand the question, but emphasize every single application of the Pinkerton principle to a substantive crime is atextual and would be subject to exactly the same criticism."
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1414.01,1417.57,"Oh yeah, that's why I mentioned the fact -- if -- if you go back into the history."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1417.57,1417.93,Yes.
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1417.93,1420.45,"-- of the forfeiture, it's quite different from that."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1437.44,1447.6,"So the tradition that you're reforming to is a long tradition of civil in rem forfeiture that this Court has discussed in many opinions, and I think the statute before you today is very self-conscious departure from that."
2016.16-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1447.6,1447.78,Well --
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1447.78,1448.97,"Both in terms of making, go ahead --"
2016.16-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1448.97,1450.0,"I'm sorry, finish your answer."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1450.0,1459.29,"I was just going to say, in two ways both in the terms of what's forfeitable, proceeds forfeiture was new in 1970 and criminal and pursuant forfeiture was also new when it was enacted in RICO statutes."
2016.16-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1459.29,1470.705,"I understand the idea you argued this is not in rem, but when you -- as soon as you say, but we're only after the tainted property, it kind of sounds like you're in rem under another label."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1476.32,1476.55,Yes.
2016.16-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1476.55,1477.96,-- in rem against the property.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1484.115,1486.01,I --I understand that tension Chief Justice.
2016.16-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1486.01,1486.1,Sure.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1486.1,1487.45,I think that it's baked into the statute.
2016.16-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1507.96,1508.32,Mr. --
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1508.32,1509.89,-- in personam liability.
2016.16-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1509.89,1524.33,"I'm having trouble with just one component of your argument, many, but one that for the moment, which is the one that led the -- the one court who's against --"
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1524.33,1524.52,Yeah.
2016.16-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1524.52,1532.46,-- on this this issue was the courier who receives 50 dollars a week or 50 dollars a trip to deliver drugs.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1532.46,1533.02,Yes.
2016.16-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1533.02,1575.545,"Under your theory that courier who on everyone facts doesn't see more than 50 dollars of whatever the profit is of this drug enterprise, that courier is responsible for a million dollars, 2 million dollars, 3 million dollars criminal conspiracy because he took an undisputedly small part. Now, assume what logic in -- in rem theory would ever make a person who's never obtaining that money, those proceeds responsible for the larger sum?"
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1575.545,1576.16,Someone --
2016.16-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1576.16,1597.359,"Why should the drug dealer, who in fact got all of the money, minus 50 dollars, why should he be off-the-hook for even a penny less than what he put in his pocket because the courier happened to have a hundred dollars saved?"
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1597.359,1608.98,"So I want to start with the courier and explain that the limits of the courier's liability are going to be the scope of the Pinkerton principle the scope of the conspiracy that he agreed to join, and the proceeds that were reasonably foreseeable to him."
2016.16-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1620.88,1620.97,Well --
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1620.97,1621.88,-- than Pinkerton liability does.
2016.16-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1621.88,1627.475,That's generally what a courier is responsible for that -- the drug deals he or she is involved in.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1627.475,1627.88,And -- and --
2016.16-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1627.88,1631.27,And for those that are reasonably within the scope of the conspiracy.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1631.27,1643.35,"And -- and the only point that I'm making, and I don't think it's disagreeing with anything that Your Honor has said, is just -- that we don't think it's a great leap to say that once you're in a conspiracy that has consequences for your liability one of them is that you can be convicted for the crimes."
2016.16-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1643.35,1645.28,You'll serve a lot of years in jail.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1645.28,1647.94,And this is a financial penalty that attaches to drug --
2016.16-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1647.94,1652.045,"But why does that give you, assuming you're a victim, the government."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1652.045,1652.62,Yes.
2016.16-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1652.62,1662.515,Greater rights against that one individual as opposed to what forfeiture tends to mean against the proceeds of the crime.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1662.515,1662.92,Yes.
2016.16-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1662.92,1669.05,You're getting a remedy that's literally unheard of in the background principles of forfeiture.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1669.05,1675.78,"I -- I agree with you unheard of mostly in the in rem context, but this is in personam liability that's very different --"
2016.16-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1675.78,1676.0,In what --
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1676.0,1676.28,-- from that.
2016.16-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1676.28,1689.86,In what other setting other than in RICO and 853? In what other setting of law has a similar concept ever existed?
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1689.86,1692.81,"So, it depends on what you mean by similar concept of law. I --"
2016.16-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1692.81,1698.295,Concept where you're going to be personally liable for something greater than what you directly obtained.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1698.295,1738.81,"So I think one is the restitution context, we point out that the criminal defendants are held jointly and severally liable to pay restitution to victims, that's now specifically authorized by statute as we explain in our brief. Courts of appeals applied the same background principles we're invoking here to reach that result even before that. I also want to emphasize, Justice Sotomayor, that some of your question and some -- I think a lot of the appeal of Mr. Unikowsky's argument comes from the -- that the alternative to the rule that we're asking you to endorse that's prevailed in nine circuits for, in some cases decades, is a scheme in which the only thing that a courier or a conspirator is required to forfeit are the proceeds that he actually has or that he somehow got to enjoy for himself, and that is not the law. That's not the -- the statute has not been enacted --"
2016.16-142,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1738.81,1749.81,"May -- may I, Mr. Fletcher, go back to your saying now this is in personam no longer in rem, but in -- in personam generally, it would be a right of contribution."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1799.7,1802.15,You're correct that there's no right of Federal contribution.
2016.16-142,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1827.33,1839.61,"Of course, under your theory, if it worked the other way around, if they went after the brother that did get the money and took it, he would then, under your theory, have a right of contribution against the brother who got nothing. That's -- that's your theory."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1839.61,1840.15,No.
2016.16-142,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1844.54,1845.91,But suppose it's under State law.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1849.04,1855.14,"If -- if a State law would recognize a right to contribution under these circumstances, then the -- the scope of it would be up to State law."
2016.16-142,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1859.19,1863.59,"If they applied your precedent, the -- the brother who got nothing would still have to pay half."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1865.665,1875.65,"I -- I don't know what principles if -- as I said, I'm not aware of any State law that has actually recognized this, I'm not suggesting that they would, I just wanted to complete what source of law might govern the question if it did exist."
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1877.13,1886.45,"Mr. Fletcher, can I just ask you -- and I'm sorry, I'm sure it's -- I'm just not understanding it, but if I could just ask you to go through the mechanics of this. So there are two co-conspirators."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1894.73,1895.09,Uh-huh.
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1895.09,1909.04,"Now, do you first have to show that Conspirator A's money because -- is that -- do you have to show that it's unavailable? Do you have to show that Conspirator A has dissipated it or do you not have to show that?"
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1909.04,1912.35,"I think we have to show that it's unavailable to the government in that proceeding, so if --"
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1912.35,1913.29,In that proceeding.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1913.29,1913.725,Right.
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1913.725,1921.62,"If they -- if you could go after Conspirator A, you could find it, he just put it in a bank account, but that's irrelevant."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1921.62,1922.9,"I mean, that -- yes."
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1931.87,1936.465,So really you're only saying it has to be unavailable as to Conspirator B.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1952.495,1953.43,I think that's right.
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1958.96,1959.21,Okay.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1976.535,1985.21,"In order to forfeit substitute property under (p), and -- and -- before you continue, I just want to put on the table that our view is the government doesn't have to invoke (p)"
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1989.6,1989.92,Okay.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1992.915,1993.45,Sure.
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1998.75,2000.695,And have -- have you shown that in this case?
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2000.695,2002.32,"I believe that we have, yes."
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2002.32,2002.83,Which one?
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2002.83,2005.25,"I believe that we've shown, I think, a number of them."
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2011.36,2013.74,"And when you say that you've shown that, what do you mean?"
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2013.74,2018.615,What I mean is that in -- this is the -- the understanding which the case was litigated in district court.
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2066.73,2073.815,"But in both of these in your answers, I take it, it happens to say, and we have -- we're trying B."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2078.06,2078.4,Uh-huh.
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2078.675,2089.85,"Now, it says you can use 853(p) if the property described in subsection (a), as a result of any act or omission of the defendant."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2089.85,2090.395,Yes.
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2090.395,2093.275,"Now, it wasn't the act or omission of the defendant."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2120.02,2120.17,Yes.
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2120.17,2120.32,Okay.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2178.265,2180.55,"The -- but I want to be emphatic, that's not the result of our theory."
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2180.55,2181.09,Why not?
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2181.09,2191.14,"Because, as we explain in our brief on pages 35 and 36, subsection (c) and (e), which deal with pretrial restraints and relation back are limited to the property described in subsection (a) --"
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2191.14,2191.38,Uh-huh.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2191.38,2199.025,"-- in the hands of either a particular defendant in a nonconspiracy case or when you're dealing with conspirators, that is our position is specific tainted property."
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2199.025,2199.39,All right.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2220.58,2224.91,I think the specific property described in A is the bag full of money.
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2224.91,2225.21,Okay.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2225.21,2227.15,But A in the statute serves two functions.
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2237.92,2246.525,"And you're able to do that under what statute? You see, everything until you said ah, you see the last clauses here, I could follow in a statute."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2250.65,2250.96,Yes.
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2250.96,2255.89,-- it's only the things following that qualification that I can't find in any statute.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2255.89,2260.25,So one way that we can definitely do that is through the substitute assets provision in Section 853(p)
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2268.15,2273.035,But (p) unfortunately says because of an act or omission --
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2273.035,2273.88,Of the defendant.
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2273.88,2283.07,"-- of the defendant, and then it adds, if act or omission of the defendant in, I think, respect to property described in (a)."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2283.07,2283.975,That's correct.
2016.16-142,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2283.975,2284.58,All right.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2300.47,2304.37,"Justice Breyer, I -- I apologize if I'm not being clear."
2016.16-142,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2344.43,2351.78,Can you go over? Can you go over the -- Justice Breyer brought up the question of counsel fees.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2370.215,2383.64,"So in a pretrial world, the government can't stop him from using -- pay -- using his funds to pay for a lawyer if those funds are untainted. Section 853(e) is the provision that allows pretrial restraints."
2016.16-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2401.68,2412.695,"So in terms of the -- I don't mean to interrupt, but the substitution principle doesn't apply with respect to assets that you can seize that are needed for counsel fees?"
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2412.695,2416.7,"The substitution principle doesn't apply because -- that's -- that's right, exactly."
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2495.29,2497.1,"Mr. Fletcher, if I could, I'm awfully sorry --"
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2497.1,2497.49,"Oh, no."
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2497.49,2503.245,-- but let's just take the -- the -- the case where there are these two conspirators and one takes the cash and it's in his basement.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2526.865,2529.97,Unavailable to be forfeited in the proceeding before the court.
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2530.545,2531.105,Yeah.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2546.37,2551.46,Because the (p) conditions aren't focused so much on the -- on the person; they're focused on rendering the property unavailable.
2016.16-142,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2552.19,2552.42,But it --
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2552.42,2552.98,But there is nothing --
2016.16-142,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2552.98,2556.31,But it begins by saying act or omission of the defendant.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2556.31,2557.2,Correct.
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2561.42,2567.03,But you just said that the other conspirator might not have dissipated them at all. They're sitting in his basement.
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2567.03,2580.73,"So I think, in that case, Justice Kagan, I think our view would be we could make the showing under (p) that they are unavailable to the government, because in this case, presumably, the government -- the government doesn't know that they're sitting in the other conspirator's basement, because if the government did, they'd be prosecuting that guy and attempting --"
2016.16-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2580.73,2580.93,You have --
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2580.93,2582.205,-- to recover the proceeds from him.
2016.16-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2582.205,2588.165,"You have your choice of getting the money either from the guy who is holding it in the basement, or from the other guy."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2604.33,2608.31,"The question is, is it available to be forfeited in the -- in the proceeding in court."
2016.16-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2608.31,2615.1,"And if it's only a proceeding against the one guy, you can get the money from him, even though the money is sitting in a bag in the kingpin's basement."
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2615.1,2615.67,Correct.
2016.16-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2617.48,2622.13,And even though you can't show that -- this is why I keep on coming back to the preconditions of (p)
2016.16-142,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2632.25,2648.29,"Well, if that's the case, Justice Kagan, you might disagree with me about how to read (p), and if you read (p) that way in the hypothetical you just described, then that defendant would have an argument the government couldn't invoke (p) as to him. But I really think a lot of the discussion that we've had about how (p) works and how money judgments works are really ancillary."
2016.16-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2721.445,2723.59,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Unikowsky, 15 minutes."
2016.16-142,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2723.59,2749.36,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to begin by responding to counsel's comments about how this case was litigated below, and then I'd like to say a few words about the textual arguments as well as the background principles. So first, in terms of how this case was litigated below, the way the government has litigated this case throughout was its theory that Section 853(a)(1), and specifically the word ""obtain,"" was enough to establish joint-and-several liability."
2016.16-142,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2954.87,2958.23,But it seems to me that just another -- a reiteration of your earlier argument.
2016.16-142,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2965.3,2974.77,"But I -- again, I push back against that because I think that's only true -- the Pinkerton principle itself says that actions are attributable only in furtherance of the conspiracy, and so I -- I --"
2016.16-142,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2974.77,2980.425,"Well, what if the dissipation was in furtherance of the conspiracy? Put the -- the cases that you're talking about aside."
2016.16-142,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2980.425,2998.96,"So, first of all, I don't think that the government shows that, but at least that would be some theoretical textual argument, remember, that's focused only on (p) rather than (a), which has been the government's theory throughout. I would still disagree that joint-and-several liability is authorized because I just think there's extremely powerful textual, structural, and historical indications that it's just not authorized in the statute."
2016.16-142,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3056.495,3062.23,"Well, I don't know how much you can get out of the in rem forfeiture caselaw since this isn't in rem."
2016.16-142,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3065.64,3066.66,"That is true, Your Honor."
2016.16-142,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3066.66,3068.785,So I -- I -- what's the relevance of that?
2016.16-142,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3068.785,3073.55,"The relevance is that the -- the background principle, these ancient principles that the government tries to employ --"
2016.16-142,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3073.55,3073.7,"No, wait."
2016.16-142,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3080.96,3081.54,Right.
2016.16-142,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3103.33,3113.8,"I thought the argument was there simply to say there isn't an old tradition of getting B, who's in the basement, and I -- and I forget where they all are at this point."
2016.16-142,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3124.37,3126.21,"That is the exact point we're making, Justice Breyer."
2016.16-142,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3126.21,3136.115,"And Congress said it -- it not -- we do not intend in their report any significant expansion of the scope of property subject to forfeiture, or that's your point."
2016.16-142,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3136.115,3137.78,"That -- that is indeed our point, Justice Breyer."
2016.16-142,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3139.665,3142.045,"Oh, I'm not -- not saying that."
2016.16-142,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3142.045,3151.68,"I -- I think that -- that the -- there's a broader point here, which is that, in criminal -- in the interpretation of criminal statutes, I think the Court should be careful of how it uses background principles."
2016.16-142,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3353.615,3356.15,I didn't under -- understand the argument there was.
2016.16-142,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3361.675,3362.17,Okay.
2016.16-142,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3411.54,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
