1979.78-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,44.273,"We will hear arguments next in 78-1335, Village of Schaumburg against Citizens."
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,48.244,51.908,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,178.534,188.665,"The posture of the case now, we take it that this--these distributions do involve the dissemination of information?"
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,188.665,192.906,"Your Honor, that's a question--that remains to be--"
1979.78-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,192.906,194.409,You said there was summary judgment?
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,194.409,195.621,There was summary judgment.
1979.78-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,195.621,197.588,And they acted--the court acted on the pleadings?
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,197.588,199.14,The court acted on the pleadings.
1979.78-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,199.14,201.268,And that's alleged in the pleadings?
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,201.268,205.46,"It's alleged in the pleadings, Your Honor, and it's denied in our answer."
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,268.909,274.748,"Mr. Siegel, is this ordinance typical of villages in Northern Illinois?"
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,274.748,275.87,"No, sir, it is not."
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,341.307,350.223,"What about guys by national organizations, like Boy Scouts, Red Cross--"
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,350.223,351.271,"I believe, Your Honor--"
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,351.271,353.489,--and the like - are they subject to this ordinance?
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,353.489,354.526,"Yes, they are."
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,362.575,365.172,So that they have met the 75 percent requirement?
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,365.172,366.07,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,366.07,370.277,Would your argument be any different if it were 90 percent?
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,370.277,372.05,I think it's a question of reasonableness.
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,425.886,428.284,"Mr. Siegel, how would this ordinance operate?"
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,462.585,466.602,"Well, Your Honor, I think if the sole purpose was advertising--"
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,466.602,467.777,Yes.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,467.777,470.552,--then the ordinance would permit solicitation.
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,470.552,471.735,It doesn't say so.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,472.936,476.921,"Well, I don't--I think, Your Honor, first of all, it does say so."
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,478.751,494.029,"It says--it's 20(g) of Chapter 22 of the Village, subsection 2, requires the deduction of advertising expenses before the 75 percent figure."
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,494.029,499.611,I take it that advertising is in conjunction with the solicitation.
1979.78-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,499.611,506.586,It would not cover--are you suggesting it would not cover advertising if it were directed at public education?
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,507.232,512.706,If the only use of the funds was for public education--
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,512.706,513.298,For advertising.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,513.298,515.789,"--and that was for a charitable purpose, whether it be advertising--yes--"
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,515.789,516.208,"Well, my question is advertising."
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,516.208,517.486,"--in a broad sense, certainly."
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,517.486,520.6,Because that's what--advertising expenses is what the ordinance says.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,520.6,521.255,That's correct.
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,535.87,537.094,I see your point.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,546.287,546.766,That's correct.
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,546.766,547.243,--advertising.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,547.243,548.329,We're talking about--
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,548.329,554.223,"Therefore administrative expenses of the organization limits the term ""advertising""?"
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,554.223,555.228,Absolutely.
1979.78-1335,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,556.032,561.849,"Your ordinance also requires license for for-profit solicitations, doesn't it?"
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,561.849,562.776,Yes.
1979.78-1335,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,567.916,573.042,"Then, did the respondents here ever apply under that section?"
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,573.042,574.85,"No, sir, they did not."
1979.78-1335,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,574.85,580.161,Did you--has it ever been interpreted by the Illinois courts?
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,580.161,581.191,This particular--
1979.78-1335,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,581.191,582.373,Yes?
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,582.373,583.282,"No, it hasn't."
1979.78-1335,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,639.236,650.753,Did either party request the District Court to abstain so that the state courts could engage in some of these constructions of the ordinance?
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,650.753,651.318,"No, sir."
1979.78-1335,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.226,697.601,"Well, but certainly there are constitutional cases from this Court saying that you can't lodge total discretion in the power--in the chief of police to issue ordinances, and things like that."
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,711.002,713.465,"I would suggest that is the case, Your Honor."
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,735.436,752.678,"Isn't it--I take it from reading this ordinance that it wouldn't apply at all to an organization that came in and said, ""We want to go door-to-door, but we aren't the least bit interested in raising any money."
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,754.677,755.634,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,755.634,762.336,"So you could go door to door, and put out the word about the environment or anything else as much as you want to without any permit?"
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,762.336,762.572,That's absolutely--
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,762.572,765.526,So this applies only to the act of raising money.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,765.526,766.231,"That's right, Your Honor."
1979.78-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,766.231,776.668,"What about door to door, if they were going to urge people to vote for James Johnson for City Councilman and ask for a contribution to his campaign?"
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,776.668,777.745,It would apply.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,781.523,782.725,I think it would apply.
1979.78-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,786.683,789.741,How do you measure the 75 percent then?
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,795.734,798.446,I would say that they would meet the requirement.
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.515,1001.773,"Well, why wouldn't it be just as effective, if those are your aims, to require anybody who wants to raise money from any of your citizens to have written down on a little card what percentage of its budget it spends for this, that or the other thing?"
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1004.877,1005.435,It might be.
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1019.828,1031.84,"Well, do you think that--do you think that raising money, purely raising money, is in any case within the protection of the First Amendment?"
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1038.276,1043.563,"I think, frankly, Your Honor that this is probably not a First Amendment case."
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.52,1052.261,I thought you had some opinions--cases in this Court to contend with.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1052.261,1054.921,"The cases, Your Honor, that we have to contend with--"
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.921,1068.42,"How about people going around--how about religious organizations going around asking for contributions, and selling a piece of literature?"
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1070.555,1088.511,"All these--the religious cases, Your Honor--and those obviously, the Schneider v. Irvington and Martin v. Struthers, beginning with the Jehovah's Witnesses cases, all involved door-to-door solicitation by people who denote themselves as evangelists or missionaries to whom--"
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1088.511,1093.62,"Yes, but where they do--is it clear in those cases that they were doing something besides raising money at the same time?"
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1093.62,1094.68,"Yes, I think it is."
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1094.68,1095.538,Spreading the gospel?
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1095.538,1097.226,I think they were spreading the gospel.
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1122.533,1133.972,"I thought the Citizens for a Better Environment said that was precisely what they were doing here, spreading information about environmental developments."
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1133.972,1134.859,"Well, Your Honor--"
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1134.859,1136.24,"Well, they could do that without a license."
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1136.24,1137.527,They could do that without a license.
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1137.527,1138.01,Yes.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1138.01,1143.027,It's the question of collecting the money that brings them within the purview of our ordinance.
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1143.027,1145.399,"But they were doing both, as were the Jehovah's Witnesses--"
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1145.399,1154.417,"They were doing both, and we were denied the opportunity to inquire into just what in fact they were doing."
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1297.029,1314.067,"Well, except--except this ordinance doesn't, at least by its terms, direct itself to protecting the privacy of homeowners and leasees, but rather, with the solicitation of funds."
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1318.333,1319.31,That's correct.
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1319.31,1325.577,"--the householders, in an effort to propagandize them in one respect or another."
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1325.577,1330.702,"Your Honor, we're not unmindful of the First Amendment."
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1346.524,1346.998,No.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1346.998,1357.672,There was a legislative intent here to limit the solicitations in a manner which we felt did not impinge upon freedom of speech.
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1357.672,1358.21,Right.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1358.21,1369.283,"But when the, if you will, quasi-commercial character of raising money became involved, then we felt that we were engaged in a proper exercise of police power."
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1369.283,1386.045,"And that was its purpose, to protect the citizenry from some sort of species of fraud, not in the technical sense, but of being--paying out their money thinking it was going to a cause, a worthy cause, and--"
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1386.045,1386.39,Exactly.
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1386.39,1389.042,--and more than 25 percent of it was not going to the cause.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1389.042,1389.706,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1389.706,1393.203,But that's different from protecting the privacy of households.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1393.203,1398.898,"Well, I think there are two or three different bases which are served by this type of ordinance."
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1454.217,1464.163,"Mr. Siegel, is there anything in the record or the ordinance itself to explain how the village fathers came up with the figure, 75 percent?"
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1464.163,1465.417,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1474.445,1475.661,Is it the same restriction as--
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1475.661,1476.927,"No, it is not."
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1480.22,1480.657,Right.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1480.657,1482.014,But the formula is different.
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1485.615,1486.665,Which your ordinance does not allow?
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1486.665,1489.837,Our ordinance specifically does not permit that.
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1489.837,1492.25,So you keep people out that the state would regard as proper charities.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1492.25,1493.258,That's correct.
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1493.258,1493.367,Yes.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1493.367,1494.498,That's correct.
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1510.605,1513.506,But what did you know at the time you fixed the 75 percent?
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1513.667,1514.529,We knew that--
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1514.529,1518.253,How did you know you wouldn't be interfering with legitimate solicitation activities?
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1518.253,1525.807,"Well, first of all, I did a little research and I came up with the Ft. Worth case, where the Court had held 80 percent."
1979.78-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1528.546,1530.771,You wanted to get the highest figure you could get?
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1530.771,1531.493,"No, we didn't."
1979.78-1335,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1540.535,1545.02,And if Ft. Worth had been a hundred you could have taken 95.
1979.78-1335,0,32994,jack_m_siegel,,1545.02,1546.121,"Well, perhaps we would have."
1979.78-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1606.712,1609.567,Mr. Shadur?
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,1609.567,1612.777,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1685.574,1692.285,Suppose the ordinance prohibited all solicitations for funds entirely.
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,1694.228,1703.72,"Your Honor, it would be unconstitutional as applied to organizations that require the obtaining of funds in order to exercise First Amendment rights."
1979.78-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1703.72,1708.131,"Well, they all--can you think of any organization that would not require funds to conduct--"
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,1708.131,1739.733,"Your Honor, I would--I think that perhaps, although I can't read the mind of the Seventh Circuit, I think that perhaps the reference to the traditional form of charitable organization, as distinct from the kind here that is directly involved in programmatic activity, is the possibility that fund raising for charities alone may not carry with it--and I don't perceive the specific example--but could not carry--necessarily carry with it the desire to communicate ideas."

1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,1776.996,1777.854,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1788.294,1794.497,"But it wouldn't be unconstitutional to say, stay away from all the doors that have signs on them ""Stay Away."""
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,1794.497,1795.615,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1814.305,1819.581,"Well, do you have any cases that say that raising money is speech?"

1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1823.372,1826.595,"Well, now you're changing my question."
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,1826.595,1827.947,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1827.947,1831.394,"Well, the only thing this ordinance applies to is the raising of money."
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,1831.394,1831.611,But Your Honor--
1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1831.611,1838.57,And it doesn't--it doesn't prevent spreading the word.

1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1851.274,1855.339,Tell me anyone of those cases that involved only solicitation.
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,1862.171,1871.627,"But Your Honor, if the organization were raising money for the sake of raising money, then you would be dealing with a for-profit organization."

1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,1918.824,1921.992,"Your Honor, I would suggest that that's a case that's not before this Court."
1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.005,1931.396,The case before the Court is an ordinance that forbids only solicitation for money; talk about that.
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,1931.396,1932.446,"I am, Your Honor."

1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,1969.063,1997.917,"Your Honor, if we were dealing with a requirement that dealt directly with the question of bona fide, which is what that ordinance would deal with, that is, that at least one percent, at least some of the funds are used, under those circumstances, the community could seek to justify the organization--could seek to justify the ordinance as a means of preventing fraud."
1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1998.427,2002.325,"Well, that's really the basis on which the ordinance is sought to be justified here."

1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2003.89,2006.853,So is the argument about the 75 percent?
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2006.853,2009.272,"No, Your Honor, it is not."
1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.23,2042.453,"So in short, if instead of 75 percent the ordinance said, at least some, it would be equally invalid?"
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2042.453,2042.844,As--
1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2042.844,2044.476,"It would also be invalid, in any event."

1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2048.163,2048.396,No.
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2048.396,2049.48,--because our record is--
1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.48,2052.346,I just thought it's violating the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2052.346,2058.234,"Yes, Your Honor, that's what I meant by over-breadth grounds, the First Amendment."

1979.78-1335,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2233.918,2240.747,"Well, you say, in effect, then, there's no way that a municipal corporation can accomplish the result that they want to accomplish here."
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2257.673,2259.399,"Well, no, Your Honor, I haven't said that at all."
1979.78-1335,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2259.399,2260.867,"Well, that's what it amounts to."
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2260.867,2263.861,"No, Your Honor, there are statutes that deal with fraud."
1979.78-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2290.042,2290.136,Such as?
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2290.136,2291.78,--that's set up by this 75 percent
1979.78-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2291.78,2295.136,Tell us--tell us what some of those methods are.
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2295.136,2306.268,"A provision in the ordinance that prohibits trespass, that excludes people from coming onto the premises of homeowners who have indicated that they don't want to be bothered."
1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.268,2307.289,By posting?
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2307.289,2309.002,"By posting or otherwise; yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1335,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2309.002,2325.127,"What if the Village council held a hearing at which due notice was given and said that we have reason to believe that CBE has engaged in fraudulent representations within this village, and we're here to determine that."
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2329.786,2333.915,As a--as a precondition to permitting CBE to solicit?
1979.78-1335,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2333.915,2335.933,No.
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2341.595,2343.692,And then we had a hearing as to fraud?
1979.78-1335,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2403.542,2412.936,What if the solicitors for CBE take the money they've raised in two weeks of soliciting and just take it to the Caribbean?
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2412.936,2429.515,"In that case, Your Honor, there are statutes that permit that; indeed, it was precisely that kind of activity that gave rise to the Police Hall of Fame case that was tried, and the Council has referred to, and that was the unfortunate genesis of this very different kind of ordinance."
1979.78-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2429.515,2430.881,"Well, how do you get at that?"
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2432.928,2434.882,Get at fraud?
1979.78-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2435.132,2436.418,Prosecute each one?
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2436.418,2444.091,"Your Honor, that's how fraud has historically been dealt with in fundraising activities, as well as anything else."
1979.78-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2444.091,2457.942,"Well, then you implied before, if you did not say, that I could put up a sign--anyone can put up a sign--saying keep out, or posted, or no solicitors, or whatnot, and then--then they must stay out; is that right?"
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2457.942,2460.327,As long as the village has an appropriate--
1979.78-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2460.327,2460.451,Yes.
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2460.451,2463.384,"--kind of trespass ordinance, which all villages that I know of do."
1979.78-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2463.384,2467.661,"So the combination of the ordinance, the action of the municipality, plus the sign?"
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2478.624,2479.573,"Oh, yes."
1979.78-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2500.043,2500.232,But the--
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2500.232,2501.451,--in which citizens could make the judgment.
1979.78-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2501.451,2504.522,"--citizen had to take an affirmative step there, didn't he?"
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2511.099,2512.946,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2515.748,2521.7,"Well, what's the difference in the constitutionality of doing it individually and collectively?"
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2521.7,2527.754,"The difference, Your Honor, is the question of who does it individually and who does it collectively."
1979.78-1335,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2561.521,2562.274,Well--
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2562.274,2562.451,"Yes, Your Honor?"
1979.78-1335,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2562.451,2578.935,--could the Village reverse the presumption you're talking about and say that soliciting is prohibited except on property where there is a soliciting permitted sign?
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2578.935,2581.932,I think that would present very serious constitutional problems.
1979.78-1335,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2617.04,2622.204,But the Martin ordinance presumed that they knew--that they had to know the law that they would have to post a no-soliciting sign.
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2622.204,2628.503,"Yes, Your Honor, because when you deal with First Amendment rights, you have to have a narrowly drawn statutes."
1979.78-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2633.657,2639.623,"Well, where is the First Amendment right to the unregulated solicitation of funds?"
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2639.623,2639.921,"But Your Honor, this isn't--"
1979.78-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2639.921,2641.335,Unregulated.
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2641.335,2649.985,"But Your Honor, I must return to the refrain that what we're dealing with here is not the solicitation of funds in a vacuum."
1979.78-1335,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.338,2726.312,"You rely heavily on the connection--your type of organization--between the, you might call it, propaganda activity and the solicitation activity."
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2739.469,2742.363,"Your Honor, that's--that's a--what I think--"
1979.78-1335,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2742.363,2745.604,"You seem to be conceding that there is none, if I understand your argument."
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2748.004,2750.142,I'm pleased to say that I don't have to confront that one.
1979.78-1335,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2751.336,2760.858,"Well you may, under Mr. Justice White's hypothetical, because the ordinance could possibly have been written to say, ""You can say anything you want to, but don't solicit any funds at all."""
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2761.481,2762.843,But it is not--
1979.78-1335,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2762.843,2769.227,"Then you'd say, your kind of organization has a right to object to it, but maybe the Red Cross or somebody else wouldn't."
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2769.227,2793.523,"It's my view, and this is how I tried to respond to Chief Justice Burger's question--it's my view that the delivery of the message that has to do with the traditional charity itself contains the ingredients of speech, it contains, implicitly at least, the--the fact that you contribute to the American Heart Association and part of the activity that they engage in, or the Boy Scouts or the Red Cross--"
1979.78-1335,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2793.523,2803.885,"Well, then you're saying that you have two First Amendment interests here, in effect, One, the asking for funds is itself First Amendment protected; and secondly, that you need to do that in order to support your other message."
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2803.885,2805.402,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2805.402,2816.1,"So you wouldn't say--if I went around and said, I'm--you know, I'm the boy next door, I want to go to college, would you make a small donation."
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2826.485,2831.055,I think that's your--that's your freedom of speech.
1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2831.945,2833.609,So you say the answer's the same?
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2833.609,2834.512,Yes.
1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.512,2843.941,"Although there's--and you'd say anybody who came--would certainly have protection if he came and said, ""By the way, I want to run for office."
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2845.537,2845.788,Yes.
1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2859.85,2866.913,"Or the fellow who says, ""I want to run for office or I want to go to college, and help me along; I have a few magazines I'm selling."""
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2866.913,2869.958,I would not--I would not necessarily espouse that person's--
1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2869.958,2870.665,"Well, why not?"
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2870.665,2870.869,--on a First Amendment--
1979.78-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2870.869,2872.114,Why not?
1979.78-1335,1,36710,milton_i_shadur,,2880.721,2896.47,"I think, Your Honor, that that--that that issue deals more in the area of what has been characterized as commercial speech, on which this Court has told us that First Amendment rights extend, but not necessarily to the same extent."
1979.78-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2922.917,2925.32,Mr. Yarmolinski?
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,2925.32,2929.323,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court"
1979.78-1335,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2973.375,2974.245,National?
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,2974.245,2975.058,National.
1979.78-1335,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2975.058,2976.375,Why do you limit to national?
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,2976.375,2986.23,"I don't limit it to national; I'm simply speaking on behalf of a number of major, national voluntary charitable organizations."
1979.78-1335,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3255.742,3268.334,"So, Mr. Yarmolinski, you would say that if the ordinance requires proof that some of the money went to the purported charitable purposes, it would still be invalid?"
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,3268.334,3288.267,"I would say that if it required that proof for an initial period, it would certainly be invalid because we all know of cases in which validly charitable organizations must spend even more than they can raise, and borrow money, in order to survive for an initial period which may run more than a fiscal year."
1979.78-1335,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3288.267,3311.789,"What if the ordinance required that the--after the first year of operation that the solicitor hand out a card saying that in the past fiscal year X percent was devoted to administrative expense, and X percent was devoted to the ultimate purposes?"
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,3311.789,3317.437,I believe that that would almost certainly be a valid constitutional ordinance.
1979.78-1335,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3378.033,3388.501,How about a statement that as a solicitor of CBE I receive $8.50 an hour for my work?
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,3388.501,3392.8,I can't see any constitutional objection to that requirement.
1979.78-1335,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3397.311,3398.226,Unless it gets into the--?
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,3398.226,3403.794,"Into the patchwork problem, the problem of how do you get the word around to all your solicitors."
1979.78-1335,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3446.858,3457.269,How about a limitation that such solicitations could be made only between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m.
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,3457.269,3467.463,"I think that that would probably be an unreasonable provision, because it would not appear to be related to safety or privacy."
1979.78-1335,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3467.463,3468.351,Why not?
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,3468.351,3470.732,Between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m.
1979.78-1335,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3470.732,3471.65,Yes.
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,3476.057,3478.602,"I thought you said, could be made only between 7 and 9 p.m."
1979.78-1335,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3478.602,3488.459,That solicitation would be only between those two hours when presumably the man of the house is home and the people are still awake and it isn't too late to call for help.
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,3488.459,3490.655,"Well, I guess I was thinking of it the other way around."
1979.78-1335,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3490.655,3492.716,"No, no, just two hours a day."
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,3492.716,3499.208,That it was more dangerous to entertain solicitors after dark than before dark.
1979.78-1335,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3508.821,3526.744,"But your basic First Amendment argument, I take it, is that there is an underlying First Amendment argument to go out and abroad and solicit support both financial and all other areas of support from all persons except those who forbid it in some way."
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,3526.744,3531.362,"Yes, but only, Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of charities; not--"
1979.78-1335,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3531.362,3531.92,Yes.
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,3531.92,3535.385,Not on behalf of--not by the person who's putting himself through college.
1979.78-1335,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3535.385,3541.096,"Not the way they do it at the airport, where the solicitors are soliciting largely for themselves?"
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,3541.096,3542.612,"Well, I won't comment on that."
1979.78-1335,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3542.612,3546.358,What's the matter with the individual who's putting himself through college?
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,3546.358,3546.922,Because--
1979.78-1335,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3546.922,3549.17,Or getting money to publish his book.
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,3551.256,3558.463,"Now, I believe, Mr. Justice White, that this is again one of those balancing questions."
1979.78-1335,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3559.353,3561.967,So you'd balance him out?
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,3561.967,3564.674,I suspect that you would balance him out.
1979.78-1335,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3564.674,3569.678,"Well, the First Amendment doesn't--refer especially to charities, does it?"
1979.78-1335,2,17290,adam_yarmolinski,,3569.678,3580.353,"No, but the First Amendment has been restricted--has been interpreted not to be a completely unrestricted opportunity."
1979.78-1335,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3613.271,3616.3,"Thank you, Mr. Yarmolinski."
1979.78-1335,3,32994,jack_m_siegel,,3616.3,3631.329,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think it's quite clear from the remarks of my opponents that they think the charities are entitled to some specific protection, which I do not read in the First Amendment."
1979.78-1335,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3677.732,3685.058,What would you say about an ordinance that totally prohibited charitable solicitation in the Village?
1979.78-1335,3,32994,jack_m_siegel,,3685.058,3688.517,"Your Honor, I don't find anything in the First Amendment that would prohibit that."
1979.78-1335,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3688.517,3690.286,"You'd think that ordinance would be valid, in other words?"
1979.78-1335,3,32994,jack_m_siegel,,3690.286,3692.224,"Yes, sir, I do."
1979.78-1335,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3722.345,3724.393,"Just the Girl Scouts cookies, apparently."
1979.78-1335,3,32994,jack_m_siegel,,3724.393,3724.702,Pardon me?
1979.78-1335,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3724.702,3726.056,I guess the Girl Scouts can solicit?
1979.78-1335,3,32994,jack_m_siegel,,3726.056,3727.853,"Girl Scouts are fine, Your Honor."
1979.78-1335,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3727.853,3731.14,"I don't see how they comply with the ordinance, though, because they've got to pay for the cookies."
1979.78-1335,3,32994,jack_m_siegel,,3731.14,3731.857,They do.
1979.78-1335,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3731.857,3733.686,And those would be administrative expenses.
1979.78-1335,3,32994,jack_m_siegel,,3733.686,3735.522,"Well, they--they--they--they serve--"
1979.78-1335,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3735.522,3737.604,Maybe you make an exception for them?
1979.78-1335,3,32994,jack_m_siegel,,3737.604,3739.082,"We don't make any exceptions; no, Your Honor."
1979.78-1335,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3739.082,3749.78,"It would follow from your position that an ordinance which prohibited, absolutely and totally, all door-to-door solicitation for any purpose would be valid."
1979.78-1335,3,32994,jack_m_siegel,,3755.859,3758.079,"Your Honor, I mean as far as the First Amendment was concerned."
1979.78-1335,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3760.185,3761.059,Such as?
1979.78-1335,3,32994,jack_m_siegel,,3761.059,3772.376,"Well, I think if it was drafted in such a way as to make distinctions, if it was an outright prohibition, I suspect it would probably not violate the First Amendment."
1979.78-1335,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3921.021,3921.676,"Thank you, gentlemen."
