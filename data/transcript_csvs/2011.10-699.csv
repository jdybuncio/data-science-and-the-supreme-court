2011.10-699,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-699, Zivotofsky v. Clinton."
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,10.189,13.141,"Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-699,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,58.27,61.639,"Well, Mr. Lewin, what power is Congress exercising here?"
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,61.639,76.231,"Justice Kagan, Congress has exercised its power over passport, the issuance of passports under the immigration, naturalization and foreign commerce powers that Congress has."
2011.10-699,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,88.558,89.308,What--
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,89.308,90.658,--how the application is to be made.
2011.10-699,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,93.51,94.193,--Do you--
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,94.193,95.045,--portion of the passport.
2011.10-699,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,95.045,99.247,--Do you think it's relevant that the title of section 214 is
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,103.751,117.891,"Well, we think -- and we have cited I guess in footnote 2 of our brief a number of recent cases of this Court that have said that you take each statutory provision independently and determine its constitutionality."
2011.10-699,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,142.123,148.161,"But you say, Mr. Lewin, that -- you are not claiming exclusivity in Congress."
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,162.92,186.119,"--Because -- precisely because under the standard of the steel seizure case and this tripartite scheme, if Congress determines that what the President has done -- and this is a statute which is really very narrow and deals with past conduct by the Executive Branch, as it were."
2011.10-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,189.654,194.273,"Well, under your -- under your theory, and this is just a following on Justice Ginsburg's question, I think."
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,200.461,205.08,Foreign relations determinations are not left to the President alone.
2011.10-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,205.08,211.667,Are there any foreign relations determinations that are for the President alone to make under your theory of the case?
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,211.667,214.019,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,214.019,214.369,And those are?
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,214.369,217.488,Those are diplomatic communications.
2011.10-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,219.507,220.907,"In other words, who gets the telegram?"
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,220.907,235.2,"--Well, who issues the communication to the foreign government, who determines; there are certain things that the President alone does because he's the one who implements foreign policy."
2011.10-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,235.2,246.174,"Is there any treatise writer or decision of this Court that supports such a narrow, crabbed interpretation of the President's foreign affairs power?"
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,246.174,249.359,"Well, with all respect, Justice Kennedy, we don't think it's crabbed."
2011.10-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,260.184,260.667,Of course--
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,277.295,286.067,--I don't know whether it's limited to the assumption with regard to the congressional statute.
2011.10-699,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,308.398,308.765,Mr.--
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,308.765,309.517,--policy has been.
2011.10-699,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,309.517,315.319,"--Mr. Lewin, you were cut off earlier when you were saying this reading doesn't hobble the President in the future."
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,338.267,339.286,If--
2011.10-699,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,339.286,343.488,Or does he have to wait for Congress to change the law?
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,343.488,347.54,--I think he does have to wait for Congress to change the law.
2011.10-699,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,347.54,353.962,So you are hobbling the President with respect to situations that occur frequently--
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,353.962,354.996,Well--
2011.10-699,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,354.996,358.513,"--as happened in Egypt, sometimes overnight."
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,358.513,375.975,"--No, but it may in some way, in a very remote possible way -- I mean, I think under those circumstances, if there were a peace treaty and if Jerusalem were handed over to a Palestinian state, I think Congress would repeal the statute."
2011.10-699,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,389.885,395.206,The Constitution requires ambassadors to be appointed with the consent of the Senate.
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,440.067,456.177,"With all respect, Justice Sotomayor, I think history demonstrates that that's simply not true, that in fact Congress has had equal, quote, ""recognition power"", if in fact that's a power rather than a ceremonial duty."
2011.10-699,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,472.539,477.758,"Mr. Lewin, this gets back to the question of exactly what congressional power you are basing your argument on."
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,491.433,491.967,No.
2011.10-699,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,503.908,526.69,Does that go the full length of saying if Congress passed a law that says the United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and Jerusalem must be designated as the capital of Israel in all official documents -- suppose that were the law.
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,533.26,536.046,We say Congress has that authority.
2011.10-699,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,567.398,578.123,"Mr. Lewin, you're -- it seems to me you are not arguing for a co-equal congressional power, you are arguing for a superior congressional power."
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,631.155,638.161,We are not -- the Court is not being asked to determine what is the better foreign policy position.
2011.10-699,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.878,641.363,"Congress is supreme, then?"
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,647.017,650.551,"--No, there is two aspects to this, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-699,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,682.523,692.211,"Well, Medellin involved a situation where the President's purported exercise of authority changed domestic law, and not simply domestic law, but domestic State law."
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,695.497,715.827,"But what -- again, what Justice Jackson said was that when there -- the two are incompatible, then you look, the Court looks and scrutinizes, ""subjects to scrutiny"" -- those words are in Justice Jackson's standard -- scrutinizes what the President has done."
2011.10-699,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,767.026,775.096,So you were suggesting that the outcome of this if Congress said Jerusalem is rea.
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,775.096,778.898,"I say it's a different case, yes, absolutely."
2011.10-699,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,787.919,789.938,Why is it -- why is it a different case?
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,789.938,797.342,"It's a different case because if it were to say ""Jerusalem, Israel"" there would be more of an argument."
2011.10-699,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,807.567,816.589,So would there be -- there would be a greater concern -- the concern on the part of the executive that there would be adverse political reaction would have a greater degree of credibility?
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,816.589,818.306,Somewhat greater degree.
2011.10-699,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,818.673,826.194,So we are supposed to decide whether or not the executive is correct in saying that it's a significant problem.
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,830.33,836.4,"--No, I don't think the Court is being asked to decide a question of foreign policy."
2011.10-699,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,893.923,901.827,"I don't see Justice Jackson's analysis -- what he's saying, and I guess I don't think it's as controlling as others might."
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,904.98,905.646,Yes.
2011.10-699,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,905.646,907.446,When there's -- when they agree it's an easy case.
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,913.134,928.596,"Well, because he says that when it's in the third category the Court has an obligation under those circumstances if it's going to keep the equilibrium of the balance of powers, to look at what the President's justification is."
2011.10-699,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,948.773,952.109,What -- what were we scrutinizing in the steel seizure case?
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,952.109,975.041,"I think in the steel seizure case the Court was scrutinizing whether, notwithstanding the fact that Congress did not give the President the power to seize steel mills, nonetheless whether there could be some justification that, even in contrary to Congress's wishes, the President would be able to exercise that power."
2011.10-699,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,975.041,980.612,"And what presidential power would have supported that, the war power?"
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,980.612,987.8,Possibly the claim that as Commander in Chief in the time of the Korean War he would be able--
2011.10-699,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,987.8,988.017,Right.
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,990.017,992.019,--Entitled him to.
2011.10-699,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,992.019,995.554,--required that these -- that these companies remain in business.
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1000.108,1006.262,"I think the Court concluded that no, that did not justify the exercise of the President's power even though it was--"
2011.10-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1006.262,1012.75,But that wasn't a case -- that wasn't a case in which the Congress had said you may not seize mills.
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1016.518,1020.189,"--Well, but that's -- that's an a fortiori situation, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1027.509,1030.227,It is if you assume that the statute is valid.
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1030.227,1038.317,"--Well, but the statute in this case -- again I come back to the fact that the statute in this case is a passport statute."
2011.10-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1038.317,1040.852,If the statute is invalid we are in category one.
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1040.852,1042.435,Yes.
2011.10-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1042.435,1042.835,Or two.
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1042.835,1047.839,But the statute in this case is on its face a passport statute.
2011.10-699,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1048.839,1049.708,But it's a passport statute that--
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1049.708,1050.391,--It's an identification.
2011.10-699,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1050.391,1050.758,--I'm sorry.
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1072.454,1076.089,"I think you are wrong on that, Let me explain why."
2011.10-699,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1126.522,1136.711,"Are you suggesting Congress enacted this because they thought that if these individuals' passports simply said ""Jerusalem"" there would be an identification problem?"
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1136.711,1141.698,"Not be -- Justice Alito, it is not because there would be an identification problem."
2011.10-699,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1186.025,1187.142,"That might be true, Mr. Lewin."
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1218.096,1224.833,"--I think that what you said the statute doesn't say, Justice Kagan, is exactly what the statute does say."
2011.10-699,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1238.657,1240.693,"Well, you have to be very old to say Palestine."
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1240.693,1241.876,Pardon?
2011.10-699,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1241.876,1242.961,Not all that old.
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1245.411,1260.339,It's -- I guess it's a reflection on my own seniority that -- it's my generation that fits into that.
2011.10-699,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1284.287,1289.406,But it's recognizing that principle only with respect to a particular jurisdiction.
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1297.362,1307.986,"No, but an American citizen born in Taiwan apparently does have that option, even the though the United States says we don't recognize Taiwan as an independent country."
2011.10-699,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1307.986,1316.509,"And your -- and your friend on behalf of the United States says that's because of a State Department judgment that in one situation it's significant, in the other it's not."
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1316.509,1319.226,"Well, no, it's not just because."
2011.10-699,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1342.474,1349.73,"--But a personal identification choice can also have significant foreign policy implications, can it not?"
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1376.464,1401.596,"I have to say that, given this Court's view about Congress's power with regard to A-passports -- and again, I go back to the fact that in Zemel and Rusk, in Haig and Agee, in Kent v. Dulles, in all these passport cases this Court said we look to see whether what the President does is authorized by Congress, whether implicitly or otherwise."
2011.10-699,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1446.643,1446.994,"Well, what is--"
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1446.994,1448.927,--and this has to do with the contents of the passport.
2011.10-699,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1448.927,1456.749,"--Mr. Lewin, what you've argued is that you are skipping over the question that the D.C. Circuit decided."
2011.10-699,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1464.022,1471.176,Our view is it's not a political question because it is like many other questions that affect foreign policy.
2011.10-699,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1519.107,1519.69,"Thank you, Mr. Lewin."
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1525.661,1532.166,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-699,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1575.076,1575.693,Your friend--
2011.10-699,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1575.693,1576.195,"Well, the--"
2011.10-699,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1576.195,1590.503,"--Your friend documented contrary history at some length in his reply brief, where from the beginning at least as he says through the McKinley Administration, the two branches acted as if they had co-equal authority."
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1590.503,1599.442,"Mr. Chief Justice, if I might spend a minute or two on that history, because I don't think it shows what my friend suggests that it does."
2011.10-699,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1658.932,1667.253,Has there ever been an instance in which the President has recognized a foreign government over Congress's sustained objection?
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1667.253,1673.173,I don't -- I can't think of an instance of Congress's sustained objection.
2011.10-699,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1695.655,1717.436,"What would have been the reasons that -- because your friend says that this is an a fortiori case from everything, because all of these words -- every time the word ""exclusive power"" has appeared in any source -- I think that's what you are saying -- it is meant that the President can act without supporting authority from Congress."
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1734.58,1734.797,Yes.
2011.10-699,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1738.182,1738.801,Uh-huh.
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1738.801,1755.244,"It is true that the Court has never before, with respect to the recognition power, confronted the question of whether the President is free to act in a manner different than a congressional command because Congress has never purported to issue a command."
2011.10-699,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1793.602,1798.654,"All right now, but my question is what leads you to that conclusion."
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1798.654,1799.589,"Well, let me--"
2011.10-699,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1799.589,1808.778,"There are very, very few cases I can ever think of where -- where the President -- where the Court has said the President can act contrary to a statute."
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1816.116,1824.371,"--So, I do think, if I could -- I think it would be helpful in answering your question, Justice Breyer, if I could return to the Chief Justice's question about history."
2011.10-699,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1916.747,1932.676,"--The two examples you are given in the brief, one of Texas, where Petitioner says there was a case where Congress went for -- Congress recognized and the President acquiesced, and the same thing with Taiwan; it was a statute and the President implemented it."
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1941.198,1946.983,--I would like to address Texas because I do think that's probably the most significant example that my friend's identified.
2011.10-699,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2032.755,2038.259,"Counsel, if I could just stop you and just have you address the political question doctrine."
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2038.259,2039.425,Certainly.
2011.10-699,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2039.425,2045.413,You say this is exclusively committed to the President and therefore it is a non-justiciable political question.

2011.10-699,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2098.381,2098.998,Why not all the way?
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2127.9,2143.327,"--Well, the -- I do think that with respect to the first Baker v. Carr factor, textual commitment is a factor that the Court has indicated is one that can lead to the conclusion that it's a political question."
2011.10-699,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2149.647,2151.647,"Well, doesn't it depend on what the question is."
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2184.135,2195.593,"--No, Justice Alito, we don't -- we think Powell v. McCormick and Nixon say that the question of -- not just the question of commitment, but also the question of scope, are questions for the Court to decide."
2011.10-699,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2236.42,2243.693,"Suppose, General Verrilli, suppose that this statute, there was a -- the section that's there now and then there was another section, and the section said:"
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2253.714,2257.766,"I don't think it would change the analysis, Justice Kagan."
2011.10-699,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2266.706,2268.206,"No, my statute has a title which says"

2011.10-699,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2299.843,2300.26,"General, what is--"
2011.10-699,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2300.26,2306.181,That seems to me different than the rationale of the D.C. Circuit.
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2308.616,2308.966,"--No, we--"
2011.10-699,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2308.966,2309.816,--that there's no jurisdiction.
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2325.745,2330.462,"--Well, we think -- we do think that if there is jurisdiction, the President wins."
2011.10-699,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2336.933,2354.728,"Because if this -- if this rationale remains the law and is the law, then you have the specter of constant legislative determinations that are not clearly -- not clearly invalid."
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2361.834,2364.536,"--Well, we appreciate that, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-699,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2378.61,2379.129,What if--
2011.10-699,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2379.129,2379.562,--General--
2011.10-699,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2379.562,2395.472,"--What if Congress's statute said: What you must put on the passport, if requested, is ""Israel"", parentheses, ""Disputed"", close parentheses, which would seem to take care of your objection that people are going to look at this and draw a false conclusion."

2011.10-699,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2409.981,2414.2,"It is the position of the administration, isn't it, that the status of Jerusalem is disputed?"
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2414.2,2428.443,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but it -- what the United States says about that in official communications -- and remember, a passport is not a communication by the passport holder."
2011.10-699,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2433.847,2442.136,So what if Congress says in the place that you have it: This person has the choice of whether or not to put Jerusalem or Israel.
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2450.475,2452.208,"Same problem, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-699,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2452.76,2453.11,Really?
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2472.472,2480.328,--I do think that this is an area in which the executive's got to make the judgment because it's of paramount importance that the nation speak with one voice.
2011.10-699,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2480.328,2492.302,"Then, Mister -- General Verrilli, then you are taking the position that this is not a shared authority; it's an exclusive authority; that there is no role for Congress."
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2498.889,2505.895,"Our position, Justice Ginsburg, is that the recognition power is exclusive to the President."
2011.10-699,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2505.895,2521.922,What if -- what if the recognition of a breakaway province of a foreign country by the United States will clearly provoke a war with that country.
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2538.366,2545.187,"I think, Justice Scalia, that's a situation in which the President would exercise that recognition power very carefully--"
2011.10-699,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2545.187,2545.57,"No, no."
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2553.293,2566.434,"--I think -- although I don't -- I just don't think that in a situation like that, the President would exercise a recognition power, but if -- but if the President did, it's the President's judgment to make."
2011.10-699,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.319,2572.504,Please stay on this.
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2627.007,2635.177,"--I -- I think with respect to the question of recognition, Justice Scalia, that it is a power that rests with the executive."
2011.10-699,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2668.581,2669.598,I didn't hear the third.
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2669.598,2671.0,--The need for secrecy.
2011.10-699,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2701.786,2707.256,"General Verrilli, is the textural basis for your argument that the President has exclusive power here?"
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2728.087,2731.889,"So -- here's our position on that, Justice Kagan."
2011.10-699,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2751.702,2752.485,"Well, it's the best there is."
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2758.789,2760.058,--It is there.
2011.10-699,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2760.058,2761.275,"Well, it is there."
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2761.275,2779.202,"And I would say in addition -- I would say in addition, to the extent that there is a question, we do think, as I think we indicated in our brief, that -- that one can see this power as part of what the Court in Garamendi described as the vast share of responsibility that the Constitution assigns to the executive."
2011.10-699,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2787.625,2792.546,"So if that provision were not in the Constitution, would you be making the same argument you are now?"
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2792.546,2803.337,"--If the reception clause were not in the Constitution -- but we had the same history that we have now and the same functional considerations about the need for it being in the control of the executive, yes, we would."
2011.10-699,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2803.337,2810.658,There are many things that Congress could do to frustrate the President's decision to recognize another country.
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2831.154,2838.843,The -- I think that there would be a difference between -- I -- I think that -- that Congress has authority over appropriations.

2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2906.654,2911.523,We -- we don't think that the -- the entire content of passports is an exclusive power.
2011.10-699,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2958.086,2961.205,I just want -- I don't want the time to elapse.
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3044.608,3052.946,"--Well, we do think -- that's -- that's what -- we think that the appropriate inquiry for political question purposes is into the relief that the Petitioner is seeking."
2011.10-699,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3071.26,3073.01,But that is -- that presents a merits determination.

2011.10-699,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3120.406,3140.487,"--General, the -- the tension that I see here, and I think it's what Justice Breyer's getting at, is the label's important, because if we call this a political question and don't address the merits, the outcome is that the President is saying that he's entitled to ignore the Congress."
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3169.137,3169.756,"--Well, I--"

2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3174.375,3199.192,"--I think, Justice Sotomayor, it's actually quite narrow, and the problem isn't a significant one in the case of textual commitment, because the Court does in reaching the conclusion, as the D.C. Circuit did, that it's a political question the Court does have to decide whether there is a textual commitment to the executive here, so the Court would resolve that question."
2011.10-699,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3207.012,3208.131,And what you told--
2011.10-699,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3208.131,3208.748,--But that's not what the D.C. Circuit did.

2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3220.439,3223.974,But I -- I didn't mean that it it wouldn't be a textual commitment.
2011.10-699,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3232.478,3233.246,That sounds to me like not in the text.
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3233.246,3240.399,"Well, I think it's the historical gloss on the vesting power is -- functions as has the equivalent of the specific textual commitment."
2011.10-699,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3243.618,3249.589,This textual commitment applies when somebody comes to the Court and asks for the Court to make the decision.
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3285.028,3299.372,"--Well, as I said earlier, I tried to say, we think that the -- the announcement of the political question doctrine goes a very long way towards answering that question, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-699,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3335.461,3338.33,I will give you a couple more minutes.
2011.10-699,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3340.015,3342.567,"Yes, I -- I wanted to follow up on that."
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3364.314,3365.749,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-699,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3366.949,3370.118,You are asking us to decide the question that it is exclusively the presidential power.
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3370.118,3370.984,--Yes.
2011.10-699,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3371.57,3376.438,"That doesn't sound to me like -- you know, like abstaining because it's a political question."
2011.10-699,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3378.14,3380.973,Do you want to answer?
2011.10-699,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3380.973,3391.781,"We -- we do think that the -- whether the Court is looking at it as a political question or whether the Court is looking at it as a judgment of the merits, the issue is textual commitment."

2011.10-699,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3685.806,3695.245,"I think Congress has to weigh that; and if Congress determines that in any event this is what the passport should say, then that is Congress--"
2011.10-699,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3695.245,3697.947,--So it's not the misperception that's at issue.
2011.10-699,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3697.947,3698.914,"--Well, in this case--"
