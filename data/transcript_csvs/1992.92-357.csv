1992.92-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.294,"We'll hear argument now in No. 92-357, Ruth O. Shaw v. Janet Reno."
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,10.043,18.853,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,99.617,101.507,Are you talking about the United States Attorney General?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,101.507,102.038,Yessiree.
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,108.581,111.08,Did he... the federal statute?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,111.08,113.392,He was relying on the Voting Rights Act.
1992.92-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,203.887,207.291,There are only five counties in which there's a majority of white persons?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,207.291,208.557,--Of black persons.
1992.92-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,208.557,209.041,Of black persons?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,209.041,210.306,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.92-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,278.404,279.389,"Mr. Everett, could I interrupt you?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,287.042,295.023,--It violates every principle except the principle of giving a majority... to preselecting--
1992.92-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,295.023,297.475,How about the one person/one vote principle?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,297.475,299.022,--It does not violate the one person/one vote.
1992.92-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,299.459,301.474,Tell me what principle does it violate.
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,301.474,304.316,"Well, it violates the principles of compactness."
1992.92-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,304.316,306.361,But are they constitutional principles?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,306.361,325.636,"We would submit that compactness and seeking a community of interest is a constitutional principle and that at least... put it this way, Your Honor... that it is not permissible to disregard everything else for the sole purpose of targeting that the seat will have a person of a particular race."
1992.92-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,325.636,331.212,"Is... when you say everything else, do you include anything other than compactness in the concept of everything else?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,331.212,332.788,"Well, I include contiguousness."
1992.92-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,334.288,336.991,"Well, but this district is entirely contiguous, isn't it?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,336.991,341.146,"--Well, they're contiguous in a very marginal sense of the word."
1992.92-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,341.707,343.254,"But it is entirely contiguous, is--"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,343.254,365.276,"--Contiguous... I think actually, Your Honor, one of the districts is cut in the middle by District 12, but we would view contiguousness as meaning more than a contact at a point so that we would suggest that if there's any significance to contiguousness other than, say, a point... one point where there is an infinitesimal contact, that it violates contiguousness."
1992.92-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.496,410.132,"--Well, Mr. Everett, I guess this Court summarily affirmed in a previous case that came before us raising just these points."
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,410.132,413.428,"Well, Your Honor, we think that we came at it from an entirely different viewpoint."
1992.92-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,452.974,457.925,"Well, that brings us back to the point Justice Stevens was beginning to discuss with you."
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,463.532,471.389,We would think there are some limitations even on how far the State can go in rejecting the principle of compactness.
1992.92-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,485.665,494.192,"Well, isn't that your basic point, Mr. Everett, that that sort of intent or motivation on the part of the legislature is subject to strict scrutiny?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,494.192,496.004,"Exactly, exactly."
1992.92-357,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,496.004,508.031,"So that your argument really isn't... does not rest, I take it, at any point on the fact that any of these other principles have been mandated either by the authority of this Court or by any other authority that we would have to recognize."
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,515.073,520.666,"That's the key to it, Justice Souter, that it rests on the motivation."
1992.92-357,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,535.003,537.892,But none of them has independent constitutional significance.
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,537.892,546.265,--We would think that is... that the motivation is the independent constitutional grounds for invalidating it.
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,573.393,584.639,Would you say... let's just assume for the moment that the Voting Rights Act either authorizes exactly what was done here or required what was done here.
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,587.935,590.699,--If it required--
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,590.699,592.152,How about authorizes it?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,592.152,602.867,"--We would say that if it authorized the legislature to act with that intent and if, in fact, the legislature acted with that intent, that then it would be unconstitutional."
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,602.867,611.19,"Well, how much of North Carolina is the kind of State that the Voting Rights Act applies to?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,611.19,612.581,40 counties.
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,618.313,625.186,"So, you don't deny that you xx to have preclearance for this redistricting."
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,625.186,631.449,"--Preclearance was required, but as we understand it, preclearance does not change the basic rules."
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.51,636.869,"No, no."
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,642.117,646.616,"Well, we think he was wrong even at the outset--"
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,646.616,646.802,Yes.
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,646.802,647.771,--that he was wrong at an earlier stage--
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,647.771,648.333,Yes.
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,648.333,652.035,--in requiring that there be the majority-minority districts.
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.163,693.3,But if the Attorney General... don't we have to decide here whether the Attorney General was... construction of the Voting Rights Act was correct or not?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,693.3,694.423,"In a sense, you do--"
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,694.423,695.079,"Well, in a sense."
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,696.36,697.937,--I'll say yes.
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,699.374,700.312,We have to decide--
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,700.312,700.624,--because--
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,700.624,705.419,"--And to... for you to win, we have to decide that he construed the act wrong."
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,705.419,707.591,"--No, I don't think... I would disagree with you on that."
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,707.591,707.997,Why?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,707.997,709.48,I think as a preliminary point--
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,709.48,710.043,How does that work?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,710.043,726.941,"--Well, to focus on the issue that the Court presented, the legislature, after the refusal of preclearance, then went ahead and with reckless abandon drew something that apparently was not in line with the suggestions of the Attorney General so that--"
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.941,734.564,"Well, the Attorney General suggested that the State needed to have another majority-minority district--"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,734.564,735.469,--They did.
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,735.469,742.935,"--and pointed out that it might... one might be created in, what, the southeast corner?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,742.935,744.341,"In the southeast, yes."
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,744.341,745.466,The southeast corner of the State?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,756.086,757.648,Before we could get preclearance--
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,757.648,757.945,Is that right?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,757.945,760.1,--we had to have two districts.
1992.92-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,769.003,776.517,"Mr. Everett, what's the effect of the Voting Rights Act by its terms where 40 out of 100 counties are covered?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,776.517,791.009,"Well, we would contend that there is a requirement of preclearance admittedly, but that a plan which burdens the areas that are not subject to preclearance and unduly burdens them is unconstitutional."
1992.92-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.009,797.084,Supposing you were to draw a district that was entirely in areas that were not subject to preclearance.
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,799.881,807.191,"We would say it would not, that it should be separated... that there would be no nexus between any violation and the purported corrective action."
1992.92-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,807.191,815.905,But are all of the counties which are the subject of this district which you're complaining about... are they all subject to preclearance?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,815.905,818.592,"Relatively few of them are, as a matter of fact."
1992.92-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,818.592,822.262,"So, many of the counties in this district are not subject to preclearance?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,822.262,828.15,"A number of them that are in the 12th district, which is the one we are particularly focusing on, are not subject to preclearance."
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,854.64,859.919,"Well, was this... this was a three-judge court, wasn't it?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,859.919,860.997,--It was a three-judge court.
1992.92-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,860.997,869.525,Was this issue brought before it about whether or not that 12th district was subject to preclearance at all?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,869.525,890.283,"Well, we brought up that... and we've consistently taken the position that to manipulate the preclearance requirement for the 40 counties, primarily in the northeast, as a basis for covering the entire State with a plan which is racially discriminatory, at least as we interpret it, is beyond the purview of the Voting Rights."
1992.92-357,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,904.354,921.238,"Well, Mr. Everett, do I understand your argument here to be that the problem is not race consciousness as such in drawing lines, it's the specificity of the race consciousness in saying, in effect, that there must be a quota of two districts?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,921.238,922.863,That is basically it.
1992.92-357,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,922.863,935.31,"Well, how then do... how do you draw the line on your theory between what is a permissible use of race consciousness in this kind of districting or redistricting and what is impermissible?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,938.465,944.244,The principle to some extent can be related to factors such as those in the Gingles case.
1992.92-357,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,958.27,971.89,"Well, what about a case like this in which you're not so much breaking apart a district in which a violation has occurred, you've simply got to come up with another district and, as a consequence, essentially a whole new configuration?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,989.913,996.504,--We think that would at least be one dividing line and one that would not permit what has been done here.
1992.92-357,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1011.389,1030.178,"What if the Attorney General had suggested in this case not that there should be a second district, minority-majority district, but that it would be permissible to have two, and he would like to know why two had not been proposed?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1036.41,1039.519,--We think even that goes too far.
1992.92-357,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1039.519,1068.116,"I guess the trouble I'm having is you accept the principle that there can be some race consciousness, but I don't understand how you are willing to let that principle be applied in a concrete way at every point at which we or somebody might suggest, well, taking race into account, this might be a permissible way to do it or, a second step, this is probably the only permissible way to do it."
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1075.691,1088.326,"Well, our line is in terms of whether there is something very specifically that was done contrary to the interests of the minority, breaking up a natural community of interest--"
1992.92-357,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1088.326,1096.87,"But there again we're getting back to, it seems to me, to criteria which you conceded a while ago did not themselves have any independent constitutional significance."
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1120.547,1131.169,--I think it may be a situation where you look at a number of factors and decide whether the paramount purpose was to achieve a particular result.
1992.92-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1132.185,1132.747,Mr. Everett--
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1146.086,1146.351,--That's--
1992.92-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1146.351,1148.148,--that you could right that wrong.
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1155.425,1174.074,"--Well, I perhaps misspoke myself earlier because I was thinking of the corrective situation where something has been done on racial grounds adverse to a minority group as, for example, breaking apart a community of minority persons into two districts and thereby basically diluting the vote."
1992.92-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1179.931,1190.241,"Well, Mr. Everett, I mean, you say community of... communities of interest can be taken into account, but doesn't that necessarily mean that racial groups can be taken into account as well?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1203.015,1206.686,"I'm thinking of a community, a racial community, let's say, a neighborhood."
1992.92-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1206.686,1207.826,Right.
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1207.826,1212.451,But it's not predicated on the stereotype that one black--
1992.92-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.451,1212.84,Yes.
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1216.776,1217.573,--That's exactly it.
1992.92-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1217.573,1228.318,"--that assuming that all black people will vote for a black representative, and therefore drawing a district with a certain number of blacks in it on the assumption that since they're black, they will vote for a black representative."
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1238.752,1240.657,"Justice Souter, that's exactly it."
1992.92-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1252.59,1259.494,"Well, is that any different from an assumption that an Irish Catholic will vote like another Irish Catholic and they're more apt to vote Democratic than Republican, say?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1259.494,1261.915,"Well, it... there may be--"
1992.92-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1261.915,1264.242,And what is the difference between the two situations?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1264.242,1269.911,"--There may be communities of interest, but I think that basically our Constitution has set its face against the racial stereotype."
1992.92-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1269.911,1271.971,"Well, how about religious stereotypes?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1278.782,1282.688,"If there were an assumption made of that sort, I think it would be equally--"
1992.92-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1282.688,1284.264,"Well, there was in the U.J.O. case I think."
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1284.264,1285.67,--I'm sorry?
1992.92-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1286.061,1289.279,"Remember the U.J.O. case, United Jewish Organization case?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1289.279,1296.494,"--In the U.J.O. case, I don't think there was an assumption that the Hasidic Jews will all vote as a community."
1992.92-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1308.364,1314.986,"Well, what about drawing lines based on registered Republicans as opposed to registered Democrats, making an assumption they'll vote with the party?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1316.439,1318.798,"Well, I think... that's... you can change parties."
1992.92-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1322.905,1327.123,"No, but you make a stereotypical assumption that they won't change for the next election when you draw your lines."
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1330.667,1337.336,"Well, it would seem to us that the political gerrymandering has been treated by the Court different than the racially... racial gerrymandering."
1992.92-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.231,1368.746,"And, in fact, we know they don't always vote that way, just as we know that Republicans don't always vote for Republican candidates."
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1369.401,1372.634,"They don't always vote that way, but this is an encouragement to do so."
1992.92-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1376.945,1378.928,Does the Voting Rights Act apply to Republicans?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1378.928,1381.849,Not to the best of my knowledge.
1992.92-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1381.849,1382.677,It deals with racial--
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1399.529,1402.34,"Well, I suppose they could delimit."
1992.92-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1412.556,1425.036,"We've also said in some of our reapportionment cases, haven't we, that legislative lines drawn on the basis of party interests are not... don't violate any constitutional--"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1425.036,1427.768,--That has been my assumption from your opinions.
1992.92-357,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1500.988,1504.8,"--Mr. Everett, just one last point to make sure I understand your principle."
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1515.701,1522.838,"Well, I think we are still standing on the principle of the color-blind Constitution in terms of inveighing against--"
1992.92-357,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1522.838,1530.946,Do you want us to... do we overrule... do we say that the possibility applying a Gingles analysis cannot be anticipated in redistricting?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1530.946,1538.676,"--Well, the Gingles analysis, if it were applied in this particular instance, would not permit the sort of result that was achieved here."
1992.92-357,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1538.676,1559.201,But you... but is it fair to say that you accept the principle that redistricting can be done on the basis of trying to anticipate the possibility of a Gingles violation and to avoid it by drawing lines in such a way as to avoid voter dilution?
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1561.027,1572.272,I believe we would accept that there can be an effort to avoid any future dilution so long as it is not done with a view to having a particular person elected of a particular race.
1992.92-357,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1572.585,1576.584,"But in any case, that's not a principle of a color-blind constitution, is it?"
1992.92-357,0,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1576.584,1594.841,"--Well, that may not be in one sense, but certainly, as we view it, some of the basic concept of ignoring racial stereotypes... that we view as an essential to the color-blind Constitution, and that we think is the principle that has been violated here."
1992.92-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1596.404,1597.451,"Thank you, Mr. Everett."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1599.215,1605.383,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1662.174,1669.405,"Do you have a position, Mr. Powell, on the application of the Voting Rights Act when only 40 out of 100 counties are subject to it?"
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1669.405,1672.638,"That question was not, in fact, presented to the district court."
1992.92-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1672.638,1673.748,Do you have a position on it?
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1673.748,1675.183,"We do, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.92-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1675.183,1675.621,"Well, what is it?"
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1675.621,1688.819,"And that is that given the distribution of the counties, it was necessary to preclear the entire plan and that, in fact, the proper focus in this case with the statewide redistricting plan is statewide."
1992.92-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1689.319,1692.38,"Well, way should that be when only 40 counties are subject to preclearance?"
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1692.38,1697.723,"--As the Attorney General administers the statute, he expects the entire plan to be submitted."
1992.92-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1704.814,1709.609,But what's the authority for that in the Voting Rights Act if only 40 counties are covered?
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1709.609,1711.591,"I think it's administrative authority, Your Honor."
1992.92-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1714.247,1716.808,"So, there isn't any authority in the act itself for that?"
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1718.698,1720.213,"I'm not aware of it, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.92-357,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1720.213,1722.758,"I... oh, I'm sorry."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1735.004,1736.503,I think that's--
1992.92-357,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1736.503,1737.628,Is your explanation different from that?
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1737.628,1738.19,--No.
1992.92-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1745.265,1750.452,I'm not sure I understand your... I guess your good faith defense.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1777.597,1778.456,"No, Justice Scalia."
1992.92-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1780.579,1780.954,All right.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1780.954,1781.923,Our position--
1992.92-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1781.923,1791.122,"So, you agree that that defense is only a valid defense if the Justice Department was correct that you needed a second majority-minority district."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1791.122,1804.085,"--Our defense is applicable if our intent was proper, and if our intent would not be proper if the Attorney General instructed the State or attempted to coerce the State into doing something unconstitutional."
1992.92-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1811.614,1823.328,"It may well be, but is it your position that even if it was wrong, so long as you were relying upon that, you are immunized?"
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1823.328,1826.045,So long as the State's reliance is reasonable.
1992.92-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1840.179,1844.038,"The reliance here you say would be a reasonable reliance, whereas in my hypothetical it wouldn't be."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1844.038,1844.725,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1844.725,1853.613,"You say that the Attorney General rested squarely on the Voting Rights Act, and you think that his interpretation was proper of the Voting Rights Act."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1853.613,1854.191,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1854.503,1864.141,And you deny that later decisions such as Voinovich renders his interpretation invalid.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1864.141,1864.781,We do indeed.
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1887.302,1900.235,"But... so, the Attorney General said that the Voting Rights Act required a second district."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1900.235,1901.249,"No, Justice White."
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1902.609,1903.296,What did he say?
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1903.296,1905.967,The Attorney General objected to the State's first plan--
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1905.967,1906.639,Yes.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1906.639,1917.04,--saying that I am not convinced that the State has carried its burden of persuading me that the State's first plan did not have some kind of discriminatory purpose.
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1931.847,1935.283,"And unless you do, you've violated the Voting Rights Act?"
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1935.283,1938.673,--That's not the legal meaning of the Attorney General's objection letter.
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1938.673,1941.187,"Well, I thought you said that it was at least implicit in it."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1941.187,1942.031,It certainly is.
1992.92-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1954.868,1956.712,"Of course, you didn't have to accept his concern."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1962.006,1962.974,"Absolutely not, Justice Scalia."
1992.92-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1962.974,1968.535,You could have gone to the district court in the District of Columbia to say this is wrong.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1968.535,1969.143,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1969.143,1969.878,But you chose not to.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1969.878,1970.784,We certainly... we did--
1992.92-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1970.784,1972.236,Then I don't think you should rely on the Justice Department.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1979.125,1988.168,--Congress has created a statutory scheme under which it is up to the State to decide which route to take in seeking preclearance.
1992.92-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1994.573,1997.274,"He said no, and you were entitled to go somewhere else."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,1998.18,2003.897,"And we submit that we were entitled, in fact, to go back to the Attorney General and to attempt to meet his objections."
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2003.897,2020.61,"Well, yes, but don't you... suppose you had turned... decided that you didn't want a second district and the legislature... well, I'll put it this way."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2030.808,2032.261,"Under section 5, Justice White?"
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2032.261,2032.48,Yes.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2032.48,2032.917,I'm not sure.
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.51,2037.369,"Yes, yes."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2037.369,2041.336,"Under section 5, I'm not sure a private right of action exists."
1992.92-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2066.324,2081.553,"Well, but certainly some of our cases have simply said that an intent to classify on the basis of race... the Croson case, for example... is subject to strict scrutiny, not that it's automatically out, but that it's subject to strict scrutiny."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2081.553,2082.741,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.92-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2099.999,2102.529,"Those were decided before Croson, weren't they?"
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2102.529,2103.592,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2118.336,2122.334,"Well, didn't you say earlier in your remarks that your defense is the Voting Rights Act?"
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2122.334,2129.19,"--Our defense is that the State's purpose here was compliance with the Voting Rights Act, that what the State... what the Attorney General--"
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2129.19,2140.701,What did the Voting Rights Act require that led you to think that you should have a second minority district?
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2140.701,2142.045,--The Voting Rights Act--
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2142.045,2143.418,Don't talk about the Attorney General.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2144.746,2154.821,--The Voting Rights Act requires the State to demonstrate an absence of invidious intent and an absence of retrogressive effect.
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2164.755,2173.766,"And did the Voting Rights Act, therefore, sort of incorporate the constitutional test?"
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2173.766,2175.454,--Certainly.
1992.92-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2181.31,2194.445,"So, if this were a State that were not covered by the Voting Act... Voting Rights Act, would a State legislature be free, as a matter of policy, to draw a district such as this one?"
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2194.445,2196.147,We'd have a very different case.
1992.92-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2207.3,2211.346,"No, but take Justice Kennedy's question just one step further."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2232.853,2233.884,"No, Justice Stevens."
1992.92-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2235.648,2236.07,Why?
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2238.272,2243.707,--There would not be an appropriate basis on which to make use of the racial classification.
1992.92-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2269.12,2281.848,"Well, just sticking for a moment with the hypothetical of the State where the Voting Rights Act is inapplicable, section 5, the only justification for a district of this kind then is that there was racially polarized voting?"
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2281.848,2291.485,"Section 2 might require a State to use majority-minority districts, Justice Kennedy, in order to avoid vote dilution of minority voters."
1992.92-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2291.485,2305.418,"So that a State that has racially polarized voting under the Voting Rights Act, as you are interpreting it, is required to employ methods which will continue racially polarized voting."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2305.418,2308.167,"One hopes not, Your Honor."
1992.92-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2308.167,2312.087,But I thought that's the logical conclusion from your answer.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2312.087,2318.521,Only if the consequences of drawing majority-minority districts is to perpetuate racially polarized voting.
1992.92-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2325.159,2340.356,"So, if a district would either perpetuate or increase the possibilities of racially polarized voting, then the district cannot be drawn consistently with the Constitution based on race?"
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2340.356,2353.634,"The State doesn't act free... xx understand the question correctly, the State doesn't act free of Federal voting rights legislation, and so that even if section 5 were not applicable, the State would... a conscientious State legislature would have to meet the requirements of section 2."
1992.92-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2362.831,2370.157,"Mr. Powell, can... this District 12 is a highly irregular shape."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2371.468,2372.124,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2372.124,2378.7,In places only as wide as a highway and stretching virtually the length of the State.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2388.478,2390.383,"Yes, Your Honor, it could be."
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.232,2423.526,You think the Constitution forbids a State as a matter of policy to have proportional representations between the various races?
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2423.526,2424.916,"No, Your Honor."
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.15,2429.726,You think the State is permitted to do that?
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2429.726,2432.429,The State would have to have a proper basis.
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2433.195,2436.208,"Well, the proper basis is we think there ought to be proportional representation."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2441.627,2442.205,--Gaffney against Cummings.
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2442.58,2446.25,I think I wrote the opinion in the Connecticut case.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2446.25,2447.328,Gaffney against Cummings.
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2447.328,2447.844,Yes.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2447.844,2450.295,"In Gaffney, the Court suggested in--"
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.295,2456.356,"Well, we held that it was all right to give proportional representation to Democrats and Republicans."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2456.356,2467.961,"--You certainly did, Your Honor, and the Court suggested that the same thing... that this Court has no warrant to overturn State attempts to ensure some kind of rough correspondence between numbers of voters and representation."
1992.92-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2471.945,2480.19,"And you're asserting that the... that a State can do that for race too and could say, you know, we have 60 percent one-race, 30 percent another, 10 percent another."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2489.296,2492.779,We think nothing in our position requires us to hold beyond--
1992.92-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.779,2496.152,"I'm sure it doesn't, but you seem to be taking that position."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2496.152,2496.574,--Yes.
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2496.574,2498.09,"Well, you've taken two different positions really."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2503.43,2505.445,Gaffney against Cummings and other cases suggest it does.
1992.92-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2505.445,2506.336,Did that deal with race?
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2506.336,2508.038,Gaffney dealt with race in dicta.
1992.92-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2508.038,2508.882,Pardon?
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2508.882,2511.397,Gaffney dealt with race in dicta.
1992.92-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2511.397,2512.74,It didn't deal with race in other words.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2512.74,2513.678,The holding was not about race.
1992.92-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2514.457,2525.031,But your position is that proportional representation could be... by race could be adopted by a State as a matter of policy quite consistently with the commands of the Constitution?
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2525.031,2527.374,"Consistently with this Court's cases interpreting it, yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2561.033,2562.922,And you think in the end that that's permissible.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2562.922,2565.624,"--What the State did here, yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2575.011,2582.304,"You know, I'm still not entirely clear what your position would be if you did everything exactly the same and there were no Voting Rights Act."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2584.507,2588.537,--It would be... it would not... the plaintiffs would not have stated a claim.
1992.92-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2594.033,2595.283,Your answer is it would be constitutional--
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2595.283,2595.799,--It would be constitutional.
1992.92-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2595.799,2596.751,--even if there were no Voting Rights Act.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2596.751,2597.47,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2597.47,2601.938,But I thought you answered Justice Kennedy's question to the same effect exactly the opposite.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2601.938,2603.171,"I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.92-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2603.905,2606.263,"Well, which... on which case did you misspeak?"
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2607.466,2615.916,Justice Stevens' hypothetical is one in which the plaintiffs would have failed to state a claim and the State's action would be constitutional.
1992.92-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2629.114,2633.283,Our cases have held that you could do this to remedy a violation of the act.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2657.055,2661.758,"With respect, Justice Scalia, we don't read the cases to hold that."
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2678.577,2687.918,"Well, section 5 I think... I thought we agreed the test under section 5 is really equivalent to the constitutional test."
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2687.918,2689.137,"Well, there are two tests."
1992.92-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2690.042,2690.635,Yes.
1992.92-357,1,27797,h_jefferson_powell,,2690.635,2691.385,--which is constitutional.
1992.92-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2734.274,2735.368,"Thank you, Mr. Powell."
1992.92-357,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2736.992,2746.613,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-357,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2801.184,2807.291,"--cases involved the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act itself, did it--"
1992.92-357,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2807.291,2815.539,"No, but in this Court's decision in United Jewish Organizations, the Court faced essentially the same situation we have here."
1992.92-357,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2840.966,2846.745,"--But U.J.O. didn't... there was no challenge to the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act there, was there?"
1992.92-357,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2846.745,2848.729,The Court treated the challenge--
1992.92-357,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2848.729,2849.729,"Well, was there or wasn't there?"
1992.92-357,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2849.729,2850.182,--There was.
1992.92-357,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2877.638,2879.185,"That was just a plurality opinion, wasn't it?"
1992.92-357,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2879.185,2884.136,"--Well, that's true, although there were two concurring Justices who would have taken--"
1992.92-357,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2884.136,2885.668,Agreeing with what you just said?
1992.92-357,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2885.668,2895.725,"--Taking an even broader position that any efforts to comply with the Voting Rights Act, even if the Attorney General's interpretation was not authorized, would negate invidious intent."
1992.92-357,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2896.975,2904.113,"Is it the policy, Mr. Kneedler, of the Justice Department and of the United States to encourage racial block voting?"
1992.92-357,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2904.113,2908.096,"--It is not, but as this Court has said--"
1992.92-357,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2908.096,2910.001,Is it a policy to discourage it?
1992.92-357,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2910.001,2919.168,"--Yes, although the Voting Rights Act is premised on the unfortunate fact that racial block voting occurs."
1992.92-357,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2950.079,2962.183,"In this case, is it a plausible assumption that racial block voting is, A, encouraged and, B is the explicit premise for the design of this district?"
1992.92-357,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2962.183,2967.197,"Well, I... as to the latter, I think it's pretty clear that it's the premise."
1992.92-357,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3022.191,3025.892,"Well, the whole thing wouldn't succeed unless they... unless the block voting occurred."
1992.92-357,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3025.892,3031.795,"--Right, but if it doesn't succeed, then the harm that appellants are most concerned about is really not present."
1992.92-357,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3092.146,3102.329,"Mr. Kneedler, what is your position that what if the State of North Carolina motivated by precisely the same considerations you've just described adopted this program on its own without there being a Voting Rights Act?"
1992.92-357,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3102.329,3103.72,--We have not taken a position.
1992.92-357,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3103.72,3105.296,What is your position?
1992.92-357,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3105.296,3110.748,There would be much to be said for the State's ability to do that if there was--
1992.92-357,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3110.748,3114.512,Just the same facts that you have that motivated the United States.
1992.92-357,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3114.512,3114.731,--No.
1992.92-357,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3139.127,3141.392,And you say it would or would not be permissible constitutionally?
1992.92-357,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3141.392,3152.871,"I think it would be permissible constitutionally if the State were addressing racial block voting, which it would be, in that respect, addressing private discriminatory conduct."
1992.92-357,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3180.985,3186.28,"As I understand your argument, though, Mr. Kneedler, you're not relying on the fact that the Attorney General turned this plan down."
1992.92-357,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3192.95,3193.184,That's correct.
1992.92-357,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3304.717,3305.108,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
1992.92-357,3,39164,robinson_o_everett,,3308.152,3315.791,"Let me respond first to the last remark by Mr. Kneedler, Mr. Chief Justice."
