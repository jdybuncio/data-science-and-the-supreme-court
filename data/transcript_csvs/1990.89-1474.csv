1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.022,"We'll hear next in No. 89-1474, McDermott International v. Jon C. Wilander."
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,45.862,48.231,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.477,150.964,May I ask a preliminary question for my information?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,150.964,152.298,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,152.298,157.952,Is there a general maritime negligence action which the respondent could have brought?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,157.952,171.026,"No, not in this case, Your Honor, because the person he was bringing suit against would have been his employer and except for the Jones Act's variation from the general common law there would be no action against his employer for the general maritime negligence."
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.026,182.568,"Now, may I also ask you what difference you think it makes whether Mr. Wilander aided in the navigation of the vessel?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,198.529,207.468,I think that the concept of aid to navigation has always been considered as a degree of the permanency of the attachment between the worker and the employer's vessel.
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,207.468,209.568,But not a necessary concept.
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,209.568,214.139,"Well, the Fifth Circuit says it's not necessary, but the other circuit courts seem to say that it is, in its particular--"
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.139,216.241,And we haven't spoken to the issue?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,216.241,217.774,--You have spoken to the issue many times.
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,266.506,272.041,Would you comment on the facts a little bit to that extent?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,272.041,272.493,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,272.493,279.164,"I guess he slept, ate, and planned his activities aboard the barge DB-9?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,279.164,280.014,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,290.039,294.757,Do you concede that he was a member of the crew of DB-9?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,294.757,303.863,"No, I don't, because he's not a member of the crew of that vessel any more than he is of the Gates Tide, since he did not contribute to the transportation or navigational function of the DB-9."
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,303.863,306.231,Assuming we think that's an essential test--
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,306.231,306.715,Exactly so.
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,306.715,309.0,--which the Fifth Circuit does not.
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,309.0,310.216,Exactly so.
1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,334.932,338.284,"Well, take a vessel different than the one we're talking about here, Mr. Doyle."
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,346.89,356.328,"I think the mess crew certainly is composed of seamen, Your Honor, because they serve the vessel, Mr. Chief Justice, in its use as a vessel as opposed to something which has another mission."
1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,356.328,360.899,"So they don't have to participate in the actual steering of the ship, then?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,360.899,361.665,Exactly.
1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,361.665,364.517,"That would be true of repair people, too?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,364.517,388.217,"Well, repair people present a special problem because, of course, ship repairs are specifically identified under the L&H Act and it could be that under some circumstances they would be covered there and not under the Jones Act, but if they're brought along on a sea voyage, specifically for the purpose of conducting those repairs to the engines or the appurtenances of the vessel which are required during its voyage, they are aiding that vessel in its navigation every bit as much as the master."
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,388.217,392.87,How about the dance instructor and the bartender on the Love Boat?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,393.52,397.155,"They, also, Justice O'Connor, aid, aid in the function of the vessel, for a different reason though perhaps."
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,397.155,398.072,Are they covered?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,398.072,400.457,I think they are covered but perhaps for a different reason.
1990.89-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,432.661,436.047,Do you think your... the Seventh Circuit agrees with your view?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,436.047,439.249,"I think they do, Justice White, although they--"
1990.89-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,439.249,445.303,All you need to do is to contribute to the function of the vessel and navigation?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,445.303,446.171,--I approach--
1990.89-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,446.171,448.705,That doesn't sound like the court of appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,448.705,451.909,"--No, sir, it doesn't sound like their opinion, but I approach it this way, Justice White."
1990.89-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,472.386,476.957,"Well, let me... how do you differ then with the Fifth Circuit?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,476.957,478.976,I differ in this way.
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,514.914,519.885,Do you take the position he was simply in the position of a passenger aboard the Gates Tide?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,519.885,520.785,"--I do, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,520.785,521.669,Do you go that far?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,521.669,522.086,I do.
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,522.086,523.087,You think he's just a passenger?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,523.087,526.707,"Well, he is just a passenger who is there in an employment-related function."
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,527.69,529.259,He's also an employee?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,529.259,535.229,"--He's an employee, not a master of the Gates Tide, but an employee of McDermott International which had chartered it."
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,550.006,557.409,"Did the employer own all these vessels, the Gates Tide, and... or lease the Gates Tide and the DB-9?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,557.409,559.178,The employer owned the DB-9--
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,559.178,560.478,"Is it a group of vessels, in effect?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,560.478,562.463,"--There were a group of vessels there, yes, ma'am."
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,562.463,567.7,"Well, maybe we should look at whether he's attached to ""a group of vessels""."
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,569.734,576.973,"That is a possibility; however, in this case it presents special problems, because not all of the vessels to which he could have been detached were American."
1990.89-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,588.781,596.719,"Well, what about a... what about a fishing boat?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,638.13,641.248,"Justice White, I'd appreciate the opportunity to finish my answer to your earlier question."
1990.89-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,654.656,672.018,"So, so if this fellow had been... while the boat that he was... the boat where he was living and operating... if he had been hurt on the way would he have been a seaman?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,672.018,673.218,"No, sir, I think not, but perhaps--"
1990.89-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,673.218,674.786,"Well, it would have been in navigation."
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,674.786,676.086,--The vessel would have been in navigation.
1990.89-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,676.086,683.492,He would have been... and his being carried to do his mission is certainly part of the boat's mission.
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,683.492,684.575,"I think this, Justice White."
1990.89-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,690.163,691.598,"No, go ahead."
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,691.598,707.358,"And to restrict... and to restrict that as the Fifth Circuit does... not to restrict it, rather to broaden it as the Fifth Circuit does... and to say that we are going to consider your attachment to the special mission as satisfying all requirements of status under the aid to navigation test is inconsistent with what this Court has ever said."
1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,707.358,713.679,I don't understand your answer to Justice White's question about the harpooner on a whale boat.
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,716.463,717.13,Well--
1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,717.13,726.771,"You added that one wasn't in maritime commerce, but that's simply adding on something to the mission of the ship that I hadn't understood from your previous definition."
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,726.771,745.9,"--Well, in my brief, Mr. Chief Justice, I had taken pains to point out that the Jones Act's outer limits is going to be defined in some way as what maritime commerce has covered and engaged in by the vessel and I suggest in my brief that part of the reason why the Robison opinion to the Fifth Circuit has lost its support--"
1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,745.9,747.952,Well can't you answer the question any more shortly than that?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,747.952,748.685,--I'm sorry.
1990.89-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,760.075,770.531,"Well, that still doesn't get to why... you mean just that because the vessel has stopped and tied up, he suddenly changes from a seaman to a nonseaman?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,770.531,774.085,"No, sir, he never attained the status as seaman in the first place."
1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,776.269,777.204,What's the difference?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,781.406,791.095,"For one thing, Mr. Chief Justice, in the real world, the person who is the whale spotter on the vessel is going to have other duties and he is going to form that type of permanent attachment to the vessel which is related to navigation."
1990.89-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,791.095,792.131,That wasn't in my hypothetical.
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,792.131,792.714,"No, sir."
1990.89-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,792.714,802.002,All he did... his only job on that ship is to... is when they get into whale territory to get up there and look and be ready.
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,802.852,803.621,Yes.
1990.89-1474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,803.621,807.14,--what if it was seals instead of whales?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,807.14,808.373,Seals--
1990.89-1474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.373,809.258,Would that have been different?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,814.127,814.996,--That's right.
1990.89-1474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,814.996,816.762,"But he would if he goes for whales, is that the difference?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,816.762,821.15,"Well, in the case involving the seal clubbers which is in the respondent's brief--"
1990.89-1474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.15,821.95,Right.
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,821.95,831.806,--I believe that the distinction there between their case and mine is that those people performed the mission... the only mission that the vessel had to do which was in maritime commerce.
1990.89-1474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.924,839.661,"Well, what's it saying here if somebody's on a boat that does nothing but carry people to paint?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,845.296,858.456,"--Well, as I've said, Justice Scalia, I think that the aid to navigation requirement at its base is an indicator, one of perhaps more than one, of the connexity between the seaman and the vessel itself."
1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,873.133,875.085,You see you're giving two separate answers it seems.
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,893.212,906.104,"--Well, it is, Mr. Chief Justice, in response to Justice Scalia's question because I believe that the vessel that was involved in the case that was hunting for seals was more... had a more all-encompassing voyage."
1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,907.722,910.508,"Well, but now is that a requirement under this act?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,914.31,920.196,"--Well, it is a requirement that the seaman, the person seeking status under the act, have a permanent attachment to the vessel."
1990.89-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,930.985,932.221,"Well, he lived on it, didn't he?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,932.221,934.123,"No, sir, not on the vessel to which he claims attachment."
1990.89-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,935.139,935.789,Oh.
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,935.789,940.777,"And that's another problem, Justice White, because the jury actually found him connected permanently to two vessels."
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,940.777,949.883,"Mr. Doyle, are we here reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,959.655,967.677,"Well, I think not, Justice O'Connor, because in this case, it is going to be controlled exclusively by what the court would have decided was relevant evidence."
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,980.902,984.306,It's whether the evidence was relevant at all.
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,984.306,984.722,Exactly.
1990.89-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,984.722,985.339,What evidence?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,985.339,997.697,"The evidence of his attachment to the special mission which he alleged was performed by this vessel, by the paint boat, as opposed to transportation as a navigation function."
1990.89-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,997.697,1004.35,"Mr. Doyle, let me recap something which will at least explain why I'm not following what you're saying."
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,1127.414,1132.318,"Justice Souter, specially I will refer to Justice Harlan's dissent in the Senko case, because I think it clarifies it."
1990.89-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1155.851,1160.82,"Yes, but it's the reason the ship... that boat even moves."
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,1160.82,1163.754,"Well, the object of his work is the only reason that the vessel moves--"
1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1163.754,1164.706,"Well, that's him."
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,1167.908,1176.681,"--Actually the facts I believe will show, Mr. Chief Justice, that he supervised and he stationed himself on the vessel most of the time except when he was inspecting the work on the platform."
1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1176.681,1180.066,"Well, why did you say then that he does most of his work off the vessel?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,1180.066,1182.501,Because the object of his work is off the vessel.
1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1186.887,1197.511,"If he were... if he lived on this boat and it went out to paint other boats regularly, would you agree that he was a seaman?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,1197.511,1204.514,I would agree that the degree of permanency that made up his attachment to that vessel would be different in character than it is here.
1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1204.514,1209.252,"But then does that you bring up to answer my question, yes or no?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,1209.252,1211.068,"I would not agree that he's a seaman, no, sir."
1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1211.604,1220.46,"Even though that he lived on this boat... this boat that did nothing but paint other boats and they... it painted other boats regularly, he still is not a seaman?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,1220.46,1224.545,--I don't believe he is and I don't believe this Court has so held in Senko and the other cases that--
1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1224.545,1225.828,And why is he not a seaman?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,1225.828,1229.732,"--Because he doesn't contribute, as this Court has said, to the navigational function of that vessel."
1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1231.199,1233.434,Although whale harpooners do?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,1233.434,1236.986,"--Yes, sir."
1990.89-1474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1236.986,1238.922,But seal harpooners don't?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,1238.922,1247.277,"Well, I didn't actually say that, Justice Scalia, and I think that they could well in the context of the voyage for the reasons that I've stated."
1990.89-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1248.71,1249.243,I have just one.
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,1249.243,1250.312,"--Yes, sir."
1990.89-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1250.312,1253.347,You referred to Justice Harlan's dissent in the Senko case?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,1253.347,1254.097,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1254.097,1258.133,Do you think we have to overrule the Senko case in order to sustain your position?
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,1258.133,1259.085,To sustain our position?
1990.89-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.553,1318.29,"Have we ever passed on the bartender, dance instructor example?"
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,1318.29,1326.46,"No, sir, you haven't, but the argument in Senko, I think, was advanced against their obtaining status and it was met by Justice Harlan in the fashion that I've described."
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,1326.46,1328.979,Thank you.
1990.89-1474,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,1328.979,1329.931,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1329.931,1331.097,"Thank you, Mr. Doyle."
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1338.185,1340.787,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1474,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1368.639,1369.822,"There aren't too many of them, are there?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1369.822,1372.591,There are 11 circuits I count that--
1990.89-1474,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1372.591,1373.058,How many?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1374.21,1379.328,"--There are 11 circuits that I count, everybody except the Seventh and the Fourth--"
1990.89-1474,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1379.328,1379.728,I see.
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1379.728,1381.164,--along with the Fifth Circuit.
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1450.876,1452.676,Mrs. Bercier--
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1452.676,1453.662,"Yes, ma'am."
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1453.662,1464.784,"--in the Norton case, the Court spoke about a seaman having, needing to have a permanent connection with a vessel."
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1464.784,1465.636,"Yes, ma'am."
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1465.636,1469.338,Now how do we find that with the Gates Tide here?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1476.159,1483.265,"Yes, ma'am, he did live aboard the DB-9 and this goes back to your question earlier about a fleet of vessels."
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1487.7,1496.822,"So under Norton and your argument, you would say at least he's a member of the crew of the DB-9?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1496.822,1498.274,"--Yes, ma'am."
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1498.274,1501.226,But that's not the basis of his claim.
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1501.226,1501.993,I disagree--
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1501.993,1512.415,"He has to... because it's registered, only the Gates Tide as a U.S. vessel, he has to win or lose on the basis of his attachment to the Gates Tide?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1512.415,1514.784,--That is how petitioner has characterized that.
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1522.973,1525.692,"Well, how do we have to take this case?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1531.995,1536.13,They found him a member of the crew of the DB-9 and the Gates Tide.
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1536.13,1537.066,"All right, two."
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1537.066,1537.816,"Yes, ma'am."
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1537.816,1549.207,"And if we think he was not a member of the crew of the Gates Tide, what do we do here, because this other question isn't here, is it?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1549.207,1551.409,"No, Your Honor, certiorari was not granted."
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1556.361,1556.98,Right.
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1556.98,1558.046,I feel that--
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1558.046,1567.336,"So that would be the end of the case if we think there wasn't enough here to make him a seaman of the Gates Tide, that's it."
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1567.336,1580.845,"--Well, of course, I think you can still affirm that this circuit in this case... I think what this case is about is are we going to choose between the Fifth Circuit rule and the Seventh Circuit rule."
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1608.079,1616.184,"Well, even if we think that's true, isn't there this element of whether he has to be permanently attached to the vessel?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1616.184,1616.801,Okay.
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1618.251,1623.855,"Here he was just hauled around for a few days on the Gates Tide, is that right?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1623.855,1638.098,"--He was assigned to the Gates Tide for this particular hitch, and this has been a rule which has developed in the Fifth Circuit due to the fleet of vessels concept where employees are required to work on different vessels."
1990.89-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1650.69,1657.345,"Did the Fifth Circuit rely on this theory that you're expounding on, to answer Justice O'Connor's question?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1657.345,1662.297,--That wasn't part of the issues before the Court when we decided the--
1990.89-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1662.297,1664.849,Can you answer my question yes or no?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1664.849,1667.451,"--I'm trying to remember, Your Honor."
1990.89-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1668.367,1668.984,It didn't.
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1673.438,1675.64,As to the permanent attachment question?
1990.89-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1675.64,1680.775,"Yeah, as to whether he was attached to a group of vessels."
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1680.775,1685.429,"No, Your Honor, I don't think the Fifth Circuit relied on the fleet of vessels concept at all."
1990.89-1474,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1692.0,1693.518,"But you're not defending that, is that it?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1693.518,1694.551,"Oh, sir?"
1990.89-1474,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1694.551,1697.57,Are you defending that or not?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1697.57,1698.17,"Yes, I am."
1990.89-1474,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.624,1713.432,I thought you were asking that perhaps we could affirm for another reason... that he was a member of... he was a seaman in terms of a whole group of vessels?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1713.432,1718.717,"No, Your Honor, that question was brought up as to the degree of his permanency of attachment."
1990.89-1474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1724.138,1740.665,"Mrs. Bercier, could you tell me how your theory excludes or does it exclude the instance posited by Mr. Doyle of a secretary who takes the Staten Island Ferry to work?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1740.665,1741.249,Sure.
1990.89-1474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1755.025,1766.9,But if... so it would be different if her employer provided a boat whose only mission was to bring those employees from Staten Island to Manhattan?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1766.9,1767.867,"No, I don't think so."
1990.89-1474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1767.867,1768.4,Why not?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1775.32,1779.272,But she would not be contributing to that mission and the mission of the vessel--
1990.89-1474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1779.272,1779.672,"Yes, she would."
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1786.942,1793.282,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that's a broad interpretation of seaman's status and I won't argue with you if you want to hold that but that would make her--"
1990.89-1474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1793.282,1794.082,"She's a seaman, too."
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1794.082,1795.748,"--I'll make her a seaman, too, if you want to."
1990.89-1474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1795.748,1796.149,All right.
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1798.549,1799.451,I'm sorry.
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1799.451,1803.353,Would you speak so that we can all share in your response to the questions?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1803.353,1804.037,"Yes, ma'am."
1990.89-1474,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1804.037,1804.42,Thank you.
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1811.743,1814.361,"Well, Justice Scalia would afford her that status."
1990.89-1474,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1814.361,1816.328,"Well, I want to know what you would do."
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1816.328,1819.682,I would require her to contribute to the mission of the vessel.
1990.89-1474,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1831.407,1834.525,I thought it was just getting her from Staten Island over to Manhattan.
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1834.525,1835.692,--Uh-huh.
1990.89-1474,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1835.692,1837.643,You'd make her a seaman there?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1837.643,1839.46,"No, Your Honor, I don't think she would be a seaman."
1990.89-1474,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1871.548,1877.686,The seaman was actually being paid to be on the boat--
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1877.686,1878.402,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1474,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1878.402,1879.32,--to do his work.
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1879.32,1880.553,"Yes, sir, he was."
1990.89-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.839,1890.445,Did the members of the crew of the Gates Tide do their painting while they were on the Gates Tide?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1890.445,1901.301,"Mr. Wilander, as I understand the facts, Mr. Wilander and at least one other employee would stay on the vessel to operate the machinery, the air compressor and the hoses."
1990.89-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1910.507,1917.013,So the Gates Tide would not have accomplished its mission if it had simply dropped these people off on the boat and then gone back.
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,1917.013,1917.879,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2007.086,2011.89,How about workers on the platform itself out there in the Gulf?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2014.257,2018.042,"If they are... if they're on the outer continental shelf, they are covered--"
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2018.042,2019.859,"No, I said in the Persian Gulf."
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2019.859,2020.994,"--Oh, in the Persian Gulf."
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2020.994,2024.363,"That's right, on a platform in the Persian Gulf."
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2025.946,2028.581,The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act does not cover him.
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2034.921,2038.039,So perhaps nothing unless local law provided it?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2038.039,2040.223,"Yes, I would feel sure nothing."
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2040.223,2058.536,Would you tell me why you think we need to be concerned about the so-called aid in navigation test as opposed to looking at whether someone is a member of a crew of a vessel and sufficiently attached and doing the mission?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2061.737,2063.288,"Nothing, Your Honor."
1990.89-1474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2192.373,2194.575,Did it pass a law rejecting the bill?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2194.575,2196.808,"--No, they just voted down the bill, Your Honor."
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2291.369,2292.238,Mrs. Bercier--
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2292.238,2292.704,"Yes, ma'am."
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2292.704,2299.608,--would you help me where exactly what question we have to answer here.
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2316.32,2317.57,"Yes, ma'am."
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2317.57,2324.64,"I would have thought perhaps it was a mixed question of law in fact, but our cases don't talk in those terms, do they?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2324.64,2329.477,"No, ma'am, they certainly don't, and that has been the holding starting with Bassett--"
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2329.477,2338.816,"That's very difficult for me to understand how it could be other than a mixed question, but assuming it's not, what do we answer here?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2348.589,2368.003,"--I think that what the Court is required to answer in this case... what I understood we were here for today... is to determine whether or not a worker must contribute to the transportation function of a vessel in order to be a seaman, as he is required to do now in the Seventh Circuit."
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2370.72,2374.156,"Well, are we reviewing instructions to the jury then?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2376.274,2380.326,--I think we're reviewing the test used by the Fifth Circuit--
1990.89-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2380.326,2384.095,"Well, what difference does that make if the jury didn't have the test?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2386.83,2390.951,--The Fifth Circuit... the jury did have the test used by the Fifth Circuit.
1990.89-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2403.759,2419.035,"Well, Mrs. Bercier, are you suggesting that our previous cases say that no matter how little evidence would support a finding of the person being a seaman that's nonetheless good enough if the jury finds it?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2419.035,2433.259,"No, sir, and in fact that's what this Court addressed in Norton v. The Warner Company, wherein the Court stated that although we held in South Chicago v. Bassett that seaman status is almost always for the tryer fact."
1990.89-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2438.93,2444.483,And presumably in some cases conversely that a person was not a seaman as a matter of law.
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2444.483,2445.852,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.89-1474,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.852,2451.506,But in any event the jury is supposed to be accurately instructed about what the law is.
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2451.506,2452.022,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2523.852,2525.72,I want to clarify one point.
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2525.72,2526.287,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2526.287,2534.41,"You're not contending that this fixed... that this platform, the drilling platform here, was anything other than a fixed platform, are you?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2534.41,2535.376,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2538.112,2542.314,And have we ruled that that cannot be a vessel?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2542.314,2545.099,"Yes, Your Honor, Rodrey v. Etna."
1990.89-1474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2636.276,2650.535,"If the only alternative is the Seventh Circuit's approach, but as I understand your opponent, Mrs. Doyle or Mrs. Bercier, he is not arguing for that, because I think he concedes that bartenders and dance instructors are covered."
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2653.987,2670.365,"--The Seventh Circuit is the only alternative if you... if you want to make a bartender and a dance instructor seamen, then you have to make a painter a seaman, too, Your Honor, because the only rationale for making the bartender and the dance instructor seamen is that they contribute to the mission of the vessel."
1990.89-1474,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2674.817,2678.971,Do you think the Seventh Circuit would consider a bartender a seaman?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2678.971,2679.688,"No, sir."
1990.89-1474,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2679.688,2680.155,No.
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2680.155,2681.188,I surely don't.
1990.89-1474,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2720.132,2726.801,"Yes, but isn't it true that Justice Douglas did seem to think it necessary to say he contributed to the navigation function of the vessel?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2726.801,2733.605,"Yes, Your Honor, but he gave the term navigation such a broad meaning, because it said it's not limited to steering--"
1990.89-1474,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2733.605,2734.305,But maybe--
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2734.305,2736.491,--it's limited to all the other purposes of the vessel.
1990.89-1474,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2736.491,2742.728,"--Well, maybe so, but he did seem to think navigation was an ingredient of the test and you're really arguing that it's not."
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2745.43,2757.138,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.89-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2757.138,2772.564,"Mrs. Bercier, you may resume."
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2772.564,2775.599,"Thank you, Your Honor, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2828.817,2835.257,Would it be more helpful to everybody on that theory if we dropped the reference to navigation entirely?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2835.257,2839.209,"Absolutely, Your Honor, and that's what the Fifth Circuit has done."
1990.89-1474,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2881.619,2886.689,"Out of curiosity, what kind of condition is Mr. Wilander in now?"
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2886.689,2889.907,"He has some permanent memory loss, Your Honor."
1990.89-1474,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2894.378,2895.811,Is he working at all?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2895.811,2896.578,Sir?
1990.89-1474,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2896.578,2897.747,Is he working at all?
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,2897.747,2904.401,"He's working in sales, no longer going to work offshore where the money was."
1990.89-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3017.49,3018.859,"Thank you, Mrs. Bercier."
1990.89-1474,1,29268,jennifer_j_bercier,,3018.859,3019.359,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.89-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3019.359,3021.092,"Mr. Doyle, do you have rebuttal?"
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3021.092,3021.478,I do.
1990.89-1474,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3084.885,3089.955,But haven't you dropped the bright line requirement once you start including bartenders and dance instructors?
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3094.657,3095.109,It is.
1990.89-1474,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3162.921,3167.806,"But those instances go to what's a vessel, not what's a seaman."
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3169.491,3173.776,"Well, I think the inquiry is inextricably tied together."
1990.89-1474,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3200.36,3210.318,"But aren't you still arguing that if in effect we get soft in defining who is a seaman, we're going to be asked to be soft in defining what is a vessel, and they're really 2 separate inquiries."
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3210.318,3212.752,"Well, I think that's the result which has now been reached."
1990.89-1474,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3226.327,3229.446,"Of course, if the helicopter were a vessel the pilot would clearly be a seaman."
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3229.446,3232.315,"Well, that's right, because he would be serving the mission of the helicopter."
1990.89-1474,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3233.215,3234.517,And vice versa I assume?
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3234.517,3235.417,--And vice versa.
1990.89-1474,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3241.754,3249.11,"If I understand your point correctly, Mr. Doyle, it is that you don't go as far as the Seventh Circuit."
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3257.263,3257.932,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1474,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3257.932,3265.802,And your assertion here is that this boat was not being used as a vessel when it just tied alongside to do painting.
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3265.802,3270.356,"No, sir, not... it might be a fine distinction, Justice Scalia, but it is not that the boat was not being used as a vessel."
1990.89-1474,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3277.777,3282.831,Weren't there... wasn't there machinery on the vessel that aided in the painting?
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3282.831,3284.45,It was carried from platform to platform.
1990.89-1474,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3285.7,3286.985,Didn't it remain on the vessel?
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3286.985,3290.52,"It remained on the vessel during the time that the painting activity was conducted, yes, sir."
1990.89-1474,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3290.52,3294.905,So it was a painting... so it was a vessel that was used in the painting of these platforms.
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3294.905,3295.688,It was--
1990.89-1474,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3295.688,3297.373,That was its mission.
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3297.373,3305.613,"--But in that sense, Justice White, the vessel performed no additional function other than the transport of the men and the equipment from one point to the other."
1990.89-1474,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3306.079,3308.898,Although you know that the vessel had the equipment on it and it stayed on it.
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3308.898,3319.456,"--Yes, sir, and once it arrived it's no different from the crane barge which is a vessel for some purposes but has been specifically held not only in the Fourth Circuit but the Fifth, not to be a vessel for Jones Act purposes."
1990.89-1474,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3319.456,3327.526,But what you're really saying I think then is that vessel has to mean or has to be defined in terms of ways common to all possible vessels.
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3328.312,3338.5,"Well, I'm saying that the distinction that's drawn is between the statutory definition of a vessel which covers a multitude of appliances and the use to which that appliance is put once it goes to work."
1990.89-1474,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3338.5,3344.654,"All right, so there's a distinction between vessel as such and vessel with a specific purpose in a given case."
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3344.654,3345.571,"Jones Act, yes, sir."
1990.89-1474,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3345.571,3356.045,"All right, so if your criterion is going to be what is common to all vessels as such, how can you consistently concede that the bartenders and the dance instructors are seamen?"
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3356.045,3358.081,"Again, because of their connection to the vessel."
1990.89-1474,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3364.651,3369.889,"No, but aren't you now saying that once you've got a vessel, anyone who is permanently connected with it, is a seaman?"
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3369.889,3371.905,I think in many cases that is the decision made--
1990.89-1474,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3371.905,3373.09,Why not in this case?
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3373.09,3376.292,--Because he's not permanently attached to the vessel and one indicia of the fact--
1990.89-1474,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3376.292,3379.66,He was during the period that he was assigned to use it for the painting duties.
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3379.66,3380.694,"--Well, but during that time--"
1990.89-1474,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3380.694,3382.946,I mean the bartender is not attached to it for life.
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3392.468,3397.039,"--I think, Justice Souter, that with respect that's not consistent with the way that the law has been applied."
1990.89-1474,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3477.322,3479.122,"Your time has expired, Mr. Doyle."
1990.89-1474,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3480.038,3480.905,"--Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
