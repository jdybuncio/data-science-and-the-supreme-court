1987.86-863,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,66.958,"Mr. Merrill, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.86-863,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,66.958,69.827,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-863,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,409.965,416.785,Did the Secretary ever direct any... anyone to use it?
1987.86-863,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,416.785,418.685,"No, Justice White."
1987.86-863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,816.276,817.312,May I ask about that Act?
1987.86-863,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,821.347,822.347,"That is correct, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,823.816,830.403,Is that an appropriate... can Congress enact a statute that tells us how to decide a case?
1987.86-863,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,830.403,839.576,"Well, there is nothing in the clarification that was passed in August that suggests that Congress was aiming at this particular case."
1987.86-863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,840.676,844.562,"What other is... no other state does this, does it, or does Nebraska do it, too?"
1987.86-863,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,844.562,844.962,"--Well, no."
1987.86-863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,923.146,933.953,But as to the first of the two pieces of legislation you mentioned in substance said that the moratorium was intended to be broader than its language would indicate?
1987.86-863,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,933.953,935.553,"--Yes, and I think that--"
1987.86-863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,935.553,939.94,How does that... I am not quite sure how that enters the case.
1987.86-863,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,943.975,945.761,"--Well, everyone finds it hard to follow the Moratorium, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,973.328,987.504,"No, but at least it establishes the proposition that the moratorium in the 1984 DEFRA statute is broader than the one applicable just to 1902(a)."
1987.86-863,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,987.504,988.854,"It does do that, yes."
1987.86-863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,990.39,991.823,"If you just knew that much, you might think,"
1987.86-863,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,998.209,998.859,--That is correct.
1987.86-863,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1033.8,1040.821,"Or at least this Congress' interpretation of the original moratorium, which is really not which governs what the original moratorium meant."
1987.86-863,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1040.821,1050.344,"Well, I think you can argue that in this case it does, Justice Scalia, because as I mentioned, Congress made the effective date of the clarification retroactive to the date of the original moratorium."
1987.86-863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1061.136,1063.052,May I ask one other question about the moratorium?
1987.86-863,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1071.242,1071.692,No.
1987.86-863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1076.561,1076.995,Oh.
1987.86-863,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1076.995,1090.119,About the effect of having different methodologies for measuring different income between medically needy medicaid families and other types of medicaid families under the categorical programs.
1987.86-863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1099.558,1101.724,"So it is still in effect, whatever it is, all right."
1987.86-863,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1101.724,1103.926,"It is still in effect, that is correct."
1987.86-863,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1170.987,1172.504,"Thank you again, Mr. Merrill."
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1180.057,1182.259,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1987.86-863,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1259.426,1271.132,"Mr. Johnson, let me ask you just a minute: you are taking a somewhat different position than the Ninth Circuit took, because it seemed to rest most of its opinion on the ROM?"
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1271.132,1278.221,I do not think we are at difference with the Ninth Circuit's Opinion.
1987.86-863,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1278.221,1283.506,"It is a matter of emphasis, I realize, but yes I thought they devoted most of their Opinion on the ROM."
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1292.879,1309.506,"The principal holding I think that you are referring to, Justice Rehnquist, was the Ninth Circuit giving legal force and effect to the ROM in the same status as one would in a duly-promulgated regulation and/or statute."
1987.86-863,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.541,1441.01,But that is not the question that is up for determination.
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1465.808,1468.724,"You mean before the Ninth Circuit, Justice Scalia?"
1987.86-863,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1468.724,1469.076,No.
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1478.032,1478.466,Yes sir?
1987.86-863,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1478.466,1481.818,--the issue to be decided in that interpretation is not
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1490.689,1491.522,"Yes, that is true."
1987.86-863,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1513.804,1515.687,You are saying it is a reasonable interpretation?
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1515.687,1517.439,"Yes it is, we felt so."
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.895,1708.097,"Mr. Johnson, what did they intend the states to be able to do?"
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1708.097,1722.856,"They intended, Mr. Justice, we believe, by that very language referring right to the Secretary's ruling of ROM... or reversing ROM-2572, to reaffirm the Department's policy set out in ROM-2572."
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1722.856,1729.01,Were there some actual states that were involved?
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1729.01,1739.199,"There were two states, Justice White, at that point in time, who were proposing to utilize the criteria of ROM-2572: ourselves and Nebraska."
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1745.436,1747.536,"Well, did Congress know that?"
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1749.971,1759.661,"We would have to make it as an assumption, Mr. Justice, because I could say that the legislative history does not specifically say they were aware that California and that Nebraska was."
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1783.561,1787.679,Somebody must have gotten to the Conference Committee or to Congress.
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1787.679,1788.079,--That is right.
1987.86-863,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.801,1851.186,"Well, and it specifically provided for reinstatement of that policy."
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1856.34,1865.846,"Mr. Justice, what the House bill proposed, the remedy that it proposed, was to amend Section 1903(f)."
1987.86-863,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1867.231,1870.75,"So, and that was rejected: the Conferees did not adopt that."
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1870.75,1873.702,--The Conferees did not amend 1903(f).
1987.86-863,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1874.635,1881.141,So the language in the House history proves nothing except that the House proposed an amendment to (f) which was not adopted.
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1883.508,1893.382,"--With respect, Mr. Justice, I would disagree, because I think it is very important and entirely appropriate to refer to when you are looking to see what was the issue that was before the Conference Committee."
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1909.625,1912.677,"So instead of amending, they did the moratorium?"
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1912.677,1915.212,"That is correct, Mr. Justice."
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1922.468,1940.513,"Well, do you... is the inference not, though, that the Conference Committee... thought that the statute, that the Secretary was properly construing the statute?"
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1940.513,1941.296,--Absolutely.
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.363,1950.719,"Well, in revoking ROM, the Secretary was properly construing the statute?"
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1950.719,1952.737,"No, Mr. Justice, I think it is the other way around."
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.737,1953.187,You do?
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,1953.187,1973.75,"I think that in reaffirming the policy set out in ROM, they were determining that the Secretary, or I should say HHS, had made a proper policy interpretation under 1903(f), and that that policy should be reinstated: 1903(f) says that"
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1999.218,2002.004,When would the moratorium end?
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,2002.004,2008.491,"If in fact the Report was filed in September, it would end 18 months after."
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2008.491,2008.991,What report?
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,2008.991,2022.149,"The moratorium required HHS, or the Secretary, to file a report with Congress in which it would discuss the entire broad range of medicaid eligibility--"
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2022.149,2041.694,"If the Conference Committee thought the Secretary was properly construing the statute, under... when he had the issue drawn... and not properly construing it when he had revoked it, why would the moratorium ever end?"
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,2041.694,2049.799,"--But for the fact that Congress has in fact said it will end, Mr. Justice, I think you would be absolutely right."
1987.86-863,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2085.27,2091.054,I took Justice White's question to suggest that if Congress had really agreed with ROM it would not have said
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,2102.611,2127.595,"In enacting the moratorium by virtue of having... well, I think what the Congress is doing... as it said in the Conference Committee report, that they wanted these more flexible rules re-established as they existed prior to 1981, and they were going to be studying the matter further during that period of 18 months."
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.482,2161.233,"It sounds like Congress was saying,"
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,2175.926,2179.278,"Mr. Justice, I think what Congress is really telling us in the moratorium--"
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2179.278,2180.48,At least they are saying that.
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,2180.48,2181.48,--They are saying that.
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2310.365,2317.369,Do you think this was really an 18... it was an amendment of the statute that would last for 18 months?
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,2317.369,2319.821,"Mr. Justice, this does not amend any statute."
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2319.821,2321.221,"I do not know, but it has that effect."
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,2321.221,2335.313,"The effect that it is intended to have, as Congress said when it enacted TEFRA, and what is essentially be reiterated here, is to re-establish the eligibility rules that existed prior to OBRA."
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2352.859,2369.32,"Suppose it were perfectly clear that the Secretary's construction when he revoked ROM, that his construction of what TEFRA you recall him saying... his construction of what TEFRA... was exactly right."
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,2394.083,2398.654,"--Yes, I do not think that that is at odds with what our position is, Mr. Justice."
1987.86-863,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2400.856,2414.163,"You can win on that, but you cannot use to support that argument the legislative history that you are trying to use in the House which showed that what the House thought of the interpretation was wrong."
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,2418.917,2439.147,"--Well, it is additional legislative history, Mr. Justice, but it seems it would be appropriate when you have no provision coming from the Senate on this adult couple income levels, and that issue was framed by a bill that comes from House and from Conference Committee."
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2499.369,2506.356,"Now, before you... I take it... well, you go ahead, you go ahead."
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,2506.356,2525.936,"It would not only require the Court, then, to disregard what we think is the very clear intent of the Conference Committee as set out in their Report, but would also require you to disregard congressional rejection of just the interpretation that they are urging upon you."
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2759.972,2765.392,Would you be here if there had not been a... I suppose you would still be here... if there had not been a Deficit Act at all?
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,2770.077,2773.879,"The case would be extremely different, Mr. Justice."
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2780.433,2782.885,Whether the Secretary was correctly construing the statute?
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,2782.885,2784.318,"--It could have been articulated,"
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2805.583,2818.408,"Well, if you think you have a tough case absent the moratorium, you mean that you probably would lose your case if you were just attacking the Secretary's construction of the law."
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,2818.408,2820.426,"With all respect, I would rather say that it was a tough case."
1987.86-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.426,2835.685,"Well, in any event then, to rely on the Deficit Act, you really think that Congress meant to, for 18 months, have the law be different."
1987.86-863,1,39616,ralph_m_johnson,,2835.685,2840.054,"They have the law different than what the Secretary was interpreting it as, yes Sir."
1987.86-863,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2849.093,2850.545,"Thank you, Mr. Johnson."
1987.86-863,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2855.231,2856.099,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-863,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2889.504,2891.772,May I interrupt you there?
1987.86-863,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2891.772,2892.606,Sure.
1987.86-863,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2892.606,2907.532,"Would you agree that, If ROM-whatever the number there is, were a correct statement of the law, and I know you disagree, that it would be permissible to treat an adult and two children as equal to two adults?"
1987.86-863,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2913.936,2925.993,"Justice Stevens, we hope that this case does not come down to the issue of whether the language of ROM says, ""between one and three"", can be stretched to include ""three""."
1987.86-863,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2937.801,2940.919,Everybody else seems to have rejected that argument.
1987.86-863,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2944.421,2951.075,"No, Justice Stevens, we think that the case should be... can be, decided on other grounds."
1987.86-863,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2986.831,2988.198,Did it send that letter?
1987.86-863,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2988.198,2989.616,"--Yes, there is such a letter."
1987.86-863,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2989.616,2990.583,Saying that?
1987.86-863,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2990.583,2991.216,Saying that.
1987.86-863,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3115.966,3117.483,"Let me interrupt you once more, Mr. Merrill."
1987.86-863,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3140.764,3156.591,"--To be absolutely precise, Justice Stevens, the Administrator found that the California plan violated Section 1903(f), and for that reason the plan was in violation of Section 1902(a)(4) and (a)(19)."
1987.86-863,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3165.38,3166.649,(10)(C)(i)(3).
1987.86-863,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3182.075,3187.062,--Some Agency employees offered the opinion that--
1987.86-863,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3187.062,3194.149,Would not the government's position today be that it violated the (a)(10)(C)(i)(3)?
1987.86-863,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3194.149,3202.655,"--If there were no moratorium on the Secretary disapproving state plans for that reason, yes, it would be our position that it violates that, quite clearly."
1987.86-863,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3295.264,3296.031,"Thank you, Mr. Merrill."
