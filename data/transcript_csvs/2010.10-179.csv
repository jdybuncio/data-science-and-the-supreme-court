2010.10-179,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.987,"We will now hear argument in Case 10-179, Stern v. Marshall."
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,8.27,13.222,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-179,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,65.706,66.556,Can you tell me why?
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,66.556,67.641,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
2010.10-179,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,68.108,78.43,"What's the authority at all for a bankruptcy court to adjudicate proof of claims, without violating Article III?"
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,81.032,84.834,This Court has never approached that issue directly.
2010.10-179,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,85.436,86.02,So what's--
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,86.02,87.153,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
2010.10-179,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,87.153,89.072,--So what's the constitutional basis?
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,89.072,102.03,"Well, of course, it need not reach that in this case, because the court below and the Respondents assume for te purposes of this case that in fact there was authority for the bankruptcy--"
2010.10-179,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,102.03,105.064,I'm not sure how that helps.
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,120.609,130.215,"--Well, I don't think so, Your Honor, because Article III of course is not jurisdictional in the sense that we think of basic fundamental jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction."
2010.10-179,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,142.04,144.556,So -- answer the question.
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,145.342,146.225,Okay.
2010.10-179,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,193.889,197.508,"The claim here was not one that was created by Congress, though, was it?"
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,197.508,204.363,"That's -- that's correct, but this Court has never held that in fact the claim had to be created by -- literally created by Congress."
2010.10-179,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,264.735,266.787,"Are there any limits, Mr. Richland?"
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,276.377,282.531,"I think that there are limits, and they must be related to the purpose of bankruptcy."
2010.10-179,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,342.169,347.806,Can the Bankruptcy Court adjudicate permissive counterclaims?
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,347.806,349.073,Well--
2010.10-179,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,349.073,354.043,"And if you posit a no, what's the limiting principle?"
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,354.043,369.802,"--Well, certainly the statute -- 157(b)(3)-2 -- does not distinguish between compulsory and permissive counterclaims, and it's also true that this Court's authority in Granfinanciera, in Langenkamp and in Katchen."
2010.10-179,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,387.947,408.778,"Mr. Richland, isn't there this difference: Just to take ordinary civil procedure, compulsory counterclaim doesn't have to satisfy any jurisdictional requirements, because it comes in under the wing of the main claim, but a permissive counterclaim has to independently satisfy jurisdictional requirements."
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,443.749,451.855,"Well, I -- I think that -- that is an excellent justification for why one might want to make this a very narrow determination in this case."
2010.10-179,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,513.845,517.999,Is there any authority -- this began as a motion for nondischargeability?
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,517.999,519.599,Yes.
2010.10-179,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,519.599,533.175,Is there -- is there -- are there any cases in the Federal courts which tell us that a motion for nondischargeability does or does not require the pleading of a counterclaim?
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,533.175,536.544,"I don't believe so, Justice Kennedy."
2010.10-179,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,567.73,570.515,And the counterclaim came at what point?
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,573.65,574.086,That is correct.
2010.10-179,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,628.321,640.444,"What do you make of the fact that -- that (b)(2) says core proceedings include, but are not limited to, the matters that are listed after that?"
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,655.121,684.557,"Well, I think that when -- a court would indeed, if one were looking at something that was outside the scope of the explicitly mentioned categories from (B) to (N) in 157(b)(2), one would in fact look beyond the words of (A) and (O) -- those are the two catch-all provisions -- and one would look to the usual, normal principles of statutory construction to determine what fit within them."
2010.10-179,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,723.182,731.621,What do you think is the principle that defines a core proceeding?
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,741.327,743.696,That's right.
2010.10-179,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,848.429,860.737,"But say you waive it when -- when, in order to protect yourself for a debt that is owed to you, you make a claim in a bankruptcy proceeding."
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,885.768,892.874,"--Well, Justice Scalia, that is precisely what this Court addressed in footnote 14 in Granfinanciera."
2010.10-179,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,939.003,952.33,Would it have been normal for the bankruptcy judge to lift the stay with respect to a claim that could be presented in the bankruptcy proceeding?
2010.10-179,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,952.33,973.76,"Well, the -- certainly the -- the principles of -- of permissive abstention, for example, encourage, if in fact comity is to be respected and if there is another suit pending elsewhere, that bankruptcy courts will permit the suit to proceed in that jurisdiction, so that that does in fact occur."
2010.10-179,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1010.499,1011.451,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-179,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1028.228,1031.097,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-179,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1079.846,1086.682,This is a little -- it's a little different when you're talking about the right to have a -- a decision before an Article III tribunal.
2010.10-179,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1091.217,1097.371,"--Well, I don't know that it's more fundamental than the right not to be questioned against one's will in a criminal proceeding--"
2010.10-179,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1097.371,1101.239,"Well, not -- not fundamental in the sense of is it important or not."
2010.10-179,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1109.512,1132.71,"--I guess there are two potential objections to the use of a non-Article III judge, and one of them would be, as you say, structural, that is, one of the objections that is sometimes made to the use of non-Article III adjudicators is that if Congress can parcel out part of the work of the judiciary to other units, the stature of the Judicial Branch will be diminished."
2010.10-179,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1150.256,1163.33,"Well, that just means that the district court is acting in concert with Congress to take action that undermines the long-term institutional and constitutional basis of the judiciary, and the districts courts have very different reasons and incentives to do that."
2010.10-179,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1168.883,1195.701,"Well, to the extent that the concern is with fairness to individual litigants, that is, the idea that the Respondent in this case has a right to an Article III tribunal and should not likely be held to have waived it, I think that a person who seeks affirmative relief from a court doesn't waive all his constitutional rights, to be sure, but should ordinarily be taken to accept the consequences that ordinarily follow from a request for judicial relief."
2010.10-179,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1207.407,1208.742,That can't be right.
2010.10-179,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1230.938,1234.492,"Well, the Court has applied this basic principle in a number of contexts."
2010.10-179,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1250.936,1253.788,"Well, that's because there's a basic sovereign immunity."
2010.10-179,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1255.323,1256.223,The government doesn't have--
2010.10-179,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1256.223,1258.691,"--so it can -- so it can make conditions, but that's not this case."
2010.10-179,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1258.691,1269.23,"--The government can make conditions, but -- but the point was the plaintiff in that situation had no alternative forum to which he could attempt to obtain a recovery from the government."
2010.10-179,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1269.23,1274.617,"But that's because of the limitation of sovereign immunity, and you don't -- and you don't have that analogue here."
2010.10-179,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1274.617,1295.698,"Another example would be Adam v. Saenger, which is also cited in the Petitioner's brief, in which I believe it was a Texas plaintiff filed suit in the California State courts, and the California defendant asserted a -- a cross-complaint, basically a counterclaim, against him, and the Texas plaintiff objected to the California court's assertion of personal jurisdiction."
2010.10-179,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1313.861,1322.717,"A State can do that, but can the Federal Government make it the price that you pay for -- for going into a non-Article III tribunal?"
2010.10-179,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1322.717,1324.25,--Look--
2010.10-179,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1324.25,1326.336,"It's a different situation, it seems."
2010.10-179,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1326.336,1347.832,"--Let me step back a second and address the questions that were posed by Justices Sotomayor and Alito at the -- at the beginning about the initial authority of the bankruptcy judge to adjudicate the claim brought against the estate, because I agree with my colleague's answer that this is a question, and with Justice Sotomayor, that this is a question that this Court hasn't squarely resolved."
2010.10-179,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1495.762,1512.223,"Will you include in that this 157(b)(5), because this whole thing would be a futile exercise if the tort claim comes -- comes out of the bankruptcy judge's--"
2010.10-179,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1512.223,1517.794,I think the 157(b)(5) is in our view not jurisdictional.
2010.10-179,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1555.05,1566.858,"Mr. Stewart, do -- do you think that we should resolve the constitutional question if there's some significant possibility that it wouldn't be necessary because the claims would be found to fit into (b)(5)?"
2010.10-179,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1566.858,1585.855,"--I think -- yes, I mean, this could have been a prudential factor that might have persuaded the Court not to grant certiorari in the first instance, but the Court has obviously identified this as an issue that warrants the expenditure of its resources; and we think that the -- there is no jurisdictional impediment to a decision in this case."
2010.10-179,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1585.855,1594.377,--Does the government have a position on what the answer would be vis a vis -- because that's an open question?
2010.10-179,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1602.798,1608.535,"Again, we don't have a position with respect to the defamation claim."
2010.10-179,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1631.617,1632.367,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1642.042,1644.175,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-179,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1719.708,1738.939,"Counselor, that sort of begs the question, because I think what I haven't unpackaged -- and I want you to unpackage it with me -- you are obviously not deprived of a State or Federal trial forum to decide your claim."
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1804.548,1811.468,"--Okay, Justice Sotomayor, in attempting to answer your question I would like to distinguish sharply between a claim of the creditor against the res--"
2010.10-179,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1811.468,1823.093,"But that's what you have to become to make that claim, meaning you would need to adjudicate your State law entitlement."
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1830.365,1861.318,"--That judgment then is covered by the priority scheme of Federal bankruptcy laws which are passed pursuant to congressional authority -- constitutional authority in Article I, Section 8, clause 4, which is why, in answer to the question Your Honor asked first of Mr. Richland, although the Court has never squarely addressed it, it's broadly accepted that there is no problem with adjudicating what would otherwise be State law claims by the creditor against the debtor in bankruptcy."
2010.10-179,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1908.713,1921.487,"That's -- that's my problem, which is if Congress could do that, why can't it do what it did here, which is to say if you -- not to make an equitable claim against the estate."
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1963.433,1964.183,--And -- and--
2010.10-179,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1964.183,1965.366,Compulsorily.
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1968.92,1969.537,--Sure.
2010.10-179,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1988.899,1995.404,Every -- every bankruptcy priority rule extinguishes someone's entitlement to money.
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2016.068,2016.734,Exactly.
2010.10-179,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2016.734,2021.453,They choose what they're going to permit you to take under what circumstances.
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2037.481,2044.385,"Well, I don't know if it's inequitable but it's certainly unconstitutional; and the reason it's unconstitutional is because--"
2010.10-179,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2044.385,2047.087,You don't have a constitutional right to collect your debt.
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2051.491,2052.474,--With respect--
2010.10-179,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2052.474,2059.078,"You can go to a state -- well, once you get the stay lifted at the end of the discharge, you could sue the estate."
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2062.597,2068.501,"--With respect to the claim of the creditor against the debtor and against the res, I have no problem with that analysis."
2010.10-179,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2135.659,2136.895,Without a proof of claim?
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2136.895,2137.645,--Yes.
2010.10-179,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2211.359,2217.846,"I wanted to ask you, Mr. Englert, about something you just said about if he had any opportunity."
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2227.785,2229.154,That's correct.
2010.10-179,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2229.154,2231.187,So it wouldn't be wiped out?
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2232.189,2233.756,"Oh -- Justice Ginsburg, I'm sorry."
2010.10-179,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2233.756,2235.74,--He would have another forum.
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2235.74,2242.794,He would have another forum against her post-bankruptcy assets after she had her -- her pre-bankruptcy assets distributed.
2010.10-179,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2302.314,2304.933,Just one more point about the nondischargeability.
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2318.609,2332.019,"--Given -- I haven't studied closely the interaction between the automatic stay of section 362 and the nondischargeability complaint of section 523, so I'm not 100 percent sure my answer to Your Honor is correct."
2010.10-179,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2415.654,2417.589,Can you go back to that for one second?
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2487.566,2497.022,"Well, no, Justice Breyer, I think I can agree with most or all of your premises and still argue that we should win under the proper constitutional analysis."
2010.10-179,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2518.686,2520.336,"Well, that's what she says."
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2583.758,2590.312,"Well, those, with respect, Your Honor, I believe are the arguments that were rejected in Marathon."
2010.10-179,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2590.312,2590.912,In which case?
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2590.912,2592.848,"In Marathon, in Northern Pipeline v. Marathon."
2010.10-179,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2592.848,2596.883,"Well, Marathon, you know, you had four, four and -- and who knows what it stands for."
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2604.156,2608.274,"Well, I'm not saying Marathon makes this case a slam-dunk for me, Justice Breyer."
2010.10-179,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2613.976,2622.248,"Of the -- of Marathon and saying, with four and four judges, to really reject a decision like Crowell, which is a kind of foundation stone?"
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2622.248,2627.366,"--No, I'm suggesting that they reject one particular interpretation of Crowell, a very broad interpretation of Crowell."
2010.10-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2627.366,2631.437,"Of course, Crowell involved public rights in the narrow sense, didn't it?"
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2634.306,2635.356,Correct.
2010.10-179,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2635.356,2637.008,"True, but it's also a--"
2010.10-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2637.008,2639.841,Perhaps there should be different standards.
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2661.289,2664.241,"I -- I agree with that -- excuse me, Justice Scalia."
2010.10-179,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2719.042,2725.111,"Of course, there was no Bankruptcy Court handling it to start with."
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2772.342,2786.667,"If all we were talking about, Justice Ginsburg, were doctrines of equity, then perhaps Alexander v. Hillman would be the governing precedent, a non-constitutional case later cited in a Seventh Amendment case and now attempted to be imported into an Article III case."
2010.10-179,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2847.407,2861.733,"Counsel, by your theory, you're basically saying that Congress cannot delegate any State law-based claim to which a jury is entitled to the bankruptcy counterclaim at all."
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2875.391,2880.862,"--I am saying that, Your Honor, but let me say for a moment why that's not inefficient, why that's not such a surprising proposition."
2010.10-179,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2916.849,2931.426,"Mr. Englert, one real difference between Marathon and this case is that Congress passed legislation in between which brought the bankruptcy judges under the control of the district courts and made them entirely Article III entities."
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,2962.545,2981.007,"I -- I would respectfully subject -- suggest not, Justice Kagan, because there remains a difference between a non-Article III court and an Article III court, and the degree of supervision does not convert the non-Article III court into an Article III court."
2010.10-179,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3031.355,3034.891,"Just clarify one point, Mr. Englert."
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3064.827,3068.98,"--I -- I believe the answer is yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.10-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3089.208,3095.212,--But did all of those court of appeals cases involve Article III claims?
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3116.792,3119.411,"I -- I don't have a case count for you, Justice Scalia."
2010.10-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3122.261,3124.246,"But not most, I don't think."
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3124.246,3127.998,"Not most, and they were only decisions of the lower courts, not of this Court."
2010.10-179,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3247.307,3248.241,"Excuse me, I just couldn't hear."
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3251.176,3257.262,--He concluded that the Bankruptcy Court actually did have authority to hear the claim and the counterclaim on the merits.
2010.10-179,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3257.262,3271.006,"--If -- if we were to decide this case, and suppose we decide every other question and suppose you lost, then wouldn't we send it back for you -- if you're right on that, for the Ninth Circuit to decide about that as an independent basis for no jurisdiction?"
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3271.006,3274.808,"Given the premise that I've lost every other issue, the Court could either--"
2010.10-179,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3275.91,3277.193,I had to make that premise in order to--
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3277.193,3277.776,"No, no, I understand."
2010.10-179,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3300.191,3300.775,Is -- is?
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3300.775,3301.641,--Is easy.
2010.10-179,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3304.393,3306.429,--If it's that hard why don't we just DIG the case?
2010.10-179,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3307.579,3323.057,"No, but really, the 157(b)(5) question is -- is easy, but the strongest argument Mr. Richland makes on the merits of the 157(b)(5) claim is that Congress meant only bodily injury when it referred to personal injury."
2010.10-179,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3443.7,3445.419,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-179,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3447.538,3449.838,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.10-179,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3545.617,3555.057,"Well, I would take that to mean you -- you brought it in here, and, you know, the same kind of argument that you were making."
2010.10-179,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3555.057,3555.807,--And that--
2010.10-179,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3555.807,3561.311,"--you've chosen to come into the Court, and this is the spawn of your coming in."
2010.10-179,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3561.311,3569.65,--And the Bankruptcy Court is so immersed in this because of what has gone on during the bankruptcy proceedings that it is not appropriate for me to withdraw it.
2010.10-179,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3573.035,3576.922,"I would -- well, I would rather say 27 months is too long."
2010.10-179,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3577.422,3578.039,And that.
2010.10-179,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3578.039,3578.639,--That's timely.
2010.10-179,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3578.639,3583.409,"Well, 27 months is a long time in bankruptcy."
2010.10-179,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3630.223,3633.925,"Well, but his basic argument I think is that in Marathon--"
2010.10-179,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3633.925,3635.559,There is--
2010.10-179,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3635.559,3636.627,--Make it totally fair.
2010.10-179,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3654.839,3662.426,"--Well, I understand that argument but the majority opinion in Schor states that the State law character of a claim, quote,"
2010.10-179,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3668.746,3670.43,"Thank you, counsel; counsel."
