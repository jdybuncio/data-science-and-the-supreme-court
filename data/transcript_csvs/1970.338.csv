1970.338,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.764,"-- arguments next number 338, Blonder-Tongue Laboratories against the University of Illinois Foundation."
1970.338,0,40255,robert_h_rines,,17.697,22.605,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.338,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,253.808,258.12,"The trial had originally been set in October or November, hadn't it?"
1970.338,0,40255,robert_h_rines,,258.12,265.178,"It had been set several times, but then was postponed Mr. Justice Potter, until December 18th."
1970.338,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,265.178,271.208,What caused the postponement?
1970.338,0,40255,robert_h_rines,,271.208,274.723,The prior trial of Judge Hoffman had not been finished.
1970.338,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,274.723,275.599,I beg your pardon.
1970.338,0,40255,robert_h_rines,,275.599,280.298,"A prior trial of the District Court had had not been finished, so it was postponed to December 18th."
1970.338,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,280.298,282.276,Just one continuance?
1970.338,0,40255,robert_h_rines,,282.276,282.433,Oh!
1970.338,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,320.386,323.161,"How about in the Eighth Circuit, had you had oral testimony?"
1970.338,0,40255,robert_h_rines,,323.161,323.979,"Yes, there was."
1970.338,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,327.927,329.037,Did you?
1970.338,0,40255,robert_h_rines,,329.037,330.622,Wasn’t in that.
1970.338,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,331.075,331.681,That’s alright.
1970.338,0,40255,robert_h_rines,,332.943,333.703,Yes he did sir.
1970.338,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,333.703,336.009,Yes.
1970.338,0,40255,robert_h_rines,,336.009,349.737,"So the issue squarely before this Court is who was right in terms to this conclusion of obviousness on substantially the same record, the Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit or the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit?"
1970.338,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,369.423,384.669,"You said, thought that on the same record was the District Court in the first case and Eighth Circuit dealing with the same record as the record the second trial for Judge Hoffman?"
1970.338,0,40255,robert_h_rines,,384.669,385.903,So far as the documents are concerned --
1970.338,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,385.903,386.587,"Well, documents --"
1970.338,0,40255,robert_h_rines,,386.587,387.569,Yes.
1970.338,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,400.207,404.215,So that it’s not the same record in the broad sense of that word?
1970.338,0,40255,robert_h_rines,,404.215,408.03,"No, it is not Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.338,1,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,2022.265,2026.318,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.338,2,45450,williams_a_marshall,,3224.664,3226.958,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.338,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3514.286,3526.696,"Mr. Marshall, if you have these two pencils and you get a blurred signal and so everybody realized that one of the problems is they’re together."
1970.338,2,45450,williams_a_marshall,,3531.96,3535.821,Mr. Justice you have reduced it is the over simplification.
1970.338,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3723.105,3725.901,This could even talk about the cable antenna which was --
1970.338,2,45450,williams_a_marshall,,3725.901,3736.258,"Yes sir, that was one in which, instead of having straight dipoles, the dipoles were folded dipoles."
1970.338,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3738.006,3739.697,That was in the prior art that --
1970.338,2,45450,williams_a_marshall,,3739.697,3741.323,"Yes, it was."
1970.338,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3750.505,3757.475,(Voice Overlap) the cable was disclosed in the application?
1970.338,2,45450,williams_a_marshall,,3757.475,3784.681,"No sir, it wasn't because I will tell you the difference because basically what you have in the case of a cable antenna, was a folded dipole, and you get into the concept of frequency, and the frequency independence, and it was known that dipole antennas because those were -- the folded dipoles were one of the first type of antennas that were used, I am sure that you have all seen that."
1970.338,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3807.142,3811.676,All of these antennas are antennas you put on the rooftop rather than on your set?
1970.338,2,45450,williams_a_marshall,,3811.676,3816.635,"They can work in the house, for example this one here --you could put on your set and it would work."
1970.338,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3823.889,3826.443,That doesn't make a real difference whether it's from top or --
1970.338,2,45450,williams_a_marshall,,3826.443,3828.794,"No sir, not at all."
1970.338,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4035.36,4039.472,"You say concurrent, you mean the district judges in each of the two circuits or the --?"
1970.338,2,45450,williams_a_marshall,,4039.472,4042.211,In the Eighth Circuit Your Honor.
1970.338,3,41341,sidney_g_faber,,4791.238,4795.842,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.338,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5640.147,5642.991,You have seven minutes left.
1970.338,4,40255,robert_h_rines,,5642.991,5643.988,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.338,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5709.783,5728.691,(Inaudible) Petitioner decided finally to forgo any request for reconsidering Triplett entirely or in any part.
1970.338,4,40255,robert_h_rines,,5733.49,5738.04,Your Honor I think that is correct.
1970.338,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5770.332,5773.418,You of course didn't interpose that as a defense understandably?
1970.338,4,40255,robert_h_rines,,5773.418,5774.068,No we did not.
1970.338,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5776.002,5777.422,Alright.
1970.338,4,40255,robert_h_rines,,5777.422,5801.564,"The last thing I would like to bring out is on this matter of obviousness just a quote from page 499, the experimental results which have been obtained from the multi-element log periodic antennas are found to be predictable and a few sentences later, an investigation of log periodic structures of thin linear elements, that's Isbell, is planned."
1970.338,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5865.532,5866.224,Thank you gentlemen.
