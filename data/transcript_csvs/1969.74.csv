1969.74,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,32.103,"Number 74, Taggart against Weinacker's Incorporated."
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,34.323,37.814,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.74,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,111.797,115.421,It's a pretty large nutshell.
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,115.421,119.037,"The situation is in a nutshell, the questions proliferate."
1969.74,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,119.037,123.483,I suppose what you may have in mind is that it's a nutshell we've looked at before too.
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,123.483,130.223,I think sir our primary position is that this controversy is controlled by this Court's decision in Logan Valley.
1969.74,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,130.223,131.27,In which one?
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,131.27,136.433,"Logan Valley Your Honor, Amalgamated Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza."
1969.74,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,177.552,181.51,You say this parking lot is privately owned but publicly used.
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,181.51,181.552,Yes sir.
1969.74,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,181.552,184.745,That this is open to all members of the public to park there free?
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,184.745,185.546,That is correct sir.
1969.74,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,185.546,186.704,Park there free?
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,186.704,187.555,I can't say.
1969.74,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,193.34,198.293,And there's no showing that it's restricted in any way the customers of this or any other enterprise?
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,198.293,198.862,That's correct.
1969.74,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,203.569,209.915,Suppose a group of people wanted to have a demonstration let us say in favor of the Vietnam war --
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,209.915,210.176,We do not --
1969.74,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,210.176,211.63,Could they hold it there?
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,211.63,225.757,"We do not have in this case the question whether when you have a public situs, you may have picketing or other demonstrations or other exercise of free speech with respect to a matter not connected with that situs."
1969.74,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,381.104,385.705,Does the record show it might have situs case?
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,385.705,386.102,No sir.
1969.74,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,423.544,429.358,Is there anything but a temporary injunction issued in this case?
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,429.358,432.916,The only two orders was the ex parte injunction and the --
1969.74,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,432.916,437.856,"What kind of injunction was that, temporary or permanent?"
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,437.856,440.215,"At that time, it was a temporary injunction."
1969.74,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,455.354,458.48,"And that was still by its terms a temporary injunction, wasn't it?"
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,458.48,461.458,I don't know how one would characterize an injunction which is to continue indefinitely.
1969.74,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,461.458,462.975,How did the Court characterize it?
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,462.975,463.474,Sir?
1969.74,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,463.474,464.574,How did the Court characterize it?
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,464.574,466.207,It did not.
1969.74,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,499.929,506.403,"You say that when the question is one of preemption that the rule, there must be a final judgment in the state court?"
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,506.403,506.845,No sir.
1969.74,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,519.058,523.652,What's your authority for that?
1969.74,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,527.93,529.247,"Yes, it's in the brief Your Honor."
1969.74,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,529.677,530.939,I can find it then.
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,1745.47,1749.512,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1769.192,1770.807,What does the store sell?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,1770.807,1773.898,The store sells groceries and drugs.
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1773.898,1774.758,Only?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,1774.758,1775.419,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1789.345,1791.149,How long is the --?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,1791.149,1793.184,I don't know the square feet involved.
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1798.801,1800.385,-- good sized grocery?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,1800.385,1810.311,"Yes, it was a good sized grocery store, very large sized supermarket grocery store."
1969.74,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1903.264,1916.755,"Mr. Fox, among the various exhibits attached in the appendix to your brief or your fellow counsel's brief, which in your opinion gives us the best picture of what you're trying to describe now?"
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,1916.755,1921.516,"I think the plat on 40, if you would like a diagram of the property."
1969.74,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1921.516,1922.408,A40?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,1922.408,1923.106,A40.
1969.74,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1923.106,1924.87,"Yes, of your brief?"
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,1924.87,1927.08,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1946.002,1948.59,Where did the picketing take place?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,1948.59,1949.377,Pardon me?
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1949.377,1953.2,Where did the picketing take place that the Alabama Court enjoined?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,1953.2,1973.812,"As far as I'm able to ascertain from the opinions of the Court and the record, it took place on the sidewalk -- the public sidewalk first then at various places in the parking lot as well as the sidewalk directly in front of the main entrance to the store building."
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1983.056,1984.172,On the sidewalk?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,1984.172,1987.973,Right on the sidewalk in front of the front door.
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1990.829,1992.523,They did not come in to the store?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,1992.523,1996.381,"No, they did not come in to the store."
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1996.381,2001.176,"If I understand the petition, they say there's no basis for that finding?"
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2001.176,2006.314,I think that I'd have difficulty either quarreling with it or accepting it in this Court.
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2011.803,2014.555,Which said they want to be -- they were obstructing.
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2014.555,2017.235,That said obstructing (Voice Overlap) that was the word.
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2017.235,2019.989,What that does mean?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2019.989,2026.279,It could mean that their presence was in the way of those -- their physical presence was in the way of those coming in and out of the --
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2026.279,2032.145,"Couldn't you say that if they walked in the street, they were obstructive?"
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2035.688,2037.412,I suppose they could have.
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2061.476,2064.855,Was there any provision for live testimony?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2064.855,2068.415,"I do not think there is, unless the court wants it."
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2078.033,2080.007,"But they could've had the hearing too, couldn't they?"
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2080.007,2080.838,They had a hearing.
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2083.657,2086.46,Which consisted of five affidavits?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2086.46,2088.524,The affidavits of the respondent only.
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2088.524,2090.591,That's a hearing?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2090.591,2091.44,That's a hearing.
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2091.44,2094.197,Sufficient for permanent injunction?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2094.197,2097.117,It's sufficient for permanent injunction under Alabama Law.
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2097.117,2098.2,Under Alabama Law?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2098.2,2109.331,"Yes, it hasn't been challenged in this Court as a failure to grant petitioners due process of law under the United States Constitution."
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2112.115,2116.393,Were they offered an opportunity to file counter affidavit?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2116.393,2120.68,Two separate provisions of the Alabama Code give them that right.
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2120.68,2122.74,What did the judge do about it?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2122.74,2126.843,"The judge accepted the evidence before him, which were the affidavits of respondent alone."
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2126.843,2129.827,Did he suggest or ask about any affidavit?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2129.827,2131.162,The record does not indicate.
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2131.162,2134.611,Did the lawyers ask for the right to offer any counter affidavit?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2134.611,2137.798,It is not so indicated in the record.
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2150.72,2155.372,What are you claiming here that the court had a right to enjoin?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2155.372,2156.447,"Well, I claim it on --"
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2156.447,2157.634,At what claim?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2157.634,2182.535,"I claim it that the court in precluding the pickets from coming on to this limited property were within their jurisdiction and acted properly and that they had the right to move the pickets, in effect, 100 feet away by moving them on to a public sidewalk, a safe and proximate place to stand only 100 feet from the front door of the respondent's premises."
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2182.535,2185.579,I understood you to say that the court enjoined picketing --
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2185.579,2185.712,No.
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2185.712,2187.124,-- on the public sidewalk.
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2187.124,2189.771,"No, I did not make myself clear."
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2189.771,2190.939,I thought that's what you said.
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2190.939,2194.439,The Court did not enjoin picketing per se.
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2201.345,2202.741,Is that the only injunction?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2202.741,2204.207,That's the only injunction.
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2204.368,2206.873,It did not enjoin picketing on the sidewalk?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2206.873,2208.092,Not at all.
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2215.823,2223.684,You construe that as a meaning enjoined in being anywhere -- picketing anywhere in the parking lot?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2223.684,2225.557,Anywhere in the parking lot at all.
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2226.837,2230.492,And where did it actually take place according to the record?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2230.492,2239.547,Within that parking lot and on the petitioner's walk directly in front of the front door of its premises.
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2342.006,2345.107,"The difficulty is it's not in the record, isn't it?"
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2345.107,2346.03,"Oh, yes."
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2374.004,2380.217,Would these employees have been excluded if they had not had the picket sign?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2380.217,2381.572,They would not.
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2383.754,2385.628,"That's make it public, doesn't it?"
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2385.628,2388.535,"No, because any store then is public."
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2388.751,2390.55,I am talking about the parking lot --
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2390.55,2391.465,What is the difference?
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2392.55,2397.128,So the only way that they become trespassers is when they pick up a sign?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2397.128,2403.297,Is when they conduct their selves in of manner that is inimical to the conduct to the business on the premises.
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2403.297,2404.701,Which is carrying a picket sign?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2404.701,2407.141,"Carrying a picket sign, throwing a bomb."
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2407.141,2407.959,"Well, it did not --"
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2407.959,2408.489,Anything they do --
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2408.489,2409.972,Any bomb thrown in?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2409.972,2411.055,"No, no but anything they do --"
1969.74,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2411.055,2416.619,"In this case, the only thing that made their action illegal was a picket sign?"
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2416.619,2418.539,That's correct.
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2439.807,2446.018,"Suppose there had been a fence around the place, or the guard fence?"
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2446.018,2449.956,That would've tended to indicate that the property was less open to the public.
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2461.551,2464.108,You mean general public?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2464.108,2464.433,General public.
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2464.433,2465.575,Including picket?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2465.575,2472.415,"No, because there the general public is conducting themselves detrimental to our conduct of our business."
1969.74,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2479.117,2495.301,But your contention here is that any part of that property was to be decreed by the law from people who did not come to buy goods from the store?
1969.74,1,41316,shayle_p_fox,,2495.301,2505.091,There was no part of it being used by the general public other than the instance of the pickets or the people who came to buy in the store.
1969.74,2,17581,bernard_dunau,,3550.062,3551.885,"Unless there are any questions, I have nothing further."
1969.74,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3551.885,3554.006,"Yes, I have one."
1969.74,2,17581,bernard_dunau,,3571.68,3577.848,"Sir, the --"
1969.74,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3577.848,3580.004,"Now accept my premise, don't argue with me to the --"
1969.74,2,17581,bernard_dunau,,3580.004,3586.064,"No, I just want to address it to the specific injunction."
1969.74,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3627.057,3633.446,"Well, at least then I gather you'd agree that it would have to be a leman or a tailoring of that provision --"
1969.74,2,17581,bernard_dunau,,3633.446,3633.787,For that --
1969.74,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3633.787,3635.421,-- to deal with the issue of obstruction?
1969.74,2,17581,bernard_dunau,,3635.421,3636.16,That's correct sir.
