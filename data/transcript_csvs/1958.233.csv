1958.233,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,25.043,"Number 233, Naomi Petty, Petitioner, versus Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Commission."
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,26.179,29.182,May it please the Court.
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,389.343,408.427,"Yes, but even if the -- that constitute consent to sue and be sued, you're still though -- you do not have to get over the hurdle, whether there is any substantive obligation, in other words whether the -- there is any immunity involved here because this is a government obligation --"
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,408.427,408.935,If the Government --
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,408.935,412.132,-- with respect to the doctrine of respondent's superior?
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,412.132,427.982,"If the Court please, first, we -- assuming that we are dealing with the sovereign States themselves, then we must find either consent or the equivalent thereof in terms of waiver."
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,427.982,446.453,"Well, I'm -- I'm assuming that there -- that there's no Eleventh Amendment problem in terms of your ability to bring a suit against this bi-state agency because of the clause that you referred to, in other words, that the agency might sue or be sued."
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,446.453,447.085,Yes.
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,447.085,449.977,But there's -- they're still involved in this case.
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,454.092,454.521,That --
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,454.521,469.622,"Or the tort involved here in place of the actions ordinarily if any respond, they have the superior obligation by a public body in respect to the governmental function."
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,469.622,479.664,"Well, the question of governmental function is one which is an open question in this case."
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,489.236,491.58,"Now, you're drawing a distinction between proprietary and governmental function."
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,491.58,492.565,And governmental function.
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,532.956,541.069,"Well, that -- that was -- that's because of the maritime law had taken over, those distinctions of the States, is that it?"
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,541.069,548.477,"That's because the maritime law as interpreted in that case in the Supreme Court, doesn't recognize local rules --"
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,548.477,550.824,"That was the tort submitted by a fire-boat, wasn't it?"
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,550.824,551.601,It was indeed.
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,551.601,553.402,And it was a maritime tort.
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,553.402,554.075,It was maritime tort.
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,554.075,559.242,And then I believe the -- I believe something didn't carry over the State distinctions (Voice overlap) --
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,559.242,565.823,"And we have a maritime tort here also, then we have an analogous situation except that we don't have a fire-boat."
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,565.94,566.989,"That's your case then, isn't it?"
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,566.989,568.897,-- the common carrier charging ferries.
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,568.897,570.097,"Well, that's your case then, isn't it?"
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,570.097,571.839,"No, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,576.577,579.632,"Well, that's one way of disposing it in your favor, isn't it?"
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,579.632,580.94,Precisely.
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,590.034,591.756,And you -- you wouldn't abandon that.
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,591.756,593.631,"Well, no indeed, sir."
1958.233,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,593.631,595.757,You didn't suggest you can be overruled?
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,595.757,597.854,"No, sir, I am not suggesting that at all."
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,609.883,617.381,"Well, now what -- what -- you must see some problems there that make it advisable for you not to rest on -- on that approach."
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,618.119,625.019,"There are -- I have a worthy opponent here and I have asked if he's going to have another side to argue in this case, Justice Brennan."
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,636.062,637.889,"Well, is this suit in admiralty?"
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,637.889,643.544,"This is an -- it's a Jones Act action at the law, but the substantive rights are maritime."
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,647.485,658.115,(Voice Overlap) the Congress say this is a maritime tort that if Congress can simply give members of the crew the same right it gave since it's not available.
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,658.115,671.8,"It did, but in so doing I believe, Mr Justice, that this Court has said repeatedly that this constituted an amendment to the body of the maritime law and it has been so regarded as an integral part."
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,671.8,680.307,"(Voice Overlap) but that means if there wasn't recovery on the maritime law, and Congress granted a new statutory right, that's all that means."
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,680.307,695.723,"Well, the maritime law, if the Court please, I believe, is whatever this Court and Congress have adopted and what Congress has amended from the whole body of the maritime law, going back to what it was at the times of the Colonies."
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,695.723,703.932,Are you suggesting that I understand your desire to have another string to your bow?
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,703.932,725.275,"The provisions of the consent statute of Congress, it seems to me, require a finding of waiver of governmental immunity even if this be regarded as a suit in essence against the States of Tennessee and Missouri themselves."
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,729.988,739.065,"But you said that by reading the condition that Congress imposed made part of its consent to the compact, what's the relevance of that?"
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,739.065,759.988,"The relevance of that is, that here, States are setting up an agency, an instrumentality to carry on activities in two areas which are exclusively federal in nature and control, which the Federal Government has priority to control, first, interstate commerce."
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,762.256,763.245,May I interrupt you?
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,776.9,795.153,"In the reference to the particular compact, what meaning could the words have other than mere surplusage except as a limitation upon the power of the two States to deal with the subject matter of the compact as they saw fit according to their own local rules."
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,795.153,810.9,"Well, it's the most common thing in laws to be sure that you don't deprive and undo something that you don't want to undo and this is just a nice caveat that this doesn't change anything that there before existed."
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,812.682,813.674,It seems to me that --
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,813.674,815.275,It doesn't create any right.
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,825.973,836.126,The -- every seaman has a right under the Jones Act to sue his employer for negligence.
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,836.268,839.108,"Yes, but not -- but not a state employer."
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,839.108,841.14,Except --
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,841.14,852.022,Are you really suggesting that this proviso more than affect statement by Congress and not really talking about the Workmen's Act.
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,862.047,863.392,"No, I'm not suggesting that, Mr. Justice."
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,863.392,864.561,What are you suggesting?
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,864.561,871.848,"I'm suggesting that two States who are doing something which -- without the consent of Congress, they'd be otherwise, unable to do."
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,885.259,885.655,And what is the rule --
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,885.655,886.299,That's what I'm saying.
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,886.299,888.352,-- and what is the rule they gave you?
1958.233,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,902.672,917.157,(Inaudible)
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,917.157,942.447,"It's preserved the status quo as to the right of the United States Government, not only as to its authority over these matters, but also, as to any other person, matter or thing forming the subject matter or a thing forming the subject matter of the aforesaid compact or agreement or otherwise affected by the terms thereof."
1958.233,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,966.625,970.95,"What the courts below say about the provision that they can sue and be sued""?"
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,970.95,978.858,"They went along with the state courts in Missouri and Tennessee both of which give a narrow construction, both of which follow a narrow construction."
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,979.487,983.0,Any reference that were made to our decision in the Keifer case?
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,983.0,985.817,No reference made in your decision in the Keifer case.
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,994.126,997.329,Although those were respondeat superior cases.
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,997.329,997.806,I --
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,997.806,1001.457,In line with distinction on (Inaudible)
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,1001.457,1005.384,"In -- in the main, those were respondeat superior cases."
1958.233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1005.384,1007.191,"That's what the Tenth -- that's the Missouri case, isn't it?"
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,1007.191,1008.582,Yes.
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1012.107,1015.614,Before you leave -- before you go on to the next.
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,1019.012,1019.763,Yes.
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1019.763,1045.777,"What I understand by that -- I understand that you are arguing that in those two States -- I don't know a thing about it (Inaudible), what the law of Missouri and Tennessee is as to the scope of the provision with reference to a public body giving us the authority of just having a provision (Inaudible)."
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,1057.971,1067.777,It means that suit is permitted in contract but not in tort where the language to contract to sue and be sued is used in such -- in such bodies in both Tennessee and Missouri.
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1067.777,1088.587,"Both of these are more specific, does that mean and I can infer from that basing on the judgment for me that in those States that's brazen to see a construction, the equivalent of which is the writing in it, to sue and be sued in contract but not in tort."
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,1090.194,1093.956,"If in respect to their local affairs, purely and simply."
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1093.956,1094.942,I understand that.
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,1094.942,1095.438,Yes.
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1095.438,1117.629,"But it isn't as to their local affair, Tennessee and Missouri could by the legislature say, suppose Tennessee and Missouri by their legislature say, ""When we all grow and we create a public body with the right to sue and be sued, we merely waive the state sovereignty to the tune of contract but not the tort."""
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,1122.326,1125.313,"Without more, this Court cannot say so."
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1127.821,1139.986,"And it says so even though that the tort involved the Jones Act, this Court that comes to the United States can create a Jones Act but can it decide to what extent a State may waive its immunity?"
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,1139.986,1147.12,This Congress -- Congress can decide to the -- which compacts it will approve between States and the conditions.
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1147.12,1150.801,Then you're back -- you're back on your compact.
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,1162.347,1164.514,"I'm sorry, I didn't -- I didn't follow your last question, Mr. Justice."
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1164.514,1167.172,Let me put it more (Inaudible)
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,1203.673,1207.81,"That is part of it, yes, sir, correct."
1958.233,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1223.443,1234.023,"I agree with you entirely, that Congress has conditioned the consent that is implied constitutionally to give but the legality of the compact by appropriate condition."
1958.233,0,21290,douglas_macleod,,1236.834,1237.389,Correct.
1958.233,1,32539,james_m_reeves,,1700.838,1714.966,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1958.233,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1733.576,1739.202,I don't know what that said but as it is the statute limitations run against (Inaudible)
1958.233,1,32539,james_m_reeves,,1739.202,1743.161,"If Your Honor please, I have read that."

1958.233,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2105.498,2108.831,But they have a right to sue and be sued.
1958.233,1,32539,james_m_reeves,,2117.024,2125.298,"If Chief Justice, please, I would not claim that right by a virtue of the grant of the power in the statutory enactment."

1958.233,1,32539,james_m_reeves,,2180.84,2182.878,That's a crucial question.

1958.233,1,32539,james_m_reeves,,2244.07,2244.382,Well --
1958.233,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2244.382,2246.139,But the jury takes it that way.
1958.233,1,32539,james_m_reeves,,2251.274,2255.434,"I think then, Your Honor, it would be terrible and the -- your jurisdiction to determine."

1958.233,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2552.227,2559.527,But the Commerce Clause gives the Congress power to grant legislation and it regulates the interstate commerce.
1958.233,1,32539,james_m_reeves,,2561.84,2561.897,Yes.
1958.233,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2561.897,2568.594,Is your argument that the railroads were owned by the State would not be liable under the Interstate Commerce Act?
1958.233,1,32539,james_m_reeves,,2568.594,2571.878,It would be liable at a suit by the Federal Government.
1958.233,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2571.878,2576.824,But the -- the Federal Government couldn't make it liable if it went into railroad business?
