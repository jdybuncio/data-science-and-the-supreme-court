1986.86-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,51.266,"Mr. Collins, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,51.266,53.985,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,76.381,82.285,"Mr. Collins, let me inquire about that statement, that it's of vital importance to Houston."
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,88.389,89.708,"It has not, Your Honor."
1986.86-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,90.274,94.26,And then reinstated just for purposes of this litigation.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,94.26,96.462,"--That is not correct, your Honor."
1986.86-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,121.445,124.647,"Well, so what is the status?"
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,131.551,135.187,It is already a permanent part of the city of Houston City Code.
1986.86-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,140.407,144.193,Well why wasn't it put in the codification?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,144.193,163.689,"It was not put in the codification because at the time of codification the panel decision in the Hill case by the Fifth Circuit had been decided two to one and we were concerned that if we did put it in, it would be inadvertently be enforced."
1986.86-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.743,200.028,xxx.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,200.028,201.062,That's correct.
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,201.062,207.466,"Well, how can we possibly agree with you on that if the man was acquitted?"
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,207.466,213.955,I think the question is: do the police officers have probable cause to arrest somebody for violation of this statute?
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,220.709,222.092,I don't understand.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,234.785,236.151,That is correct.
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,241.772,243.491,But that's not what the jury found.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,243.491,244.291,There was no jury--
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,244.291,244.857,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,244.857,245.341,--in that case.
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,245.341,246.343,It was tried before a judge.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,248.776,251.228,That is not correct either.
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,258.984,262.603,Well is there any other possible reason why it would have been dismissed?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,262.603,264.555,There are a lot of speculative reasons.
1986.86-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,278.378,279.88,Did it go to trial?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,279.88,285.218,"It did not go to trial to my knowledge, no."
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,450.026,452.059,"Mr. Collins, can I get something squared away?"
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,481.442,484.977,"I believe that your question, Justice Scalia, was, was he acquitted?"
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,487.262,491.464,"Well, I had asked you whether he was tried and I thought you said he wasn't tried."
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,491.464,498.987,"What happened, well it's outside the record, but he was not, the trial was interrupted in the middle."
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,498.987,500.504,By what?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,500.504,503.522,"The fact that the trial, the fact that the trial court judge--"
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,503.522,504.374,Found him not guilty.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,505.124,507.76,--Right.
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,526.304,526.937,Were you [inaudible]?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,526.937,528.937,"No, I was not."
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,528.937,531.805,But the fact is he was found not guilty.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,538.911,540.111,"That's correct, there was."
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,540.111,545.232,And you distinguish that from an acquittal?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,545.232,552.385,"I distinguish it from acquittal because I took the word acquittal to mean that it was submitted to the jury, the jury deliberated and found that he was not guilty."
1986.86-243,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,552.385,554.254,At least he was not convicted?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,554.254,556.22,"He was not convicted, no."
1986.86-243,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,556.22,560.674,xxx.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,560.674,562.36,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1986.86-243,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,562.36,566.812,Why are we sitting on a case where a man was found not guilty?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,566.812,586.142,"Because the individual has raised the argument that the city of Houston is unconstitutional, unconstitutionally denying him the right to exercise his rights of free speech in the area and at the scene of arrest in the city of Houston."
1986.86-243,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,586.142,589.093,The unsuccessful [inaudible].
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,589.093,590.51,He has not been convicted under the ordinance.
1986.86-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,592.745,593.262,Right.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,596.914,598.033,"That's precise, Your honor."
1986.86-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,598.033,599.116,xxx.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,602.068,603.937,The Fifth Circuit sustained his challenge to the ordinance--
1986.86-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,603.937,605.853,And said he had standing to raise the issue.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,605.853,610.941,"--Said he had standing to raise the issue, found the ordinance over broad."
1986.86-243,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,610.941,613.976,But they've taken it under en banc consideration.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,613.976,623.332,They took it under en banc consideration and held eight to seven that Mr. Hill had standing and that the ordinance was over broad.
1986.86-243,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,623.332,629.069,"Well now that he has created all of this havoc, couldn't we just drop the case and get it over with."
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,630.736,632.688,"I don't think so, Justice Marshall."
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,675.895,677.229,What does knowingly interferes mean?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,692.822,696.725,Scienter requires that you have an intent to interrupt the officer.
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,697.309,699.176,Whatever that means.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,699.176,703.379,--If you do not have an intent to interfere with an officer--
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,703.379,705.914,Whatever interfere with the officer means.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,705.914,709.283,--Interfere with the officer means to interrupt him during the course of his duties.
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.283,713.485,"Yes, whatever a court later finds to constitute an interruption."
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,719.639,721.341,The scienter requirement does not require that.
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,722.458,723.226,Right.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,723.226,724.693,--allow you to have probable cause.
1986.86-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,735.934,736.901,Why not?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,747.325,749.141,"Unless the, it was done intentionally--"
1986.86-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,749.141,749.86,It was done intentionally.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,756.064,757.347,--I don't think it is.
1986.86-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,775.226,783.331,"It also says in the execution of his duty as I thought it, unless the abuser interrupt any policeman in the execution of his duty."
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,790.502,799.71,The term execution of his duties is limited by the fact that officers only arrest people for interrupting them during investigations.
1986.86-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,799.71,800.526,How do we know that?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,800.526,801.693,That is in the record.
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,807.364,815.22,"Well does that show that the statute is not overbroad simply because you don't use it in those areas which it shouldn't properly, which it shouldn't apply to?"
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,821.873,831.312,But on the other hand if the statute doesn't cover those areas then what you're saying the overbreadth doctrine is there for is to prevent the city--
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,831.312,832.431,But the statute does cover it.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,843.22,844.572,"--No, we do not."
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,844.572,850.309,"So you're just saying we're not enforcing it in the overbroad areas, but that doesn't make it any less overbroad it seems to me."
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,850.309,859.749,"I think that it makes it less overbroad in the fact that if we looking at whether the statute is overbroad, we have to look at whether it's real and substantial overbreath."
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,877.81,882.364,"I think that would be a good argument if you had a court decision that said this statute only applies to arrests, but you don't."
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,888.601,905.293,"I would also refer you, Justice Scalia, to the complaint which is on page two of the Joint Appendix which states that people are charged for interrupting, willfully, intentionally interrupting a police officer during an investigation."
1986.86-243,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,905.293,912.216,"Mr. Collins, the ordinance is broad; there's no question about this."
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,920.12,924.274,There are three Texas statutes that would cover assault.
1986.86-243,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,924.274,927.893,And to that extent do they preempt the ordinance?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,927.893,929.309,"Yes, they do to that extent."
1986.86-243,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,929.309,935.749,Can you give us some examples of instances that are not preempted by state statutes?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,935.749,936.715,Yes.
1986.86-243,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,968.72,975.124,"Well can you give a, any kind of a definition of a so-called legitimate scope of the ordinance."
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,975.124,991.567,I think that the ordinance's legitimate scope should be limited to intentional acts during an investigation where an individual attempts to interfere or interrupt a police officer.
1986.86-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,991.567,1005.309,Didn't the Court of Appeals here say that the conduct that was involved here could constitutionally be forbidden?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1005.309,1006.859,"I think it did, yes."
1986.86-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1006.859,1013.499,"Said this was a, this was a proper, this was a constitutional application of the ordinance but that didn't cure the overbreadth problem."
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1013.499,1014.632,That's correct.
1986.86-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1021.452,1027.44,How do you distinguish the Lewis Case from this--
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1027.44,1033.944,Lewis was a case where the statute was directly aimed at speech.
1986.86-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1042.882,1050.888,"--Well, but could not the statute under your interpretation of its legitimate scope fall squarely under Lewis?"
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1058.225,1059.827,"Yes you can, Justice O'Connor."
1986.86-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1059.827,1064.379,"And so in your view, it would be legitimate to apply the ordinance to that."
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1064.379,1065.565,That is correct.
1986.86-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1065.565,1067.767,So how do you distinguish Lewis?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1067.767,1074.92,"I distinguish Lewis because Lewis on its face dealt with words, there was, it was an overbroad statute."
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1096.833,1103.153,"What, what, excuse me, what is left other than speech that isn't preempted by the other state laws?"
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1110.842,1116.413,--If you touched him or caused bodily injury it would be covered by assault statute.
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1116.413,1116.83,Right.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1116.83,1126.036,"But if you walked into the middle of the investigation, stood next to the arresting officer and the suspect and began talking in a loud voice while he was reading the Miranda warning to the suspect--"
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1126.036,1126.469,That's speech.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1126.469,1127.169,--that's certainly is misconduct.
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.169,1127.502,Right.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1127.502,1129.185,It's also speech with action.
1986.86-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1129.185,1129.968,So what's the action?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1132.037,1135.156,"No, it will also apply to conduct."
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.233,1155.252,Does this sign say something on it?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1158.437,1160.973,"--I don't think it's relevant whether the sign would say anything on it, or not."
1986.86-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1160.973,1162.006,It isn't?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1164.091,1169.876,"It would be, it would be speech but it would also be conduct."
1986.86-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1169.876,1171.195,Well didn't the ordinance--
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1189.472,1191.491,"Yes, it was directed at, only at language."
1986.86-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1192.558,1193.508,At the police.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1194.193,1194.743,Directed at the police.
1986.86-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1194.743,1197.228,--In the performance of their duty.
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1203.632,1206.668,I have a whole area of conduct.
1986.86-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1212.922,1217.726,Well are you now saying that it could not apply then to interruption by speech?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1217.726,1219.976,"--No, I am not saying that."
1986.86-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1219.976,1222.644,"You think it could apply to the speech, the interrupt?"
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1222.644,1222.994,Yes.
1986.86-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1222.994,1225.78,And how do you distinguish Lewis?
1986.86-243,0,39024,robert_j_collins,,1225.78,1232.235,"I distinguish Lewis on the basis that Lewis, the statute in Lewis was a statute that could not apply to conduct."
1986.86-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1358.132,1359.168,"Thank you, Mr. Collins."
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1362.47,1364.136,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1412.117,1417.604,"Said that could be a form, Mr. Wright, that isn't inconsistent with Counsel's oral statement here."
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1417.604,1423.591,"--It is certainly inconsistent, Mr. Chief Justice, with his answer to you that the defendant was not tried."
1986.86-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1485.565,1489.1,"Well, Mr. Wright, perhaps I didn't follow you just then."
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1493.171,1493.671,--That's right.
1986.86-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1493.671,1496.64,Are you saying that inexorably means that it was repealed?
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1496.64,1511.132,"It would have been had the city attorney not in the request for council action in 1985 said, do not include section 3411A in the new code but do not repeal it also because we are currently involved in a lawsuit."
1986.86-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1514.251,1515.734,So it isn't repealed.
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1515.734,1517.069,"It is not repealed, no."
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1583.645,1589.799,That the Court of Appeals held that the conduct involved here was subject to sanction.
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1589.799,1590.965,"No, sir."
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1590.965,1591.515,It isn't?
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1591.515,1592.667,It is not.
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1610.213,1616.283,"So it wouldn't, so it didn't make any difference to him whether it was proscribable or not?"
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1616.283,1620.735,"No, on the view that he took of the case he found it invalid for overbreadth--"
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.735,1621.119,Right.
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1621.119,1624.87,"--did not, as we read the opinion, reach the issue of as applied."
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1633.209,1635.161,Why did you take a cross appeal?
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1635.161,1635.661,--Pardon?
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1635.661,1636.78,Why did you take a cross appeal?
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1636.78,1648.319,To collect damages since he held that we were not entitled to damages and also that for reasons that we did not fathom that we're not entitled to have expunged record of Mr. Hill's arrest.
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.319,1656.575,"But you don't, you weren't appealing against any claim that the ordinance was constitutionally applied in this case?"
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1656.575,1667.299,We are taking a cross appeal from the failure to award us remedies to which we believe that we are entitled.
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1705.424,1705.824,xxx standing?
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1705.824,1706.757,"--That's what gives him standing, right."
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1706.757,1713.53,"Different from O'Shea and Rizzo and Lyons, those cases?"
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1713.53,1719.434,"I, the judges below thought so and I submit so, yes."
1986.86-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1736.444,1743.049,"Mr. Wright, anyone who reads the first dozen pages of Mr. Hill's testimony knows that he'll be back."
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1744.249,1747.584,"--That, that, that seems to me a fair statement, Justice Marshall."
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1749.286,1751.286,"That's what the Court of Appeals thought too, I guess."
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1751.286,1753.071,"Yes, I think so."
1986.86-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1823.252,1827.719,"Well is that necessarily relevant to the constitutional analysis, Mr. Wright?"
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1874.934,1877.652,"I, can't recall the case either, but I think that--"
1986.86-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1877.652,1878.719,"Well, I don't think there is one."
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1878.719,1902.667,"--No, it may well be out on principle that has to be the result I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that the reason for Broderick v. Oklahoma and for the substantial overbreadth is that if a statute in most of its applications is valid then we're not going to strike it even though there is some imprecision and the stretch is too far at the outside."
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1939.841,1946.344,Could you think of some valid applications of the statute if there weren't this Texas Preemption Doctrine.
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1946.344,1946.796,--Well sure.
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1948.029,1948.513,"Yes, a lot of them."
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1950.398,1951.115,There would be a lot of them.
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1951.431,1958.587,Absent the preemption doctrine would it be substantially overbroad?
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1958.587,1968.86,I think that becomes a very close question because I think there are so many impermissible applications and it is used in practice so often in an impermissible way.
1986.86-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.268,1994.51,"Mr. Wright, is it clear that whether overbroadness is, overbreadth is substantial overbreadth is determined on the basis of proportionality?"
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2024.779,2033.301,"There is a great deal, Justice Scalia, of the overbreadth doctrine as this Court seems to have formulated it, that I find very strange indeed."
1986.86-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2285.446,2290.45,--Don't you think the Texas courts might take that into consideration in construing the ordinance?
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2290.45,2299.373,"--It's awfully hard, Mr. Chief Justice, when you have an ordinance that says, ""in any manner interrupt""."
1986.86-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2394.084,2407.075,"Mr. Wright, the Seconds, this is a hundred year old ordinance and just for fun, I looked up interrupt in the Second Webster's International and it gives an obsolete meaning of the word."
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2441.581,2442.448,Of course I would.
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2496.2,2508.459,What is your understanding of the relationship between the overbreadth doctrine and the ability to limit an ordinance in one city?
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2545.633,2546.649,I think--
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2546.649,2549.284,Just because he's done A.
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2549.284,2554.571,"--I think that it would, depends on how the case comes to you."
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2557.106,2558.556,xxx this is in the federal court.
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2561.677,2568.748,--In that case you would consider whether there is a realistic possibility of a limiting construction from the state court.
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2568.748,2570.331,What if there was?
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2570.331,2574.568,If there is a realistic possibility then abstention becomes possible--
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.568,2578.77,You couldn't uphold the conviction though.
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2581.572,2584.441,"--In federal court, you wouldn't be upholding a conviction I wouldn't think."
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2584.441,2587.96,"I mean, you wouldn't uphold the ordinance."
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2592.446,2600.719,"You would either say it's invalid or if there seemed a reasonable, a real possibility of getting an answer by abstention from the state court, you might abstain."
1986.86-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2600.719,2602.921,Yes.
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2602.921,2614.61,But it seems to that Justice O'Connor in the Hawaiian Housing case to which we heard reference early today made the very important point that there are always possibilities.
1986.86-243,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2635.758,2640.094,"Well, we could test out the certification procedure, I guess."
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2640.094,2650.902,--Well you can if Mr. Hill wants to be a guinea pig I suppose we'll have to test the certification procedure.
1986.86-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2693.895,2700.149,"Suppose it just said, interrupt means obstruct?"
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2700.149,2703.787,I would have considerable difficulty still--
1986.86-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2703.787,2714.642,"Then you would have considerable difficulty with, not just this ordinance, but the whole mess of ordinances that are included as an appendix to the reply brief of the state."
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2714.642,2733.139,"--I would have, not at all, Justice Scalia, and I am glad that you addressed that point because it seems to me that these ordinances that are contained in the reply brief are a remarkably unhelpful collection of things, many of them on their face, have no possible application."
1986.86-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2757.087,2764.908,"Others that say for example, any person who shall in any way or manner hinder, obstruct, molest, resist or otherwise interfere with any city officer."
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2764.908,2766.193,But that doesn't help us.
1986.86-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2766.193,2773.681,It's very hard to get more precise language to prevent what they're trying to prevent.
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2773.681,2777.085,"With respect, I don't think, I do not agree that it is."
1986.86-243,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2908.32,2919.527,"Professor Wright, I think, obviously you would agree that the part of the ordinance that deals with physical interruption, if that were all that were before us, would be perfectly lawful."
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2919.527,2920.277,"Would be what, sir?"
1986.86-243,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2920.277,2923.729,Physical interruption rather than speech?
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2924.162,2926.264,That would raise no First Amendment problem.
1986.86-243,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2933.87,2934.72,"--Preemption, right."
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2947.795,2948.547,"Oh, no."
1986.86-243,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2951.999,2958.152,The problem is one that Justice Scalia raised on how do you write that out?
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2958.152,2961.437,I think that they can if they need too.
1986.86-243,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3032.967,3035.902,May I put a very simple example to you?
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3073.444,3075.395,I think yes.
1986.86-243,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3075.395,3089.553,And the problem I come back to and this is one you have addressed is now one draws an ordinance that would cover a situation like that and yet not be overbroad.
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3089.553,3107.265,"I repeat that I think it can be done, but I would take my stand with the draftsmen of the Texas Penal Code and that portion of the report at page 18 of our brief that in case of doubt it is better to under penalize than to over penalize."
1986.86-243,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3148.425,3159.132,"Sometimes it involves language as it occurred here that isn't just directed to the policeman, but it stirs up a crowd as well and the policeman worries about that."
1986.86-243,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3178.011,3189.402,"--I think, Justice Scalia, the statute for example that was upheld in Colten v. Kentucky and that seems to me to address itself to that kind of a problem in a much more effective way."
1986.86-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3242.536,3244.303,"--Thank you, Mr. Wright."
1986.86-243,2,39024,robert_j_collins,,3252.392,3265.235,"In response to the argument about the unfettered discretion of the Houston Police Department, I think that the testimony of Officer Kelley in the record is a perfect example of the fact that this discretion is not abused."
1986.86-243,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3288.499,3290.435,"Mr. Collins, do you, I just want to be sure of one thing."
1986.86-243,2,39024,robert_j_collins,,3297.088,3298.373,"--Yes, we agree with it."
1986.86-243,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3298.373,3300.106,And about how many convictions under the ordinance?
1986.86-243,2,39024,robert_j_collins,,3300.106,3307.062,"I do not know, Your Honor."
1986.86-243,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3456.659,3459.544,"That isn't what it says at all, is it?"
1986.86-243,2,39024,robert_j_collins,,3459.544,3468.216,It has a scienter requirement and the fact is that the city has applied it only in investigations.
1986.86-243,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3474.97,3481.524,"Mr. Collins, if that's the case when they've repealed it and they're putting it back in the code, why don't they re-write it in that fashion?"
1986.86-243,2,39024,robert_j_collins,,3485.012,3495.368,"I would agree on its face it is, but I also think that this Court has in the past taken cognizance of administrative determinations and administrative constructions placed on it."
1986.86-243,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3495.368,3503.406,"I mean, just the very change of the words from execution of his duty to during an investigation which carve out a big chunk of this ordinance."
1986.86-243,2,39024,robert_j_collins,,3508.46,3518.733,"Again, if we go back and look at what people are charged with and what they're tried for in the Appendix, it is willfully, intentionally interrupting an officer during an investigation."
1986.86-243,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3518.733,3524.653,"This great investigation were to find out if a man was drunk or crazy, right?"
1986.86-243,2,39024,robert_j_collins,,3524.653,3526.589,"No, it was not, Justice Marshall."
1986.86-243,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3526.589,3528.655,"Well, what else was he investigating?"
1986.86-243,2,39024,robert_j_collins,,3528.655,3532.743,"He was attempting to find out why the man was standing in the middle of the street, blocking traffic."
1986.86-243,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3532.743,3534.543,Well can you give me any other reason than those two?
1986.86-243,2,39024,robert_j_collins,,3536.561,3537.661,Not at this point in time.
1986.86-243,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3538.313,3541.764,"Well that's, you going to investigate to find a third reason?"
1986.86-243,2,39024,robert_j_collins,,3541.764,3552.636,"I believe the reason that was given, and it's in the record, is that the individual wanted to stop traffic so he could back a truck out into the street."
1986.86-243,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3571.949,3572.783,"Thank you, Mr. Collins."
