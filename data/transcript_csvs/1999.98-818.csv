1999.98-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.004,"We'll hear argument next in Number 98-818, Harold Rice v. Benjamin Cayetano."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,54.235,58.703,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,87.289,89.239,"Mr. Olson, I just want to make one question."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,96.562,100.447,"--It would be, particularly with respect to the Fifteenth Amendment, Justice Stevens."
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,114.774,115.457,"No, but your answer to my question is yes, isn't it?"
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,115.457,136.703,"Yes, particularly with respect to the Fifteenth Amendment, but Hawaii prohibits, despite the fact he is a citizen, Mr. Rice from voting in a State-conducted election for State officials who annually distribute millions of dollars of proceeds from State-owned property and money appropriated from Hawaiian taxpayers."
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,172.395,194.642,"Well, wouldn't a clear, simple way to resolve this case in your favor be to say that the mechanism here is just an overreading of Salyer and James v. Ball, and that it denies one person one vote?"
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,205.783,210.168,"Well, I think that issue was in the case and was withdrawn from the case."
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,235.969,241.456,"But if we were to say it denies one person one vote under Reynolds v. Sims, that would give you the relief you seek."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,241.456,246.526,"--If this Court rules in our favor on that grounds, we of course would be satisfied."
1999.98-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.597,257.482,You say it was in the case earlier and withdrawn.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,258.75,261.202,"--I can't recall the circumstances, Justice O'Connor."
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,272.076,289.787,"May I ask on the racial discrimination point, supposing there is a citizen of Hawaii who has the same racial makeup as the native Hawaiian, he came, however, from Tahiti or some place else, and is a citizen of the State, has exactly the same race as the others, but he's denied the vote."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,292.072,295.274,"Yes, he would be denied a vote on account of race, because--"
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,295.274,297.543,Even though he's of the same race as those who were allowed to vote?
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,297.543,306.565,"--Well, it depends upon... this Court has said repeatedly that the definition of race relates to drawing a line with respect to a person's ancestors."
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.805,382.797,"Well, I... even if the Tahitian is of the same race, I mean, the fact that you give special privileges to some people of one race, though not to all people of that race, would not make it any better, would it?"
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,382.797,383.982,I agree completely.
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.101,389.303,"The thing is, unless you're of that race, you can't qualify."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,389.303,389.703,--That's--
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.703,391.319,Not everybody of that race may qualify.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,391.319,404.645,"--That's correct, and an interesting example of that is Loving v. Virginia, where the Supreme Court there was dealing with racial discrimination with respect to miscegenation, interracial marriage."
1999.98-818,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,436.634,442.538,"The Twenty-sixth Amendment treats age identically to race in the Fifteenth Amendment, doesn't it?"
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,467.253,471.955,"--Well, Justice Breyer, the definition ties to race."
1999.98-818,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,474.657,481.663,"Well, I understand that, but is it your opinion you do have to let every 18-year-old in the neighborhood vote for the board of the senior services center?"
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,481.663,483.529,"I think that's a totally different... no, I don't."
1999.98-818,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,483.529,484.448,All right.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,506.812,514.9,"First of all, Justice Breyer, the land was put in trust, and it's not like a bank, a trust in the concept of banks and trustees and beneficiaries."
1999.98-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,619.968,626.805,"Mr. Olson, isn't the Salyer case and the Ball v. James case a useful tool for analyzing that very thing?"
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,634.078,638.263,"--It's a very good question, and the respondent has relied upon that case."
1999.98-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,710.061,723.786,"Well, I think Mancari deserves some comment, where special provisions and preferences were provided for Native Americans."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,740.33,755.09,"What this Court, Justice O'Connor, did in the Mancari case is make it very clear that it was analyzing the extent to which Congress had power under the Constitution to act with respect to Indian tribes as quasi-sovereigns under the Constitution."
1999.98-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,798.266,809.141,Is it possible that the Congress and/or the State could treat Hawaiians as it treats Native Americans--
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,809.141,810.508,"--Well, in the first place--"
1999.98-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,810.508,812.51,--under the Indian Commerce Clause?
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,813.56,823.4,"--No, because the unit that we're talking about, the collection of people that we're talking about in the first place has never been considered or perceived of as a tribe."
1999.98-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,824.383,825.383,Right.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,825.383,828.001,--states... I just want to make that point if I may.
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,839.643,854.985,"Is it your view, Mr. Olson... I understand your point about Mancari involving tribes... that if you had the same case as Mancari, but they included within the preferred group some people who are not members of a tribe, would that have compelled a different result, in your view?"
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,854.985,859.454,"--I think one would have to examine the context of the case, because--"
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,859.454,867.46,"The only change in... it's actually exactly the same, except that the preferred group is defined to include some Native Americans who are not tribal members."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,867.46,870.012,--That seemed to be the clear import of the--
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,870.012,870.462,I understand.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,871.562,872.162,--Yes.
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.162,873.747,"--that if those were the facts, that would be unconstitutional?"
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,873.747,896.593,"Yes, and it seems to be the clear import of the case, and then the Court... this Court reinforced that in the Yakima Nation case by saying, the unique status of Indian tribes under... and this is a partial answer to Justice O'Connor's question... permits the Federal Government, not the State government, to enact legislation singling out Indians because of the tribal characteristic, legislation that otherwise might be constitutionally offensive."
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,896.593,897.112,So then--
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,916.157,917.693,I think... well--
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,917.693,918.993,Suppose they passed a law that said--
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,918.993,921.145,"--That... of course, that is not a Fifteenth Amendment case."
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.195,924.28,"--I understand that, but we're talking about--"
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,924.28,925.213,"And, of course--"
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,925.213,926.247,--discrimination on the basis of race.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,926.247,935.404,--And I think that that may raise a serious constitutional question under the Fourteenth Amendment if it was limited to... if the State was--
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,935.404,935.97,Yes.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,935.97,937.12,--enacted legislation--
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,937.12,940.872,"Well, we have some that allow tribes to run casinos."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,940.872,941.308,--Yes.
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,941.308,953.116,"If that kind of legislation were expanded to allow any group of American Indians to, whether they're tribal or not to run a casino but nobody else."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,953.116,957.251,I'm not sure I'm understanding the question.
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,958.334,959.536,The question's very easy.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,959.536,964.055,"--It's the answer that's hard, perhaps."
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,964.772,968.876,The special permission is not given to Indian tribes.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,972.428,989.705,"I think... I think that that would be unconstitutional, because Congress' power to operate with respect to Indians, as this Court has made clear over and over again, derives from the Indian Commerce Clause or the Indian Treaty Clause, and that has to do with the status of Indian tribes, not as Indian people."
1999.98-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,989.705,992.574,"So if you had Alaska Natives, the result would have to be different?"
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,992.574,1007.084,"Well, there are... in fact there was a specific distinction between the way Alaska was treated and the way Hawaii was treated when it was entered into the Nation, because there were Indian tribes in Alaska, so to the extent we're talking about people who were not members of tribes--"
1999.98-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1007.084,1019.058,"Well, that may have been in the Act of Admission or in the statutes, but constitutionally, as I understand your answer both to Justice Scalia and Justice Stevens, constitutionally the answer would have to be different."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1019.058,1024.295,"--The answer would be the same to the extent that the people in Alaska were part of a tribe, any tribe."
1999.98-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1024.295,1024.811,"No, but they--"
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1024.811,1025.412,If they were--
1999.98-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1025.412,1035.334,"--My question is assuming that they were not organized on the same tribal scheme, the tribal sovereignty scheme that the Indians of the Lower 48 States were, so the result would have to be different."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1035.334,1038.435,--We'd have to make... we'd make the same case there as we would here.
1999.98-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1038.435,1038.887,Yes.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1038.887,1040.071,And--
1999.98-818,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1040.071,1042.357,"Mr. Olson, one part of it I don't understand."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1102.962,1106.497,"--Let me answer that... there are several answers to that, Justice Ginsburg."
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1162.001,1166.421,You mean you're contradicting the congressional resolution that said we were guilty?
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1170.956,1172.156,"--Of course not, and this Court--"
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1172.156,1173.325,Can't Congress make history?
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1174.008,1177.96,"--Congress does make history, but Congress, of course, can't change history."
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1224.008,1229.761,"No, but your theory is that about 85 percent of the population of Hawaii are the victims we're talking about."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1229.761,1232.696,"As a matter of fact, the--"
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1232.696,1234.315,Is that not right?
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1234.315,1234.815,--No.
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1243.171,1246.373,So that 80 percent are the victims of the discrimination we're talking about.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1246.373,1246.856,Yes.
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1248.523,1258.096,"If... assume... it didn't happen, but assume that in 1790 the United States discovered Hawaii, Cook discovered Hawaii."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1263.148,1267.286,"Well, in fact, the United States had treaties with the monarchy of Hawaii."
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1267.286,1271.904,"No, no, I'm talking about before 1810, before Kamehameha."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1271.904,1276.475,"No, because there wasn't a tribal government at the time."
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1276.475,1277.608,So the United States is simply powerful?
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1277.608,1278.408,Before 18--
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1278.408,1279.094,Powerless.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1283.229,1288.8,"--Well, as I understand it, between 1890 and 19... 1810 there was a civil war going on."
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1290.818,1291.485,But... no.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1308.613,1311.665,--It may have had power to deal with the entity.
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1313.281,1314.017,There was no entity.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1314.017,1339.982,"--Foreign policy powers to deal with the entity, but we're talking about, and we're talking about a period of time before the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment, which made very clear what our country would do with respect to racial discriminations, and if we pick any date in history after 1778, the Hawaiian population consists of people that are in protected... in the benefited class here, and are not in the benefited class."
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1397.754,1400.039,Let me ask a question that Justice Kennedy's question prompted.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1427.273,1429.392,"--I don't think so, Justice Stevens."
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1429.392,1429.908,You don't think--
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1429.908,1430.542,"I do not think so, and--"
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1430.542,1432.51,--Congress would not have the power to make that kind of a deal.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1432.51,1435.046,--I don't see where it would come from in the Constitution.
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1446.535,1448.854,"Right, I'm saying, we'll give this to you and all of your descendants."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1448.854,1449.889,Forever and ever and ever.
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1449.889,1450.306,Right.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1450.306,1456.626,"I don't think that that's consistent at all with the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution, especially if it involved voting."
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1464.196,1468.85,"And make my hypothetical saying, and your descendants can vote when they're only 15 years old."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1469.733,1469.899,--Pardon?
1999.98-818,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1469.899,1478.589,"To get voting into it, I'd say we give you, a) a tax exemption, and b) the right to have your children vote when they're 14 years old, and all your descendants."
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1479.739,1487.259,I think that is a discrimination on the basis of ancestry which this Court has said over and over again is a discrimination on the basis of race.
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1500.835,1514.076,"--In Justice Stevens' hypothetical and my hypothetical, would the United States have power to pass legislation consistent with the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment, and to make agreements with those people?"
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1514.076,1516.678,"I think I answered that, and I think the answer is no."
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1518.797,1520.247,The United States is simply powerless.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1521.097,1521.848,To--
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1521.848,1523.031,--Under the foreign affairs power?
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1523.031,1531.287,"--Well, to make a distinction among citizens on the basis of race in the voting booth, I think that is precluded by the Fifteenth--"
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1531.287,1534.822,"No, the hypothetical is, can they deal with them at all?"
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1539.726,1540.993,"--No, I think that... yes."
1999.98-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1551.533,1553.683,The Government can annex territory.
1999.98-818,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1555.402,1556.102,Of course. Of course.
1999.98-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1603.999,1605.366,"Very well, Mr. Olson."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1607.285,1613.189,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.054,1640.256,"Well now, just a minute."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1645.743,1657.634,"Because it flows from the Indian affairs power, and under that power Congress has the authority to determine what groups should be beneficiaries of the trust status, for how long, and to what extent."
1999.98-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1657.634,1660.503,So you think... and what did Congress do?
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1660.503,1669.959,"Congress has singled out Hawaiians as a beneficiary of a trust relationship, just like the trust relationship that is extended to American Indians--"
1999.98-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1669.959,1674.66,Did Congress ratify this particular statute that's being challenged here?
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1674.66,1676.012,--It hasn't ratified it.
1999.98-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1679.164,1684.201,"What does that mean, Mr. Roberts, to say Congress has recognized a State statute?"
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1684.201,1691.539,"--Congress, in the Statehood Act, delegated to the State of Hawaii the responsibility for implementing the trust relationship"
1999.98-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1717.506,1722.926,And this is all done under Congress' power to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes?
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1722.926,1723.843,"Yes, it is."
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1729.98,1732.199,"It doesn't say Indian, it says Indian tribes."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1743.157,1744.124,Congress--
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1744.124,1752.096,"--and say, you know, we have the exclusive power to regulate commerce with Native Americans, whether they're on reservations or not?"
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1752.096,1753.28,--Two points.
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1778.663,1781.865,"They remain wards of the United States, and the United States--"
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1781.865,1782.682,Congress is... Congress--
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.682,1784.834,--is the Great White Father perpetually.
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1784.834,1791.138,"--Your question contains, it seems, an objection to Indian law jurisprudence, and that's not the point."
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.624,1801.426,The question is whether its source is the tribal character of the Indians.
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1802.278,1802.812,Yes.
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1802.812,1835.167,"Now, the only provision in the Constitution I know of that refers not to Indian tribes but to Indians is the provision of the Fourteenth Amendment altering the way you count citizens in order to decide how many votes a State has, and it says representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1881.814,1892.336,"The question is what tribes meant in the Constitution, and tribes at the time of the Framing was defined as a distinct body of people divided by family or fortune or any other characteristic."
1999.98-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1899.692,1901.776,"But Mancari was more restrictive than that, wasn't it?"
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1901.776,1902.309,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1999.98-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1902.309,1905.93,"What we said in Mancari was more restrictive than that, wasn't it?"
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1905.93,1911.917,"Mancari referred to federally recognized tribes because that's the way the preference was written in that case, but that--"
1999.98-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1911.917,1928.193,"But it emphasized the organizational or organized character of the tribes, and... which seems to go against this great level of generality which you're trying to import into it by reference to the 18th Century definitions."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1928.193,1929.545,"--Well, it's not a level of generality."
1999.98-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1935.532,1952.292,"Well, it rests with Congress once we have identified what is meant by Indian tribe under the Indian Commerce Clause, and Mancari seems to say that, as Justice Scalia has suggested, that in fact the definition is narrower than you are arguing for."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1952.292,1960.747,"Well, and my point is that it referred to federally recognized tribes simply because that's the way the preference was written, but that doesn't answer the objection that it's a race-based preference."
1999.98-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1972.372,1974.305,"Well, it wasn't sufficient, but it was necessary."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1975.924,1989.933,"To qualify for the benefit, and the reason it was not race-based was because... not because of tribal status per se, but because the tribe was the proper subject of Congress' exercise of its Indian affairs power, so--"
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1989.933,1996.753,"Well, but it seems to me, Mr. Roberts, that you begin by saying, now, this is not race, it's a trust."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2019.686,2020.219,"--Oh, that is--"
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2020.219,2027.607,"--and it seems to me that when you tell us, oh, don't worry about it, it's a trust, that just diverts our attention from the real issue in the case."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2027.607,2038.295,"--The question whether they can be treated under Mancari is whether they can qualify under the Constitution as an object of Congress' Indian affairs power, and this Court has seen this case before."
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2073.551,2091.78,"So your answer to my casino hypothetical that I put to your friend would be the opposite, that Congress could indeed deem every person with Indian blood in his veins to be a member of an Indian tribe and allow those people and only those people to conduct casinos?"
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2091.78,2096.149,I think that raises a question on the application of Mancari.
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2107.939,2117.997,"Well, the obligation would be the same one that's alleged here, that we've treated their ancestors, you know, shamefully, and we're making up for it."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2117.997,2123.068,"--That wasn't the... that's not the obligation at issue here, nor was it the obligation in Mancari."
1999.98-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2144.481,2164.395,"Well, what if Congress had at the time we acquired the Mexican cession, California, New Mexico, Arizona, had set up a special trust for people who were living in that territory at that time, who were almost entirely Spanish-speaking."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2165.978,2170.965,"I think not, Your Honor, because there you would bump up against the constitutional limitation to Indian tribes."
1999.98-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2179.552,2182.504,"Okay, now what does... how do you define Native inhabitants?"
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2187.141,2205.286,"It's traced from Chief Justice Marshall's opinions in cases like Worcester v. Georgia and Johnson v. M'Intosh, where he recognized the basic distinction between the aboriginal indigenous people and the European newcomers, and that, by the way, is the only purpose served by the 1778 date."
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2210.59,2218.446,"Oh, we do have a racial distinction embedded in the Constitution between aboriginals and European newcomers?"
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2219.679,2227.302,"--It's not only in the Constitution, in the Commerce With Indian Tribes, it's in the Civil War amendments, the passage Your Honor quoted previously."
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2228.485,2229.552,Related to tribes.
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2234.955,2236.49,--And Congress has determined--
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.49,2236.79,It was for Indian tribes.
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2236.79,2242.061,--And Congress has determined that it can treat with Hawaiians as it treats with Indian tribes.
1999.98-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2261.523,2265.558,Was that contemporaneous with the recognition of the OHA?
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2265.558,2276.699,"--The passage I was just referring to is a much more recent 1988 legislation 10 years later, but Congress has treated with Native Hawaiians consistently since--"
1999.98-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2276.699,2281.686,"But don't we have to look at what Hawaii has done, not what Congress has done?"
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2290.625,2299.981,--What the Federal Government did at Statehood was delegate to the State of Hawaii the responsibility for implementing the Federal trust relationship.
1999.98-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2306.235,2309.104,But it didn't say you're exempt from the Fifteenth Amendment.
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2309.104,2309.87,"--No, it did not."
1999.98-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2309.87,2310.737,And I suppose it can't.
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2310.737,2311.206,No.
1999.98-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2311.206,2316.074,"So the question is, does this statute comply with the Fifteenth Amendment?"
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2318.193,2318.66,And--
1999.98-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2318.66,2319.86,Could we talk about that?
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2319.86,2337.087,"--Under this Court's decision in Yakima, where a State law is implemented pursuant to, flows from, is based on Federal classification under the Indian affairs power, it's examined under Mancari just like a Federal legislation would be."
1999.98-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2343.677,2355.651,Would it violate anything Congress passed if Hawaii were to extend the vote in this trust arrangement to people without the racial qualification?
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2364.923,2367.875,"No, I don't think that in itself would violate anything."
1999.98-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2375.246,2382.385,Would it breach... would it breach the trust that has been established to extend the vote to--
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2382.385,2383.518,It would interfere--
1999.98-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2383.518,2384.018,--Hawaiian citizens?
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2384.018,2389.122,"--I don't know that it would breach the trust, but it would make implementation of it more difficult, for this reason."
1999.98-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2405.75,2410.119,OHA is kind of an independent sovereignty in the State of Hawaii?
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2410.119,2412.237,"--No, it's not an independent sovereignty."
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2421.61,2422.61,But it does much more than that.
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2438.405,2444.042,"--By Hawaiians, you mean the group that can trace at least one ancestor to 1778?"
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2444.042,2444.425,Yes.
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2444.425,2445.175,Yes that's true.
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2446.725,2452.712,"So you're talking about the Native Hawaiians in the trust, but the purposes of OHA are much broader than that."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2452.712,2454.664,"Well, there's some confusion--"
1999.98-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2454.664,2455.85,And they are generally governmental in character.
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2455.85,2466.722,"--There's some confusion because the Federal statutes use the phrase, Native Hawaiians to refer to all covered by the trust relationship with one ancestor, and the distinction is in the Hawaiian legislation."
1999.98-818,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2478.114,2480.216,That I think is the problem.
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2501.377,2506.614,Congress has changed the definition of the group to whom it's extended this trust relationship.
1999.98-818,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2513.518,2526.594,"So might this be all right if it were just for the Native Hawaiians, but not all right if it includes more than half the people who are really like everyone in Hawaii but for the fact that they can trace one ancestor back?"
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2526.594,2536.783,"I think not, because Congress since before OHA in 1974, defined the group that is the beneficiary of the trust relationship to include those who can trace one ancestor back."
1999.98-818,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2540.185,2544.489,"Could you also respond to Justice Kennedy... well, you ask... I wanted him to respond to your question."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2561.95,2566.402,--It does not have any general governmental responsibilities.
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2578.809,2589.267,"Mr. Roberts, assuming that the treat with the Indians power of the Federal Government includes Indians generally, and not just tribes."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2596.255,2597.456,"Oh, it's done it frequently."
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2599.989,2600.991,Can it delegate the power to make a treaty?
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2605.61,2610.847,"No, I don't think it could have, but it has frequently delegated lesser responsibilities."
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.238,2630.194,"But the State... that's the State governing people on the reservation, at least its own citizens there."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2648.222,2657.161,"Well, the situation in Hawaii is unique, and under our Federal system, it's open to Congress to say that we're going to work with the State to implement this responsibility."
1999.98-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2665.701,2668.553,"Public Law 280 isn't... doesn't support you at all, I don't think."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2685.662,2697.053,"--Well, I... with respect, Your Honor, I think Public Law 280 is a delegation of responsibility to enforce those criminal laws, because the State would be without power to do so in the absence of the delegation."
1999.98-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2697.053,2698.322,"Yes, but they're general laws."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2703.809,2706.761,"Well, in OHA it doesn't draw up special laws."
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2729.841,2740.332,"It's unusual, but it's not a delegation of Federal power, and here you're saying they left it to the State to decide who can vote on the basis of tribal membership--"
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2740.332,2741.899,The question would be--
1999.98-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.899,2742.867,--or aboriginal membership.
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2742.867,2754.159,"--The question would be, under Mancari, whether it's rationally related to fulfilling Congress' trust obligation, and if the State strays from that, it can be brought back to that standard."
1999.98-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2784.659,2801.62,"Well, yes, but presumably Hawaii would not have the authority to violate the First Amendment in structuring the State laws, and perhaps not to violate the Fourteenth Amendment, and perhaps not to violate the Fifteenth Amendment."
1999.98-818,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2801.62,2812.309,"--Because the OHA voting provision implements the Federal classification based on Native status, it's not race-based, and therefore doesn't violate the Fifteenth Amendment."
1999.98-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2813.011,2814.011,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2815.98,2829.204,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-818,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2840.911,2855.838,"Mr. Kneedler, do I understand correctly, on your view, that we cannot decide this case without deciding that in fact that assumption made by Congress is correct, and that the Native Hawaiians may be treated as an Indian tribe within the meaning of the Commerce Clause?"
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2859.39,2885.874,"--It does, but it's a very important determination, because we think that Congress' Indian affairs power applies in Hawaii to the indigenous people, but the nonindigenous people encountered there, just as it does in the other 49 States and, indeed, Congress' first action with respect to Native Hawaiians was in the same form that Congress has always taken with respect to Native Americans, wherever they've been in the United States, and that is to set aside a land base for them."
1999.98-818,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2891.444,2891.844,Excuse me.
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2896.498,2897.082,--Yes.
1999.98-818,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2912.525,2917.345,And only Native Hawaiians as defined in this legislation live on that land?
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2917.345,2921.047,--Only Native Hawaiians of 50 percent or more blood are eligible for those lands.
1999.98-818,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2921.047,2921.649,Can live on that land.
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2921.649,2935.723,"But the important point about that is that that manifests Congress' recognition soon after annexation that Native Hawaiians in Hawaii constituted a distinct community and, like Indian groups elsewhere, a distinct community whose ties to the land and the culture that springs from that--"
1999.98-818,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2935.723,2937.492,Where are those lands?
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2938.625,2941.461,"--They are scattered on all the islands, according--"
1999.98-818,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2941.461,2943.646,And are they leased only to Native Hawaiians?
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2943.646,2948.55,"--Yes, they... well, there are some lands that are leased to non-Natives for revenue purposes, but the purpose--"
1999.98-818,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2948.55,2949.133,Like hotels?
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2949.133,2953.019,"--Some are agricultural leases, and that sort of thing, but the... but--"
1999.98-818,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2953.019,2955.371,So it's not just for Hawaiians to reside on.
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2955.371,2961.207,--It's... but it's... the only residences there would be for Native Hawaiians.
1999.98-818,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2976.8,2979.169,"Well, you're not saying this is run like an Indian reservation."
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2979.169,2979.619,No--
1999.98-818,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2979.619,2981.604,There's no governing council.
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2982.888,2988.442,--My... there's nothing magic about a reservation in terms of Congress' plenary Indian power.
1999.98-818,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2991.627,2998.864,"--How do we extend that to people 10 generations later, who had 10 generations ago one Indian ancestor?"
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3001.883,3016.075,"--There are many Indian tribes in this country, a number that are identified in title 25 of the United States Code, tribes that have been restored, where tribal membership is defined in terms of descendancy, lineal descendancy from the tribe that was in existence at the time--"
1999.98-818,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3016.075,3023.229,"Someone where there's no tribal organization, and there is no people living on the land, and you just have one ancestor 10 generations ago--"
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3023.229,3054.867,"--No, it's important to recognize the basis for what Congress has determined in this century, starting with the Indian... or, excuse me, the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, and that is that as Congress said in the resolution in 1993, the Native people of Hawaii, in Hawaii right now, have an historic continuity to the sovereign nation that existed at the time of European contact, and has continued that, and not only that, that they are distinct people, and that they are determined to maintain their culture, their language, and their ties to the land, and pass them on."
1999.98-818,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3054.867,3055.767,--There are a lot of groups in this country like that.
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3058.402,3058.969,But the--
1999.98-818,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3058.969,3078.364,"And do you say that when you add to that one more factor, namely that they were there when... first, that you can discriminate on the basis of race with respect to those groups, but not the other groups who have their own continuity, their own history, perhaps have been aggrieved, and so forth."
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3078.364,3081.298,"--With respect, it's not just one more factor."
1999.98-818,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3111.066,3114.952,You say it's a manifestation of... it's the source of Congress'--
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3114.952,3116.652,"--It's not the sole source, and what this Court--"
1999.98-818,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3116.652,3117.738,--What is the sole source?
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3117.738,3127.11,"--This Court... there are a variety of sources, and this Court said in Mancari that Congress' power derives both explicitly and implicitly from the Constitution."
1999.98-818,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3163.95,3176.674,"Did this suggest that had there been this case, Sandoval, or these other things, suggest that had there been no Indian Commerce Clause, Congress still would have had plenary authority to deal with Indian tribes?"
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3176.674,3192.783,"Perhaps, but I think the important thing is that this is a power that recognizes... that stems from or flows from the fact that there were tribes, and the full powers of those tribes have been eroded, but does not detract from the people, that Indian communities remain distinct Indian communities."
1999.98-818,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3192.783,3199.623,So your answer to my casino hypothetical is that you could say only Indians can run casinos.
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3199.623,3200.023,No.
1999.98-818,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3227.773,3228.206,Why is that?
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3228.706,3229.325,Because the trust--
1999.98-818,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3229.325,3232.344,"--That sounds nice, but I don't know why that would have any constitutional significance."
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3235.129,3238.664,"--The historic relationship has been a bilateral one, and the BIA was--"
1999.98-818,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3238.664,3241.45,"It has been, but what in the Constitution requires it?"
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3252.306,3258.31,--I think this is a situation in which the way in which Congress has carried out its trust relationship over the years is instructive.
1999.98-818,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3259.762,3268.533,"Well, Mr. Kneedler, I think this is an interesting discussion, but I'm not sure quite how it answers the question before us dealing with what Hawaii can do."
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3268.533,3282.627,"--Well, we think that cases such as the Yakima case indicate that where a State is acting within a sphere in which Congress has authorized it to act, that the State is entitled to enact measures to promote self-determination in the same way."
1999.98-818,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3282.627,3291.466,"Well, but now this... the funds administered, as I understand it, also include tax dollars appropriated by the Hawaii legislature."
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3291.466,3292.399,"They do, but once--"
1999.98-818,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3292.399,3293.533,It isn't just Federal money.
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3306.892,3307.408,--No.
1999.98-818,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3349.402,3351.687,And these Hawaiians are not fully integrated in Hawaiian society?
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3353.373,3357.325,"There are variations, just as there are among the Cherokee in Oklahoma."
1999.98-818,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3359.36,3361.21,--Cherokee... I'm talking about Hawaiians.
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3375.487,3395.2,"--Congress has so determined, that Native Hawaiians remain a distinct community, the phrase that was used in Sandoval itself, and was used in Worcester v. Georgia by Chief Justice Marshall at that point, because they had distinct lands, they retained their distinct culture, all the factors that the BIA has historically looked--"
1999.98-818,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3395.2,3398.902,And are you defining Native Hawaiian now to mean any Hawaiian and--
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3398.902,3400.37,"--Yes, I'm sorry, the Native people of Hawaii."
1999.98-818,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3400.37,3402.154,--So 148 will do it.
1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3402.154,3406.508,"Lineal descendancy, which is a measurement, yes, that a number--"

1999.98-818,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3406.991,3409.043,--that other tribes use.

1999.98-818,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3522.799,3523.166,--No.
1999.98-818,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3523.549,3524.085,--that limit voting?
1999.98-818,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3524.085,3525.068,I should have made myself clear.
1999.98-818,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3534.524,3538.326,You don't really suggest that if you win there won't be a lot of litigation as a result of this.

1999.98-818,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3572.832,3585.457,"Well, there is no statute of which I'm aware that creates special voting privileges for Native Alaskans, and there are different... there are tribes in Alaska that would possibly be treated differently under these statutes."
