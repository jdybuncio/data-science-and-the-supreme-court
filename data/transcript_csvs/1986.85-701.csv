1986.85-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,54.468,"You may proceed when you're ready, Mr. Steele."
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,54.468,59.622,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-701,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,141.693,144.91,"It is now a membership corporation, am I correct about that?"
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,149.012,149.428,Yes.
1986.85-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,305.778,309.765,"I take it it's the organization that apprises the people, not the fund?"
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,309.765,323.173,"--Yes, the organization in making the solicitations... those can be done by the organization, would be done by the organization, and they would be the ones that apprised them of that."
1986.85-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,384.547,393.986,Could Congress require that the publisher of a newspaper along with every edition of the newspaper list all the stockholders of the newspaper?
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,393.986,401.973,"--I think Congress felt that it would not do that and, in light of the First Amendment, did not do that, and there was an explicit statutory exception."
1986.85-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,401.973,403.692,But suppose it changed its mind?
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,406.293,409.078,I think that would be a very difficult requirement to uphold.
1986.85-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.078,411.114,Why is that different from this?
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,411.114,428.909,"Because here the purposes of the organization are... again, I think one of the questions here would be, if the purpose of this organization had been to distribute newsletters by subscription and so forth and that was its regular business, that there would be that question there."
1986.85-701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,512.163,520.134,"To print the list of their advertisements, political advertisements, and what they cost?"
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,520.134,530.024,"The federal election campaign statute does require, on ads placed, where the source of that is."
1986.85-701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,541.665,558.758,"But if an ordinary organization, say the Jim Brown Patriotic Society, publishes a list of voting records of all of the Congressmen, that's barred?"
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,558.758,562.578,We do not think that is barred and we do not contend that that is barred.
1986.85-701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,564.194,565.613,And the difference is?
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,565.613,567.38,--There's two differences.
1986.85-701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,597.133,601.037,But the voting records themselves is okay?
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,601.037,606.607,"Yes, assuming by that, as the Commission has set forth in its regulations, that they were non-partisan."
1986.85-701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,625.319,638.31,"Well, is it all that clear that Congress intended to sweep in all non-profit corporations, even if they derive no funds at all from business corporations or unions?"
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,638.31,640.745,"I think it is that clear, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-701,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,727.1,733.79,"Mr. Steele, it's clear... or maybe it isn't clear."
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,753.268,761.941,"I think it is clear, in the sense that that question was... it was resolved again by the Congress after this Court's decision in Buckley versus Valeo."
1986.85-701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,785.656,789.71,"Does this apply to membership corporations, too?"
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,793.329,802.685,"The statute in question, 2 U.S.C. 441(b), does apply to non-profit membership corporations in our view, and we think--"
1986.85-701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,802.685,804.387,Is this one a non-profit membership corporation?
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,804.387,807.838,--It is organized under that section of the Massachusetts law.
1986.85-701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,807.838,809.288,So then it is.
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,809.288,809.754,Yes.
1986.85-701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,809.754,813.04,There's no... you're not saying that they don't follow the law?
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,813.04,814.325,No.
1986.85-701,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,825.65,834.739,"Mr. Steele, I think you said earlier that the... is it 441(b) has its source in the old Corrupt Practices Acts?"
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,834.739,835.222,Yes.
1986.85-701,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,835.222,838.208,Some 80 years ago or something?
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,838.208,841.076,"1907 was the first passage of it, yes."
1986.85-701,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,841.076,842.593,"That's 80 years ago, believe me."
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,842.593,844.428,"Yes, it is."
1986.85-701,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,844.428,864.841,"The corruption which provoked that statute at the time, is it the sort of thing that's ordinarily even associated with non-profit corporations?"
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,864.841,868.876,I think that at the time it was passed that was certainly so.
1986.85-701,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,909.584,926.713,"Well, even assuming that's what the statute says and that it may embrace non-profit corporations, I suppose the First Amendment question is whether it can be constitutional as applied to a non-profit corporation like this, isn't that right?"
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,926.713,929.181,"I think that is the question, and that was the question--"
1986.85-701,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,929.181,930.198,"Well, that's why I wondered."
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,952.88,954.482,"--Well, some of them do not."
1986.85-701,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,976.995,986.684,"Well, do you recognize that the First Amendment problem is rather more difficult as addressed to a non-profit corporation than it is to a profit corporation?"
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,986.684,993.123,"--Well, I think that the concern that this Court should have about that I certainly understand and concede."
1986.85-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1044.973,1062.934,"Mr. Steele, do I detect from one of your earlier comments that you think Congress may have shifted gears to a certain extent in 1947 from 1907 when it brought in unions, I guess many of which are certainly not supposed to be in business to make money?"
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1062.934,1111.184,"No, I think it did shift gears then in deciding, certainly in deciding that labor organizations, because of their role in the economic process and because of the way they had been treated under the federal statutes regarding labor relations, posed a similar difficulty; that you had there, particularly you had members who would be joining them for reasons other than supporting particular political candidates; and that one of the thrusts of the statute that came forward in '47 and then even more strongly in '71 was that in seeking money for these funds, that people had to be apprised of the political nature of the fund and had to be allowed to realize that, in the paradigm situation of the labor organization which requires membership, that they were not required to give to these funds."
1986.85-701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1111.184,1117.188,"But sweeping in the union, they also brought in a little neighborhood membership club--"
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1117.188,1118.404,I think that--
1986.85-701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1118.404,1120.29,"--in Podunk, Mississippi."
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1120.29,1121.89,--I think that the--
1986.85-701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1121.89,1123.658,"Now, that will not wreck the United States."
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1123.658,1130.162,--I think that the decision with regard to membership corporations was really not made in 1971.
1986.85-701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1144.571,1145.205,But most of them are small.
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1145.205,1146.873,There are--
1986.85-701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1146.873,1148.573,"Any book you look at, you'll find that."
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1148.573,1151.575,--I think that many of them are small.
1986.85-701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1180.16,1188.248,But don't you agree that there are a lot of people that think that to urge people to vote is non-partisan?
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1188.248,1190.117,I think that is true.
1986.85-701,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1223.105,1231.86,"Mr. Steele, what is the threat of corruption that's involved here, even from regular business corporations?"
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1251.839,1254.124,That would make it a coordinated expenditure.
1986.85-701,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1254.124,1255.457,So there is none of that involved.
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1266.181,1305.39,"I think that the danger the Congress feared was that you could get large expenditures where the sources would be known, where the help would be known, and even though there was no overt cooperation before that a rule that would allow those kinds of expenditures would result in the same kind of indebtedness; that even without prior coordination, that it thought that a prophylactic rule saying that expenditures would result in the same thing... again, the Taft-Hartley Act was where that question was first debated very strongly with regard to the expenditures, when they put in expenditures, because of the Congressional feeling that expenditures serve much of the same kind of role as contributions."
1986.85-701,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1324.451,1325.053,There's something wrong with that?
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1333.826,1342.765,"I think that the judgment of Congress over a long period of time, particularly with regard to corporations, has been, yes, there is that very strong danger there."
1986.85-701,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1342.765,1346.634,"Oh, I understand there's the danger, but I wouldn't describe that as corruption."
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1358.608,1377.07,"Well, I think that the Congressional judgment is that it's not merely the working hard, that it is the relationship of the money that increases that indebtedness, and that there is in their mind a very similar relationship there between the actual contribution under control and the expenditure of money for the same purposes."
1986.85-701,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.685,1406.522,"Mr. Steele, earlier in your argument you suggested there were three policies that you relied on particularly."
1986.85-701,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1411.507,1442.695,"Well, really I think that all three, the three that I was going to mention, come under I think the general heading of corruption, because I think what Congress was saying was that the voluntariness, the individual choice which is protected in the statute, was clearly an important policy; in other words, that the statute, 441(b), makes it clear that in soliciting contributions to these funds that they have to apprise them of the fact that they are going to be used for political purposes, ""political purposes"" there meaning explicit election-related purposes."
1986.85-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1482.736,1484.105,"Thank you, Mr. Steele."
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1485.722,1495.211,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-701,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1549.715,1552.249,"Mr. Fox, has it accepted any labor union money?"
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1552.249,1555.284,"--No labor union money, no business money."
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1555.284,1557.903,"That isn't critical to your argument, is it?"
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1557.903,1579.484,"Depending upon what substantial evil this statute is designed to curb, if one of them is the accumulation of money from the commercial world that might flow into the political process, I'm only mentioning that they have never accepted business money, this particular corporation."
1986.85-701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1579.484,1585.471,Supposing a similar organization in a different state did accept money from business corporations.
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1589.19,1605.134,"Yes, Your Honor, I think it would have a lesser claim, but nonetheless one that would carry the day with respect to this particular message, which says: Vote, and here are the 492 candidates that are up for office, and here are their positions."
1986.85-701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1605.134,1614.823,Do you think the First Amendment would permit the Government to pass a law requiring disclosure of whether or not there were business corporations contributing to the organization?
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1614.823,1619.811,I think that that would be a legitimate exercise on the part of the Government.
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1656.15,1660.286,But do you object to disclosure for your expenditures?
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1660.286,1673.779,"Well, we think that it is unduly burdensome with respect to an ideological corporation whose purposes may be controversial."
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1673.779,1677.313,"So you don't need to file and say, I have spent this much trying to get these people elected?"
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1677.313,1683.134,"Oh, if Your Honor please, any independent expenditure does have to be disclosed."
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1683.134,1685.15,And you don't object to that?
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1685.15,1685.434,"Oh, no."
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1685.434,1685.984,I didn't think so.
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1685.984,1692.288,"If it's more than $250, anyone who makes an independent expenditure must disclose it."
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1692.288,1693.74,Including your corporation?
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1693.74,1698.358,"Yes, if this Court were to rule that we may make them at all."
1986.85-701,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1698.358,1699.477,I understand.
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1710.415,1713.534,"Well, if... we're talking about a hypothetical statute."
1986.85-701,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1719.371,1719.888,"Well, isn't that this statute?"
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1729.496,1740.102,"--If a political committee were to file its disclosure, it must disclose any contributions that it has received over $200."
1986.85-701,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1740.102,1758.598,"Well, I thought that was... I thought that that was one of your major objections here, that the effect of this scheme is to require your organization with respect to any money that it wants to use for political activity to disclose the names of its contributors, some of whom might want to remain anonymous."
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1758.598,1760.365,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-701,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.464,1782.914,That's right.
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1785.0,1792.237,"And he says if we set up a PAC, then that PAC would have to disclose, again only up to $200."
1986.85-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1883.58,1883.996,Over $200.
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1883.996,1886.698,"Over $200, yes, I'm sorry."
1986.85-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1886.698,1893.519,"Mr. Fox, the way you describe those requirements, it seems to me you really have to strain to say they are burdensome."
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1900.756,1920.586,"No, but I think that without a compelling purpose and one served by the narrowest means available, there shouldn't be any burdens placed on the ability of organizations of individuals to make such a message as was made in this case."
1986.85-701,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1920.586,1924.907,That's because in your submission the First Amendment protects you.
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1924.907,1925.857,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1925.857,1941.017,"But in connection with expenditures in connection with elections, we have sustained a lot of things that we wouldn't sustain if it were just on someone's right to communicate on a street corner about something."
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,1941.017,1953.89,"The cases that this Court has addressed itself to in this field, the NCPAC, National Right to Work, and all the others, dealt with contributions to candidates."
1986.85-701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2013.548,2018.833,"Mr. Fox... I don't want to interrupt in the middle of an answer, but I did have a concern I wanted you to address if you would."
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2056.158,2056.975,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.837,2112.127,"xxx served by forcing your organization to set up a separate fund, and then you solicit and people know exactly what they're paying for."
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2112.127,2113.913,"Not very well, Your Honor."
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2113.913,2115.229,"Well, better than this."
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2115.229,2118.615,"I'm not sure that is so at all, Your Honor."
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2118.615,2119.131,Why?
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2119.131,2131.875,"The separate segregated fund, as the FEC argues, could spend for the administration of the PAC, for the solicitation for the PAC, for the setting up of the PAC."
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2131.875,2132.391,That may be so.
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2132.391,2133.858,They would dip into the--
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.858,2135.243,But what about the money you raise?
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2135.243,2139.862,--The money that you raise would be controlled by the officers of the organization.
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.862,2140.379,Through the PAC.
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2145.283,2147.468,It doesn't say.
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.704,2155.423,At least you know it's going to be used for political purposes.
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2155.423,2156.706,"Yes, you will know that."
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2156.706,2167.464,But you may not know at all that the corporation's general revenues or general funds are going to be used for political purposes.
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2167.464,2169.031,"Well, if Your Honor please--"
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2169.031,2169.848,Isn't that right?
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2169.848,2174.368,--You won't know either way what candidates are going to be favored.
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.368,2179.439,"I know, but at least you'll know in a separate PAC you're going to be operating in the political field."
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2179.439,2181.289,"Yes, that's correct."
1986.85-701,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.099,2229.539,"Mr. Fox, just so we're clear about the message here, what you said before led me to believe you were going to assert that the message here is just get out and vote."
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2238.477,2239.66,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-701,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.66,2244.798,"So it was not just get out and vote, but vote our way and here's something to help you do that."
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2244.798,2258.724,"The message here, the basic and overwhelming significant of the message, was the gathering together of the positions of 492 candidates, and then that was to be distributed."
1986.85-701,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2279.387,2284.339,"Well, it's nice to say that, but when you also say vote pro-life doesn't that rather contradict that?"
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2284.339,2293.129,"--I don't say that it would take a psychiatrist to figure out which side of issue the authors of his message were on, Your Honor."
1986.85-701,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2293.129,2293.395,Thank you.
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2294.314,2300.135,There is no doubt what their subjective hopes would be.
1986.85-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2318.012,2321.964,"But the only pictures are those of the candidates that are pro-life, isn't that right?"
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2323.5,2326.083,"I'm not sure about Tip O'Neil, Your Honor."
1986.85-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2332.154,2338.426,"Well, the Court of Appeals said that only pro-life candidates had their pictures."
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2353.352,2354.685,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2354.685,2356.068,And that's what you're arguing you have a right.
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2371.564,2389.941,"The briefs have set forth various positions here, varying constitutional interpretations which would exclude or include various organizations depending upon what this Court were to believe was the evil that was to be combatted."
1986.85-701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2405.968,2417.008,"Well, what if the evil is the one I tried to describe rather clumsily a little bit ago, that you want to be sure the contributors don't just feel they want to contribute to a general cause, but want to know whether they're contributing to an election campaign?"
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2422.393,2431.332,"Well, that interest this Court has stated in Cort v. Ash is but a secondary concern, if at all, of this statute."
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.361,2479.996,We have also mentioned the concern that Justice Stevens has.
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2479.996,2481.097,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2558.432,2565.518,"How is the position expressed, for or against, or what?"
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2565.518,2568.553,It has a Y and an N or NR.
1986.85-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2588.551,2589.801,Vote him up or vote him down on the one issue?
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2589.801,2603.042,"If there is a single message perhaps, it would be make pro-life be the one issue that you should address yourself to, not elect Smith or don't elect Jones."
1986.85-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2966.194,2972.366,"Well, where does your corporate till come from, Mr. Fox, other than from the contributions of members?"
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2972.366,2975.735,"--Garage sales, dances."
1986.85-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2979.019,2982.138,But aren't those individuals who contribute members?
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,2982.138,2991.411,"--Well, this case pointed out some very weak bookkeeping records on the part of this organization."
1986.85-701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3019.311,3022.632,Your charter does not provide for members?
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,3022.632,3024.798,It did not provide for members.
1986.85-701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3025.834,3028.452,Who elects the officers and directors?
1986.85-701,1,23943,francis_h_fox,,3028.452,3038.475,"Well, at that time the officers... there were maybe 25 of them, or a board of directors... would elect themselves, and people would come on and replace them."
1986.85-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3250.779,3252.53,"Thank you, Mr. Fox."
1986.85-701,2,20154,charles_n_steele,,3255.232,3258.767,"If there are no questions from the Court, I would conclude my argument."
