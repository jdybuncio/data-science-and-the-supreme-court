1997.96-1487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1487, United States v. Hosep Krikor Bajakajian."
1997.96-1487,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,11.389,13.474,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1487,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,81.7,94.342,"On your first argument, if it's an instrumentality of the crime and we agree with you on that, does that mean the excessive fines analysis is just inapplicable, or that it is presumptively non... not excessive?"
1997.96-1487,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,94.342,95.342,It is satisfied.
1997.96-1487,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,107.166,111.018,"In other words, the Excessive Fines Clause analysis applies in either event."
1997.96-1487,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,111.018,139.121,"It does, but the manner of satisfying the Excessive Fines Clause is by showing that it is property that's seized... one way of satisfying it, it is showing that the property that is seized is in fact an instrumentality of the offense, and there... questions may arise about whether it has a sufficiently close connection to the offense to be classified properly as an instrumentality, but once it is, then that would satisfy the Excessive Fines Clause."
1997.96-1487,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,139.121,150.827,"Well, if we have to ask about excessiveness anyway, I'm just wondering why we have to go through the additional step of elaborating a big jurisprudence on what is an instrumentality and what isn't."
1997.96-1487,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,150.827,151.345,"Well, historic--"
1997.96-1487,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,151.345,155.13,"If in any event we're going to talk about proportionality, maybe--"
1997.96-1487,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,155.13,155.33,--No.
1997.96-1487,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,155.58,156.997,--we should just save ourselves a step.
1997.96-1487,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,156.997,160.534,"--Well, there are just two different ways of talking about proportionality, Justice Kennedy."
1997.96-1487,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,173.573,175.691,"Well, you said it's presumptively proportional."
1997.96-1487,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,175.691,175.925,--No.
1997.96-1487,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,177.175,178.075,I thought.
1997.96-1487,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,178.075,214.55,"--I'm sorry if I... if we had a misunderstanding on that, but generally speaking, if the... if it is an instrumentality, then it is per se nonexcessive, and I would except from that one small category of cases where perhaps the property is involved in what might be a minor infraction such as a parking violation, but if it is the kind of violations that property have historically been forfeited for customs violations, for criminal offenses, then if it is an instrumentality in the offense, then it is per se a proportionate fine and not an excessive one."
1997.96-1487,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.55,227.774,"It seems a little odd, though, to equate excessiveness with just instrumentality as opposed to some examination of gross proportionality, or lack thereof."
1997.96-1487,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,227.774,228.074,"Well, I think--"
1997.96-1487,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,228.074,234.845,"I mean, the mere term excessiveness seems to import some notion of proportionality to me."
1997.96-1487,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,234.845,238.165,"--Well, I think the question is excessive in relation to what."
1997.96-1487,1,29362,james_e_blatt,,1697.067,1700.019,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1733.323,1739.91,Could you explain... I don't really understand the finding that the crime was committed because of cultural differences.
1997.96-1487,1,29362,james_e_blatt,,1739.91,1745.545,"--What happened in this matter, Mr. Chief Justice, is that my client, Mr. Bajakajian, is from Syria."
1997.96-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1777.333,1782.885,"So if one lies out of fear, it's not the same thing as lying for some other motive."
1997.96-1487,1,29362,james_e_blatt,,1782.885,1783.92,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1806.4,1812.804,"Do you think the Constitution Excessive Fines Clause has to be applied on a case-by-case basis, each individual case?"
1997.96-1487,1,29362,james_e_blatt,,1834.3,1837.002,"Justice Scalia, I believe that."
1997.96-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1837.002,1838.835,It's a lot of trouble.
1997.96-1487,1,29362,james_e_blatt,,1843.572,1851.845,"I think they can handle that burden, Justice Scalia, because when we're talking about the Eighth Amendment and punishment it's the district court's responsibility to weigh culpability and value."
1997.96-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1851.845,1859.165,"So every different judge can come up with a different conclusion, I suppose, if each one just weigh, I think this is excessive, this isn't excessive."
1997.96-1487,1,29362,james_e_blatt,,1859.165,1861.701,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think that's always a possibility, yes."
1997.96-1487,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1863.653,1866.319,And is the standard abuse of discretion?
1997.96-1487,1,29362,james_e_blatt,,1866.319,1866.788,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1997.96-1487,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1866.788,1872.307,Abuse of discretion is to determine what the meaning of excessiveness is under the Constitution?
1997.96-1487,1,29362,james_e_blatt,,1872.307,1872.675,Yes.
1997.96-1487,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1872.675,1874.575,"That's a very strange doctrine, it seems to me."
1997.96-1487,1,29362,james_e_blatt,,1874.575,1876.877,"Well, when we're... Your Honor, when we're talking about--"
1997.96-1487,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1876.877,1886.399,Are there any other constitutional provisions that are entrusted to the interpretation of the district courts under an abuse of discretion standard that you can think of?
1997.96-1487,1,29362,james_e_blatt,,1886.399,1899.826,"--In reference to statutory and constitutionally, no, Your Honor, but in reference to when we're evaluating this on a proportionality analysis, under Austin and Alexander this Court made a determination that the Eighth Amendment applies in reference to forfeitures."
1997.96-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.638,1927.559,What about a statute that says anyone who uses an unlawfully possessed firearm in the commission of a crime shall forfeit the firearm?
1997.96-1487,1,29362,james_e_blatt,,1931.427,1935.046,"I believe that, Your Honor, that would be entirely constitutional for the following reason."
1997.96-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.516,1950.972,"You acknowledge the existence of that doctrine, then, that... your quarrel here is just that it is not a contraband or instrumentality, whatever else you want to call it."
1997.96-1487,1,29362,james_e_blatt,,1950.972,1962.179,"I acknowledge that, Your Honor, that contraband and proceeds of contraband are forfeitable, but this is an instrument, allegedly an instrumentality of a crime, a means by which a crime is committed."
1997.96-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1962.179,1968.083,Do you think failure to register a firearm is any different from failure to notify the Government that you're carrying currency?
1997.96-1487,1,29362,james_e_blatt,,1968.083,1975.004,"Under the statute it is, Your Honor, because the statute indicates that it's not contraband to have the money and to transport the money outside of the country."
1997.96-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1975.004,1979.391,"Okay, but if it is contraband, you acknowledge it doesn't matter how much it's worth."
1997.96-1487,1,29362,james_e_blatt,,1979.391,1979.791,Correct.
1997.96-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.791,1986.278,"I should have used, you know, a 12th Century valuable firearm, if there were any in the 12th Century."
1997.96-1487,1,29362,james_e_blatt,,1986.278,1986.661,"Correct, Your Honor."
