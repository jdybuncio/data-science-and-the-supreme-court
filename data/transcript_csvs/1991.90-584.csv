1991.90-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.856,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-584, Southwest Marine, Inc., v. Bryon Gizoni."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,11.222,15.776,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,124.23,127.682,"May I ask you a question, just to be sure I get something straight in my mind?"
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,127.682,128.299,"--Yes, you certainly can."
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,128.299,138.07,"If he wins the Jones Act claim, assume you lose, just for purposes of argument, will you be entitled to a credit for the amount paid on the Longshoreman Act claim?"
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,138.07,139.67,That is correct.
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,139.67,142.622,So is there any risk of double recovery in this case?
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,143.905,146.738,There is no risk of double recovery.
1991.90-584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,250.852,271.266,"--Well, Mr. Tichy, the plain language of the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act excludes from coverage any repairman who is a member of a crew of any vessel, and it seems to me that your position just reads that right out of the statute."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,271.266,274.302,"To the contrary, Justice O'Connor."
1991.90-584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,343.612,348.73,Can't a ship repair person be a member of the crew of a vessel?
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,352.598,353.632,--No.
1991.90-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,379.097,385.301,"The statute uses the term ""seaman"", doesn't it, not member of a crew or--"
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,385.301,387.967,--Not the Longshore Act.
1991.90-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,387.967,389.669,"--Not the Longshore Act, okay."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,389.669,393.888,"No, it uses a term ""master"" or ""member"" of a crew of a vessel."
1991.90-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,393.888,397.459,"But the Jones Act uses the term ""seaman"", does it not?"
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,397.459,398.359,"That is correct, and--"
1991.90-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,398.359,401.827,"Where does the term, seaperson, come from in the statute?"
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,401.827,406.547,"--Your Honor, I suppose that is my introduction."
1991.90-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,423.057,425.74,"If it does, you should refer to it accordingly."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,425.74,427.675,"--Thank you, Your Honor, and I certainly will."
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,480.06,483.012,"But you, of course go on."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,495.32,504.591,"There are situations where an individual is land based, which is the other pivot in the Wilander decision--"
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,504.591,507.157,"No, but the exception talks about people who are vessels."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,507.157,507.823,--That's right.
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,514.144,515.111,What about a vessel--
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,515.111,522.681,"--for weeks, and was taking care of that vessel out there, outside the 3-mile limit, that individual would probably be a master or member of the crew."
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,522.681,525.383,--What about a vessel within the 3-mile limit or within the harbor itself?
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,525.383,532.454,"I would submit to you, Justice Stevens, that the use of the term, harbor worker was intended to--"
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,532.454,534.156,"No, I am asking about the use of the term, vessel."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,534.156,535.106,--Yes.
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,535.106,537.857,Aren't there vessels that do not leave the harbor?
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,537.857,543.761,"Indeed, there are vessels that do not leave the harbor."
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,543.761,553.2,"And a person who is a member of a crew of such a vessel is not a ship repairman within the meaning of the statute, even if he spends all his time doing ship repair work."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,553.7,566.424,"I would submit to you that it was the 1972 amendments that clarified that if that individual worked exclusively within the harbor, that that individual would in fact be covered by the Longshore Act."
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,566.84,570.126,"He would not be on a vessel, even though the vessel never left the harbor."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,578.529,578.912,--No.
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,583.85,584.433,Right.
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,584.433,608.465,"--that the 1972 amendments made it clear that there are those individuals who work exclusively within the harbor, exclusively, if you will, within the break-water, who are not subject to the type of perils of the sea which a normal seaman is; therefore, Congress used the term ""harbor worker"" to specifically indicate a form of inclusion."
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,654.862,657.278,"But the hypothesis, we are talking about someone who is not land based."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,665.318,675.84,"--I would submit that that is in fact the case, and I cannot imagine a situation in the real world where an individual is assigned to a vessel that operates strictly within a harbor who is not land based."
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,704.109,704.192,Let me ask you this question.
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,714.298,714.715,--Sure.
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,714.715,715.848,How are they to be resolved?
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,715.848,718.683,"Very simply, and I am glad you asked the question."
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,769.301,773.769,Then supposing an employee files a claim under the Harbor Workers Act because he is not really sure--
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,773.769,774.736,--Yes.
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,774.736,786.846,"--and the employer goes ahead and acknowledges the claim and there is adjudication of the issue, does that mean he is estopped from saying well, I really think I am entitled to Jones Act benefits, but in order to protect myself, I filed this claim as well."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,793.814,798.199,"If the matter were adjudicated, I would say yes."
1991.90-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.051,800.651,Supposing it is not adjudicated.
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,802.384,804.086,"--Voluntarily provided the payments, as he did here."
1991.90-584,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,819.013,820.229,"--Yes, but where would he go?"
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,820.229,830.851,"If the individual made a total error, the employer made a total error, provided the benefits, then he would have to go court, certainly."
1991.90-584,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.851,837.671,I thought you said you... I thought you said you wanted the administrative agency to decide this case.
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,837.671,838.088,I do.
1991.90-584,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,850.328,851.045,But what if it is just close?
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,855.799,856.999,--That's right--
1991.90-584,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,856.999,857.751,--Well--
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,857.751,860.37,"--Then they should go to the administrative agency, Justice White."
1991.90-584,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,869.826,875.296,--Then the employee who has been getting benefits because the employer has been paying them--
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,875.296,876.096,Yes--
1991.90-584,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,876.096,885.068,"--If he now wants to go to the Jones Act, he has to go to the administrative agency and say, by the way, I am really not covered by the Longshoremen Act?"
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,885.068,890.186,"--He needs to get a determination from that agency, if it is arguable that he is covered, that is what he should do."
1991.90-584,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,895.321,899.292,"So he goes up, wants, in a sense, a declaratory judgment from the agency."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,899.292,913.885,"That is the equivalent of it, but in this Court's Garmon decisions, essentially what the Court has said is, we've created the law... Congress created the law which establishes coverage, and that particular coverage is articulated on the face of the statute."
1991.90-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,922.741,928.192,"When did this requirement emerge, in the enactment of the 1972 amendments?"
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,928.192,930.577,"I believe so, because prior to that--"
1991.90-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,930.577,933.279,"So before that, there was no such requirement."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,933.279,948.872,"--What happened was, prior to '72 there was only a situs test and therefore, what was happening was that an individual had to establish, in order to obtain coverage, that he was not a seaman under the Jones Act."
1991.90-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,967.65,978.874,"And you say, the Congress, I suppose by implication, since they didn't do it expressly, also established kind of an administrative exhaustion requirement?"
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,978.874,983.243,"Yes, yes."
1991.90-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1020.182,1032.39,"Is there anything in the 1972 amendments or their legislative... that suggests Congress intended to effect the traditional Jones Act procedures, which you start in court, I take it, in the Jones Act."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,1032.39,1034.692,"Yes, that is correct."
1991.90-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1054.053,1065.044,"My question was: Is there any indication in that legislative history that Congress wanted to depart from traditional Jones Act procedures, where you could go directly into court if you have a Jones Act claim?"
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,1065.044,1086.108,"--I believe the answer to that and perhaps I am not stating it as clearly as I should, is by adopting the status requirement, Congress attempted to delineate those people who must absolutely go to the OWCP for their relief, because there was a tradeoff."
1991.90-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1098.88,1110.937,"So that even if a claimant is saying, I don't claim under that system, I claim under the Jones Act, the claimant must still go through the administrative procedure for the Harbor Workers Act?"
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,1110.937,1116.425,"That's correct, if he is a ship repair... ship repairman, such as Mr. Gizoni."
1991.90-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1175.511,1179.081,I am not sure I understand.
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,1185.419,1186.819,It would.
1991.90-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1186.819,1191.223,"So these things are going to be decided by the courts eventually, aren't they?"
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,1191.223,1197.127,"Except, it would be reviewable in the same way that the National Labor Relations Board determination is reviewable."
1991.90-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1207.983,1214.421,"Is that a question of... whether you are a seaman under the statute, is a question of fact rather than law?"
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,1218.456,1228.931,"In the case of somebody who is specifically enumerated within the included categories of 2(3), it is as a matter of law."
1991.90-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1263.735,1267.204,"You say, as is the case with the National Labor Relations Act."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,1270.425,1285.101,"In the Garmon case, essentially what happened was that an employer sued a union for picketing, which was arguably protected under the National Labor Relations Act."
1991.90-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1306.329,1307.345,Sure--
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,1307.345,1310.281,"Gentlemen, you must go to the administrative agency, the NLRB."
1991.90-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.281,1316.101,"--It isn't a matter of having to go to the administrative agency, not just a matter of that."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,1336.764,1337.264,Yes.
1991.90-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1343.918,1345.384,"No, but that is the crucial distinction."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,1364.296,1366.748,--Let me point out one thing if I may.
1991.90-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1394.946,1407.92,Do you know of any other instance like this where the issue is which of two Federal schemes would apply and where you must go to the administrative agency first?
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,1407.92,1411.472,"Sure, Title VII of the EEOC."
1991.90-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1411.472,1412.388,"No, no."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,1414.924,1415.424,Yes.
1991.90-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.424,1425.613,"--But I mean where it doesn't say anything and where we have created a... by judicial determination, the rule that you have to go to the administrative agency first."
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,1428.248,1428.615,Sure.
1991.90-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1428.615,1430.031,--And I offhand can't think of any.
1991.90-584,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,1430.031,1432.697,"If I can think of one, when I come back on rebuttal, I will let you know."
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,1443.755,1452.027,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-584,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1501.024,1505.226,"You just said that he was given damages under the Longshore Act, do you mean to say the Jones Act?"
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,1505.226,1508.361,--He was awarded benefits under the Jones Act.
1991.90-584,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1508.361,1508.744,Under the Jones Act?
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,1508.744,1518.534,"Yes, he was awarded benefits under the Jones Act, but the shipyard employer believes that the Longshore Act gives them a blanket immunity from Jones Act claims."
1991.90-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1653.101,1657.172,"Excuse me, it doesn't necessarily recognize that."
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,1666.694,1677.4,"--I agree with that, it doesn't authorize a Jones Act claim, but it contemplates that a worker who is employed in one of those occupations might seek Jones Act benefits."
1991.90-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1677.4,1679.169,"Yes, but... okay."
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,1679.169,1697.63,"There is another provision in the Longshore Act that I believe more specifically gives a shipyard employee a right to go under the Longshore Act first, although it doesn't specifically say that, and that is Section 913(d) of the Longshore Act, Filing of Claims."
1991.90-584,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1753.567,1764.774,Suppose... what is the name of the bureau that is supposed to make the determinations under the Longshore Act?
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,1764.774,1766.643,It is the U.S. Department of Labor.
1991.90-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1766.643,1769.043,"Yes, but I mean, it's a sub... Office of Workers'--"
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,1769.043,1771.511,It is the Office of Workers' Compensation Program.
1991.90-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.511,1773.761,"--OWCP, right?"
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,1773.761,1773.944,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1773.944,1782.8,Suppose OWCP issues a regulation in addition to making individualized determinations of who is covered?
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,1818.473,1824.46,"I think that would be subject to determination of the courts, whether or not it has an effect."
1991.90-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1824.46,1824.677,All right.
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,1824.677,1830.197,I would think that such a regulation violates the Longshore Act.
1991.90-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1844.957,1849.409,You don't think we were... we're entitled to give the regulation any deference?
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,1862.633,1872.072,"I think that is fair to say, that the courts give the final meaning to the regulation and the determination of whether the regulation is consistent with existing law."
1991.90-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1872.072,1873.524,"That's unusual, if it is so."
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,1873.524,1881.778,I have a description of a maritime employee here that is two sentences long.
1991.90-584,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1903.942,1905.008,Where is that from?
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,1905.008,1911.298,That is what I am going to... that's from a Supreme Court case called Norton v. Warner that's cited in my brief.
1991.90-584,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1927.473,1942.817,"Do you think cases like Norton against Warner and some of those cases decided in the fifties by this Court, where the Court in effect said the sky is the limit so far as a jury finding someone is a seaman... do you think those have survived in tact after our Wilander opinion?"
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,1942.817,1948.654,--I believe that Wilander is consistent with those earlier Supreme Court decisions.
1991.90-584,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1948.654,1969.817,"You don't think that there was language in it that intended to cut back somewhat on some of those odd decisions that occurred some years back that made everything, including questions of law, a jury question?"
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,1978.673,1986.41,"I would say that in one way Wilander liberalized the situation, and in another way it restricted the remedy."
1991.90-584,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2080.536,2092.512,"In this case, if you prevail and it goes to the jury, does the jury determine both whether or not there was a vessel and his... the extent of his connection to that vessel?"
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,2092.512,2100.182,"--The jury usually just makes a general determination as to whether he had seaman status, and the judge--"
1991.90-584,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2100.182,2104.67,"Well, is one of the issues that is argued and submitted to the jury the question of whether or not there is a vessel?"
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,2104.67,2105.42,"--Yes, it is."
1991.90-584,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2106.97,2120.995,"Couldn't that be a question of law, and has this Court ever decided whether all floating things in the water are vessels?"
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,2120.995,2124.031,Sometimes it can be a question of law.
1991.90-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2143.695,2145.311,It is always a jury question?
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,2145.311,2145.98,--Not always.
1991.90-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.98,2155.252,And I suppose the facts could be clear enough that there is just no evidence at all that the person was a crew member.
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,2155.252,2155.835,That's right.
1991.90-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2155.835,2158.037,I suppose that also would be taken away from the jury.
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,2160.12,2160.337,That's right.
1991.90-584,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2395.239,2398.523,What's the difference between a vessel and a barge?
1991.90-584,1,37852,preston_easley,,2398.523,2400.725,"In legal terms, none."
1991.90-584,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2531.026,2533.811,"Thank you, Mr. Easley."
1991.90-584,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2535.511,2543.833,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-584,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2612.745,2617.965,What happens if the Secretary issues a regulation dealing with this subject?
1991.90-584,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2622.517,2630.039,"I would think not, after... it is perfectly clear after Wilander that seaman is linked to master or member of a crew of a vessel."
1991.90-584,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2638.128,2639.445,It would be?
1991.90-584,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2639.445,2640.747,"Yes, it would be."
1991.90-584,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2640.747,2649.436,"So if he issues a regulation, the courts, in the Jones Act case, would have to follow his regulation, even though he is issuing it under--"
1991.90-584,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2649.436,2652.222,If it is a reasonable interpretation of the phrase
1991.90-584,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2663.678,2680.455,"--All right, and then suppose he doesn't issue a regulation, but in fact the claimant goes to him for a case determination initially and he decides that the work is covered."
1991.90-584,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2686.859,2699.703,"If the issue of seaman status is actually litigated and adjudicated in the proceeding under the Longshore Act, then we do think that there would be issue preclusion."
1991.90-584,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2751.985,2758.991,"--Mr. Long, that is how you would give effect to the mutual exclusivity of the two acts?"
1991.90-584,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2758.991,2763.359,"No, we don't... well, yes, excuse me, Justice O'Connor."
1991.90-584,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2841.101,2844.655,"Do you think it is a question of law, whether a vessel is a vessel?"
1991.90-584,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2844.655,2846.655,"It can be, Your Honor."
1991.90-584,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2859.879,2864.883,May I go back to Justice Scalia's hypothetical with you a moment?
1991.90-584,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2874.239,2877.957,I am not aware of cases that so hold.
1991.90-584,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2898.169,2904.573,But the issue would have to be there as to whether it's... he is a seaman or not?
1991.90-584,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2904.573,2907.108,"It would have to be there and actually litigated, Your Honor."
1991.90-584,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2907.108,2916.214,"So that means, I take it, in cases like this, the employer would be well advised always to resist payment in order to get the benefit of adjudication in a doubtful case?"
1991.90-584,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2916.214,2919.082,"Well, we don't agree that that will be the result in every case."
1991.90-584,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2927.854,2929.371,"No, we are just talking about doubtful cases, always."
1991.90-584,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2931.639,2937.477,"--I think to be honest that in doubtful cases, there is some incentive to go ahead and litigate the issue."
1991.90-584,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2972.864,2975.614,Can I ask another question about tactics in this situation?
1991.90-584,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2986.636,2986.969,--Yes.
1991.90-584,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2986.969,2992.873,So that would be the normal way to do it is to litigate rather than filing a claim and taking the risk that you would get an adverse adjudication.
1991.90-584,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3008.382,3014.286,"I think under Justice Stevens' hypothetical, the employee would want to prove he's--"
1991.90-584,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3014.286,3017.404,He doesn't want to be subject to a Jones Act suit.
1991.90-584,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3017.404,3022.808,"--Right, but the employer would prefer to pay under the Longshore Act in many cases because--"
1991.90-584,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3022.808,3030.129,"Exactly, so that is kind of a funny position for him to be in, to go before the administrative agency."
1991.90-584,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3034.081,3042.037,"--I think in practice in many cases, of course, these workers don't have the resources and may be in genuine doubt about which the two schemes covers them."
1991.90-584,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3046.508,3050.209,And run the risk of an adjudication that would foreclose their Jones Act claim?
1991.90-584,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3050.209,3052.327,"--It does run that risk, Your Honor."
1991.90-584,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3114.246,3116.115,"Thank you, Mr. Long."
1991.90-584,3,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,3120.1,3123.019,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-584,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3155.323,3157.692,"That was a Court decision, wasn't it?"
1991.90-584,3,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,3157.692,3158.575,--Excuse me?
1991.90-584,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3158.575,3160.727,"That was a Court decision, wasn't it?"
1991.90-584,3,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,3160.727,3167.148,"That's correct, but it was, Your Honor, and you know the case much better than I ever will--"
1991.90-584,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3167.148,3168.315,I don't even remember it.
1991.90-584,3,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,3168.315,3174.82,"--But it relates, if I recall, to two concurrent forms or potentially concurrent forms of Federal relief."
1991.90-584,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3197.25,3203.138,"Just refresh my recollection, because I don't remember the case even as well as Justice White does."
1991.90-584,3,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,3203.138,3203.404,Okay.
1991.90-584,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3203.404,3211.243,Did that case hold that you must go to... bring your administrative claim before you litigate your FELA claim?
1991.90-584,3,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,3211.243,3222.801,"What happened in this case was that a claim was attempted to be made under FELA, and there was raised as a defense that the Longshore Act applied."
1991.90-584,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3244.565,3248.284,"In other words, that case held that they were covered by one statute rather than the other--"
1991.90-584,3,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,3248.284,3248.617,--Correct.
1991.90-584,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3248.617,3251.134,--But did it say anything about which proceeding you must commence first?
1991.90-584,3,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,3251.134,3265.46,"I think implicit in that, and I will certainly leave it to the Justices to discuss in more detail, is where you arguably have a claim which is within the Longshore Act, that's where you should initiate your proceeding, that's where your focus should be, and that's where you should go."
1991.90-584,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3266.929,3270.613,"There claim there wasn't arguably, their claim, as a matter of law was within that statute."
1991.90-584,3,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,3270.613,3271.899,"--Well, ultimately you determined that."
1991.90-584,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3271.899,3272.515,Yes.
1991.90-584,3,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,3272.515,3273.282,Absolutely.
1991.90-584,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3310.357,3314.976,"Mr. Tichy, do you know how to pronounce Wilander?"
1991.90-584,3,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,3314.976,3316.511,I assume it is Wilander.
1991.90-584,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3316.511,3318.394,You don't know that firsthand?
1991.90-584,3,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,3318.394,3322.512,"I worked in North Shipping, Sweden for some time in my youth."
1991.90-584,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3327.833,3330.285,We ought to agree with this--
1991.90-584,3,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,3332.535,3340.474,"That is what I assumed, and in my youth many years ago I did have the opportunity to speak some of the language, though not well."
1991.90-584,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.474,3344.943,That is the way it is pronounced in the broadcast of tennis tournaments.
1991.90-584,3,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,3345.461,3350.746,"That's right, and there we have decided on the dispositive determination."
1991.90-584,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3350.746,3354.114,Maybe we can call it McDermott and solve the problem that way.
1991.90-584,3,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,3354.348,3356.048,"Okay, thank you very much, Justice O'Connor."
1991.90-584,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3399.477,3400.993,"Thank you, Mr. Tichy."
