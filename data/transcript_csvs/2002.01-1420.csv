2002.01-1420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,11.972,15.398,General... is it Gregoire or Gregory?
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,15.398,16.02,Gregoire.
2002.01-1420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,16.02,16.642,Gregoire.
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,17.551,19.986,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,124.799,128.225,Can a set-off ever be legal process?
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,148.947,157.286,If... the violation of 407(a) comes in... comes into play when there's a legal process that actually attaches to those Social Security benefits.
2002.01-1420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,157.286,161.002,So you would say there's no 407 violation in that event.
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,161.002,161.745,Correct.
2002.01-1420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,161.745,176.068,Although I presume there would be a cause of action against the State for... for not behaving properly as the... what... what is the... the--
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,176.068,177.432,Representative payee?
2002.01-1420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,177.432,178.918,--As the representative payee within that--
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,178.918,181.147,"I believe that's true, Justice Scalia."
2002.01-1420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,215.038,218.548,--And why... why is 405(j) not at issue here?
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,218.548,219.746,Well--
2002.01-1420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,219.746,224.205,"Because those points are raised, of course, in the... in your opponent's brief."
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,224.205,247.526,"--Yes, Your Honor, but if you... if you look at the complaint in this particular case by... by the respondent, if you look at the certification of the class that's present here, if you look at the holding below, in every instance the question presented is whether a representative payee duly appointed can use the benefits for the cost of care of the beneficiary."
2002.01-1420,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,255.041,268.787,"General Gregoire, I'd like to just find out if... let's say we accept your argument this is not a 407 case, and then the question is put, but there are alleged misappropriations here."
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,312.165,315.509,What the Social Security Act provides is one of two things.
2002.01-1420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,332.726,335.698,And who... who can invoke the court's assistance?
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,336.358,339.413,"--An individual, the... the beneficiary could."
2002.01-1420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,339.413,340.445,--The beneficiary can?
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,340.445,341.032,Yes.
2002.01-1420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,357.329,360.301,May I ask you this question related to that?
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,365.419,366.822,"--We... we do not, Your Honor."
2002.01-1420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,377.929,378.146,Right.
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,378.146,383.131,--when in fact there... that is not the case here and there is no finding to that effect by the lower court.
2002.01-1420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,383.131,383.874,No finding.
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,385.648,392.335,Only after the... the remand and... and the supplemental brief that was submitted in the State supreme court.
2002.01-1420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,429.382,430.275,Excuse me.
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,439.357,439.796,--No.
2002.01-1420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.796,440.911,Or is it a regulation or what?
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,440.911,441.282,It is.
2002.01-1420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,557.33,559.809,"Well, I... I think we're all interested in the needs of the children."
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,570.333,574.67,"--We don't submit, Your Honor... we think that's wrong."
2002.01-1420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,581.69,584.307,"Well, I mean free in the sense that the State would pay for it anyway."
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,584.307,595.269,"--Your Honor, there is an expectation in State law and an expectation in the Social Security Act that... that what this money is to be used for is the current maintenance of the child."
2002.01-1420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,614.363,619.48,"Well, but we're talking about the... the State has a certain... has assumed a certain obligation and made certain payments."
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,635.91,640.657,"But, Justice Kennedy, that would be... that would be the case with a parent."
2002.01-1420,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,661.794,665.592,"General Gregoire, can I ask you about the person who started all this?"
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,719.091,726.438,"Not by legal process, Justice Ginsburg, which was a lesson learned by the grandmother, Wanda Pierce, in this case."
2002.01-1420,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,734.999,736.364,Why is it wrong?
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,747.714,749.367,"Well, you--"
2002.01-1420,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,749.367,750.11,Why wouldn't they do it?
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,750.11,750.853,--You could.
2002.01-1420,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,757.912,758.571,Why shouldn't they?
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,758.571,759.974,They should.
2002.01-1420,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,771.591,771.946,"Oh, I see."
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,775.372,775.911,Correct.
2002.01-1420,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,775.911,776.571,--that stopped that.
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,776.571,776.959,Correct.
2002.01-1420,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,776.959,777.176,Okay.
2002.01-1420,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,777.48,780.369,--Is that the basis on which the ALJ ruled?
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,783.607,799.938,"The ALJ in the case of Danny Keffeler said that there was no finding that she had wrongfully used the benefits, but went on to suggest at the end that the State hadn't done anything like submit a bill to her showing an expectation that she was responsible to provide for the benefit and care of this child."
2002.01-1420,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,799.938,802.289,"But that wasn't under State law, was it?"
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,804.147,805.883,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.01-1420,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,806.542,830.857,"--Then that's what creates the problem because if you have a State law and the grandmother just says, no, I'm not going to pay this money, which I would have thought was earmarked for that purpose, pretty much, and they won't do it, and then you say, okay, appoint us, and the State says, no, we... we cannot appoint ourselves, and then you say to the grandmother, well, pay us, well, then you really are a creditor in respect to that."
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,830.857,839.03,"--Well... and specifically what happened in the case of Danny Keffeler, when the State attempted legal process against Wanda Pierce, that was wrong."
2002.01-1420,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,840.905,843.944,"And you're in an anomalous situation, aren't you?"
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,878.328,894.925,"--But Justice Breyer, the remedy is the State could go to the Social Security Administration and ask them to consider an alternative representative payee for the child in this case because Wanda Pierce was not providing for the current maintenance of the child as we believe she should."
2002.01-1420,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,897.237,899.755,And she might have if she had to care for the child.
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,909.664,918.309,"--Under State law, we believe the representative payee should pay for the current maintenance of the child whether in the custody of that individual or not."
2002.01-1420,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,927.375,930.348,Which gives it... there's no role for the State court in that.
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,930.348,930.886,--Correct.
2002.01-1420,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,930.886,933.032,In that 405(j) process.
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,934.313,935.178,That's correct.
2002.01-1420,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,936.004,940.712,"And under 405(j), when you go to the Social Security Administration, its options are what?"
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,940.712,945.004,--To remove that individual as a representative payee and appoint another.
2002.01-1420,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,945.004,945.831,Put you in.
2002.01-1420,0,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,945.831,953.011,"If... unless we have a State law, as I indicated in the specific case of Danny Keffeler, would not allow us because she was named guardian."
2002.01-1420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,956.605,957.264,Very well.
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,969.541,977.343,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1420,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1070.267,1080.957,"Is... is the issue of whether there was compliance with section 405(j) properly before us, do you think?"
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1080.957,1082.443,"No, it is not, Justice O'Connor."
2002.01-1420,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1124.06,1139.718,Do... do beneficiaries of SSI funds have a Federal right that they can enforce through a section 1983 action to have the representative payee act in their best interests?
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1139.718,1143.212,What they would do is bring... bring a complaint.
2002.01-1420,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1147.299,1147.753,Right.
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1147.753,1150.148,--then you can bring a complaint with the Social Security--
2002.01-1420,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1150.148,1155.821,Would there be alternatively some lawsuit open--
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1155.821,1156.443,--They... I think--
2002.01-1420,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1156.443,1157.808,--under 1983?
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1157.808,1165.359,"--I'm not sure whether under 1983, but you could bring certainly a State law conversion out... suit against someone if you thought that they were misapplying your funds."
2002.01-1420,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1169.529,1170.001,Right.
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1170.001,1174.359,"--payee, but the vast majority of representative payees are private individuals."
2002.01-1420,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1174.359,1179.355,Does... does the State have any set-off rights that private entities don't?
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1187.9,1191.577,Neither... make sure I understand what you're talking about by set-off.
2002.01-1420,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1198.924,1201.153,"Well, I'm just talking about 407 now."
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1209.986,1214.361,--I didn't understand that to be her... her response.
2002.01-1420,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1226.848,1242.436,I'm assuming there... my... my question is whether... what I'm trying to explore is whether the State has some special advantages that other representative payees might not in the area of being... of being allowed to make certain set-offs to take certain funds.
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1245.696,1246.068,I'm sorry.
2002.01-1420,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1270.112,1277.526,"--In other words, the State of Washington is not relying here on any special statutory authority for set-offs that's applicable only to a State."
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1277.526,1278.519,"--No, it is not."
2002.01-1420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1343.125,1345.809,May I... may I ask you a question about mechanics here?
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1359.472,1360.182,"Yes, it is."
2002.01-1420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1365.362,1372.154,"And the second question I had... there's a lot of discussion in the briefs about something called sweeping, which I don't understand."
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1373.401,1376.983,"--Well, I'm afraid it may have different meanings depending on whom you ask the question to."
2002.01-1420,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.922,1425.22,What if it happens--
2002.01-1420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1425.22,1425.658,--What if it happens 7 months--
2002.01-1420,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1425.658,1425.946,--even 6 months later?
2002.01-1420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1425.946,1426.401,--7 months--
2002.01-1420,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1426.401,1426.894,--Yes.
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1428.546,1438.306,"--With respect to the SSI, the Title XVI benefits, there is... there was after October 1996, and that's why there's some confusion because this case spanned that bridge."
2002.01-1420,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1439.42,1440.806,"It's a little complicated, doesn't it?"
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1440.806,1442.831,--There's a lot of complicated things here.
2002.01-1420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1477.465,1481.924,May I ask you one question I asked the attorney general too?
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1485.434,1487.292,"Yes, for... for two reasons."
2002.01-1420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1487.292,1488.035,The same reasons she gave.
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1488.035,1495.465,"Well, yes, I think it has again the confusion about past reimbursements which could still be for current maintenance and the payment of past debts."
2002.01-1420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.634,1560.671,"But, of course, there's... there's a statutory restriction on what the... when the money comes from the Federal Government that does not apply when the money comes from the family."
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1560.671,1562.407,--On?
2002.01-1420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1562.407,1563.522,407.
2002.01-1420,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1563.522,1564.758,That's right.
2002.01-1420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1584.699,1585.192,Thank you very much.
2002.01-1420,2,43218,teresa_w_roseborough,,1592.416,1595.556,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1420,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1716.777,1731.266,"Ms. Roseborough, I want to make sure that I understand what you're saying because it seems to me you're telling us the Social... the food and shelter and clothing must be provided to the child today and tomorrow and the next day."
2002.01-1420,2,43218,teresa_w_roseborough,,1764.703,1765.779,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-1420,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.727,1783.279,Why isn't the same thing true of the guardian who's been appointed the... the designated beneficiary?
2002.01-1420,2,43218,teresa_w_roseborough,,1794.962,1799.709,"It absolutely would be the payment of a debt... past debt, and it would be subject to the same restrictions."
2002.01-1420,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1799.709,1804.333,Why isn't the same thing when you have an EZ pass if you go through the tolls?
2002.01-1420,2,43218,teresa_w_roseborough,,1810.649,1821.795,"Then the representative payee, having in its possession funds belonging to that child, makes a determination whether or not that is a debt that should be paid in the best interest of the child or not."
