1979.79-67,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.865,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Walter against the United States and the consolidated case Sanders against the United States.
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,13.673,16.59,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.79-67,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,115.359,122.464,When did the -- did your clients first to learn what the FBI had taken possession of the films?
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,122.464,139.579,"Well, Your Honor, in the transcript, it appears that there was some information conveyed by one of the employees, Mr. Grassi to Mr. Sanders about a month or several days or several weeks after the initial seizure or after the FBI seized them."
1979.79-67,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,154.049,157.998,Did your client ask for the return of the films?
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,157.998,159.562,"No, he did not."
1979.79-67,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,177.393,184.681,I think that there is no issue as to the obscenity -- the obscene character of some of the films.
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,184.681,189.846,"Well, I can see it as a -- a trial attorney that it's a factual disposition to the jury."
1979.79-67,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,211.844,217.505,Your client's shipment was -- was (Inaudible) type of thing.
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,228.01,228.578,That's correct.
1979.79-67,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,302.511,307.74,"Well, not many travel under the name L'Eggs."
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,307.74,308.457,No.
1979.79-67,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,320.047,324.323,"You -- you used the -- the word ""seized"" several times --"
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,324.323,324.453,Yes.
1979.79-67,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,324.453,325.83,-- in your statement of facts.
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,325.83,328.779,Yes.
1979.79-67,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,328.779,337.979,Do I correctly have the impression that the outfit to whom -- the hosiery manufacturer to whom the delivery was made and they want her to get rid of the stuff?
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,337.979,339.062,That's correct.
1979.79-67,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,339.062,342.887,And you equate that with the seizure by the FBI?
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,342.887,346.325,For this reason.
1979.79-67,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,410.246,416.616,"Now, when do you say they were the property of the sender, why not the property of the consignee the recipient?"
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,416.616,416.799,That's correct.
1979.79-67,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,416.799,418.15,(Voice Overlap) well --
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,418.15,419.169,I would agree with that also.
1979.79-67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,446.38,454.425,"Well, what if they had been simply stolen by a thief in transit they certainly wouldn't have been the property of the thief even arguably."
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,454.425,455.657,That's correct.
1979.79-67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,455.657,459.425,And what if the thief had voluntary given them to the FBI?
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,465.693,469.866,"Probably not because you don't have the First Amendment issue involved, which is --"
1979.79-67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,469.866,472.0,Just as much as you do here.
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,472.0,473.821,"Well, the -- the goods are -- are stolen."
1979.79-67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,476.908,479.995,"Well, the goods are presumptively protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendment."
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,479.995,481.454,"Yes, these films are."
1979.79-67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,481.454,481.825,Yes.
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,489.975,491.205,That's correct.
1979.79-67,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,515.883,520.214,Let me change slightly Mr. Justice Stewart's hypothetical theory.
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,545.35,551.032,"No, because -- well as a third party, I wouldn't consider that it's seizure under those facts."
1979.79-67,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,572.492,580.587,Would your position be different if the FBI had to kept the 25 samples or the five and turn all the others over to your client?
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,580.587,584.131,"Yes, I think the -- I think the procedural sequence requires that."
1979.79-67,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,585.968,585.993,Well --
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,585.993,586.978,-- and 20 different kinds.
1979.79-67,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,586.978,589.188,You -- you say then you wouldn't be here?
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,589.188,613.937,"Well, if they had been properly notified, went to a magistrate to determine they're obscene so they could keep them, if they had then returned the films they didn't need and kept the only ones that they felt were obscene, of course that that's what I think as I understand it, your procedural safeguards the you've set on your opinions require -- in the Sherwin case for example, we -- that the Fifth Circuit cites the majority opinion."
1979.79-67,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,648.81,649.892,Mr. Zell --
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,649.892,650.871,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-67,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,650.871,660.723,"-- you said that you had -- through hearsay that these films were in the possession of the FBI, why, as a practical matter, didn't you demand them?"
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,660.723,665.721,"Well, as a practical matter, we weren't sure -- the client said these weren't sure."
1979.79-67,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,665.721,671.263,Wouldn't -- wouldn't have been any difficulty to demand them even if he was sure?
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,671.263,675.161,"Theoretically, if they -- they could've demanded them, they could have after when they found out it maybe a month later --"
1979.79-67,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,675.161,679.976,Did you make -- did you make a conscious decision not to demand them?
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,679.976,682.995,"The -- we weren't sure, we weren't sure where the films, where we shoot."
1979.79-67,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,682.995,688.209,"Well, you -- you had a pretty good idea where they were."
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,688.209,689.339,I know about pretty good idea.
1979.79-67,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,696.404,697.414,Did you make any effort to locate them?
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,697.414,698.101,No.
1979.79-67,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,728.063,736.402,You made a point of distinction between films and firearms sawed-off shotguns.
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,744.367,745.602,That's frivolous.
1979.79-67,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,767.018,772.745,"In other words in each case, it's -- it's a presumptive protection with one little presumption that can be overcome."
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,772.745,780.763,"Yes, in particularly where you have the First Amendment in expressing materials, in particular whether it entirely suppressed completely."
1979.79-67,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,780.763,784.111,You -- you make that higher than the right to bare arms?
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,784.111,785.496,Well it's the First Amendment.
1979.79-67,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,873.405,878.849,"Mr. Zell, what was going to happen to the films if they'd gone on their intended route?"
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,878.849,879.845,I've no question in mind.
1979.79-67,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,881.802,889.297,But did your client then retained a -- an expectation that they would not be publicly viewed? What kind of privacy interest did he retain?
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,889.297,890.263,Well in the --
1979.79-67,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,890.263,893.198,You anticipate that they would be shown to people that he --
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,893.198,893.263,They --
1979.79-67,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,893.263,893.579,-- don't know.
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,893.579,895.866,"-- they would be distributed yes, they would be shown."
1979.79-67,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,895.866,896.152,Are they exhibited --
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,896.152,896.674,Purchased --
1979.79-67,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.674,897.982,-- publicly?
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,897.982,898.141,No.
1979.79-67,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,913.193,917.692,I can understand sort of an unfair competition kind of privacy somebody shouldn't be looking at stuff --
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,917.692,917.791,[Laughs]
1979.79-67,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,917.791,924.905,"-- intended to sell, but is there a constitutional privacy interest in not having somebody see that which is being offered for sale in effect?"
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,924.905,928.276,"Well, here -- again you must read the First and Fourth Amendment together."
1979.79-67,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,932.268,934.193,"Your clients didn't want to look at them anymore, did they?"
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,934.193,935.002,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1979.79-67,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,935.002,936.692,Did your clients want to look at them anymore?
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,936.692,938.379,"Well, they -- well [Laughs]"
1979.79-67,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.379,939.023,You mean --
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,939.023,940.948,"I guess they would want -- not in the -- not particularly, no."
1979.79-67,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,943.68,948.47,"You'd like a privacy interest in a -- in a billboard or something like that, isn't it?"
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,948.47,950.359,"Yes, but -- but they're keeping them."
1979.79-67,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,956.742,959.05,"Well, we get by to see -- if -- if we go by to seizure."
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,959.336,959.5,Yes.
1979.79-67,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,959.5,966.97,"-- your point that when they were -- got in the FBI's possession, I'm -- I'm directing my question really at -- at screening, at -- at viewing them."
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,972.673,975.756,"Well, my clients, of course, in the store, they're not viewed by people."
1979.79-67,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,978.285,979.999,"Oh, as I say, there's a commercial interest --"
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,979.999,980.156,Yes.
1979.79-67,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,980.156,981.877,"-- that they are protecting, I understand that."
1979.79-67,0,26354,glenn_zell,,981.877,985.053,And -- and they're not -- and -- and you must buy the film before you could view it.
1979.79-67,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1014.893,1018.382,Mr. Mayock.
1979.79-67,1,45421,w_michael_mayock,,1018.382,1024.059,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-67,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1136.052,1141.908,Was the description prepared by your clients that kind of cover for the films?
1979.79-67,1,45421,w_michael_mayock,,1141.908,1151.116,"As it turned out, Your Honor, the -- the films as -- were pretty much as described in the blurb contained on the box covers."
1979.79-67,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1443.269,1461.134,Do you think it would be a ground for a reversal in this Court if there were a proffer of evidence that a juror had dozed off during the testimony of the witness in an -- the -- the case of perfectly orthodox tour or contract case?
1979.79-67,1,45421,w_michael_mayock,,1461.134,1468.623,I think if a sufficient record establishing that fact is made that that may well be the case.
1979.79-67,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1492.402,1511.017,"Before you'd have a lot reversal, if you require the juror to give his undivided attention from 10 to 12 and 1:30 to 4:30, five days a week, whenever the Court said if you required every -- everyone of the 12 jurors."
1979.79-67,1,45421,w_michael_mayock,,1511.017,1515.195,"Well, Your Honor, I understand that's what we tried to do when we select a jury."
1979.79-67,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1536.732,1539.864,Is -- is the issue of obscenity before us?
1979.79-67,1,45421,w_michael_mayock,,1539.864,1540.576,"Pardon, Your Honor?"
1979.79-67,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1540.576,1542.889,Is the issue of obscenity before us?
1979.79-67,1,45421,w_michael_mayock,,1542.889,1547.33,"No, it is not."
1979.79-67,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1555.137,1577.757,You don't -- you don't think the -- you don't think your -- any of your -- in any of your claims of error subsume a -- a claim that it -- the -- of -- -- of -- that any conviction under the statute is unconstitutional?
1979.79-67,1,45421,w_michael_mayock,,1577.757,1579.981,I'm not sure I understand.
1979.79-67,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.383,1589.851,All right.
1979.79-67,1,45421,w_michael_mayock,,1589.851,1590.848,Insofar as this --
1979.79-67,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1590.848,1594.824,"So your answer is, yes -- no, that question is just not here?"
1979.79-67,1,45421,w_michael_mayock,,1594.824,1600.733,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-67,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1605.373,1610.362,"Very well, Mr. Mayock."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1613.355,1614.556,Thank you.
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1690.433,1697.089,Do you -- do you suggest that there was some kind of a constructive abandonment --
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1697.089,1697.099,"Well, that --"
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1697.099,1698.892,-- as -- as on the basis of --
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1698.892,1709.994,-- part of the Fourth Amendment argument is that petitioners essentially relinquished or abandoned any reasonable expectation of privacy in the shipment of films.
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1775.9,1786.022,Do you think then that the Government could or the FBI could just have kept the films and never done anything with them?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1794.072,1794.199,That's correct.
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1794.199,1794.899,-- where the --
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1794.899,1799.3,I believe -- I believe that the First Amendment would not have required the Government to do anything.
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1799.3,1802.465,I didn't -- I didn't ask you about the First Amendment particularly.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1809.274,1814.101,"I believe so, unless there was a request for their return by someone who had a proprietary relationship."
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1814.101,1822.14,Or you just -- you just generally or rather repository for unclaimed goods at -- by -- at shipping lines or what?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1822.14,1823.328,"No, not necessarily."
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1824.048,1825.21,"Well, do you know where they came from."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1827.676,1829.23,That's correct.
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1829.417,1834.748,How could (Inaudible) what business -- was it yours that keep the property?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1834.748,1839.935,"Well, the Government kept the films as evidence in the criminal investigation and prosecution."
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1839.935,1845.648,"Well, I know, but that's after you thought they were -- they were evidence, after you had looked at them."
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1845.648,1855.869,Would they not be subject to an action and conversion if the petitioners had wanted to bring such an action?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1855.869,1856.341,That's possible --
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1856.341,1856.5,Or --
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1856.5,1856.841,-- Your Honor.
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1856.872,1862.054,-- or taking the property without compensation?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1862.054,1862.889,I assume so.
1979.79-67,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1866.493,1872.26,I can't conceive what the procedure by which you would just keep property and not prosecutor do anything with it.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1872.26,1877.811,"Well, what occurred in this case was the Government did -- did prosecute and initiate charges."
1979.79-67,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1877.811,1883.489,But the question was do -- was it possible just to keep it and not do anything with them?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1889.477,1890.444,"Well, I assume unless a claim has been made --"
1979.79-67,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1890.444,1895.467,And then if -- if you want to answer -- you tell me where you will keep it.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1895.467,1904.616,"I assume that unless a claim had made for these goods, the Government could -- could have either kept it or used it as evidence to initiate a prosecution."
1979.79-67,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1904.616,1910.185,"Well, how could they just keep it?"
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1910.185,1913.01,"Well, was there ever a claim made before?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1913.01,1916.073,"Well, there was no claim made until after indictment."
1979.79-67,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1916.073,1931.253,"Well, that almost goes to the common law of trover, doesn't it, as to whether someone to whom goods are delivered who does not own the goods is obligated to return them to someone he knows whether a demand has to be made and that sort of thing."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1932.747,1933.799,That's correct.
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2134.85,2142.241,What if they had him -- what if they had him in a commercial establishment and had them on the shelves for sale?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2142.241,2150.968,"If they had them in a commercial establishment for sale, they would know -- there would be no expectation of privacy in the contents of the film as necessarily."
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.65,2162.466,But until you – until you had a proceeding and had them declared to be obscene and finally you couldn't take out of circulation all copies of the film.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2163.011,2163.272,"Oh, clearly --"
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.272,2164.15,-- one of them.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2166.412,2185.911,"Well, clearly, the Government could not seize the films from a commercial establishment without a warrant issued by a neutral magistrate and a subsequent determination at the request of the bookstore or establishment owner for determination of obscenity under the Heller case."
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.223,2207.108,"Well, I suppose part of the suppression argument is based on the First Amendment too."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2207.108,2208.838,That's correct.
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2229.761,2251.096,"Suppose the -- suppose what you had seized from L'Eggs or what -- or that you'd taken delivery out from L'Eggs was a locked trunk, and you had -- and you had probable cause that you thought to believe that it contained obscene films, could you open the box without any -- without a warrant?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2251.096,2257.745,"Well, for a locked trunk, we would be in a situation very similar to Chadwick and Sanders situation."
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2257.745,2263.789,"Well, what about -- could you -- could you tell what these films were without screening them?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2263.789,2271.443,"Well, it -- it was clear from the exteriors of the individual film cartons what the films in fact depicted."
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2283.644,2287.826,"And so you didn't need to screen them, but you did."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2287.826,2295.459,"Well, we submit that the screening itself did not amount to a search, simply because there was no longer any expectation of privacy with respect to the contents."
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2295.459,2310.949,But – but you think – you think that because that cartons indicated to you that the films were obscene that just because of your own determination without submission to a judge or anybody else you were entitled to hold all copies of the -- of the films?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2310.949,2312.548,"Well, not -- not exactly."
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2313.231,2314.756,"Well, what is your exact claim, was it by (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2314.756,2323.824,"Well, we're not making the claim that the -- the contents or the descriptions on the boxes gave the Government probable cause to believe the films were obscene and to hold --"
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2323.824,2328.066,In -- in your judgment and the judgment of the FBI.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2328.066,2334.894,"The argument is not probable cause, but it's a lack of a legitimate expectation of privacy in the contents of the films."
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.894,2339.244,"But it gave you probable cause to keep them, to -- to believe that they were obscene, is that it?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2339.244,2339.731,No.
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2371.863,2393.334,"Suppose – suppose that, as a matter of law, the Government should've returned all, but 25 samples as was intimated, I think, in Heller.What effect would that have on the 25 that were retained?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2393.334,2400.679,"Well, our submission is that the 25 that -- that were retained would still be admissible in evidence."
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2400.761,2406.464,(Voice Overlap) the Government might be subject to some kind of a civil claim for --
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2406.464,2406.896,Perhaps.
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2406.896,2406.914,(Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2406.914,2413.025,-- but that should not affect the right of the Government to go ahead with a criminal prosecution.
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2432.012,2448.658,So this is a sort of a plain view argument that you just had the -- what was obviously or what you gave me probably cause to believe was a -- was obscene material in violation of the law and it had been delivered to you and you could keep it.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2460.705,2467.917,"Well, Mr. Justice White, we don't rely on the plain view doctrine to justify the Government's acquisition of the films from L'Eggs."
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2467.917,2468.798,I know -- I know that.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2475.164,2478.007,"Well, our submission as far as keeping the films is that --"
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2478.007,2489.124,What would you have done -- what would you have done if you -- if after you screened the film it turned out that the designations on the box were completely false?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2497.098,2501.958,I suppose that the Government may have -- if -- if the Government were able to discover the true owners of the films --
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2501.958,2503.242,I hope you would.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2503.242,2506.674,-- the Government would have returned them.
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2506.674,2514.783,Mr. Schulder can I ask you about your -- the argument that there is no expectation of privacy -- as I understand that you make two separate arguments on that point.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2527.587,2528.092,In assumption of those charges --
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2528.092,2532.343,-- if that's true it doesn't matter whether they are guns or personal business records or anything like.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2550.674,2559.069,"Well, we -- we have no specific authority with respect to precisely this type of situation, but we have analogized in our brief the other --"
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2559.069,2559.59,All right.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2559.59,2559.664,-- situation such as --
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2559.664,2570.404,Then your second theory which is -- is quite different is that -- that there were sufficient indicia of what the contents were on the outside of the box to -- to give up any expectation of privacy.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2592.812,2599.852,"Well, as -- as I said in addressing Mr. Justice White's questions, I'm not sure that probable cause is really the --"
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2599.852,2600.294,"Well, your position I take it --"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2600.294,2601.315,-- determining factor here.
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2601.315,2609.268,"-- is that if you have probable cause from the outside of a packet -- package to know the contents are illegal, you can go ahead and open without a warrant?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2609.268,2611.029,That's correct.
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2611.029,2623.017,"Well, then if you don't have probable cause you couldn't get a warrant so that absolutely removes the -- the requirement of a warrant from every inspecting parcels that come into your possession that you don't expect to get."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2629.003,2634.789,"Well, our submission is that once the container clearly demonstrates or --"
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2634.789,2640.569,"By “clearly demonstrate,” do you mean that it demonstrates more clearly than just giving probable cause?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2655.567,2658.641,That's not exactly what we're saying.
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2678.325,2683.028,The probable cause here is that in labels on the packages themselves.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2696.738,2701.884,"Well, there -- there are two related -- I've strains to what we're saying here."
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2729.833,2732.359,"Well, but this -- that you now argue with transparent bag."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2752.428,2755.397,I'm not really certain what the answer is.
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2761.031,2775.826,"Well, are the -- are the items which appear in the footnotes of the Court of Appeals' opinion, the descriptions that were found?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2775.826,2776.385,That's correct.
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2777.714,2786.884,And could that leave anyone in doubt -- anyone in doubt of the pornographic nature of the materials?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2786.884,2788.515,We don't believe so.
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2788.515,2791.406,Or wasn't that the answer to the question there?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2791.406,2791.701,"Well, except that --"
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2791.701,2804.315,"That the – that the description gave probable cause -- the description prepared by the petitioners of their own materials, gave probable cause in abundance."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2804.315,2813.014,The description gave probable cause or perhaps more than probable cause as to what was contained inside of these film cartons.
1979.79-67,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2813.014,2815.322,"Counsel, may I ask this question?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2849.352,2850.318,Not necessarily.
1979.79-67,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2850.318,2852.931,Why not?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2859.351,2862.261,"Well, the -- which containers are you talking about?"
1979.79-67,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2862.261,2864.241,I'm talking about anything that (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2864.241,2866.25,"Well, we have two -- two types of containers."
1979.79-67,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2868.278,2868.426,I'm talking --
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2868.426,2868.988,-- the individual --
1979.79-67,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2868.988,2874.037,-- I'm talking about -- let's say viewing the film.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2874.037,2875.873,Okay.
1979.79-67,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2881.361,2882.732,Why -- why do you -- why do you make that concession?
1979.79-67,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2882.732,2885.402,"Well assuming, if they did consent, it's –-"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2885.402,2887.556,If they did consent we don't have to reach the -- the other --
1979.79-67,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2887.556,2889.899,Are you familiar with (Inaudible)
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2889.899,2891.019,Sure.
1979.79-67,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2891.019,2896.057,"Well, don't you agree that consent may be implied as well as expressed?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2896.057,2896.977,"Yes, we do."
1979.79-67,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2896.977,2901.367,"Well, I wonder why you don't argue that."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2901.367,2901.64,"Well, I suppose --"
1979.79-67,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2901.64,2910.151,If you told us at the outset of your argument that plaintiff's -- petitioners knew the FBI had the film.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2918.604,2920.133,That's correct.
1979.79-67,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2922.06,2928.139,"Well, I -- I would apply to both -- keeping them and viewing them."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2933.409,2935.179,"No, not at all."
1979.79-67,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2963.727,2964.538,Right.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2977.469,2979.872,I believe so.
1979.79-67,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2979.872,3017.694,Following up on Justice Powell's questions about the difficult Fourth Amendment issues in this case is -- would you agree there isn't as bright a line as might be implied between the simple suitcase or steamer trunk which one has reason to believe might contain a contraband and say a pistol holster with the outlines of a pistol on it as to whether that may or may not be plain view?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3026.164,3030.665,Certainly.
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3030.665,3048.972,"Mr. Schulder, assume that a misdelivery occurred of a carton in the same fashion you had here and it got into the hands of the FBI and the carton and had a label on it -- this box contains the records of my purchases and sales of firearms and somebody's name on the bottom of it and the man was not a registered firearm dealer."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3059.394,3062.856,"In our view, yes."
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3062.856,3063.838,On -- on what theory?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3065.631,3073.21,"Well, this -- the -- the exterior of the carton itself provides ample probable cause -- ample basis."
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3073.21,3081.925,"And all the Government needs to open a container that comes into its possession is probable cause, that's your submission."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3081.925,3087.442,"Well, I don't want – I don't want to take that position because the Court explicitly rejected it in Chadwick."
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3087.442,3097.015,Well [Laughs] then it seems to me what you're saying in substance is that your position and -- and final analysis rests precisely on the grounds rejecting in Chadwick.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3097.015,3097.141,Well --
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3097.141,3098.168,That's what I'm trying to find out.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3098.168,3098.827,I don't think so.
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3105.377,3108.547,"Well, I've given you an example of a carton that had exteriors."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3121.707,3139.573,"Because when -- when the person places his items within that container and writes on the outside what the container actually contains, he is in effect, opening up the container to anyone who wants to look at the contents."
1979.79-67,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3139.573,3143.356,"What if he puts right below that, “No stranger may open.”"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3152.095,3152.28,"Well, I --"
1979.79-67,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3152.28,3158.36,You cannot -- you can inadvertently make known what's inside something that you don't intend to be public.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3158.36,3158.906,That's correct.
1979.79-67,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3168.546,3170.906,It's in a container.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3171.944,3179.164,The question is whether there was a sufficient indication that he wished to retain a privacy interest in your hypothetical.
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3186.041,3197.754,"Well, these – these descriptions on these films went considerably beyond simply saying these are guns purchased."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3207.548,3218.888,That's correct and I believe counsel for one of petitioners has indicated that the descriptions were in fact accurate -- accurate in terms of what actions were portrayed on the films.
1979.79-67,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3218.888,3222.499,"Well, that gives -- certainly provides probable cause."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3229.078,3230.014,"Well, we submit though that by --"
1979.79-67,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3230.014,3238.915,"And thus assume there's ample probable cause -- as the question of the Chief Justice indicated that were was, but that's not the end of the problem."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3238.915,3247.511,"But here, the information that gave the agents probable cause was placed either by petitioners or it was left by petitioners on the outside of the container."
1979.79-67,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3247.511,3248.19,Well --
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3248.19,3261.088,"And by that we submit by doing that -- by allowing these films to be shipped with that explicit description on the covers they in effect, abandoned any privacy interest in the -- in the contents of the individual --"
1979.79-67,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3261.088,3264.294,"Well they might've -- it might've abandoned the films also, as well as consented."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3264.294,3265.285,That's correct.
1979.79-67,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3265.285,3268.315,And that would then -- the problems would disappear just as they would've had.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3269.452,3274.392,Certainly.
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3274.392,3280.088,But they -- you don't -- you certainly don't claim that they abandoned any property interest.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3285.648,3288.351,"Well, they didn't claim the film until after they were indicted."
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3288.351,3293.639,"Well, all I say is they didn't abandon their property interest."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3293.639,3304.487,"Well, so far as the Government knew prior to -- to the indictment or prior to the motion to suppress, by all appearances, it -- it did seem as if they'd -- they had abandoned any (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3304.487,3310.515,That was more than a year was it since at -- such as the time lapse from the time the FBI got them until they demanded them back?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3310.515,3311.833,That's correct.
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3311.833,3314.056,Nearly two years as I recall the record.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3314.056,3320.33,Well that was nearly two years between the initial shipment and the actual trial itself.
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3333.942,3338.048,At the time of -- of the -- was there a suppression motion?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3338.048,3339.121,Yes.
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3339.121,3347.556,"At that time, did -- did the judge determine that there was probable cause to believe the films were obscene?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3347.556,3353.21,"Well, the judge did not make a determination on the obscenity question in that -- in that --"
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3353.21,3362.212,"Well, was there ever prior to conviction any judicial -- any searching judicial look at the -- at the film?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3362.212,3381.673,"What happened was the suppression at hearing concluded the day before trial and the District Court stated on the record that since the Court didn't believe that there was any prior restraint here, since there was no evidence that petitioners didn't have other copies of the films and that there was no evidence the films were being --"
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3381.673,3383.534,How many copies did you have in all?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3383.534,3386.219,"There were 871, which we --"
1979.79-67,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3386.219,3387.309,Constant film or --
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3387.309,3391.581,"Well, there 25 different titles and so most of them were in fact duplicates."
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3411.0,3416.45,"Mr. Schulder, just curiosity, how many of the titles were -- of the 25 titles were determined to be obscene?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3417.597,3419.596,"Well, the indictment charged five."
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3419.596,3420.564,Five is as it was.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3420.564,3421.256,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-67,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3421.256,3422.588,And we don't know about the other 20?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3422.588,3424.095,No.
1979.79-67,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3424.526,3431.84,Not a conviction on all five.
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3431.84,3450.328,"Will you tell -- tell us about the descriptive matter that's in the Footnote 4 on page 10 of the Court's opinion in your appendix, is that the material that would be made available to the customers on the shelf to presumably to induce them to buy their film?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3450.328,3456.376,What was contained on the box covers was to be viewed by potential customers.
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3458.219,3463.67,"This was the -- this was the, come on, did they get them interested in the contents of the package?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3463.67,3465.769,It was.
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3465.769,3472.123,Would you say it overstated or understated?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3472.123,3478.817,"I suppose like anything else -- like the expression, “You can't judge a book by its cover.”"
1979.79-67,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3595.433,3606.562,"They -- they left -- as I understand on the third call, the woman finally left her name, but on no calls, they leave their address where they could be reached."
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3606.562,3611.454,"That I believe, is what the record reflects, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.79-67,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3651.471,3651.807,(Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3651.807,3653.084,-- to get their property back.
1979.79-67,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3653.084,3660.125,When did the petitioner demand from the FBI the return of the film?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3660.125,3665.407,Approximately two years after it was taken from them -- at the time of the trial.
1979.79-67,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3665.407,3671.701,"And you -- you -- could it be said that up to that time, you had abandoned it?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3671.701,3673.724,"No, I don't believe that that was the case."
1979.79-67,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3674.163,3675.674,Then what was it?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3675.674,3676.73,The situation was --
1979.79-67,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3676.73,3678.678,And lack of interest in?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3678.678,3684.771,"Well, perhaps lack of interest in being prosecuted for [Laughs] what turned out to be a --"
1979.79-67,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3684.771,3685.064,Well --
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3685.064,3685.92,-- a federal case.
1979.79-67,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3685.92,3690.373,"-- abandonment would -- would stop prosecution too, wouldn't it?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3690.373,3692.358,I don't know if that would be the case.
1979.79-67,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3692.358,3695.022,"Well, wasn't that what you were working on?"
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3695.022,3696.052,That it was abandoned?
1979.79-67,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3696.052,3697.329,Yes.
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3704.336,3712.068,"To the extent that until such time, I guess, is a prosecution was initiated it would be unclaimed."
1979.79-67,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3712.068,3715.768,Why were the bills of lading instructed to be destroyed?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3715.768,3716.893,They were not.
1979.79-67,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3729.179,3731.438,Or that there were any instructions to that effect?
1979.79-67,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3731.438,3733.611,That is correct.
1979.79-67,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3758.406,3759.139,"Thank you, gentlemen."
