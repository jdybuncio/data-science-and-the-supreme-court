1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.654,We will hear arguments next in Seattle Times v. Rhinehart.
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,10.92,12.022,Thank you.
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,29.9,33.935,"Where were these papers filed at the time they were sought, Mr. Schwab?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,33.935,38.839,--Most of the discovery had not been completed at that point.
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,40.689,42.208,"Well, was it on file or not?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,42.208,42.491,--Yes.
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,67.324,69.859,"Well, how about the rest of the answer to the Chief Justice's question?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,69.859,71.327,--I'm sorry.
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,71.327,75.196,The only things that you sought had been already been filed in the public record?
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,75.196,76.462,"Oh, I'm sorry, sir."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,108.184,110.785,"Well, I'm afraid my question wasn't really clear enough."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,134.985,138.937,Some of what we were seeking was in the possession of the clerk.
1983.82-1721,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,143.389,152.697,"So that... so far as that stuff is concerned, your right of access to it really depends on the court order, doesn't it?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,152.697,154.197,"On this court order, that's right, sir."
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,154.197,154.913,On the--
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,154.913,158.683,The court below reserved its final judgment on discovery until we completed this.
1983.82-1721,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.683,167.789,"--Well, but your original right of access to it under the discovery rules depended on the decision of the Superior Court in Washington to grant your discovery."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,167.789,168.706,"Yes, it did."
1983.82-1721,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,185.334,196.124,"Well, in a sense, the order that conditions your access to the discovery is of the same parcel with the order that granted you discovery, isn't it?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,196.124,197.957,"I think that's right, yes."
1983.82-1721,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.957,209.948,"If the court had denied you discovery altogether in this order and just said no, you can't have it, would you be here with this argument?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,209.948,211.717,I think the argument would be quite different.
1983.82-1721,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.352,218.954,But no First Amendment right to discovery.
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,218.954,231.428,"--Well, I think that in the context of a defamation action, Your Honor, in which we are being sued on allegations that we have defamed the Respondents, there may be some constitutional overtones to discovery."
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,243.402,247.104,"Well, could we take just a little... let's take a specific example."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,269.117,274.838,--The question involves two elements.
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,284.527,289.365,Even if it is just in the possession of the lawyers and both lawyers say it is none of your business?
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,289.365,290.098,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,290.098,296.084,"And I would think... that position, I take it, that isn't dependent upon your being a defendant in the libel suit."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,296.084,298.286,"Oh, access might be dependent."
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,302.524,309.344,What if you weren't a party to this case and it was just any civil case in which a deposition had been taken and the results were in the possession of the lawyers?
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,317.117,318.217,"No, sir, I don't argue that."
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,318.217,329.925,"But it is... but you certainly would say that if a deposition was filed in court, that you had the right of access to it."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,329.925,332.543,"Well, the access questions are different."
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,352.338,353.206,"Yes, yes."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,353.206,354.872,In our state that's the practice.
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,354.872,355.439,Yes.
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,355.439,357.241,"Now, normally, documents aren't filed with the clerk."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,377.572,392.248,Let me see if I have got this... the picture is a little confused because your client is a litigant and is also seeking some information not as a litigant but as a representative of the media.
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,392.248,394.082,"Oh, we are seeking it as a litigant, sir."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,394.082,408.524,"What about two private parties who have a lawsuit and they are taking depositions pretrial and they are having interrogatories, and none of them are filed; they remain in the possession of the lawyers?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,415.197,438.895,"I would... again, I would like to say the access question, but we are not seeking this under rights of access but rather as a litigant, but I think the access questions are different, and I think that the depositions that are in the files of the lawyers that have never been submitted to a court in connection with a summary judgment motion or any other kind of dispositive motion would probably be treated differently."
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,440.278,441.764,"Well, that's what you answered to me before, isn't it?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,441.764,442.747,I believe so.
1983.82-1721,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,446.982,456.524,"Well, Mr. Schwab, in both your answers to the Chief Justice's question and to Justice Blackmun, you refer to access cases and then intimate this is not an access case."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,456.524,457.007,--Correct.
1983.82-1721,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,457.007,459.44,How do you define an access case?
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,459.44,467.446,"The access cases are the cases in which the press as a nonlitigant is seeking access to the discovered information, and that is not this case."
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,475.652,489.744,"And of course, I suppose if you were just... if the press were just a litigant in a tax case in which there were depositions, you wouldn't be making the same arguments that you are making here."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,494.53,503.036,"We think the argument receives... is worthy of additional weight in a libel suit, but there would also be situations in other kinds of litigation."
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,503.036,507.19,"You would not, what... in a tax case you have a First Amendment right to access?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,507.19,508.706,"Well, not to access, sir."
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,513.677,515.343,You have First Amendment right to publish it.
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,515.343,516.043,--To publish.
1983.82-1721,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,521.597,524.299,"Well, Mr. Schwab, you are not making that argument as a litigant."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,524.299,525.901,"Yes, sir, we are."
1983.82-1721,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,525.901,529.353,"Your right to publish, you are making that argument as a litigant?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,529.353,536.506,"We are arguing... yes, we are arguing that as a litigant we have First Amendment rights in the judicial process and First Amendment rights in--"
1983.82-1721,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,536.506,538.792,"Well, you mean as a news media litigant?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,540.41,543.01,--The same argument would be made.
1983.82-1721,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,543.01,543.796,It would?
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,543.796,554.402,"Although I think the argument has greater force for members of the media and for public interest advocates such as consumer groups, the NAACP, the ACLU and organizations like that."
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,554.402,562.091,"You have no cases to support you on that from around here, giving the press superior rights to another litigant, do you?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,562.091,563.408,"Well, I'm not asking for superior rights."
1983.82-1721,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,568.062,570.18,"Well, how does publication further your interests as a litigant?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,570.18,574.982,There are several ways publication can further our interest.
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,585.106,586.639,Before the trial has been held?
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,586.639,589.308,"--Before the trial has been held, sir, and that's what we're asking."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,589.308,592.677,"Well, then you are asserting right as media, not as a litigant."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,592.677,596.414,But I think the same right would exist in a nonmedia defendant.
1983.82-1721,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,614.542,615.259,"Publish in what, in their journal?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,615.259,616.192,"I'm sorry, sir?"
1983.82-1721,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,616.192,617.993,"To publish it where, in their journal?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,617.993,623.147,"Well, I don't think where is as much the test as whether they have a right to disseminate it."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,636.472,638.741,"You can use it as a litigant, of course, can't you?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,638.741,640.524,"Yes, that's the only... the only way we can use it."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,640.524,647.363,"And you are, I repeat, asking for a special right because your client happens to be a newspaper."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,647.363,660.32,"We are asking for a right on behalf of anyone who has First Amendment interests at stake in a litigation, and that would apply equally to, and particularly, the public interest advocates."
1983.82-1721,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,660.32,664.724,"Well, how can you tell whether someone has First Amendment rights at stake in the litigation?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,664.724,670.212,"I think on a case-by-case basis, depending upon the function of the litigation."
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,675.264,683.12,"I thought you just were arguing that any litigant, when he gets discovery, has a First Amendment interest in being able to publish the results of the discovery."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,683.12,683.47,Exactly.
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.236,688.007,And just anybody in any kind of a case.
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,689.99,700.564,"Well, I'm trying to say that the public interest litigants might have a stronger argument, Your Honor, but basically I am arguing that any litigant has a protected First Amendment interest in being able to disseminate or use for any purpose--"
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,700.564,706.718,"In any kind of a case, whether it is libel or tax or science or environmental or whatever?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,706.718,707.885,--I think lines can be drawn.
1983.82-1721,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,708.837,714.574,"Well, does a defamation litigant have a greater First Amendment right than any other kind?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,714.574,717.776,"--Well, it's hard to say people have a greater First Amendment right."
1983.82-1721,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,722.245,729.584,"Well, this is independently, then, of this being a defamation suit in your argument for a First Amendment right to publish."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,729.584,745.343,"--I'm arguing, yes, whenever a trial court presumes to freeze discussion, I'm arguing that the court should be required to weigh the First Amendment interests at stake, much like you did in Nebraska Press v. Stuart, that the First Amendment considerations are entitled to a place on the scale."
1983.82-1721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,757.568,771.911,"And yet you are talking only about a litigant's right, and you are not talking about a litigant's right who just happens to be the defendant in a libel suit, or you are not talking about a litigant's right just because he's a member of the press."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,771.911,773.028,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,773.028,789.139,"Then it would be your view, if you postulate this hypothetical question, proposition, an individual sues a bank, his own banker for any reason you can conceive of."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,813.171,816.857,I'm saying the litigants themselves are protected by the First Amendment.
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,818.725,833.068,"Well, then, could one of the litigants take a page ad, let's say, in the Seattle Times, and... or two pages, even better, and publish all these pretrial depositions over the objection of the other party?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,833.068,838.02,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's exactly our argument, and that's happening around the country right now."
1983.82-1721,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,843.44,844.626,Do we have to go that far?
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,844.626,849.261,"No, Your Honor, you don't."
1983.82-1721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,911.882,912.115,What difference does it make that it was not relevant?
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,924.625,926.358,"--I think that is a factor, Your Honor."
1983.82-1721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.549,944.353,Would you say that a lawyer who is a free-lance writer on the side would have the same First Amendment right?
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,944.353,952.125,I think in many cases he would.
1983.82-1721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,952.125,953.075,He would?
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,953.075,962.715,"I think the First Amendment applies equally, and one of the cornerstones of our jurisprudence has been that the First Amendment rights should not be restrained in advance."
1983.82-1721,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,970.154,980.026,"Well, I don't see how you can argue that, Mr. Schwab, because the Superior Court should have... could have said no, we are not going to give you any discovery in this case."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,999.19,1002.292,"We submit, Your Honor--"
1983.82-1721,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1002.292,1007.362,When the access that you get is made conditional in the very granting of the access.
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1007.362,1015.365,"--That's correct, and that was part of the reasoning that the D.C. Court went through in Tavoulareas."
1983.82-1721,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1026.923,1028.692,"Well, how about the Snepp case?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1028.692,1032.91,"Well, I think Snepp is distinguishable."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1071.435,1113.096,"Suppose you have two lawyers in some heavy litigation of the kind we are talking about who are dismayed at the prospect of the excessive cost of pretrial discovery and interrogatories, and they agree informally that plaintiff's lawyer will submit a series of informal questions by letter to the defendant's lawyer, and they will reciprocate, and these will be answered informally, and yet with a stipulation both ways that to the extent relevant to the case, if it ever goes to trial, these may be used in evidence as admissions."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1120.952,1125.254,"--The First... yes, Your Honor, I think so."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1125.254,1126.106,Who would have that right?
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1126.106,1126.989,"Either, either side."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1128.239,1128.589,Either side.
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1128.589,1130.158,--Either one of them would have a right--
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1130.158,1134.859,"Now, what about, what about demand of the local newspaper to get at those things?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1134.859,1142.298,"--I think they would have a right to say we don't want to give it to you, and then if the newspaper sought a court order, we would be under the different line of reasoning of the access cases."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1142.298,1147.935,But either litigant could take a coupe of pages in the local newspaper and put it all there?
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1147.935,1155.625,"Yes, Your Honor, again, subject to the laws of defamation, right of privacy, subsequent punishment and so on if he utters falsehoods."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1188.827,1191.012,"When you say our First Amendment, now, are you speaking--"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1191.012,1191.879,"--I'm sorry, my clients'."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1191.879,1200.618,"--as a representative of... well, are you speaking of your client as the press or as a litigant?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1200.618,1201.487,"Both, Your Honor."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1201.487,1202.537,Well--
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1202.537,1204.47,The press does have a special function.
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1204.47,1205.42,--Are they they same?
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1205.42,1206.839,I think they are different.
1983.82-1721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1422.71,1423.694,"Mr. Schwab, may I ask you this question?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1434.768,1442.707,"--Well, the test... we are asking for a test, and I can't imagine that some information might meet that test."
1983.82-1721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1442.707,1450.194,"Well, as long as some is, isn't it a virtual certainty that we are going to have a federal question in every case in which there is such information?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1450.194,1452.229,Yes.
1983.82-1721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1452.879,1456.098,That we're going to have to we're the last court of resort for discovery all over the country if you--
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1456.098,1462.585,"--Whenever parties are seeking orders to gag litigants, because that runs right into their First Amendment right to access."
1983.82-1721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1462.585,1466.537,--So every good cause for a protective order raises a First Amendment issue.
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1466.537,1471.322,We believe it does because the First Amendment protects freedom of expression and freedom of the press.
1983.82-1721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1471.322,1471.905,"Let me ask you this, too."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1475.224,1478.511,We're not because everything has stopped since this protective order in June 1981.
1983.82-1721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1480.961,1485.999,"Had there not been an appeal from the protective order, how soon do you suppose you would have been ready for trial?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1485.999,1490.735,"Oh, probably six months or a year after the protective order had been issued."
1983.82-1721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1490.735,1494.52,"And if that had happened, then you could have gone in and asked for all the information to be released."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1496.306,1497.189,It would have come out at trial.
1983.82-1721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1551.624,1556.178,What if you just adopted a policy of not having the lawyers turn anything over to their client?
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1569.136,1572.204,"I think in most cases... I think in most cases, Your Honor, that really gets in the way of one's ability to prepare for trial."
1983.82-1721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1573.287,1573.937,This is that tough a case.
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1573.937,1574.604,I need to talk to my client.
1983.82-1721,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1579.639,1601.504,"Now, to be sure I understand, are we dealing with two different types of materials here, some which haven't yet been produced and some which have been produced before there was any protective order issued."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1601.504,1602.121,"That's right, Your Honor."
1983.82-1721,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1602.121,1602.654,Okay.
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1602.654,1616.364,Is there any risk in this process of making it very difficult or even impossible to get a jury that hasn't heard a lot about the evidence before the case comes to trial?
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1616.364,1617.78,I think it is a minimal risk.
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1626.653,1631.124,"Well, but the other cases you're referring to didn't always have that."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1638.194,1639.98,I think... I don't think it's a significant risk.
1983.82-1721,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1676.486,1696.281,"Mr. Schwab, it would help me if you could tell me whether the issue that is primarily involved in this case is limited to names and amounts of contributors to the defendant... to the plaintiff organization, names and amounts of money contributed."
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1696.281,1698.232,That's the essence of their damage--
1983.82-1721,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1698.232,1699.982,That's the essence of what you are interested in.
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1699.982,1702.467,--Financial affairs and information about the contributors.
1983.82-1721,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1702.467,1704.653,"Well, if they are tax returns, you are not--"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1704.653,1706.005,"Well, there would be more."
1983.82-1721,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1708.888,1728.685,"--Well, suppose instead of the party who claimed it had been libeled were one of the nationally known ministries, Protestant, Catholic, Mohammedan, whatever, with millions of subscribers, members and donors, your position would have to be the same, wouldn't it?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1728.685,1732.054,I think it would depend on whether they injected that issue into the lawsuit.
1983.82-1721,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1733.239,1744.963,"Well, let's suppose a newspaper made the sort of claims that have been made according to the pleadings here in this case, they were sued for libel--"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1744.963,1752.55,"--We would... if it was something we needed to pursue discovery in to defend, yes, then I am arguing that we have a right also to disseminate that information."
1983.82-1721,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1752.55,1766.977,"--So the fact that this particular sect, Rhinehart's organization, is as you characterize it something of a charlatan really doesn't make any difference, does it, in terms of your theory?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1766.977,1767.51,No.
1983.82-1721,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1769.012,1770.062,None whatever.
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1770.062,1782.219,"We would argue that at least a court should balance the First Amendment rights of expression that are at stake, and then it should closely examine and scrutinize the alleged harm."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1811.239,1820.695,"In what you postulate, he means to have it go public when, as, and if it gets into the courtroom but not before, necessarily, isn't that so?"
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1820.695,1826.682,"Well, he means... puts it at issue."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1827.784,1834.021,You are not suggesting that all of the material that is covered by pretrial discovery goes in evidence in a lawsuit?
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1834.021,1835.604,"No, of course it doesn't."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1835.604,1837.406,A fraction of it goes in.
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1837.406,1838.09,"That's right, Your Honor."
1983.82-1721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1840.842,1841.758,May I just ask one question?
1983.82-1721,0,23227,evan_l_schwab,,1847.079,1851.948,"No, I think we do have final judgment, Your Honor, because the order, restraining order is final and effective."
1983.82-1721,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1871.277,1875.063,"You will not be charged with that time, counsel."
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,1877.015,1897.179,"Chief Justice Burger, members of the Court, I would like to address a few of the concerns that were discussed in opening argument, namely, what kind of information are we dealing with here to which this protective order will apply."
1983.82-1721,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.483,1932.999,A promise made by whom?
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,1932.999,1935.601,--By counsel for the Seattle Times.
1983.82-1721,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1980.547,1985.951,The preceding counsel thought he was obligated as a result of discovery to file--
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,1985.951,1986.618,Yes.
1983.82-1721,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1986.618,1990.688,--Mr. Rhinehart's income tax returns with the clerk of the court?
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,1990.688,1992.522,"With the clerk of the court, which obviously he wasn't."
1983.82-1721,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2247.951,2261.127,"Of course, your clients were plaintiffs in this lawsuit, weren't they, Mr. Edwards, and to a certain extent they do give up rights of... to a very large extent they give up rights of privacy when you bring a lawsuit for libel."
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2261.127,2273.452,"They give up rights of privacy when they are plaintiffs only for the purposes of that lawsuit, and the fact that they are plaintiffs I think is something that you can make too much of, Your Honor."
1983.82-1721,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2283.658,2285.343,"Well, now, just a minute."
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2289.211,2289.395,Mm-hmm.
1983.82-1721,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2289.395,2298.901,"Now, are you saying that is some kind of an independent, federal, constitutional right to go into the Superior Court of King County and plead a case?"
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2298.901,2308.606,I am saying that perhaps the most fundamental right that anyone has in our society is to go into court and redress a grievance.
1983.82-1721,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2308.606,2309.374,"Well, okay, now."
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2321.266,2321.432,Okay.
1983.82-1721,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2343.595,2349.166,"Well, did he say that was a... did the Chief Justice say that was a federal constitutional right?"
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2349.166,2355.32,The Chief Justice was not talking in terms of a libel case in the King County Superior Court.
1983.82-1721,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2357.689,2359.255,He was talking natural law.
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2359.255,2359.807,--Yes.
1983.82-1721,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2364.926,2373.58,"Well, isn't one answer to the question posed to you that the legislature of the State of Washington at least gave that right to all the people in Washington?"
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2373.58,2374.032,That is right.
1983.82-1721,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2374.032,2380.269,"And that's... you don't need to go beyond that to find it in the federal constitution, do you?"
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2380.269,2381.519,"I don't think so, but I--"
1983.82-1721,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.519,2403.448,"You wouldn't, you wouldn't, you wouldn't say that... you wouldn't say that as a plaintiff furnishing discovery under this protective order that if information was actually relevant and was introduced at trial that the protective order would prevent publication?"
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2403.448,2407.002,"--No, Your Honor, and the opinion of our State Supreme Court--"
1983.82-1721,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2407.002,2419.827,"Even though, even though, even though technically you could say the information would be... if it were published, would be used for something besides litigation."
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2419.827,2420.86,--That is correct.
1983.82-1721,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.86,2430.618,"But you say once it is actually legitimately filed in court or used in the litigation, it is open to the public then."
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2430.618,2432.685,I think the public interest in--
1983.82-1721,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2432.685,2434.904,Unless there is something special.
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2440.474,2442.058,--That's possible.
1983.82-1721,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2443.275,2453.198,"But you don't claim any of this information would be sealed forever if it were used in defense, legitimately used in defense or in prosecution of that."
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2453.198,2454.483,--That is correct.
1983.82-1721,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2486.186,2490.823,Even subject to the... even subject to the secrecy order?
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2490.823,2491.506,Yes.
1983.82-1721,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2493.442,2530.781,"Well, Mr. Edwards, if your position in your petition for certiorari is correct that all these constitutional privacy interests are invaded by a discovery order, and Mr. Schwab's position that his clients' and all sorts of other clients' First Amendment interests are invaded if there is a protective order, then isn't Justice Stevens' earlier question to Mr. Schwab brought about in double, so to speak, that every single discovery order that a court makes is now a matter of federal constitutional import?"
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2530.781,2557.385,"I think there is not any question but that the position being advanced here by the petitioner is that the rule this Court should announce should apply to all litigation and all parties without regard to whether they are newspapers or pamphleteers or anyone, and that if the rule advanced by Petitioner is supported, that you will constitutionalize all protective order questions."
1983.82-1721,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2557.385,2579.464,"Well, let me... suppose the newspaper had published a story that the main supporters to this sect or this group are the following people, and you sued them and said that's a lie, that's libelous."
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2592.974,2593.474,Mm-hmm.
1983.82-1721,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2593.474,2596.926,"Now, would you say that they weren't entitled to get the contribution list?"
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2596.926,2600.878,"That isn't the context in which this case arises, but--"
1983.82-1721,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2600.878,2601.195,"I know, but."
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2601.195,2607.901,"--Under those circumstances, they would have a more compelling reason to get the contribution lists than they do here."
1983.82-1721,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2607.901,2619.958,"You might still be... you might still win on a protective order, though, and say that we have to furnish it if we want to be a plaintiff in this case, but it should be furnished under a protective order."
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2619.958,2622.827,That is the position we took at trial.
1983.82-1721,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2632.533,2644.407,"Well, then, once the deposition or the interrogatory is offered in evidence, it would lose any right of privacy, would it not?"
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2644.407,2649.645,"That's what the State Supreme Court opinion says, and we are not arguing that."
1983.82-1721,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2649.645,2654.53,"Unless, as suggested, it was a patent case or a national defense case, something of that type."
1983.82-1721,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2654.53,2662.802,"You just agreed that your position is that if it were used at the trial legitimately, then it is open to the public."
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2662.802,2663.302,That is correct.
1983.82-1721,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2743.754,2757.514,"Well, you don't have to find a federal right of access to courts to sustain the position of the Supreme Court of Washington in this case because they found as a matter of state policy that the access to courts was all-important."
1983.82-1721,1,35778,malcolm_l_edwards,,2757.514,2759.43,That the access to the court was what?
1983.82-1721,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2759.43,2761.946,"Was all-important, or very important."
