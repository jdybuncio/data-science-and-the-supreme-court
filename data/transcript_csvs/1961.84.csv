1961.84,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,30.559,"Number 84, Jesse Turner, Appellant, versus City of Memphis, et al."
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,33.601,39.74,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.84,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,182.076,183.724,Have you stated those facts?
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,183.724,184.376,Pardon me.
1961.84,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,184.376,186.679,All the types of appeals in the Court of Appeals?
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,186.679,187.939,"Yes, sir."
1961.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,187.939,191.194,At the same time as you file a petition for certiorari?
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,191.194,192.076,"Now, we have not filed --"
1961.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,192.076,193.638,"Or man -- mandamus here, is that it?"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,193.638,194.19,Pardon me.
1961.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,194.19,195.143,I'm -- tell me what is here.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,195.143,196.678,Please let's go down the line.
1961.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,200.463,201.272,An appeal here?
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,201.272,201.823,That's right.
1961.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,201.823,203.79,And a petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals?
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,203.79,204.321,"No, sir."
1961.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,204.321,205.818,A -- appeal in the Court of Appeals.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,205.818,207.329,That's right.
1961.84,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,207.329,209.117,Upon the same order that's what I'm what trying to point out.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,209.117,221.342,"Yes, sir, the exact same order and the same record is now before the Court of Appeals because we had some doubt that this was properly a three-judge court case."
1961.84,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,225.909,235.853,"And now, I gather your position is, therefore our decision yesterday is satisfied that an appeal here has not lied that should have been a single judge determination."
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,235.853,236.314,"Yes, sir."
1961.84,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,236.314,238.944,And therefore the proper appeals to the Court of Appeals.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,238.944,241.531,That's right sir.
1961.84,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,279.933,282.1,Does the case been sent in the Court of Appeals?
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,282.1,282.713,"No, sir."
1961.84,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,290.831,295.708,"Now what the trial judge did here, I gather, was to abstain and send it to the state court, is that it?"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,295.708,296.762,That's right.
1961.84,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,296.762,304.806,And your position is that there's no more reason for a state court determination of this statute and ordinances than there was in the Bailey case (Voice Overlap)?
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,304.806,306.852,"That's right, Your Honor."
1961.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,306.852,308.561,And this was a three-judge court hearing?
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,308.561,309.702,"Yes, sir."
1961.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,310.996,314.05,Again before Judge Marion and Boyd and then --
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,314.05,319.503,The Ci -- the Circuit Judge Martin and Judge Miller from Nashville.
1961.84,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,319.503,320.197,Where is this --
1961.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,320.197,321.922,William Miller from Nashville or --
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,321.922,322.976,"Yes, I think it is."
1961.84,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,323.395,330.492,(Inaudible) from Nashville is state rule (Inaudible).
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,354.424,368.753,"Well, you know, the regulation here on its face, either required or permitted segregation and we say that there is no construction which the state court could give to that regulation."
1961.84,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,368.753,375.795,How can the regulation -- supposing the state court said that this regulation not authorized by the statute?
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,375.795,396.285,"Well, we would still have the constitutional question here that is the reference of the state court would not dispose of a constitutional question whether this lessee is subject to the Fourteenth Amendment so that we say there was no need to refer to the state court for that construction."
1961.84,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,396.285,399.107,(Inaudible)
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,399.107,423.112,"The -- yes, the constitutional issue would be not be mooted or eliminated from the case if the state court should hold that the regulatory agency was without power to issue such regulation because, you see, Dobbs Houses says, quite apart from any state order or statute, we segregate on our own as a matter of business practice."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,429.737,436.647,"Mrs. Motley, is this case, in your view, ruled by Burton against the Wilmington Parking Association?"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,436.647,437.817,"Yes, sir."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,437.817,450.99,"Well, that's what I had assumed and in that regard, the difference from the Bailey case because in Bailey case we were dealing with the conceded public utilities."
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,483.568,499.43,"I think in this case, they conceded in effect that this was Burton because they conceded that this was a restaurant in a municipally owned airport, the purpose of which was to serve the public."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,510.113,525.991,"The -- the court of -- the District Court, the three-judge court, am I right, doesn't -- was this decided, was this ruling made with the decision of the District Court before or after the Burton decision here?"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,525.991,528.609,"This decision was rendered before Burton, I believe."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,528.609,529.354,Before?
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,529.354,532.634,"Yes, sir, but I think that this Court's --"
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,532.634,542.67,"Of course, there's no reference -- there's no reference, I'm right, am I not, I usually look through that, there's no reference to the Burton decision in the -- in the lower court."
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,542.67,543.646,That's right.
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,549.017,556.403,"Yes, then -- I said it -- there was no reference to the District Court to the -- related to the Delaware decision is that the --"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,556.403,557.035,"No, sir --"
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,557.035,558.32,-- state decision.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,558.32,559.997,"No, the state co -- well, I think yes."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,560.868,574.527,"For all we know -- for all we know, the District Court in this case might have acted otherwise than it did, if it had the Burton-Albertson decision before it, is that right?"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,574.527,579.434,"Well, all they did here, well they might have, but all they did here was to refer to state court for that."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,579.434,580.4,I understand that.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,595.72,597.097,"Well, yes."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,597.097,615.538,I'm just trying to find out whether this is like Bailey in that -- the starting point of Bailey was a series of decisions which didn't leave the question open that deemed to be open by the District Court in Mississippi.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,618.223,618.778,Yes.
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,618.778,624.46,"But as Justice Harlan pointed out, there are differences and I'm pointing out some more differences."
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,624.46,632.818,"Well, I think here, the -- it's like Bailey because this Court had decided the Muir case which again was a lease of a public --"
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,632.818,633.491,What's this?
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,633.491,638.94,The Muir versus Louisville Park Theatrical Association in the same Circuit.
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,679.005,692.677,"But when say the Court -- when you say the Court sent it back to reconsider in the light of Brown, you're implying, are you not, that this Court didn't say this is so, didn't do in that case but we did in Bailey yesterday?"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,692.677,698.101,"Well in Bailey, yesterday, there was also an airport restaurant involved and the lessee and this Court --"
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,698.101,698.39,"Yes, but --"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,698.39,699.96,-- did the same thing.
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,705.275,705.474,But if --
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,705.474,711.133,"They have, likewise, leased their restaurant to a private lessee."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,711.133,716.828,"Oh, that was said in Bailey unless I'm mistaken, the Government transportation."
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,730.358,730.68,"Well, I think --"
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,730.68,731.442,Fiction.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,731.442,748.653,"I think Bailey dealt with transportation facilities and this is transportation facility, also. And I think the Court intended to say that any state enforced segregation in any transportation facility is settled by the decisions of this Court."
1961.84,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,748.653,754.432,And it was the restaurant that the airport attack in Mississippi say involved in the --
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,754.432,755.019,"Yes, sir."
1961.84,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,755.019,756.105,"-- party, party at --."
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,756.105,760.507,-- Party; the lessee as well as the airport authority.
1961.84,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,760.507,762.752,"The same rules apply, wasn't it?"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,762.752,762.899,"Yes, sir."
1961.84,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,762.899,767.036,"The other -- the other kinds of transportation facility, or bus transportation."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,767.036,767.839,Railroad.
1961.84,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,767.839,768.031,Railroad.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,768.031,770.113,"Railroad, that's right."
1961.84,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,778.276,779.425,Right.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,779.425,784.99,So that we think it is governed by Bailey because Bailey had the same facility involved.
1961.84,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,784.99,789.08,How many separate cases are there on the airports segregation here?
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,789.08,795.413,"I believe there is only the Hendrik case and the Coke, District Court decision."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,820.286,823.522,"What is it that you -- you ask of this Court, Mrs. Motley?"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,823.522,844.954,"We ask this Court to do one of two things; either refer this case back to the District Court pursuant to its power to determine the authority of the District Court and say to the District Court, “Your only authority here was to issue the injunction prayed for because the facts were conceded."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,879.198,918.32,"Well that -- I didn't -- I didn't hear and therefore could not -- couldn't understand what are answer was to Justice Harlan's question that if the District Court now, in light of Bailey and all that preceded, might pose that in fact Memphis didn't have power, that the regulation is ultra vires to specific powers and go on that ground which is a very different thing from striking down as invalid an exercise of power."
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,922.871,932.559,"Well, he might that but he would still have to say, in addition, I think, that this lessee is -- is a Burton case that wouldn't be --"
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,932.559,935.338,As I -- I (Voice Overlap) -- All I am saying it doesn't make a difference.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,942.232,942.825,That's true.
1961.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,943.863,946.895,This would go back to the District Court in Memphis?
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,946.895,948.303,"That's right, Your Honor."
1961.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,948.303,949.178,You're now --
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,949.178,967.01,"Or -- well, yes, if the Court didn't do that pursuant to what it did in Bailey than to treat the papers to search for or before judgment in the Sixth Circuit that we say first, that this Court under -- as they did in Bailey should determine the authority of the District Court in this case."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,967.01,982.66,"There's a -- there's certain that another thing might be done if parties on both sides, if there is a consensual withdrawal of this appeal then your -- your appeal because the Court of Appeals would go forward, wouldn't it?"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,982.66,983.653,"Yes, I sho --"
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,983.653,985.878,I'm not trying to manifest litigation.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,988.514,995.405,"That -- that -- that is true, but we say there's nothing for the Court of Appeals to do in this case and that --"
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,995.405,997.863,The same thing that you are asking us to agree.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,997.863,998.022,Yes.
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,998.022,1000.571,Mainly to reverse what the District Court has done.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1000.571,1000.718,"Well, let me --"
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1000.718,1007.755,If you are right to the District Court -- didn't give you the injunction your declaration you prayed for.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1016.044,1017.03,That's right.
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1017.03,1020.6,"You, in fact, have an appeal pending in the Court of Appeals."
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1020.6,1020.862,That's right.
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1020.862,1033.06,So I must suppose that the ordinary thing is that the Court of Appeals should do or it properly should have been asked to do and you did ask to do but you naturally are two straight steel (Inaudible)
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1033.06,1051.938,"Yes, but we say that's -- we think that this Court can under Bailey, direct the entry of a judgment which is all the Court of Appeals would be doing and that we should be saved the necessity of going through an appeal through the Sixth Circuit because there's nothing for them do."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1051.938,1053.462,"You're there now, aren't you?"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1054.561,1055.859,"Yes, sir, we are."
1961.84,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1055.859,1058.866,"I take it too, you'd be long while getting reach to it."
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1058.866,1059.564,Pardon me.
1961.84,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1059.564,1062.428,"It'd be quite a while getting reached, wouldn't you in the Sixth Circuit?"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1062.428,1064.739,"Well, we have the come up in a normal cause."
1961.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1071.686,1073.908,"And you affirmatively asked them to hold it, haven't you?"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1073.908,1075.227,"Yes, we (Voice Overlap)."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1075.787,1076.758,I'm not suggesting you should do this.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1082.919,1085.364,That's right.
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1085.364,1092.474,"Did you -- did you, in your appeal, to the Court of Appeals say that it was not court of three-judge court?"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1093.591,1105.941,"Well, yes, we appealed on the ground that we felt that there was some doubt but then we thought that this was properly an appeal from a one judge court."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1127.644,1137.81,"I just opened your brief which I haven't done before not out of disrespect but I don't do it normally, but I noticed that here you claim that is a proper three-judge court."
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1137.81,1145.761,"Well, we did appeal here and I say that this Court settled that matter yesterday with the Bailey case."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1145.761,1148.218,All I am saying it wasn't clear to you until yesterday.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1148.218,1149.124,That's right.
1961.84,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1149.124,1150.972,"Well, I guess it wasn't clear to a lot of people --"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1150.972,1151.769,That's right.
1961.84,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1151.769,1164.326,You have definition with that so -- you have a definition (Inaudible) before Bailey (Inaudible) under the Court's (Inaudible)
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1164.326,1164.629,Yes.

1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1187.169,1187.774,That's right.
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1187.774,1189.403,"Well, I don't -- I don't follow that before."
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1189.403,1190.27,Well --
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1190.27,1208.919,"-- your claim has been all -- all the way through what you conce -- I'm not -- I'm not remotely criticizing you or any body else, but as a tangled procedure or situation, for me, it's -- it's perhaps it goes on because that -- that is in need likes to understand it fully without disposing of it quickly."
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1216.8,1217.459,That's our --
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1217.459,1218.477,And that's your claim now.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1219.996,1221.317,That's right.
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1221.317,1226.21,And you said that's a three-judge court business.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1226.21,1228.256,"Well, when we filed a complaint, we've --"
1961.84,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1228.256,1230.929,I can't understand what it was.
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1230.929,1232.08,"Well, what was your complaint?"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1233.409,1247.013,"Our -- our complaint -- that complaint preceded on the 12 -- 1343 (3) an alleged that acting on the power of state laws, city ordinances, the defendants were segregating Negroes in the airport."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1247.013,1250.041,And you did not -- that -- the statutory materials?
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1250.041,1255.208,"No, we did not set out in the complaint that there was statute so and so and so."
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1255.208,1256.02,"Oh, but --"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1256.02,1263.344,"The defendants in their answer said, “We rely on this order as giving us the authority to segregate them.”"
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1269.713,1271.011,"To me, that makes no difference."
1961.84,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1285.651,1287.79,"As I understand, it was not judicial notice."
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1289.237,1289.739,That's right.
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1289.739,1290.1,I underst --

1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1290.848,1291.983,That's right.
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1291.983,1293.313,I understand that.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1301.56,1302.522,It's Tennessee.
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1302.522,1303.721,"In Tennessee, I beg your pardon."
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1310.195,1310.699,That's right.
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1310.699,1318.512,And they would understand what you did just as to whether you do understood it namely that you regard the state law as non-existing --
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1318.512,1318.761,That's right.
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1318.761,1320.702,-- because it subverts the federal law.
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1320.702,1321.255,That's right.
1961.84,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1321.255,1329.885,"Therefore, this is a case in which you asked for a declaration of rights as against the existing state law."
1961.84,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1329.885,1339.604,"Ms. Motley, do you -- do you know whether counsel objects to hear the pro -- procedure you now propose?"
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1339.604,1340.127,"No, sir."
1961.84,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1341.096,1342.299,You -- you do not?
1961.84,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1342.299,1345.943,-- object to this -- this proposal.
1961.84,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1345.943,1347.417,I see.
1961.84,1,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,1356.697,1389.877,"Mr. Chief Justice, as Your Honor well knows the city attorney had available authority to -- to be merely seeing anybody and after that it was not tried in every way possible could be helpful but I just don't know if counsel will fully explain and hand down just exactly what their position is, it may leave with their answers in some doubt away which you read last night the Bailey case."
1961.84,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1389.877,1390.622,Yes.
1961.84,1,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,1400.132,1403.878,If I could this at -- some change in some issue in this.
1961.84,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1403.878,1404.635,"Yes, yes."
1961.84,2,19602,constance_baker_motley,,1406.885,1411.657,I'd like to save the remaining time for rebuttal.
1961.84,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1413.601,1420.395,You may do that.
1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,1423.135,1426.391,"May it please, Your Honor and Members of the Court."
1961.84,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1457.778,1463.205,"Well, we only -- don't usually do it to summary case but we will do it in this --"
1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,1463.205,1463.546,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1961.84,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1463.546,1467.147,You has -- you may divide your time.
1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,1467.147,1469.383,May it please the Court.
1961.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1470.422,1485.243,I hope that as soon as you can as far I am concerned if you respond to the suggestion that Bailey case covers it or that you state -- state your position on it.
1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,1485.243,1492.111,"Well, we will, of course, concern as to the position that counsel would take."
1961.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1621.984,1623.373,"Well, that wouldn't be --"
1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,1623.373,1623.547,Sir?
1961.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1623.547,1637.499,"That wouldn't be necessary, would it, if in the facts to both sides who admit it, showed beyond dispute that the situation existed in connection with the transportation facilities which existed in the Bailey case?"
1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,1638.264,1641.218,"I necessarily, Your Honor, it's already been indicated here."
1961.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1656.312,1667.467,Would it -- would it bother you -- would it bother you to state precisely at this time what you think the record shows that we have to consider as the facts from each sides?
1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,1667.467,1668.258,From each what?
1961.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1668.258,1669.493,From both parties.
1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,1680.76,1684.058,"Yes, it takes on both interstate and intrastate."

1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,1695.496,1700.46,It is an attractive place for people who go and dine and watch airplanes take off and land.
1961.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1826.727,1847.185,"May I ask you if the record shows by your admission that this is an airport that people come in there on interstate union to eat at this place that the city has leased it, the city has -- the city's agent has passed the regulation that (Voice Overlap) required segregation."
1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,1847.185,1847.624,"No, sir."

1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,1861.229,1861.559,I understand.

1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,1999.516,2007.602,"Well, the faith -- no, well, in action, yes, on the part from a recommending standpoint on the office of the City Attorney."
1961.84,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2114.828,2119.202,Are you saying -- let's see if I understand you.
1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,2154.085,2155.183,"In a way, yes, sir."
1961.84,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2155.617,2172.995,"We -- we -- to me -- I'm afraid -- I'm afraid that the decisions of the Court in that argument has never been able to understand the answer to that argument, but the answer has been made by controlling decisions."
1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,2198.898,2202.476,"Well, the point that we're trying to make is, may it please Your Honor, if given --"

1961.84,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2206.607,2207.437,-- a good ordinance --
1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,2207.437,2221.528,"If given an opportunity, we say that the public officials of the City of Memphis have acted in good faith and within the terms of this Court's opinion in the Brown case."

1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,2262.322,2266.005,And we will then uphold the law as declared by the Courts.

1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,2278.977,2286.974,"On the face of it -- on the face of it, yes, if they served these people, they are disobedient to the state law."
1961.84,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2291.771,2295.324,But it's all in the city -- against whom is this bill?
1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,2295.324,2298.827,It's against both the City of Memphis and Dobbs House.
1961.84,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2303.816,2304.929,Well are you saying --
1961.84,3,23985,frank_b_gianotti_jr,,2304.929,2320.295,"-- if they op -- if they operate in a manner not authorized by the state law. We say that if we permit them to operate then, we are being subjected, that is the official to the City of Memphis are being subjected to criticisms."
1961.84,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2382.675,2383.526,Your name sir?

1961.84,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2386.496,2392.021,"Mr. Heiskell, you may -- you may proceed."
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2392.021,2399.687,The Dobbs House restaurants operate the airport restaurant in Memphis under a lease from the City of Memphis.
1961.84,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2565.184,2567.119,"Well, let me ask you this."
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2606.743,2612.076,I cannot argue that in view of subsequent decisions of this Court that we have that right.
1961.84,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2612.076,2612.577,Yes.
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2612.577,2617.337,"I think that the cases that have been decided by these Court, the Delaware case --"
1961.84,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2617.337,2617.819,Yes.
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2617.819,2623.984,-- is -- deprives me of being able to make any argument to that effect or to sue it by as my client.
1961.84,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2623.984,2626.976,But the city still maintains that?
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2626.976,2627.202,I can't --
1961.84,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2627.202,2630.138,They do in their answer.
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2630.138,2631.006,"Yes, sir but I say we --"
1961.84,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2631.006,2633.268,"But the answers were all filed before Burton, is that correct?"
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2633.268,2633.607,"Yes, sir."
1961.84,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2663.379,2683.148,"Well, I gather Mr. Heiskell, if the City were now to say, we agree Burton and Bailey or both means that we can't sustain the constitutionality of the regulation and therefore, our defense -- your defense now would fall, wouldn't it?"
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2683.148,2683.435,I would say thi --
1961.84,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2683.435,2685.095,Because everybody concedes that.
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2685.095,2698.927,I would say this now that we would still be subject to arrest by state authority for violating what is on the books as a valid state statute until judicially declared unconstitutional.
1961.84,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2698.927,2700.189,And you want a court decision to say it?
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2700.189,2701.444,"Yes, sir."
1961.84,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2701.444,2703.468,You prefer the state court rather than a federal court?
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2703.468,2710.432,We thought that that would be the way that these matters should be handled expeditiously that -- rather than burden this Court with each of the --
1961.84,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2710.432,2711.098,But we have it here now.
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2712.977,2716.785,I -- very -- please --[Laughter]
1961.84,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2716.785,2730.394,"Mr. Heiskell, as I understand it, you now withdraw your claim of right to segregate on racial lines and accept the Burton decision --"
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2730.394,2730.508,Yes.
1961.84,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2730.508,2732.841,"And say you're within it, is that right?"
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2732.841,2734.93,I -- I cannot say to the contrary.
1961.84,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2734.93,2743.69,"As I understand it, you can't defer but as I understood you, after the position of the city solicitor, with reference to the city."
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2743.69,2743.804,I --
1961.84,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2743.804,2747.157,Let us ask -- let us ask if that is the situation.
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2747.157,2749.789,We have no right to rely on that statute.
1961.84,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2754.461,2791.962,"No, no, no, but as I understood you, as I have listen to you to no effect and no avail, as I understood you, it was your position that in view of the decisions of this Court and the responses made with reference of them by the Supreme Court of Tennessee it is your position that segregation on racial law with any of the governmental authorities of the State of Tennessee are no longer within -- are no longer defensible by state law -- under state law."
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2791.962,2796.506,"But I said, may it please the Court, that that should be determined by a state court, --"
1961.84,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2796.506,2797.644,I understand that.
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2803.037,2823.444,"Except the Burton case and the Bailey where decisions of a state court and as I remember the well, as Your Honor's remarks in the Burton case, Ms Motley that I would always thought to defend would -- was make it slowly and I think, Your Honor used his words generally to that effect in the Burton case."
1961.84,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2823.444,2827.905,Well are you still standing on the defense to which the Chief Justice referred?
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2827.905,2830.729,"On the state statute, yes sir."
1961.84,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2830.729,2833.103,You mean you -- you defend that as Court --
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2833.103,2837.901,If the Court please the defense that we have in there is the regulation of the Department of Conservation.

1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2845.583,2847.358,Not applicable to the City of Memphis.
1961.84,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2847.358,2862.095,What's the relevance and as before the -- the references you made to the various decisions by your Supreme Court accepting Brown against the Board and all that followed?
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2862.791,2864.705,"I used Brown, may it please Your Honor --"
1961.84,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2864.705,2867.227,I'm not -- I'm just trying to find out what your position was.
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2867.227,2871.21,-- was left for deliberate speed argument only not with the other.
1961.84,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2871.21,2875.564,I understood you to say you did not have authority to agree --
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2875.564,2877.987,That was the first question that Chief Justice asked me --

1961.84,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2958.615,2959.316,I beg your pardon?
1961.84,4,30974,john_m_heiskell,,2959.316,2967.01,"I say, what Dobbs House does under a similar defense that they have raised is a choice, it's a permissive."
1961.84,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2970.731,2973.403,"Well, but you've raised it as the defense."
