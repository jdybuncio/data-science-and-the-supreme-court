1983.82-2140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.636,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Hobby v. the United States.
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,9.767,11.289,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, sir."
1983.82-2140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,86.507,107.18,"Would you agree, Mr. Pollitt, that the... a key question, if not the key question in this case is, assuming the truth of all that, which we accept because it's agreed to, its impact on this particular case is the Gorton thing, isn't it?"
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,107.18,109.023,"Sir, it was below."
1983.82-2140,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,151.741,153.472,"You aren't pressing a constitutional issue, then?"
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,153.472,154.213,"--No, sir."
1983.82-2140,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,159.836,165.55,"Well, what if we didn't agree with your supervisory argument?"
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,166.431,169.333,"--Well, then we'd go back to the constitutional issues, Your Honor, please."
1983.82-2140,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,169.333,170.395,Are you going to argue those?
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,170.395,185.124,"I will argue them only in the context... for example, the Rose v. Mitchell and the equal protection cases under the Fourteenth Amendment, and what I refer to myself as the Heard v. Hodges situation."
1983.82-2140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,229.092,233.504,"Mr. Pollitt, was that really what you'd call an exercise of the supervisory power?"
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,248.705,251.417,"You're correct, Mr. Rehnquist."
1983.82-2140,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.498,295.464,"Well, are you going to explain why this petitioner has standing to require us to either decide the supervisory or the constitutional?"
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,295.464,296.065,--Yes.
1983.82-2140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,356.905,361.499,"Mr. Pollitt, you're not arguing a due process violation, then, I take it."
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,361.499,362.538,--I beg your pardon?
1983.82-2140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,362.538,365.831,"You're not arguing a due process violation, then?"
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,365.831,366.802,"No, ma'am."
1983.82-2140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,454.689,467.618,"Mr. Pollitt, do you think this Court, if it were to exercise supervisory power over the federal judges, would have several options of how to do that?"
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,471.769,475.442,We think that that is the only way to do it.
1983.82-2140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,477.925,479.646,You mean they would not get the message otherwise?
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,479.646,487.781,"--We think that the message which would go out otherwise would be extremely garbled, and it might be hard to understand, and we think that--"
1983.82-2140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,487.781,489.874,Even if it were clearly expressed?
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,489.874,523.224,"--If Your Honor, please, if I may elaborate slightly in my argument here, this is the lack of prejudice type of theory which was advanced by Justice Jackson in Cassell v. Texas back in 1950, and repeated in Rose v. Mitchell by Mr. Justice Potter Stewart, with Mr. Justice Rehnquist agreeing with Mr. Stewart, but no one else has advanced it since 1880."
1983.82-2140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,575.397,597.653,"Mr. Pollitt, if we expressed what you're asking, in as clear terms as it would expressed in a rule adopted by the traditional procedure, do you think that the federal judges of this country would not follow that rule?"
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,597.653,599.423,"No, I don't think that, Your Honor."
1983.82-2140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,807.37,810.653,"Mr. Pollitt, is it clear there's a violation of 243?"
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,814.394,824.51,"243, Your Honor, says that it is a crime to discriminate on the basis of race or color in the appointment of jurors."
1983.82-2140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,824.51,826.19,But that didn't... you're not alleging that happened.
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,830.514,831.325,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-2140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,833.446,838.198,"--as to which one will be foreman, or foreperson, rather."
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,842.462,846.874,"--Well, it's not on its face."
1983.82-2140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,901.362,908.764,"One other reason that concerned me about your reliance on 243, I suppose there's an element of intent required to prove violation of that statute."
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,908.764,923.015,"We don't think that anyone... so far as I know, and I've researched it... my research may be faulty, but I think in ex parte Virginia, the Virginia judge was the last person indicted under 243."
1983.82-2140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,926.546,934.703,"But I wonder, in order for you to prevail, are you requiring us to hold, in effect, that these judges committed a crime?"
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,934.703,935.452,"--No, sir."
1983.82-2140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,953.246,957.547,"What you're chiefly concerned with is that the judges get this message, I'm sure."
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,958.827,962.55,"What I'm chiefly concerned with, Your Honor, is Wilbur Hobby, my client."
1983.82-2140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,973.149,980.102,You think he might get a favorable verdict if he... if the foreman of the jury were properly designated.
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,980.102,981.705,"--I think it might make a difference, Your Honor."
1983.82-2140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1010.615,1018.899,"Mr. Pollitt, would the statute of limitations have run on the offense in the event that the indictment were dismissed?"
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,1018.899,1020.411,"I would not think so, Your Honor."
1983.82-2140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1020.411,1022.432,Do you know whether it has or not?
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,1022.432,1028.016,I would think this appeal would stay the statute running of limitations.
1983.82-2140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.145,1117.598,"May I ask, before you sit down, in the Rose v. Mitchell context, where we're reviewing a state court, a state's conviction, there really is no possible way in which this Court could correct the problem unless it reversed convictions."
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,1135.479,1141.083,"--Well, if Your Honors please, I don't know of any alternative remedy."
1983.82-2140,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1233.694,1247.024,"Professor, what if we... I know you don't agree with the Court of Appeals in this respect, but what if we did... that the foreperson's job is really just ministerial?"
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,1265.478,1278.307,"Well, if Your Honors please, in the Fourth Circuit, it was argued 6(c), and the Fourth Circuit looked at 6(c) and 6(c) looks like the foreperson is ministerial."
1983.82-2140,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1352.705,1354.127,--Where was this trial?
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,1354.127,1358.28,"It was... the trial was in Raleigh, North Carolina, if Your Honor please."
1983.82-2140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1358.28,1363.432,Because there's a difference between the grand jury in a rural area and in a city area.
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,1363.432,1371.116,"Well, where the Eastern District... the grand jury is drawn from the Eastern District, which stretches to the ocean at Wilmington."
1983.82-2140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1371.116,1373.657,"In a rural area, it's a great big thing."
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,1375.219,1376.569,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-2140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1384.015,1389.419,--You're talking about the foreman being a person that everybody looks up to.
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,1398.575,1401.807,"Well, I really don't... can't answer that, Your Honor."
1983.82-2140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1409.061,1410.002,I'm sorry I got you off it.
1983.82-2140,0,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,1410.002,1410.693,"--Oh, no, sir."
1983.82-2140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1432.008,1436.2,Mr. Schwartz.
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1436.2,1465.227,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question in this case is whether a white male defendant is entitled to seek dismissal of the indictment returned against him by a validly-constituted federal grand jury by alleging that a pattern of discrimination against women and blacks in the selection of grand jury forepersons from among the members of the grand juries exists in the particular judicial district in which he was indicted."
1983.82-2140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1743.119,1750.245,"Well, what if we disagree with the Court of Appeals as to the significance of a grand jury foreperson?"
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1757.749,1760.05,Well--
1983.82-2140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1760.05,1764.655,"And in Rose v. Mitchell, what did we--"
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1764.655,1770.247,--The Court as a whole did not really decide.
1983.82-2140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1779.955,1781.655,"--Well, then I'll put it another way."
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1785.798,1798.456,"--We do not believe that this Court is required... that is really the central question in the case, because the question whether the foreperson's job is important or unimportant is not one that exists that in a vacuum."
1983.82-2140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1814.355,1823.492,"Well, what would the... what do you suppose the Court would have done in Rose if they had thought the case had been made, the discrimination case had been made?"
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1829.456,1831.189,"--Well, there are two points."
1983.82-2140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1831.346,1832.378,Do you agree with that or not?
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1832.378,1835.911,"--I don't really agree with that, Justice White."
1983.82-2140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1835.911,1837.251,I guess you can't.
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1837.251,1846.436,"Well, perhaps I could, because there is a factual difference between the system involved in Rose."
1983.82-2140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1888.134,1897.77,"What would the word ""foreman"" mean to a blue collar worker that was on the jury?"
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1897.77,1900.122,"Well, I--"
1983.82-2140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1900.122,1901.962,"Could it mean ""boss""?"
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1901.962,1908.557,"--I don't think it would mean ""boss"" in the sense that you must do what this man says."
1983.82-2140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1908.557,1910.488,Could it mean authority?
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1910.488,1912.831,There might be some suggestion of authority.
1983.82-2140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1912.831,1916.074,Could it mean more authority than an ordinary member?
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1916.074,1938.577,"Grand jurors are also instructed, Your Honor, that they each have a vote, and whatever informal influence there might be, there's no reason to believe that grand jurors have the perception that they are subordinate to the foreperson in the sense that washes out the significance of their vote."
1983.82-2140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1938.577,1944.411,"Well, isn't he more important to everybody in that room than everybody else?"
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1960.143,1962.897,"Justice Marshall, the judge is not wasting his time."
1983.82-2140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1972.234,1977.506,"What if he were say I appoint you as a teller, I appoint you as a vote person?"
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1982.598,2001.452,"--We don't think that the label itself is sufficient to establish that, especially because of the other gaps in the argument that the appointment of a foreperson confers some... infringes in a defendant's rights."
1983.82-2140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2320.408,2322.28,"You keep saying ""foreperson""."
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2324.351,2326.983,"--Justice Marshall, my rules say ""foreman"", and--"
1983.82-2140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2326.983,2330.235,I didn't say your rules... rules of the court in this case.
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2330.235,2334.539,"--The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure use the word ""foreman""."
1983.82-2140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2334.539,2335.819,Foreman.
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2337.942,2340.463,"I say ""foreperson""--"
1983.82-2140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2340.463,2343.275,Are you trying to say that you've already agreed that the other side is right?
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2343.275,2344.084,--No.
1983.82-2140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2345.025,2346.845,I just wondered.
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2346.845,2356.933,"--To the extent that we use that terminology, Justice Marshall, it does reflect that we do not assume that there is any reason that a foreman of a grand jury should be a man."
1983.82-2140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2499.768,2504.523,"Mr. Schwartz, supposing the judge asked the bailiff right before the selection to"
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2511.876,2516.991,"--Justice Stevens, our answer would depend on... I'll ask you for--"
1983.82-2140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2516.991,2518.02,"And he further said,"
1983.82-2140,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2524.225,2526.626,"--In our view, several things would make a difference."
1983.82-2140,2,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,3050.402,3051.043,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-2140,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3051.594,3055.748,You have about seven minutes remaining... nine minutes remaining.
1983.82-2140,2,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,3055.748,3059.511,"--I certainly won't take that much time, Your Honor, I hope."
1983.82-2140,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3095.953,3103.4,"I am sure you would not intend to suggest that those 20 judges, if this Court speaks, will not comply with what this Court says."
1983.82-2140,2,21370,daniel_h_pollitt,,3103.4,3103.69,"Oh, no."
1983.82-2140,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3212.71,3213.771,"Thank you, gentlemen."
