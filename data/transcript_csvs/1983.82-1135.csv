1983.82-1135,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.218,"Ms. Benitez, you may proceed when you are ready."
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,53.218,56.753,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1135,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,157.166,159.468,"Now, two counsel were appointed, weren't they?"
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,159.468,160.618,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,160.618,165.689,"Through the briefs I find small mention of Mr. Samples, was that his name?"
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,168.391,178.949,The record reflects that he participated to a very limited extent by occasionally bringing a matter or two to the attention of the trial court out of the presence of the jury.
1983.82-1135,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,183.651,192.089,So your opposition would take the position that the two counsels stood in stark contrast one to the other.
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,192.089,198.593,"I don't believe that Respondent has particularly made that argument, but the record does reflect that that is the case."
1983.82-1135,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,226.429,228.145,Counsel?
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,228.145,230.381,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,321.491,337.601,"Ms. Benitez, under Faretta, do you think a trial judge is permitted, once a defendant invokes his right to represent himself, to say okay, fine, but you are on your own?"
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,349.058,352.343,"No, I don't believe that the trial court does have that obligation."
1983.82-1135,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,352.343,354.212,"Why do so many of them do it, then?"
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,354.212,362.901,I believe that the trial courts do it because it makes the trial in a case such as the instant case less burdensome to the trial court.
1983.82-1135,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,397.789,405.061,"Well, of course, when the defendant has elected to go on his own, I would think the trial court would feel relieved of that sort of responsibility."
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,405.061,424.559,"Your Honor, I believe that the argument to that effect that the Respondent has made overlooks the fact that the trial court also has an interest in the fundamental fairness of the trial proceedings and has an interest in ensuring that a criminal defendant who is going to be convicted pursuant to that court's judgment obtains a fundamentally fair trial."
1983.82-1135,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,424.559,446.888,"Are you familiar with some of the cases in which after a defendant asserted his Faretta right to try his own case and the court did not appoint counsel to stand by, and then later that same defendant attacked the results on the grounds that the court should have appointed someone one a standby basis?"
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,448.757,454.661,"Your Honor, I believe that those that the... that some of those cases have been cited."
1983.82-1135,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,615.629,621.033,"Ms. Benitez, let me take up once more the subject I asked you about earlier."
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,637.744,643.981,"No, Your Honor, I can't represent that that is the position of all the trial judges in Texas."
1983.82-1135,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,702.62,709.174,"Well, what happened, if this was tried in 1972, if this is happening, the federal habeas is eleven years later?"
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,710.876,711.576,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,730.837,732.206,He finally made the grade.
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,732.206,734.408,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,734.408,742.162,"Ms. Benitez, this is irrelevant, but what has happened to Mr. Estelle who is on so many cases here?"
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,743.097,749.335,"Mr. Estelle has resigned as Director of Texas Department of Corrections, and Mr. McKaskle is now the Acting Director."
1983.82-1135,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,818.645,829.62,"Of course, another way of preventing relitigation of those things would be for it to be established that a Faretta defendant is genuinely on his own and that what he doesn't object to at trial he can't raise later."
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,829.62,836.607,"That's true, and I think under most circumstances that would be the result and that would be the holding of the reviewing court."
1983.82-1135,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,870.614,878.885,"Well, the prosecutor as well has obligations to ensure a basically fair proceeding, isn't that true?"
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,878.885,890.527,"Yes, that is true, and I think that there is, under most circumstances, a much greater burden on the prosecutor to make sure of the fairness of the proceedings when a defendant is acting pro se."
1983.82-1135,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,941.976,948.547,"Ms. Benitez, to agree with you, do we have either to overrule Faretta or substantially to retreat from it?"
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,948.547,959.938,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe that this Court would even have to substantially retreat from Faretta in order to reverse the decision of the Fifth Circuit because the position that we are taking is not inconsistent with Faretta."
1983.82-1135,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1001.181,1004.966,"Permitted, permitted, do you mean the judge just didn't tell him to sit down?"
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,1008.937,1017.893,"--I would say in this particular case, counsel was not... the trial court refused to instruct counsel not to make any objections."
1983.82-1135,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1052.966,1056.085,What do you think about that reaction of the judge?
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,1061.822,1072.361,"I think that ideally the court, perhaps at an earlier point in the trial, could have advised counsel that he would not be heard--"
1983.82-1135,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1072.361,1077.165,"Of course he could have... he could have advised him any time, but should he, should he, should he have?"
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,1077.165,1103.982,"--I believe that an appropriate way for the trial court to proceed, and one that I believe would clearly be consistent with the interest of the defendant in Faretta, would be for the trial court to advise counsel that he was not to speak up on the defendant's behalf unless either he had the permission of the defendant or there were some very serious matter which threatened to undermine the validity of the proceedings or he perceived sore grave error occurring."
1983.82-1135,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1103.982,1112.338,"But you don't think that desirable way of proceeding is constitutionally required, apparently, because that didn't happen here."
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,1112.338,1113.805,That?
1983.82-1135,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.805,1118.423,"I mean, the judge didn't follow that course here."
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,1118.423,1122.375,The judge... the judge finally through... after the proceedings had begun--
1983.82-1135,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.375,1123.208,"No, but he didn't early in the trial."
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,1123.825,1124.858,--He didn't at the beginning of the trial.
1983.82-1135,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1155.846,1159.131,"Well, the judge is dealing with a two-headed monster, basically."
1983.82-1135,0,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,1192.769,1215.051,"That was... the portion of the record to which you refer was a proceeding, a motion hearing outside the presence of the jury, and counsel at that point was explaining to the Respondent who was attempting to begin his examination prior to his turn, was explaining to him that it would be his turn later for him to examine or cross examine."
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1384.126,1390.362,"Chief Justice Burger, may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1419.299,1423.103,Maybe because he thought that the man was ruining his own case.
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1423.103,1425.72,"That is highly possible, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1451.837,1460.626,"What was the demonstration of Mr. Wiggins' capacity, training and education to try to defend himself in a criminal case?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1460.626,1462.311,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1462.311,1469.215,What kind of education or experience was shown to suggest that he was qualified to try to his own case?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1469.215,1483.224,"Your Honor, at the hearing in which Mr. Wiggins, in which the trial judge determined that Mr. Wiggins was capable of conducting his own defense and waiving his right to counsel is not part of the record, so I do not know what his educational background is."
1983.82-1135,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1494.449,1505.222,"May I ask, since you have enumerated the number of times, are all 74 of the examples that you referred to in the Joint Appendix?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1505.222,1506.007,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1506.007,1511.309,Of what... what proportion did you bother to put in?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1511.309,1516.379,"Your Honor, I have not counted the number in the Joint Appendix as compared to the number in the record."
1983.82-1135,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1569.98,1572.716,You are not critical of the other standby counsel?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1572.716,1574.734,"--No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1589.261,1596.064,"Mr. Smyser, looking over the transcript, do you agree that this was a rather cumbersome way of trying a case?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1596.064,1598.433,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1598.433,1606.205,What can a trial judge do to protect himself as much as possible against this cumbersomeness?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1618.43,1620.53,"Yes, Your Honor, he can do that."
1983.82-1135,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1624.334,1632.155,"No, but supposing the defendant afterwards comes in and says, well, if only I had known, I would have made these objections."
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1638.676,1652.668,"And, Your Honor, it is Respondent's position that in that instance he should be bound, as Your Honor noted in examining the State, he should be bound by his decisions at trial just as if he had been represented by a lawyer."
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1652.668,1656.972,"Do you mean to sink or swim, or to sink?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1656.972,1658.272,Pardon?
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1659.424,1663.626,That's what I thought.
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1675.1,1676.25,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1677.719,1679.119,You are saying he is forever foreclosed.
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1679.119,1679.902,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1684.622,1686.991,"Well, as you know, some courts have not agreed with that."
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1686.991,1687.791,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1706.219,1709.171,Mr. Smyser.
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1718.458,1722.528,"I think the State was... I think the State was correct in saying five, but I'm not positive, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1722.528,1724.928,Was this issue raised in any of those?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1724.928,1727.98,"Your Honor, it was raised on direct appeal."
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1727.98,1728.599,Yes.
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1728.599,1732.466,I am not aware if it was raised in any of the other five habeas petitions.
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1733.333,1737.97,How many state collateral proceeding were instituted by Respondent?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1737.97,1739.22,"I believe two, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1739.22,1740.07,Was the issue--
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1740.07,1744.208,"No, excuse me, one direct appeal and one habeas appeal, as I recall."
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1744.208,1748.06,"--Was this issue addressed in any of those, either of those?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1748.06,1751.445,"It's my understanding this issue was addressed below, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1754.047,1758.118,It was raised and addressed in the state system on direct appeal.
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1758.118,1760.834,"--It is my understanding that it was, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1760.834,1796.743,"Mr. Smyser, suppose during the trial that the trial court itself had raised some objections as the proceedings went along in an effort to ensure the defendant's rights were protected, or suppose even the prosecutor had undertaken to intervene at some point on the defendant's behalf, would his Sixth Amendment rights be violated by action of either of those?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1796.743,1800.211,"Your Honor, this is much closer question."
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1842.522,1842.938,And you think--
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1849.592,1855.08,"No, Your Honor, I don't think the judge is obliged to tell him that."
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1855.08,1858.782,"You don't think that's a fundamental right, not to testify?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1858.782,1862.067,I think it is a fundamental right to have the opportunity to testify.
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1862.8,1864.435,What if he doesn't know it?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1864.435,1869.589,--That's what he loses when he elects to represent himself.
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1875.576,1895.205,"What if prosecution witnesses testify so that the judge sitting on the bench, presumably having had litigation experience and judicial experience, sees clearly that the prosecution witness is very vulnerable and could be destroyed on cross examination?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1914.284,1917.403,"No, Your Honor, I don't think the judge has any obligation to--"
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1917.403,1925.942,Even if he thinks that a conviction may be had that is wrongly resulting from this incompetence?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1925.942,1929.728,"--Yes, Your Honor, unless it involves fundamental error."
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1942.202,1963.551,"Suppose the judge, to make it more concrete, suppose the judge knows firsthand from having tried the... presided over the trial of the person who is the prosecution witness, that the man was convicted, when he was, he the judge was the presiding judge, and at that time had three felony convictions before?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1980.077,1997.188,"--Yes, Your Honor, and the same situation would arise if the man had ineffective counsel and the counsel did not know it, this Court would be called upon to determine whether or not that counsel, by not having found out that this prosecution witness had three previous--"
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1997.188,1998.171,That's another question.
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,1998.171,1999.556,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1999.556,2003.358,"I'm speaking, a lawyer in the case is presumed to know something about what he is doing."
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2008.746,2009.862,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2009.862,2013.9,And you say the judge has no obligation whatever to step in at that point?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2013.9,2021.22,"Yes, Your Honor, I would say so, and I feel as if I am perhaps rearguing Faretta here, but I do feel that the--"
1983.82-1135,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2021.22,2022.32,Which side are you on?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2028.659,2032.711,"--Yes, Your Honor, it does at times seem that I am arguing the dissents in Faretta."
1983.82-1135,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2032.711,2035.829,"Well, may I ask you the question I asked your colleague?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2041.567,2042.883,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2105.058,2128.256,"Mr. Smyser, when you said we would have to overruled Faretta if we conclude to overrule the Fifth Circuit in this case, one of the things that troubles me is that a number of judges have held after reviewing the record which we have not had an opportunity to do, that there was no violation of Faretta."
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2182.141,2192.781,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that the State's standard would in fact open the door to a case-by-case examination of the record."
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2192.781,2193.915,What do we have here?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2193.915,2212.493,"What we have here, if this Court announces a standard that standby counsel should aid only if and when requested to do so, we have a bright line rule which is easy of application, which everyone then knows their position in a criminal trial, and--"
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2212.493,2213.695,Faretta didn't say that.
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2216.231,2219.766,"--No, I believe, Your Honor, maybe I'm wrong."
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2239.612,2242.881,"--Well, CA 5 did say counsel should be seen and not head."
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2242.881,2243.631,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2243.631,2244.848,Not a word.
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2244.848,2247.5,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2284.208,2297.616,"Well, are there circumstances in which under your view standby counsel without consulting the defendant and without his approval, without asking the judge, may intervene?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2297.616,2298.801,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2306.805,2308.241,Then you would--
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2309.974,2310.693,Pardon?
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2310.693,2312.725,I said the line isn't very bright.
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2312.725,2320.314,"Your Honor, I would submit that in most cases fundamental error is pretty easily identifiable."
1983.82-1135,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2330.004,2336.158,"Well, apart from fundamental error, is it your position that counsel must remain mute unless the defendant asks for help?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2336.158,2337.343,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.343,2346.716,"So that if the lawyer is sitting there, thanks of a real good question to ask on cross examination, he may not even tap him on the shoulder and say I have a suggestion to make?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2346.716,2350.234,"Yes, Your Honor, I would say that he should not do that."
1983.82-1135,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.234,2351.118,He should not do that.
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2351.118,2352.02,He should not do that.
1983.82-1135,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2354.236,2363.041,"Even if it is perfectly obvious, it is not fundamental in any constitutional sense but it might be the difference between a not guilty verdict and a guilty verdict, he had still better keep his mouth shut?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2363.041,2364.243,--The point--
1983.82-1135,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2364.243,2365.027,I find that--
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2366.445,2366.979,--Sir?
1983.82-1135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.979,2374.116,"You don't need to say that the lawyer can't even consult with his client, or with his friend?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2374.116,2383.205,"No, Your Honor, what I would say is... and the important thing to realize on the facts of this case as well is that it is the accused's defense and it is his request."
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2427.382,2435.388,"Let me take your recent statement, your recent standard that you announced, back to the hypothetical I gave you earlier."
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2483.82,2486.522,"Your Honor, I don't think he had that obligation."
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2487.088,2489.474,Has he a right to do it to protect himself?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2489.474,2496.228,"--Your Honor, I don't think he has a right to do that if it interferes with the presentation of the defense."
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2507.686,2509.636,"Well, let me try one."
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2525.98,2532.551,"Your Honor, again, it would depend on the relationship between the accused and standby counsel."
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2536.436,2539.538,"The accused, he tells the accused, and the accused said so what?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2539.538,2542.609,"--I think that's the end of it, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2543.642,2545.392,"You mean, that's the end of the trial?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2545.392,2546.644,"--No, Your Honor, I'm sorry."
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2546.644,2549.596,That's the end of all decency in--
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2549.596,2550.929,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2551.548,2553.998,--You have convicted somebody on perjured testimony.
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2553.998,2566.474,"--Your Honor, it it is perjured testimony and the government is aware that it is perjured testimony, I submit the prosecution has the duty, the ethical duty, not to put perjured testimony on the stand."
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2566.474,2567.457,You're introducing another element.
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2588.404,2591.69,Would I require that the accused ask it?
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2591.69,2592.792,"Would you, yes?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2592.792,2595.458,"No, Your Honor, I would not, because the--"
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2595.458,2597.927,"You wouldn't let it, you wouldn't let the question be asked?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2597.927,2598.527,"--No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2598.527,2601.045,"You wouldn't ask it yourself either, would you?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2601.045,2602.563,"Your Honor, it would depend on the--"
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2602.563,2603.13,Would you?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2603.13,2603.997,--As the judge?
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2604.849,2616.221,"No, sir, I said you're the lawyer, and you tell the judge that this witness is a convicted perjurer and that question should be brought out."
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2618.904,2620.673,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2621.556,2623.375,And the judge couldn't either?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2623.375,2624.941,"--No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2624.941,2625.827,Couldn't ask that question.
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2625.827,2626.977,Although I submit--
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2626.977,2629.379,"The question is, were you convicted of perjury?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2629.379,2629.979,--Yes.
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2629.979,2631.314,You couldn't do that.
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2631.314,2638.551,"No, Your Honor, because this goes to the very notion of why a person elects to represent himself."
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2646.323,2648.573,He may have no interest in acquittal?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2648.573,2652.66,"--In a hypothetical case, he may have no interest in acquittal."
1983.82-1135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2654.427,2655.262,He likes jail.
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2655.262,2663.452,"--No, Your Honor, as in U.S. v. Dougherty, the Second Circuit decision, some defendants elect to make a political statement."
1983.82-1135,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2676.426,2715.135,"Mr. Smyser, that illustrates a point that I haven't heard you discuss, and that is the extent to which the public interest in having a fair trial should... is sufficiently great that maybe the participation of counsel, even when the accused doesn't want it, is appropriate to vindicate the public interest in having a fair proceeding and preventing making a mockery of the judicial system, and I think your view is a little simplistic to ignore that public interest."
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2715.135,2718.603,"No, Your Honor, I don't mean to ignore that public interest at all."
1983.82-1135,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2730.727,2738.683,"Well, Faretta doesn't have to be overruled for the State to win in this case, does it?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2738.683,2746.439,"--Your Honor, I think Faretta... Faretta does not have to be overruled in the sense that the accused can have the right to represent himself."
1983.82-1135,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2809.196,2810.879,"Well, I think that is the point."
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2818.302,2832.878,"Well, Your Honor, I would submit under even the State's analysis, even under their analysis of the opportunity to control his defense, that the facts of this case are too egregious to fit even under that standard."
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2852.875,2857.76,"Mr. Smyser, who has the burden of proof on this issue?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2857.76,2859.612,"I think the State does, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2859.612,2860.229,The State?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2860.229,2860.762,Yes.
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2861.397,2863.697,At the threshold?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2863.697,2868.485,"--Well, as a threshold determination to determine that he was violated--"
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2868.485,2871.337,The defendant makes a charge that he has been denied the right--
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2871.337,2873.103,"--Yes, yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2873.103,2875.389,--The right to counsel guaranteed by Garetta.
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2875.389,2876.205,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2876.205,2879.157,And the State has the burden of disproving that charge?
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2879.157,2879.741,"No, no, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2901.456,2905.074,"Right, but on the first issue, you agree that the defendant has the burden of proof?"
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2905.074,2905.691,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2905.691,2910.978,"And on the second issue, the Court of Appeals put the burden of proof on the state."
1983.82-1135,1,20157,craig_smyser,,2910.978,2911.628,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3090.546,3095.165,"Do you have anything further, Ms. Benitez?"
1983.82-1135,2,34158,leslie_a_benitez,,3095.165,3098.199,"Your Honor, I believe that we have presented our argument."
1983.82-1135,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3101.234,3103.168,"Thank you, Counsel."
