1967.15,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,31.374,"Number 15, Stella Hughes, petitioner, versus the State of Washington."
1967.15,0,20350,charles_b_welsh,,33.445,35.569,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.15,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,37.777,39.488,Yes.
1967.15,0,20350,charles_b_welsh,,39.488,53.984,"After many years and many miles, we approach this Honorable Court with depreciation for the permission granted."
1967.15,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,633.996,636.522,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,1548.407,1555.346,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.15,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1680.479,1687.978,Are there areas along the coast further north for the -- under the movement of the east.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,1687.978,1700.917,The -- Your Honor knows the northern part of the coast is the Olympic Peninsula and the coastal area is part of the Olympic National Park.
1967.15,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1700.917,1703.622,The state domain of whom?
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,1703.622,1710.634,"And in this area where the Olympic National Park is concerned, the accretion problem does not exist."
1967.15,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1714.704,1724.025,What I'm getting is what are the landing zone -- the high tide of moving east and the high tide line?
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,1724.025,1724.287,Oh!
1967.15,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1747.037,1762.81,"But if the tides -- the toning of the water was carrying the lands away and established a new high tide line to the east and that land was privately owned, would that just take from those?"
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,1762.81,1782.461,"No, it wouldn't as I will explain the state law, it calls for a fixing of a permanent line so that the state either loses when there is accretion moving the line westerly nor gains when there is an erosion moving a line easterly."
1967.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1814.447,1816.69,Can I ask you.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,1830.103,1830.834,If it is --
1967.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1830.834,1832.969,-- the problem of this kind.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,1832.969,1837.222,"Well, this will be one of the problems that the Court will want to -- can turn itself with."
1967.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1862.055,1872.235,"I really wanted to have it further but other than that district problem is peculiar to the State of Washington, this place is this accretion going east."
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,1872.235,1879.339,"I think probably for such extensive areas, it might be unique but I'm sure that there is the problem of accretion."
1967.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1881.514,1887.007,Whether there is not a problem of accretion eastward or westward when you get to the East Coast.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,1887.007,1899.737,"Well of course, if it would be the same principle that we have here, the land would be building out to sea, it would be building east on the Atlantic whereas it builds west on the Pacific where we are."
1967.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1909.499,1911.005,Why?
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,1912.16,1933.303,"Well, the position that's raised by the petitioner and supported by the Solicitor General is that the rule that they're asking this Court to intervene solely on the ground that Washington is a public land state solely on the ground that the property we're talking about here today was owned by the Government until 1866 but not since."
1967.15,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1937.719,1942.457,Is there any problem that would be common with the last two Oregon and California?
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,1942.457,1946.765,If -- if perhaps could be common with Alaska or Oregon.
1967.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1962.898,1979.844,"Suppose the use of the states tide lands affected the erosion one way or the other, would you still say that the accretion belonged to the state?"
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,1979.844,1981.078,"Yes, I would Your Honor."
1967.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1982.6,1985.42,"No, but it could happen in any place along that coast --"
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,1985.42,1985.996,"Yes, and --"
1967.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1985.996,1990.428,And it has happened along that coast hadn't it?
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,1990.428,1992.856,Not to the consequence of the State.
1967.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1992.856,1998.244,"Well, I have in mind two cities in California along the coast."
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2027.295,2027.659,I suspect --
1967.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2027.659,2045.536,I've -- then I have in mind the Redondo Beach situation where the city and the State put in breakwater and it tore away the land and tore away most of the buildings that were facing on the waterfront before that.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2053.302,2056.701,"Yeah, under Washington law which may not be a general law."
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2422.174,2428.38,With this including with the part of the case all of these would be irrelevant.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2428.38,2429.954,"No, no."
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2443.817,2447.405,You mean the accretion is saying is really no --
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2447.405,2457.032,"Well, the accretion matter is a major issue but it involves a 175 feet of -- above the beach."
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2457.032,2459.816,"Yes, but it's still going on with --"
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2459.816,2460.874,"Yes, it is."
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2464.729,2471.584,The vegetation line is really -- if you want it to be a permanent line that will go wherever put it into accretion.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2471.584,2475.973,"Yes, I -- the vegetation --"
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.973,2479.83,The way of saying accretion -- the rule of accretion is out of the window.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2490.038,2493.845,Your Honor is that -- Your Honor is right.
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.988,2513.212,And does your -- it doesn't really matter the fact that the actual vegetation line came?
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2513.212,2514.02,"Yes, it does."
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2514.02,2518.161,And it has -- that you want to have it a permanent --
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2518.161,2535.283,"Well, when we talk about the beach proper, when we talk about the vegetation line, we talk about a line that changes as the reach of the water changes because it's a line which the water establishes."
1967.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2535.816,2540.9,At what rate has this accretion change in growth?
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2540.9,2541.279,In --
1967.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2541.279,2542.902,What the defendant state?
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2542.902,2551.216,"In -- on this property here, the growth of the beach has been 175 feet."
1967.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2555.341,2558.612,An average amount each year.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2558.612,2563.755,I think the growth rate has been constant.
1967.15,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2564.078,2565.768,175 feet since when?
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2566.024,2569.746,Since 1889 which is the date of Washington statehood.
1967.15,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2569.746,2574.307,"Yes, and how about the -- the patent was in what, 1866?"
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2574.307,2576.493,The patent was in 1866.
1967.15,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2587.691,2588.89,It could be even more.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2588.89,2594.629,There is approximately 350 feet of accretion prior to statehood.
1967.15,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2594.629,2601.382,To the prior -- 350 feet between 18 -- about 1860 and 1889 --
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2601.382,2601.845,And the --
1967.15,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2601.845,2605.166,-- and 175 feet since.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2610.338,2611.205,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2614.133,2630.937,Are you suggesting that if we should decide that federal law controls -- we could nevertheless accept the vegetation line for purposes of demarcation?
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2630.937,2631.845,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2635.302,2641.019,"Well, at first you take the position of federal law that should not control it, is that right?"
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2641.019,2649.537,"We take the position that number one, wash on -- first of all, we should divide this between the accretion problem and the beach problem."
1967.15,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2670.432,2683.464,If you come to the (Inaudible) and you still recognize that United States has accreted the lands to its riparian land.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2683.464,2684.509,"This is right, Your Honor."
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2684.509,2687.304,"Well, how do you -- how can you make that provision?"
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2687.304,2687.521,No.
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2687.521,2695.158,"Your Constitution says that once you became a state, the accretion rights end."
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2695.158,2698.843,"Your Honor, the explanation is this."
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2715.717,2727.027,"If the United States expressly in the deed, if this deed that we have in this case had expressed those, reported the grant of accretion, you wouldn't be here?"
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2727.027,2739.407,We have a constitutional problem then which would be another problem.
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2823.287,2840.525,"Although, you concede that although the patent didn't say anything about it nevertheless the landowner had the right to all the accretions up to the date that Washington became a state and that is by virtue of that his deed which did not say anything about accretion."
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2840.525,2841.096,"No, Your Honor."
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2845.892,2850.024,"Yes, but the common law in connection with this grant."
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2858.149,2882.637,"Well, the difference is that the common law control -- the right to accretion has been held by this Court in Joy versus St. Louis, a case which must be read and must be understood on the question of accretion, Joy versus St. Louis in Volume 203 of United States reports."
1967.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2901.478,2943.339,"I suppose your position is that if this had always been -- let's just assume somehow rather that this would always been private land and that date when they had in here an issue instead of a federal patent issuing, there had been a transfer to another individual, now from that date to the date when the stated doctrine it's conflicting land policy by virtue of the common law, the new owner would have done it prior to accretions, it would have been entitled to acquisition is that right?Mr."
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2943.339,2944.271,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2944.271,2953.107,"And you're saying that the state could come in and then say that as of 18 -- what was it, ‘89?"
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2953.107,2954.294,1889.
1967.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2954.294,2963.677,"As of 1889, the accretion will no longer go to the private owner but will go to the state, isn't that right?"
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2963.677,2964.487,"That's right, Your Honor."
1967.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2964.487,2981.299,"And you're saying that once a Federal Government issued the patent and divested itself here saying of all of its interest then the land for all purposes including this purpose should be treated as private land, isn't that right?"
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,2981.299,2982.07,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2993.242,3003.657,"Yes, but the purposes of this problem anyway, you're saying that the land once the Federal Government issued its patent the land ought to be treated like any other private land."
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3003.657,3008.004,"Or put it better yet, once the Federal Government gave its patent."
1967.15,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3021.685,3023.824,"Well, I don't quite understand that."
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3031.831,3032.628,The --
1967.15,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3032.628,3045.316,I thought the rule was -- I know the state law will make the law eventually varied common law was preparing --
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3045.316,3049.921,"Under common law until it's changed, the riparian owner will get the accretion --"
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3049.921,3056.36,"Well, how do you say if the law that you were saying is as bad it could be (Inaudible) --"
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3056.36,3058.428,"So far as the federal question is concerned, Your Honor --"
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3058.428,3064.255,"What about in Great Britain, what's the rule of Great Britain (Inaudible)?"
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3064.255,3071.637,That would have been the rule but nobody would challenge the state law if we had a grant from Great Britain.
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3088.946,3095.179,"What the United States say, they think the same argument today if the grant is made today?"
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3095.179,3096.607,The --
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3096.607,3101.396,"And in this case, that should turn on the grant has been made before what it became a mistake."
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3101.396,3111.502,"And -- no, it does not accept that if it's made after statehood, of course the accretions that have formed after the date of patent would go to the patent deed."
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3111.502,3114.334,How about after.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3114.334,3117.388,"Because I'm speaking about after statehood, Your Honor."
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3121.729,3129.908,Would the United States position with regard to the accretion would be the same today -- you were saying that this grant had been weighed after the statehood?
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3129.908,3130.628,"Yes, it would."
1967.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3130.628,3140.283,Alright.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3140.283,3149.415,"Now, I want to have Mr. Miller point out at present time the beach."
1967.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3302.29,3310.345,Has any of this accretion is settled on land that is privately owned that time.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3310.345,3320.052,"In the area that we are primarily interested in, the adjacent lands are almost entirely privately own."
1967.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3320.052,3325.514,Is that the ones that the accretion was settled on?
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3325.514,3326.864,"Yeah, in front of those."
1967.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3342.942,3357.631,What happened then I guess what you say is that the Government probably gotten more land out in the open ocean than it had have before but it's gotten to the expense of private owned lands right on the coasts?
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3357.631,3362.044,"No, we do not take land at the expense of the private owners."
1967.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3362.044,3366.924,How could you say that some of that accretion had settled on land and owned by private owners.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3366.924,3367.413,No.
1967.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3369.374,3375.125,I mean the new accreted land that comes to your land by accretion.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3375.125,3383.939,"No, it always settles on tidelands and builds the tidelands up so that the tidelands are raised above the level of the ocean."
1967.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3447.279,3454.51,Do you think the provision the Government did not own that before the accretion was set alone therefore she can't own it now.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3454.51,3457.163,The state most definitely did own it before the --
1967.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3457.163,3458.115,The state did?
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3458.115,3459.3,"Yes, the state not --"
1967.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3459.3,3460.848,State or private owner.
1967.15,2,27202,harold_t_hartinger,,3460.848,3463.533,The state owned the land before the accretion settled on.
1967.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3463.533,3464.651,All of it?
