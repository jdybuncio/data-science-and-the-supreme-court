2010.09-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.93,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1036, Henderson v. Shinseki."
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,10.022,17.564,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,87.536,106.949,"Ms. Blatt, you do have a substantial hurdle to contend with in this Court's decision in Bowles v. Russell, which seemed to say if you have a time limit and it's statutory, it is mandatory and jurisdictional."
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,118.924,138.293,"Because neither this Court's decision in Bowles nor any other decision by this Court holds that this type of an appeal from a pro-claimant and non-adversarial proceeding to a court of first review clearly speaks in jurisdictional terms, notwithstanding the lack of a jurisdictional label."
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,138.293,140.824,"Gee, I thought Bowles was a nice, clear case."
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,159.923,166.455,"I can understand why maybe the Federal circuit did it, because of the one statement that the Court, I think, took out of context."
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,193.443,198.251,"Doesn't the Social Security context -- it doesn't speak of an appeal, does it?"
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,200.003,201.578,--That's right.
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,201.75,209.296,"I mean, you're right that there is -- you know, there is a parallel in what's going on, but the statute does not call it an appeal."
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,212.965,217.01,"--Right, and there is nothing inherently jurisdictional about the word ""appeal""."
2010.09-1036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,280.684,284.868,"And that is jurisdictional, 7292?"
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,284.868,285.34,Yes.
2010.09-1036,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,291.713,293.523,Counsel -- I'm sorry.
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,293.523,293.679,Go ahead.
2010.09-1036,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,293.679,306.454,"I'm not sure why Congress would have actually known the difference that we established in Bowles, because when it passed this statute, it was before Bowles, wasn't it?"
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,306.454,307.674,--Yes.
2010.09-1036,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,307.674,315.418,"So what to read of its knowledge of Bowles, whether it meant jurisdiction or not, is a bit of a fiction, isn't it?"
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,315.418,315.434,No.
2010.09-1036,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,336.112,337.142,So what's the rule?
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,364.209,372.238,"The rule of Reed Elsevier, which was a unanimous decision which says -- and it was written by the same author of Bowles -- that all the decisions are consistent."
2010.09-1036,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,388.23,390.027,--I'm not sure what that distinction is.
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,390.495,392.663,--You had a century--
2010.09-1036,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,392.663,397.163,"What we wrote on was the word ""notice of appeal"" in Bowles, within a historical context."
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,397.163,399.191,"--I don't think this Court said the word ""notice""."
2010.09-1036,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,460.994,471.476,"You would have us make a statute-by-statute determination as to what we think Congress intended whenever it uses the term ""notice of appeal""."
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,488.155,488.42,--Yeah.
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,543.864,552.532,"Although that -- although that would happen when he appeals from the -- from the veterans' appeals court, right?"
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,552.532,560.354,"Yes, but that points out the irony: He's in better off shape if he appeals to the court of appeals, because there, there's -- at least there's important exceptions."
2010.09-1036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,580.473,588.315,How much time does 7292 give to go from Veterans Court to the Federal circuit?
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,588.315,605.258,"It says you have to follow the exact time and procedure that is set forth in the process for appealing a United States District Court decision to the United States courts of appeals, so it is the procedures under 28 U.S.C. 2107."
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,605.258,612.628,"But this one to get to the Veterans Court is 120 days, which is a lot of time."
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,617.078,618.875,"Well, sure."
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,626.671,627.498,"No, for appeal."
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,630.262,631.37,"--Yes, the veteran's context."
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.695,690.377,"--Well, the latter I can understand, but I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for -- I mean, when he loses below he gets a notice that says specifically he has to file an appeal with this Court, doesn't it?"
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,691.394,692.502,"Yes, and it says--"
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,692.502,696.406,So he sends it -- he sends it to the VA instead of to this Court?
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,696.406,699.202,"--Well, it is a -- you can look it up--"
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,699.202,702.684,Would equitable tolling even cover that situation?
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,709.185,723.335,"--Not only has the Federal circuit ruled en banc that it does, but this Court's decision in Irwin and in United States v. Young specifically recognized that a classic equitable tolling situation is when there is no prejudice to the other side and the litigant files in the wrong forum."
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,759.645,760.113,Is that--
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,760.113,761.517,--It's cited in the Government's brief.
2010.09-1036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,791.036,800.422,"Ms. Blatt, you are making -- you said that the closest comparison is in the Social Security, because there's disability benefits in both cases."
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,820.744,827.458,"Well, it's purely appellate, and district courts always say when they get these things: This is an appeal of the Social Security decision."
2010.09-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,870.114,878.908,"I appreciate all those points, but counting -- cutting, perhaps, the other way is that it's not a real adversarial system before you get to that stage."
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,883.626,884.328,--That's right.
2010.09-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,884.328,889.546,Which seems to me may counterbalance a little bit the fact that the veterans are uncounseled.
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,889.546,894.915,"Well, I mean, up until 2006 they were actually barred from having lawyers."
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,932.885,936.761,--They don't navigate it entirely on the system.
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,943.772,946.926,"Yes, in the Veterans' Administration, not in Veterans' Court."
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,949.582,949.754,--That's right.
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,957.046,959.218,"That's correct, but I wouldn't say they drop them like a hot potato."
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,992.001,996.516,And you think normally he is not assisted -- he is not assisted by one of these people?
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,996.516,997.858,"Well, I know that."
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1004.231,1005.669,I'm not talking about a lawyer.
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1008.602,1018.163,"--They are still not lawyers, but the veterans' assisted organizations who filed in this case are telling you they don't participate in Veterans' Court."
2010.09-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1023.595,1028.672,"I think -- unless I am missing the point of my colleague's question, it's two different issues."
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1043.151,1049.632,"--They by and large don't do that, and the veterans' organizations that filed an amicus brief say they also make the same mistake."
2010.09-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1053.68,1057.958,They do it regularly and they -- every now and then they file it in the wrong place?
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1057.958,1059.3,--Yes.
2010.09-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1062.033,1062.767,I don't see how that works.
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1067.465,1075.339,"--Again, as far as I am aware, they don't counsel veterans after they make their final decision."
2010.09-1036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1075.339,1078.368,Earlier you said that they wouldn't even know.
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1078.368,1079.179,Right.
2010.09-1036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1079.179,1081.316,"So they don't get notice, only the veterans?"
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1081.316,1081.601,Right.
2010.09-1036,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1097.031,1099.42,What happens if the veteran doesn't get notice?
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1099.42,1102.841,"--Well, he's out of luck, according to the Government."
2010.09-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1120.443,1124.02,What clear statement rule are you talking about?
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1124.02,1129.783,"--Just the rule of Reed Elsevier and Arbaugh, that unless a statute clearly speaks in jurisdictional terms--"
2010.09-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1129.783,1131.187,"Yes, I remember that."
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1161.065,1167.425,"--Well, it doesn't sense to say in 1988 Congress was trying to map onto some preexisting structure that didn't exist."
2010.09-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1169.063,1169.655,No.
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1181.229,1183.476,I can see your point.
2010.09-1036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1197.705,1214.153,"You have -- in Bowles itself it was from the district court to a court of appeals, and then we have from the court of appeals to this Court, and those two provisions were cited in Bowles, 2107."
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1216.493,1218.54,2101(c).
2010.09-1036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1218.54,1218.852,--2101.
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1223.306,1225.837,"Well, and the predecessors called writ of error."
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1283.451,1300.43,"So whenever we have time limits in the future that do not contain any explicit provision for waiver of failure to meet those time limits, you are asking us to find that all of those are non-jurisdictional?"
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1300.43,1304.505,"Well, all statute of limitations are not jurisdictional."
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1305.897,1307.301,"Well, is it a filing requirement?"
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1308.506,1308.974,--Well--
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.974,1309.707,--It's an appeal.
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1325.998,1327.106,"--No, of course not."
2010.09-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1390.458,1395.827,"Although you are willing to -- to have that happen when there is an appeal from -- from the first appeal, right?"
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1395.827,1397.313,"And here's why, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-1036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1441.576,1445.651,"And that was -- that was the Federal Circuit's position until Bowles, right?"
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1451.618,1451.836,--Right.
2010.09-1036,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1462.24,1479.312,"If the veteran is so profoundly disabled that the veteran can't file the notice of appeal within 120 days after the notice of the decision, at what point after the 120-day period would the right to file a notice of appeal be cut off?"
2010.09-1036,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1482.201,1482.622,No.
2010.09-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1533.991,1535.442,"Thank you, Counsel."
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1539.895,1542.204,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1036,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1563.6,1564.38,So it's only--
2010.09-1036,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1564.38,1564.723,Of course--
2010.09-1036,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1564.723,1565.441,--I'm sorry.
2010.09-1036,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1565.441,1570.019,"--Of course, in Bowles it was from an Article III court to another Article III court."
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1592.117,1593.318,"Well, I--"
2010.09-1036,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1593.318,1606.487,"I guess it's related -- just to get everything out on the table, it's related to the same point that I thought was significant in Bowles: That you are dealing with a time limitation that lawyers had long recognized as being, you know, a drop-dead date."
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1606.487,1608.784,--That -- that is true.
2010.09-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1621.902,1638.818,"It didn't mention -- Bowles didn't mention anything like an appeal from an agency where the district court is -- is sitting, essentially, as an appellate court."
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1653.422,1668.228,"--You are -- your are correct that Bowles was focused on court-to-court appeals, but of course, in Stone v. INS, which involved a deadline for petitioning of review for the final decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals, the Court held that that time limit was jurisdictional."
2010.09-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1671.647,1682.722,"Except that -- that one is an adversarial proceeding, immigration proceeding, and the veteran is supposed to be claimant-friendly."
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1708.868,1737.417,"--It -- it is true that functionally, the review that takes place under section 405(g) has a lot of appeal-like features; but what -- and so in that sense, Bowen was like a hybrid case, because you have something that looks a little bit like an appeal, but it takes place in a district court and in a court of original jurisdiction; and most importantly, Congress referred to it as a civil action that is commenced by the party who is filing the complaint."
2010.09-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1737.417,1739.355,"But isn't it -- it is an appellant review, isn't it?"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1743.68,1752.021,"The -- the review is very much like -- functionally like what would happen in the court of appeals, but Congress chose to call it commencing a civil action."
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1762.674,1767.283,Are we supposed to still pay some attention to what we think Congress would have intended?
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1767.283,1769.56,Certainly.
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1769.56,1770.2,All right.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1821.073,1838.956,"Well -- I think in evaluating what Congress thought in 1988, one factor that is significant is that this is taking place -- the Veterans' Judicial Review Act -- against a backdrop of decades of no judicial review whatsoever of veterans -- of VA administrative decisions."
2010.09-1036,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1850.043,1851.778,And it made some sense.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1857.151,1865.679,"--When you look at decisions on the merits as opposed to agreed-upon remands, the veterans win in most cases."
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1865.679,1869.395,"What is the relevance of that, if the veterans win?"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1876.235,1877.452,Of course not.
2010.09-1036,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1877.452,1895.491,"My point was the exact opposite: That if you -- they almost always win, you assume that Congress wouldn't want to cut them off, because it's -- if only 1 percent of the veterans appealing win, you might understand an absolute rule, because they're not -- as -- statistically, we are not losing much."
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1905.848,1914.563,"First, I would say I think the reversal rate is not necessarily out of line with what you find in other agency review contexts, but--"
2010.09-1036,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1914.563,1916.107,What is the reversal rate?
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1916.107,1927.542,"--I think of cases that are decided on the merits, about a quarter are reversed and remanded and about 34 percent are affirmed in part and reversed in part."
2010.09-1036,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1927.542,1931.164,Any idea what the normal rule is from district court to court of appeals?
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1931.164,1941.667,"I -- I don't know the percentage there, but I think in considering that rate, it's significant that the great majority of claimants who file claims in the regional office are given relief there."
2010.09-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1955.191,1957.987,"Mr. Miller, do you really think Congress thought about this?"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1968.905,1971.389,--There is no indication that they did.
2010.09-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1971.389,1973.838,So don't we pretty much have to go on what they wrote?
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1973.838,1975.651,Yes.
2010.09-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1986.133,1991.004,I bet you a dollar to a donut that -- that nobody thought about this narrow -- narrow issue.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2008.996,2009.745,Right.
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2010.435,2011.402,"What do you mean, ""right""?"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2036.285,2048.981,"--What -- what this Court has held, in Bowles on the one hand and Irwin on the other, is that statutory notice of appeal deadlines are presumptively jurisdictional and statutes of limitation are presumptively not."
2010.09-1036,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2048.981,2049.979,But that's court to court.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2065.648,2067.973,"Stone v. INS, which was after--"
2010.09-1036,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2067.973,2069.365,"Well, after--"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2069.365,2080.876,"--But -- but in the courts of appeals, there was a long history of cases under the Hobbs Act, cases under more specialized statutes, the Communications Act, the Federal Power Act, the environmental statutes--"
2010.09-1036,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2080.876,2082.576,--But those have different language.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2087.637,2088.37,"--No, ma'am."
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2098.006,2102.363,"Bowles itself made -- made a major point, which I thought was relevant."
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2144.925,2147.733,I would say two things about that.
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2180.769,2181.737,That's the main thing.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2223.891,2230.438,"Well, I -- I guess I would take issue with the premise of what the presumption is that Bowles set up."
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2239.403,2244.227,"And what they found, one thing in the text, was that there were exceptions written in."
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2255.41,2265.702,"--I mean, what we are emphasizing is that this is an appeal deadline, and in Bowles, although it is true there were exceptions there, that was not something that the Court emphasized in its reasoning."
2010.09-1036,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2273.73,2286.068,"What happens if the -- if the notice of decision is mistakenly mailed to the wrong address, comes back undeliverable, and no further notice is sent?"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2291.784,2322.074,"--No, Your Honor, because in that case, the 120 days wouldn't start running because section 7266(a) says have you to file within 120 days after the date on which notice of the decision is mailed pursuant to section 7104(e), and section 7104(e), in turn, requires that notice be mailed to the address of record for the claimant, and also, incidentally, requires that if the claimant has an authorized representative in proceedings before the court, that the notice also be mailed to the representative."
2010.09-1036,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2322.074,2322.48,All right.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2336.958,2351.106,"I think Congress, in writing the statute, assumes that the mail can be relied upon in the ordinary course to be delivered, and so it made provision for the case in which the mail -- the mailing is not made."
2010.09-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2351.106,2363.054,"You -- you say that a copy of the notice is also sent to the representative, the American Legion or whoever, who has been representing the veteran?"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2363.054,2368.412,"Section 7104(e)(2) says that if the claimant has a representative, a copy is mailed."
2010.09-1036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2368.412,2372.413,In what percentage of the cases is there a representative?
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2372.413,2375.255,I think it's about 80 percent.
2010.09-1036,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2375.255,2375.723,No--
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2375.723,2377.689,"80 percent, Your Honor."
2010.09-1036,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2377.689,2380.907,"--I sense some confusion here, given what you and your friend have said."
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2398.992,2404.209,There -- there is a procedure for official accreditation of representatives--
2010.09-1036,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2404.209,2404.475,Right.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2404.475,2415.706,"--from organizations like the American Legion, and if that person is registered as the claimant's representative in the proceeding before the board, then they would get a copy of the notice under 7104."
2010.09-1036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2415.706,2420.144,And you say -- you say that 80 percent of the time there is a registered--
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2420.144,2421.064,"Yes, that's--"
2010.09-1036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2421.064,2422.688,--advocate or counsel?
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2422.688,2422.985,--Yes.
2010.09-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2425.703,2427.139,What happened in this case?
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2431.311,2434.135,--I'm -- I'm not sure whether there was.
2010.09-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2435.339,2448.863,"You made a point earlier that, well, the Social Security, there are many resemblances, but one is founded by complaint and the other by notice of appeal."
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2481.836,2485.475,I think that may well be what Congress had in mind.
2010.09-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2509.7,2516.665,Did Congress -- let's assume we -- we come out with a decision against the veteran.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2523.472,2526.642,"--It could if it chose to do so, yes."
2010.09-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2526.642,2538.704,And that wouldn't be contrary to any of our decisions because the Government is the defendant and is essentially waiving its sovereign immunity?
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2539.921,2541.028,If Congress--
2010.09-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2541.028,2545.2,"I mean, there will have been a final decision in this case, right?"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2545.2,2547.041,--Yes.
2010.09-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2547.041,2551.667,"So can Congress say, you know, go back and do it over again and give it to this guy?"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2551.667,2562.428,"I believe that, since what's at stake is -- I think ultimately the question would be whether the Government issues a monetary award to him."
2010.09-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2572.173,2577.2,But there is no determination on the merits whether this claimant should prevail?
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2577.2,2577.328,No.
2010.09-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2577.328,2584.558,That hasn't been aired because the Veterans' Court said it had no jurisdiction and the Federal circuit said that's right.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2587.277,2588.681,Right.
2010.09-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2588.681,2593.211,Congress couldn't just award money because there has to be an adjudication.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2593.211,2598.831,Congress would have the constitutional power to just award money.
2010.09-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2602.735,2621.257,"Justice Scalia just asked you: Could this be -- if Congress decided that this was a harsh result, could it be made retroactive, but for Congress to say, well, just what is it going to rely on to say whether it gives compensation or not?"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2627.785,2628.456,--Right.
2010.09-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2661.426,2670.797,"On the length of time, which is, you said, 120 days -- that's a long time, but isn't it on cert?"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2675.312,2675.967,Right.
2010.09-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2688.259,2694.1,"But the total number of days would exceed 120, assuming the application is made--"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2694.1,2695.863,Right.
2010.09-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2696.131,2697.785,--Application to extend this time.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2697.785,2705.221,--Although of course filing a cert petition is a much greater undertaking than filing a notice of appeal.
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2710.296,2719.12,What is supposed to happen -- and I've probably seen this on page 16 of the Federal circuit bar's amicus brief.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2750.218,2758.341,I think it's significant that Congress did address the question of mailing of notices of appeal.
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2777.69,2783.594,"All these cases, actually, that they have raised in the brief, the veteran does get his appeal."
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2783.594,2785.17,--No.
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2788.668,2790.856,So they could do it again.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2790.856,2791.215,--And certainly--
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2791.215,2792.073,That's good.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2792.073,2800.523,"--And certainly one would hope that the VA ideally would get those notices, figure out what they are, and send them to the court."
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2820.905,2824.512,"These people in footnote 3, did they get their appeal or didn't they?"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2824.512,2825.963,They did not.
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2825.963,2826.996,They did not?
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2830.385,2843.207,"And we -- we do not deny, and in fact, it's true by definition that to say that there is no equitable tolling is to say that the rule would be cases in which the result is not equitable."
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2865.247,2885.552,"So if we are in a void and the language doesn't have the exceptions -- and I think you can distinguish it from these other cases, and you have older cases that says unless Congress is clear, read it as non-jurisdictional, and nobody could say it was inequitable -- or rather to the contrary, nobody could say it was equitable to follow your position here, why isn't there a simple remedy?"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2887.065,2889.659,"Well, I think there are two answers to that."
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2901.372,2905.244,"Except that for purposes of this, it governs."
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2914.053,2927.363,--But the question of whether a particular time limit is or is not jurisdictional would seem to be a quintessential example of the sort of issue where it is more important that the law be settled then that it be settled any particular way.
2010.09-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2935.606,2955.911,"That's really the only thing that counsels your result, because in Reed you took -- the Government took the position that a statutory provision is non-jurisdictional if it does not speak in jurisdictional terms and doesn't address the power of the court."
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2967.719,2974.0,"--Our position is consistent with what we said in Reed, because Reed, of course, did not involve a time limit."
2010.09-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2997.524,3020.823,"Is there any statute on the time to appeal -- has any statute been held, quote, 2107, that extensions are possible?"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3034.757,3035.521,--Yes.
2010.09-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3072.944,3086.129,"What other acts do you think would be swept up into a rule that we adopted here, that not all limitations on appeal time are jurisdictional?"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3088.671,3097.465,"--The -- which ones would be swept up, I suppose, would depend on what the Court were to say in distinguishing this case."
2010.09-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3098.84,3109.287,"Well, I'm sure we would say these are veterans, and I'm sure there are other categories of sympathetic people who might come under the Hobbs Act."
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3109.287,3117.816,"--There -- there might well be, and I think that's why one of the virtues of the rule in Bowles is that it provides clear guidance to Congress."
2010.09-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3123.783,3124.628,But you haven't answered my question.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3124.628,3124.972,--Oh--
2010.09-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3124.972,3125.518,The Hobbs Act--
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3125.518,3136.561,"--Well, the Hobbs Act, the Federal Power Act, the Communications Act, various EPA orders are reviewed under their specific -- each statute has its own review procedure."
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3136.561,3140.153,All these agency matters are matters where there has never been judicial input.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3166.159,3176.231,"Well, I -- I suppose the Court could come up with a rule."
2010.09-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3193.817,3203.391,"Why wouldn't it be a bright, clear line if we said: Court to court, Bowles controls; agency to court, Bowles does not control?"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3204.545,3207.076,"--It would be clear, but it would be contrary to Stone."
2010.09-1036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3213.823,3214.93,"Stone was somewhat mixed, though."
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3222.632,3223.568,"That -- that's right, Your Honor."
2010.09-1036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3223.568,3229.642,That's sort of a hybrid problem in the context of Justice Ginsburg's dichotomy.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3229.642,3248.762,"But -- I mean, you are right that that was the issue in Bowles, but -- excuse me, in Stone, but the reason that that mattered in Stone was because the Court held that the timely filing of a petition for review and compliance with the statute was a prerequisite to the exercise of jurisdiction by the court of appeals."
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3248.762,3264.831,"What was the other case that you said decades of -- what is an example of a case where a person, for an incredible, equitable strong reason, such as the wind blew his paper -- I don't know, some tremendously equitable, strong reason he wants review of an agency action--"
2010.09-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.831,3265.659,"--The dog ate it, maybe."
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3265.659,3266.454,--Yes.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3287.324,3291.649,"I don't know one in the specific context of agency actions, but of course Bowles--"
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3291.649,3296.461,"Well, I'm only talking about agency actions, judicial review of agency action."
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3296.461,3299.522,--If -- if the time limit is jurisdictional as the--
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3299.522,3301.191,"Well, I know the rule, but I'm just saying--"
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3301.191,3302.112,--There is no authority--
2010.09-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3302.112,3302.252,--I know the rule.
2010.09-1036,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3309.201,3318.15,"--I -- I don't know of any from this Court, but of course in the courts of appeals Petitioner hasn't identified any in which an exception was made."
2010.09-1036,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3341.235,3342.249,"Thank you, Counsel."
2010.09-1036,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3344.202,3347.061,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-1036,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3394.666,3398.789,"Counsel, I want to clear up this represent -- represented business."
2010.09-1036,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3398.789,3399.023,--Sure.
2010.09-1036,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3399.023,3413.907,"I understood you to say in the -- your opening that represented -- most of these people are not represented, and they're -- to the extent the American Legion participates, they don't get notice of the order that triggers the 120 days."
2010.09-1036,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3419.623,3420.469,Right.
2010.09-1036,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3440.131,3440.458,Right.
2010.09-1036,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3440.458,3444.097,This can take up to 4 or 5 years to get notice.
2010.09-1036,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3444.21,3447.911,Was that person helping him registered as a representative?
2010.09-1036,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3447.911,3449.331,"--No, not that I know of."
2010.09-1036,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3451.159,3452.938,"Well, is that the exception, then?"
2010.09-1036,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3457.077,3457.343,--Right.
2010.09-1036,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3477.601,3480.007,But it won't be disastrous if they can ask to be registered.
2010.09-1036,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3480.007,3481.926,I agree.
2010.09-1036,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3501.451,3505.244,It doesn't matter how far away they are if he gets notice.
2010.09-1036,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3505.244,3519.334,"--I understand, and I'm just -- my understanding is that they -- either they don't get notice, and even if they have notice, they have -- feel no obligation, because they are not in a representative capacity at that point, that they would process his appeal or advise him."
2010.09-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3519.334,3520.816,"Well, why give them notice?"
2010.09-1036,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3523.662,3523.818,Right.
2010.09-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3524.161,3526.766,--an indication that they are expected to do something?
2010.09-1036,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3526.766,3535.781,"--And I understand the government representing that there is notice, and I am telling you that is not my understanding; that when he said authorized representative, I don't think that that meant veterans service organizations."
2010.09-1036,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3610.466,3616.151,Are you helped or hurt in making that argument when this is not de novo review?
2010.09-1036,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3620.292,3621.228,"Yes, there is no prejudice."
2010.09-1036,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3629.398,3630.505,"Thank you, counsel."
