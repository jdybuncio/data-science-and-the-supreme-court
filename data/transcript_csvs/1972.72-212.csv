1972.72-212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,20.171,We’ll hear arguments next in 72-212 Cupp against Murphy.
1972.72-212,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,22.558,25.426,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-212,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,498.316,507.498,He was detained against his will for the limited time necessary to take the scrapings which were also taken against his will.
1972.72-212,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,507.498,508.17,That is correct.
1972.72-212,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,508.17,513.808,So why wasn’t that from the constitutional point of view an arrest?
1972.72-212,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,513.808,514.033,I thought --
1972.72-212,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,514.033,522.905,"Even though it might not have been from the point of view of Oregon law, why wasn’t it from the constitutional point of view and arrest just as in Davis against Mississippi?"
1972.72-212,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,537.232,537.881,I --
1972.72-212,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,537.881,550.071,"In Mississippi we said it was an unreasonable seizure and an unreasonable search but why not these have been a seizure under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment, That was a reasonable one."
1972.72-212,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,550.071,551.591,I would have no difficulty if the Court --
1972.72-212,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,551.591,555.986,"But you keep avoiding that in your brief, you said they wasn’t arrested, he wasn’t arrested, he wasn’t arrested."
1972.72-212,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,560.74,562.588,"Perhaps it is, the definition that the Oregon --"
1972.72-212,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,562.588,564.824,Or a seizure to use the constitutional phrase.
1972.72-212,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,564.824,574.399,"Right, I suppose the only answer I can give there Mr. Justice Stuart because it does occur to me that this could be perfectly well denominated an arrest and that would be --"
1972.72-212,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,574.399,589.941,"A seizure would be in the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and the seizure upon probable cause and a search incident to that reasonable seizure within the bounds of Chimel against California, why isn’t that your case?"
1972.72-212,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,589.941,607.467,"The reason I think is because the Oregon Court of Appeals held rightly or wrongly and we have followed this all the way along and I believe that they sited one of the decisions of this Court in so said, that the arrest is the taking of the person into custody to make him answer for the charge."
1972.72-212,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,607.467,620.254,"Well that maybe well true as a matter of Oregon law just as in Louisiana, they said that as a matter of Louisiana law taking that young man Davis down to the station house was not an arrest, I am sorry the Mississippi law."
1972.72-212,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,620.254,621.617,I see.
1972.72-212,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,621.617,630.245,"But we said, we said in Davis against Mississippi that is a matter of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment, so it was a seizure."
1972.72-212,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,630.245,633.008,Well I’m simply adhering to what the Oregon Court said --
1972.72-212,1,27456,howard_r_lonergan,,857.631,858.794,Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.72-212,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,858.794,862.746,Mr. Lonergan.
1972.72-212,1,27456,howard_r_lonergan,,862.746,871.49,I think the first consideration is rather like this case held in Coolidge that’s implicit in Coolidge.
1972.72-212,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,884.942,890.417,"Sometimes the reverse of that proposition is true too, isn’t it?"
1972.72-212,1,27456,howard_r_lonergan,,890.417,892.084,I do not know of any.
1972.72-212,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,892.084,895.036,"Well, go on."
1972.72-212,1,27456,howard_r_lonergan,,895.036,901.419,You take note for example Mr. Justice Stewart has mentioned “was this not an arrest?”
1972.72-212,2,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1477.632,1480.322,"Just briefly, two points Your Honor."
1972.72-212,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1547.926,1548.652,Thank you gentlemen.
