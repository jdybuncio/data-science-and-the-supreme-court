1972.71-507,0,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,12.458,15.371,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-507,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,90.658,101.324,"Well the -- that the -- the courts below -- both of them, as I understand it, thought that so far as the core area of Denver went there was a de facto and not a de jury segregation."
1972.71-507,0,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,101.324,101.516,That -- that is --
1972.71-507,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,101.516,102.818,Am I mistaken about that?
1972.71-507,0,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,102.818,104.363,"No, that is correct."
1972.71-507,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,124.847,129.804,"Assuming no de jure segregation, is that correct, that -- that branch of the argument?"
1972.71-507,0,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,129.804,143.11,"We think that either ground, segregation or inequality, is sufficient to justify in order to desegregate the schools and argue also that both grounds together justify such a complete remedy."
1972.71-507,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,191.483,217.761,"Mr. Nabrit, before you proceed further, I overlooked announcing that Mr. Justice Thurgood Marshall is unavoidably absent this morning, attending a family funeral and he reserves the right to participate in the case on the basis of all the records and arguments that are recorded."
1972.71-507,0,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,217.761,229.188,My second argument will be that the facts found below require a conclusion that illegal segregation was considerably more widespread in the -- in the system than the courts below have.
1972.71-507,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,260.212,267.559,Does the record in this case show whether the composition of the School Board?
1972.71-507,0,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,270.749,276.295,"The School Board, during the relevant years, had one black member, Mrs. Noel."
1972.71-507,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,279.306,279.717,What was the --

1972.71-507,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,281.021,282.457,What was the size of the School Board?
1972.71-507,0,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,282.823,285.241,The School Board was composed of seven elected members.
1972.71-507,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,285.241,285.705,How many?
1972.71-507,0,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,285.705,287.741,Seven elected members.
1972.71-507,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,287.741,292.278,"Well then there was an election, which is material to this case, isn't it?"
1972.71-507,0,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,292.278,294.041,"Oh, Mrs. Noel was not --"
1972.71-507,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,294.041,295.243,"No, but there was."
1972.71-507,0,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,299.442,299.857,Yes.
1972.71-507,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,299.857,300.636,An election of the school.

1972.71-507,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,339.173,349.272,"Mr. Nabrit, kindly give me again the figure on the overall balance picture, the overall composition of the entire area as to Mexican residents."
1972.71-507,0,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,349.272,356.835,"Fourteen percent Negro, 20% Hispano and 65% Anglo."
1972.71-507,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,721.935,722.952,"Implicate more than what, Mr. Narbit?"
1972.71-507,0,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,722.952,728.3,More than just the local schools involved in the northeast part of town.
1972.71-507,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,755.089,766.858,"Could you have identified for me what is referred to as the core city on that map, right in the left part of the blue area?"
1972.71-507,0,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,766.858,777.15,The Manual High School is in the center there in a so-called 5.0 you referred to an opinion is just the size of Manual.
1972.71-507,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,777.15,782.085,And where is the Park Hill area?
1972.71-507,0,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,782.085,802.438,"The Barret Schools, Stedman School, Hallet School, the schools that the -- so frequently mentioned in the opinion of these three that it was held that the policy was to segregate to prevent Park Hill and Philips, to keep those schools majority white, while these schools turn black."
1972.71-507,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,802.438,809.254,What's the significance of the difference between blue and green shaded areas?

1972.71-507,1,25382,gordon_g_greiner,,1493.634,1497.934,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-507,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1581.73,1591.198,I understand that your argument would stand independently of any evidence of the injurious segregation.
1972.71-507,1,25382,gordon_g_greiner,,1591.198,1593.345,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-507,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1604.681,1607.837,"The jury, of course includes the action by the School Board."
1972.71-507,1,25382,gordon_g_greiner,,1607.837,1608.589,Certainly.
1972.71-507,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1610.079,1613.406,Your argument is quite apart from any evidence of that.
1972.71-507,1,25382,gordon_g_greiner,,1613.406,1614.354,That's correct.
1972.71-507,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1614.354,1622.687,Are you suggesting that by that argument that perhaps there was a non-compliance with Plessy-Ferguson independent to Brown.
1972.71-507,1,25382,gordon_g_greiner,,1622.687,1626.255,"Quite true, Mr. Chief Justice, that's right."
1972.71-507,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1713.7,1715.83,"Wait a minute, let me have that again."
1972.71-507,1,25382,gordon_g_greiner,,1716.892,1727.83,The red dots â€“ first of all the red dots are schools that have either 70% black or 70% Hispano.
1972.71-507,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1847.324,1850.278,Was this in the employment contract of the teachers?
1972.71-507,1,25382,gordon_g_greiner,,1850.278,1851.078,"Yes, as --"
1972.71-507,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1851.078,1853.269,Is that the result of collective bargaining?
1972.71-507,1,25382,gordon_g_greiner,,1853.269,1866.484,"Well, prior to 1966, the contract provided that teachers assigned to a school, new teachers, had to remain in the school for at least their three-year probationary period."
1972.71-507,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1874.716,1878.818,But I -- I -- was this the result of collective bargaining?
1972.71-507,1,25382,gordon_g_greiner,,1878.818,1881.634,"Yes, it was, it was."
1972.71-507,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1881.634,1885.107,That gave the --
1972.71-507,1,25382,gordon_g_greiner,,1885.107,1885.473,However --
1972.71-507,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1885.473,1889.45,"-- transfer options to -- to the more senior stint teachers, right?"
1972.71-507,1,25382,gordon_g_greiner,,1889.45,1904.976,That's true but it was not an absolute right that the Board retained the power to both initiate and disapprove of transfer request under the standard of whatever they felt was best for the interest of the school district.
1972.71-507,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1921.254,1929.219,Could the School Board refuse a transfer for any reason?
1972.71-507,1,25382,gordon_g_greiner,,1929.219,1933.941,"If in their judgment it was not in the best interest of the district, that was the standard."
1972.71-507,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1933.941,1940.126,"Well then -- then the union contract provision didn't mean very much, is that your argument?"
1972.71-507,1,25382,gordon_g_greiner,,1940.126,1964.884,"Well, even if it meant something, certainly, there was sufficient power reserved to the school administration to take some kinds of affirmative action to remedy the situation that existed in these minority schools, both regard with regard to trying to improve the level of experience there, as well as trying to reduce the rate of turnover there."
1972.71-507,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2148.654,2154.259,"Was -- the expectancy was based on experience from school, right?"
1972.71-507,1,25382,gordon_g_greiner,,2154.259,2169.634,"The expectancy now was according to the school district, based upon the calculation of, I believe the term was the interquartile distribution of IQ scores for the particular class at that particular school."
1972.71-507,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2169.634,2170.962,Not on the --
1972.71-507,1,25382,gordon_g_greiner,,2170.962,2173.562,"Not on the actual experience in the schools, that's correct."
1972.71-507,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2173.562,2176.506,-- experience expressed in here.
1972.71-507,1,25382,gordon_g_greiner,,2176.506,2189.701,"Now, I would like to go on to our second point concerning the law which we believe should apply to this case."

1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,2682.627,2683.077,"The -- no, sir."
1972.71-507,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2683.271,2683.529,The percentage?
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,2683.529,2694.261,"The school population went up during the same period, Justice Potter, because of the -- basically, increase in -- in babes -- post-war babies which we are all familiar."
1972.71-507,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2703.366,2704.689,Went up by 40%.
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,2704.689,2705.591,Yes sir.
1972.71-507,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2760.331,2764.612,Were -- were Hispanos identified only by their -- by their names?
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,2764.612,2772.796,"Well, Hispanic surname, that probably is -- is the best way of identification and I think that's --"
1972.71-507,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2772.796,2774.968,Is that the way they have been identified in this case?
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,2774.968,2783.129,"Insofar -- insofar as the -- as the school district figures are concerned, in this case, they were identified in this one fashion."
1972.71-507,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2814.108,2815.602,(Inaudible)
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,2815.602,2817.293,"Right, exactly."
1972.71-507,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3256.914,3257.383,Mr. Ris.
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,3257.383,3258.054,Yes sir.
1972.71-507,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3258.054,3269.515,"Before you move on, you mentioned busing, does the record show how many elementary school children in Denver are being bused from their respective neighborhoods?"
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,3269.515,3271.837,"Prior to the Court's order in this case, yes."

1972.71-507,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3396.738,3403.062,Was there any affirmative pairing of white and black schools for the purpose of busing --

1972.71-507,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3403.249,3404.732,-- from a neighborhood to another?
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,3404.732,3406.57,"No sir, there was not."
1972.71-507,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3515.292,3519.821,Is Manual an Arts High School or a vocational?
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,3519.821,3531.113,"Well, Mr. Justice Brennan, there's a reason they called Manual Training High School because it originally -- it was intended to do -- apparently to give considerable amount of vocational training."
1972.71-507,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3594.72,3597.129,"It was an area of high school always, wasn't it?"

1972.71-507,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3609.851,3612.104,"Now, look down there."
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,3614.729,3618.218,"Well, there were originally five, North, East, South, West, and Manual."
1972.71-507,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3621.956,3627.583,"Among the five, Manual is the only one which was predominantly non-Anglo?"
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,3627.583,3643.983,"Well, non-Anglo, yes sir, and at the time that Manual was in the planning state, so they could determine how big to make it and what kind of facilities to provide or to provide shops or what type of shops and so forth, they had it on a brochure."
1972.71-507,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3695.498,3700.144,It was the only in high school that was -- that had a majority of non-Anglo.

1972.71-507,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3702.028,3715.413,And it -- was there any -- was there any high school in the -- among the five that were presently among the nine that was at the other hand of the spectrum in its orientation that was a college preparatory school?
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,3715.413,3717.019,"Basically, yes sir --"
1972.71-507,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3717.019,3718.507,One or more than one?
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,3718.507,3722.672,"Well, in the mainland, will there be more than one, actually."
1972.71-507,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3751.0,3751.821,Are in the south.

1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,3779.789,3781.109,"Additionally, there was not."
1972.71-507,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3987.402,3994.807,"That busing, that transportation you just alluded to would be something less than 10 miles I would just assume?"
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,3994.807,3997.315,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-507,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4146.441,4151.43,"Well, by input, you mean expenditure and by output, you're talking about performance result?"

1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,4326.223,4328.785,"I'm sorry, I didn't follow you in the last part here."
1972.71-507,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4328.785,4331.172,"Well, the Court of Appeals didn't pass."
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,4331.172,4331.389,Right.
1972.71-507,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4331.389,4337.185,It did not decide on whether or not the rescission was by itself a constitutional violation.
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,4342.763,4350.887,"They said, â€œWell, we find that there was already a violation by raising boundary changes and that is in the construction there but they neglected."
1972.71-507,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4350.887,4353.356,-- and approved the district court's remedy in that area.
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,4353.356,4354.119,"Yes, indeed."
1972.71-507,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4354.119,4354.763,That's what I thought.

1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,4391.447,4385.582,Yes sir.
1972.71-507,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4603.051,4607.547,"Well, when you said they, do you mean the schools that are being challenged?"
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,4607.547,4608.411,Yes sir.
1972.71-507,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4687.807,4689.246,Whose witness was he?
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,4689.246,4692.132,He was the plaintiff's witness Your Honor.
1972.71-507,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4692.132,4711.85,"Is he the one who's footnoted, his testimonies footnoted in the government's opinion, his reference to the difficulties of -- well, go on."
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,4713.969,4716.608,Yes sir.

1972.71-507,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4752.488,4755.029,"Well, is there a specific finding on that?"
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,4755.029,4756.226,On that?
1972.71-507,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4767.3,4774.768,"In other words, Judge Doyle made no finding either way that the per capita expenditure was greater or less."
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,4774.768,4777.057,He found inferiority --
1972.71-507,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4777.057,4779.08,-- in this totality?
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,4779.08,4790.918,"In totality, but the only -- the only thing that he referred to specifically, insofar as allocated resources was the younger teachers, plus inexperienced teachers."
1972.71-507,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4818.001,4825.577,Do they also suggest -- am I wrong and that at least there is some of the buildings that they were older and inferior?
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,4825.577,4825.939,They were --
1972.71-507,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4825.939,4826.577,That some of these --
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,4826.577,4836.213,But he found expressly the -- Mr. Brown that it was not the substantial factor and not a really material fact.
1972.71-507,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4839.592,4840.521,"Well, don't bother."
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,4842.518,4843.522,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-507,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4843.522,4845.165,-- disparity and the quality of the --
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,4845.165,4850.661,He expressed the client that it was not a potential contributory factor into inferiority.
1972.71-507,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4850.661,4862.328,"Well, as I recall, one of the plaintiff's expert witnesses said the age of buildings have relatively little if anything to do with the performance of the students, is that correct?"
1972.71-507,2,46058,william_k_ris,,4862.328,4863.206,I think that is correct.
1972.71-507,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5099.885,5102.314,Thank you Mr. Ris.
1972.71-507,3,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,5105.157,5106.232,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.71-507,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5391.136,5395.283,May I ask you a question at that point?
1972.71-507,3,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,5436.433,5449.774,"Mr. Justice Powell, I would give my answer by saying that -- I'm dividing the two parts."
1972.71-507,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5564.669,5566.584,There's no evidence on that in this record.
1972.71-507,3,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,5568.197,5569.976,That -- that wasn't litigated here because we've placed it at the jury --
1972.71-507,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5569.976,5577.648,"And I asked you -- Yeah, I don't -- I really don't understand your answer so far to Mr. Justice Powell's question."
1972.71-507,3,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,5591.237,5594.376,But that was their -- that was their holding that they find themselves.
1972.71-507,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5594.376,5597.948,Let's assume we accept either because we have to because we're chose to.
1972.71-507,3,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,5618.7,5627.039,"Well -- if this -- faced with that decision, and I -- I would still argue that we should win the case."
1972.71-507,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5628.169,5629.017,(Voice overlap) your question however.
1972.71-507,3,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,5632.42,5655.336,"Well, I mean I would -- I'd be willing to follow it up to -- to its logical conclusion if I had to, but that the inequality argument justifies relief without regard to -- to -- and --and indeed that the School Board so can -- really does control the racial composition of a school."
1972.71-507,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5655.336,5661.086,"Just by denying that, even by its inaction in the -- in the phase of changing neighborhood patterns."
1972.71-507,3,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,5674.248,5684.787,"Well, I -- I don't -- I don't envision any real -- realistic record as involving only inaction but determining hard and that -- that certainly might be part of it."
1972.71-507,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5684.787,5685.808,We began -- we began at this point --
1972.71-507,3,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,5685.808,5686.784,Let us say they make -- they make decisions.
1972.71-507,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5686.784,5691.857,We begin on this question by assuming that they took no affirmative action to segregate.
1972.71-507,3,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,5701.973,5714.272,"I -- I think that as a --as a matter of -- of making a prima facie case of -- of violation of the Constitution, that plaintiffs can do it by showing whether it is a substantive rule or not, I don't know."
1972.71-507,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5779.537,5791.036,"Mr. Nabrit, my understanding of Justice Stewart and Justice Powell's question is supposing we reach there with the point where we find it discriminatory and it's not inferable."
1972.71-507,3,32163,james_m_nabritt_iii,,5799.545,5808.38,"I -- I would argue the proposition alternatively as a question of approving a prima facie case, I know is a substantive question of substitute law."
