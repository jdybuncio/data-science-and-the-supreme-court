2010.10-382,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.404,"We will hear argument today in case 10-382, United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,8.437,12.558,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-382,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,96.711,105.066,"Counsel, all of the statutes relating to these funds use the word ""trust""."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,172.811,173.978,Okay--
2010.10-382,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,173.978,178.346,That's the part that doesn't make -- that you're not explaining.
2010.10-382,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,178.346,180.882,"Mr. Shah, you might want to make your third point."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,187.47,188.27,"--Sure, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,294.157,310.099,"But in both -- in all of those cases, counsel, it was a limitation related to competing interests, meaning it was recognizing that there are potentially moments in which an attorney is acting both in the interest of the government and in the interest of the tribe."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,310.099,320.038,"--Justice Sotomayor, with respect, there is no competing interest that I'm aware of that were mentioned in -- in the Mitchell decisions, Mitchell 1, Mitchell 2, or even the Navajo Nation decision."
2010.10-382,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,354.259,362.215,"But that was a jurisdictional question, not a question with respect to -- to the -- to the obligation."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,379.744,381.629,"--Sure, and let me--"
2010.10-382,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,381.629,384.564,"--from the common law, and the common law has to define that."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,384.564,389.7,"--Well, Your Honor, I agree everything up to the point when you said we go to the common law."
2010.10-382,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,409.513,428.677,"And so why would, if it imposes those duties, protect you from disclosing items that might -- attorney confidences that go to that very act, the very act of investing in the way, even under your definition, that the trust requires you to?"
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,428.677,430.177,"--A couple responses, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,514.247,520.735,Do you agree that the -- do you agree that the fiduciary exception is well established as a general matter?
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,520.735,531.459,"Your Honor, the United States does not contest the existence of a fiduciary exception in certain private trust contexts where the criteria for that exception are satisfied."
2010.10-382,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,538.029,551.206,"So if this cause arose in a different context with a different trustee, the position of the United States would be that under Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence there is a fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege?"
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,551.206,551.806,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,584.843,589.914,"Mr. Shah, you don't have to take a position on that, because you don't represent a private trustee."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,602.305,607.107,"Absolutely, the Court need not decide that question in order to reach the question."
2010.10-382,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,643.363,660.324,"The thrust of what -- my understanding of the thrust of what Justice Sotomayor was asking is something like the following: It's easy to understand how there can be competing government interests when you're talking about some, the management of lands, things of that nature."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,678.37,679.103,--Sure.
2010.10-382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,811.289,817.693,"Suppose we have the Union Trust Company, a private company that has 5,000 trust accounts."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,844.01,845.177,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,845.744,846.31,"Yes, okay."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,854.283,864.257,"--I think the response is, Your Honor, is that the situation will never be identical to the hypothetical you posed because the government inherently differs, and let me set out--"
2010.10-382,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,864.257,882.052,"But this argument, frankly, would be -- we wouldn't have any need for 501, because if as an evidentiary rule the government is always different, then there is no situation in which fiduciary duties in common law would ever exist."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,882.052,895.46,"--To be clear, Justice Sotomayor, the government is not arguing that no common law exception to the attorney-client privilege can apply to the government or that Federal Rule 501, Federal Rule of Evidence 501 is otherwise inapplicable."
2010.10-382,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,907.917,917.642,Is there -- is there any greater value to a fiduciary duty than to manage the account for the benefit of the beneficiary?
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,953.915,957.267,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think that those two things are inconsistent."
2010.10-382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,978.347,980.966,I would like to get an answer to my question.
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,980.966,981.449,Sure.
2010.10-382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,981.449,991.523,"My question, to go back to it, was imagine that the government has a thousand trust accounts for a thousand tribes."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,991.523,992.04,Okay.
2010.10-382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,992.04,998.177,"And imagine that several of them consist of nothing more than $500,000 in cash."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,998.177,998.694,Okay.
2010.10-382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,998.694,1013.537,"And one day the Secretary of the Interior says to a lawyer: I fear there is kind of a difficult fiduciary problem arising into account number 302, which is owned by such and such tribe."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,1040.837,1042.289,"A couple of reasons, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1084.666,1089.437,"You're saying, one, we're not really a trustee totally?"
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,1089.437,1090.554,Yes.
2010.10-382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1090.554,1090.804,Okay.
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,1096.341,1096.791,Sure.
2010.10-382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1096.791,1102.495,"--in this very limited situation I described, what harm would befall the government?"
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,1102.495,1107.148,"Well, Your Honor, we would still win, and here's why."
2010.10-382,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1175.543,1175.96,Mr. Shah--
2010.10-382,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1175.96,1192.771,"Other than the time and expense of going through voluminous records, which is obvious, is there any other harm to the government in being required to show that there's a competing interest that makes disclosure unnecessary or improper?"
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,1192.771,1193.987,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1210.549,1214.268,--Is one -- is one of them shielding government actors?
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,1247.74,1253.409,"Well, Your Honor, I think it could be more nebulous -- but -- but there -- I think there is a real chilling concern."
2010.10-382,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1277.025,1286.131,"Well, this is just the general purpose behind the exception to 301, right, the -- the exception for providing attorney's advice."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,1299.957,1302.909,"--Not as a general matter, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.813,1312.182,Not in the trustee context.
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,1314.467,1315.917,"--Oh, absolutely, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1319.836,1335.13,"And -- and so, once you establish that this isn't the normal trust complex, we apply the normal Rule 301 law, and -- and that does not require the person who declines to turn over the information to show why it would really hurt him to turn it over, right?"
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,1335.13,1337.063,"--I think that's exactly correct, Justice Scalia."
2010.10-382,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1337.063,1341.348,How many -- how many of these mismanagement suits are there?
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,1343.883,1344.317,Yes.
2010.10-382,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1480.256,1497.467,"I hadn't thought about your argument until this -- until you made it this morning, that if there -- if -- if the tribe is correct that it owns these documents and gets -- can get them anytime, but the -- the -- the trial court here divided the documents into five categories."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,1497.467,1498.083,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1498.083,1502.454,As to some of those categories it -- it denied -- it denied production.
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,1502.454,1503.971,"Yes, Your Honor, but those--"
2010.10-382,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1503.971,1514.262,"And I take it did that in the context of recognizing the attorney-client privilege, including work product, which were the accountant's records."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,1514.262,1514.662,--Right.
2010.10-382,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1541.579,1542.129,"Thank you, Mr. Shah."
2010.10-382,0,38316,pratik_shah,,1542.129,1542.779,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1542.779,1550.602,Mr. Gordon.
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,1550.602,1554.054,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1584.406,1591.595,"It's -- you don't doubt that in this context sovereign commands would trump trustee obligations, do you?"
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,1592.712,1595.714,"I -- I -- I do not -- I do not, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1595.714,1596.047,--Okay.
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,1596.047,1617.912,"The -- the notion of -- the issue here is an issue of evidence, and it is controlled by Federal Rule 501, which specifies that Federal courts that resolve claims of privilege based on common law principles."
2010.10-382,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1635.458,1645.08,"Well, what do you make of the fact that the Uniform Trust Code reserves decision on the question whether there is a fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege?"
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,1650.882,1666.076,"Your Honor, there are very -- there are a handful of States that have not recognized the fiduciary exception, but there is no Federal circuit that has refused to recognize it."
2010.10-382,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1678.551,1679.734,Mr. Gordon--
2010.10-382,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1679.734,1703.166,"Has it ever been applied, to your knowledge, where -- where it was not the case that the trust paid for the attorney's advice out of the trust funds and where the trust did -- where -- where the trust owned the papers that consisted of the attorney's advice?"
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,1714.872,1720.342,"Justice Scalia, I -- I cannot cite a specific case--"
2010.10-382,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1720.342,1741.791,"Yes, but, see, that's the argument of the government, that the exception, the trust exception to the extent that it exists, was based principally upon the fact that these papers belonged to the trust and that the attorney's advice had been paid for by the trust, so of course the trustee is entitled to get it."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,1741.791,1745.343,"--But that's not correct, if -- if I may, Mr. Justice."
2010.10-382,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1795.176,1796.259,But you don't have a single case?
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,1796.259,1798.794,Not that I can cite right now.
2010.10-382,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1801.263,1829.83,"--I thought Riggs -- you said Riggs was a case where the trust fund paid the lawyer, and the Court distinguished cases where that wasn't so, where the trustee was paying the lawyer for the trustee's own protection, and the Court went out of its way to say we are dealing with a case where the lawyer is paid out of trust funds."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,1833.282,1834.415,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1904.728,1912.115,"Counsel, the attorney-client privilege is policy-based and I'm concerned about the policy implications of your position."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,1926.392,1927.142,Right.
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1927.142,1941.901,"--and if you know that that is going to be shared with the beneficiary, you're going to give bland, mushy, hedging advice rather than direct and candid advice to the trustee, because it's going to be shared more widely beyond the trustee."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,1950.657,1954.827,"My response to that would be twofold, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1977.923,1983.994,"So how does -- I appreciate the point, but how does a trustee get candid legal advice?"
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,1994.035,1994.502,--Right.
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1994.502,2004.824,"And it seems to me if the -- if the information is always going to be shared with the beneficiary, the trustee is always going to get hedged advice."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2004.824,2014.281,"Well, if it's never shared, Your Honor, then it leaves it at the option of the trustee to selectively waive the privilege when it's to its advantage in a breach of trust suit."
2010.10-382,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2014.281,2014.615,No.
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2030.975,2037.647,"I think the issue, Your Honor, is whether that, in fact, is what the trustee is seeking."
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2058.727,2060.46,"Well, that's always a question of liability."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2069.183,2085.295,"--Well, Your Honor, I -- I submit that the whole issue is if there is a suit for breach of trust, which is the precondition for all of this, whether in that circumstance the trustee is obliged to produce the legal advice that it has received so the beneficiary can be--"
2010.10-382,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2085.295,2087.128,"The trustee cannot hire his own lawyer, you're saying."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2100.054,2101.604,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's the position."
2010.10-382,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2109.093,2113.112,What's your best case that you have on that in the private trustee context?
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2147.332,2149.784,"Justice Kennedy, let me respond to that."
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2186.124,2194.147,"So I'm the trustee, and I say I would like legal advice as to whether I should renegotiate this lease with the government."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2194.147,2194.78,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2194.78,2202.836,"Now, I want that advice so I manage the trust correctly, and I'm concerned if I don't manage the trust correctly I'm going to be sued."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2206.621,2225.082,"I think, Your Honor, that if it focuses on how to manage it properly, then -- and it's prospective, then I think that the -- it -- it is not privileged."
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2235.688,2239.842,"So if he says this is what I did and I might be liable, it's privileged."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2242.542,2244.71,"Please tell me what to do, yes."
2010.10-382,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2244.71,2250.548,"Which means you can't get preventative advice, which is one of the most important kinds of advice an attorney can give."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2250.548,2256.452,"Well, Your Honor, I agree preventative advice is the most -- is among the most important one can give."
2010.10-382,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2261.671,2266.742,"I have a question on that particular point, and there may be an obvious answer to this which I just couldn't find."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2284.204,2300.381,"Your Honor, the Court said in the Sears decision, which is the cited in our brief -- I believe it's in footnote 16 -- that citizens' access rights under FOIA are not necessarily coextensive with--"
2010.10-382,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2300.381,2301.514,"That's certainly true, they're not."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2307.819,2312.204,"--That, Your Honor, and also the fundamental--"
2010.10-382,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2312.204,2314.656,"Well, that just -- that just says it may or may not be coextensive."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2340.089,2340.54,--Right.
2010.10-382,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2340.54,2342.674,"Now, they are available if you win."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2363.62,2364.187,I would say--
2010.10-382,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2364.187,2366.489,"If there isn't an obvious answer, I'll have to go away and worry about it."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2366.489,2382.516,"--I would say, Your Honor, that this Court's decision in Julian, where it said that different classes of persons may have different rights under FOIA -- the right we are talking about here is the right of the beneficiaries."
2010.10-382,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2388.854,2392.739,"I know you don't want that, and what I'm looking is how you prevent that."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2392.739,2402.845,"But I believe that under the precedent in Julian, that it would be that what we're talking about here is access to Indians whose money is being managed."
2010.10-382,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2402.845,2447.041,"If we assume for the sake of argument that a private trustee may, using the private trustee's own fund, hire an attorney to obtain prospective advice about liability, does that doom your argument here for the reason that the government claims it has no ability to set up a system like this, to have some attorneys in the solicitor's office provide advice regarding the management of the funds and other attorneys in the solicitor's office provide advice regarding -- regarding the possibility of prospective liability in light of all of these suits that you mentioned?"
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2447.041,2455.88,"Well, Your Honor, again I come back that the trustee is entitled where the issue is liability, rather than how to manage the money."
2010.10-382,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2480.095,2486.268,"--Again, as the Chief Justice pointed out, that seems to me an artificial distinction."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2511.216,2531.714,"--Well, Your Honor, at -- at some logical level there is a link there that can never be severed, but I submit, respectfully, that the government, when it's getting advice about managing trust funds, is not really focused on its liability."
2010.10-382,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2585.329,2592.05,"You make a distinction, I -- I take it, between attorney-client privilege and work product."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2605.409,2612.063,"In fact, Your Honor, there is some case law that says the fiduciary exception can be applied to -- to work product."
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2622.519,2642.165,"--So under your theory if there's a claim of privilege on -- on -- on the government's behalf, presumably the district court would conduct an in-camera review to determine whether it was retrospective for liability or prospective for responsibility?"
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2642.165,2644.617,"Yes, Your Honor, which is exactly what happened here."
2010.10-382,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2661.427,2665.012,"Did it do -- did it do on that basis, retrospective versus prospective?"
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2665.012,2669.066,"It didn't come up, Your Honor, because there weren't any retrospective wants."
2010.10-382,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2669.066,2676.569,"There were no prospective, is that -- did you--"
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2676.569,2677.671,"They're all prospective, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2681.223,2684.159,"Well, they -- they could be retrospective, too, right?"
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2690.563,2691.629,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2745.733,2754.439,"I suppose the government as a whole has an obligation to act in the best interests of the citizenry, right?"
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2773.217,2784.708,"Your Honor, it -- I think that that could pick up on the same distinction that the Court has already drawn in Mitchell 1 and Mitchell 2, between bare trust and a full-fledged trust."
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2840.694,2849.717,Are there any other -- are there any other areas in which the government's relationship to particular groups of citizens is that of fiduciary to beneficiary?
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2849.717,2850.217,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2850.217,2851.419,What are some of those?
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2851.419,2865.743,"Well, the -- the principal one we could find, which is cited in our brief, is with respect to government retirees who make voluntary contributions to their fund, and the government's argument here could be applied to them."
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2865.743,2868.679,And your argument could be applied to them?
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2868.679,2870.512,"Yes, Your Honor, and I'm happy for it to be."
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2871.395,2881.237,"So if I'm a government retiree, I have the ability to get the legal advice that whoever it is that runs that trust gets?"
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2881.237,2881.687,Yes.
2010.10-382,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2885.955,2888.557,Does that happen a lot?
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2904.768,2911.006,"Your Honor, no, frankly it hasn't come up that much with -- in terms of Federal retirees."
2010.10-382,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2936.573,2937.356,--I know that.
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2956.385,2957.403,"--That's the Julian case, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2957.403,2957.87,Is that in the--
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2957.87,2960.605,"I'm sorry, it's not cited in our brief."
2010.10-382,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2960.605,2961.839,--How am I going to find it?
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,2964.391,2973.496,"I will -- it -- 486 U.S. 1, 1988, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3036.403,3044.057,The government is maintaining throughout that it wears two hats.
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,3064.47,3071.457,"--I agree, Your Honor, that that's their claim."
2010.10-382,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3095.157,3100.476,"But it also has broader authority, and that's just their point, I take it, for many other areas."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,3111.718,3122.092,"--Well, Your Honor, I agree, but the issue of conflicting, competing interests, first of all it arises in the private trust context and it arises frequently."
2010.10-382,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3166.621,3169.157,We're not talking here about competing interests.
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,3178.928,3179.712,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3179.712,3191.586,"We're talking here about an interest of the trustee that conflicts with what he is supposed to do, with respect to the person who is the beneficiary of the trust."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,3193.519,3195.471,"Well, Your Honor, I submit that it's not totally--"
2010.10-382,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3195.471,3204.06,"And ordinarily if there is that kind of a conflict where the trustee has a personal conflict, he has to step down as trustee."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,3213.0,3222.105,"--Well, Your Honor, you're positing that the trustee has a personal interest that's adverse to the beneficiary."
2010.10-382,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3222.105,3227.775,That's what the government asserts: I have other duties as government besides my duties to the -- to these Indians.
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,3227.775,3228.259,That's correct.
2010.10-382,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3228.259,3231.211,And sometimes those duties conflict with my duties to the Indians.
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,3231.211,3232.727,Those are competing responsibilities.
2010.10-382,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3262.682,3280.644,"Is this true regardless of the fact that the government may have a very powerful interest in seeking neutral, independent advice from an attorney, and that were you to prevail that advice would become watered down?"
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,3280.644,3282.694,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3312.948,3318.602,The trustee I guess is -- is broadly conceived of as the government?
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,3318.602,3319.635,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3319.635,3327.375,"Well, isn't the lawyer working for the trustee then a trustee too, an employee of the trustee?"
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,3327.375,3335.112,"I think that may in a theoretical sense be true, Your Honor."
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3354.156,3356.525,"Thank you, Mr. Gordon."
2010.10-382,1,41380,steven_d_gordon,,3356.525,3357.308,Thank you.
2010.10-382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3357.308,3360.81,"Mr. Shah, you have 4 minutes remaining."
2010.10-382,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3360.81,3365.88,"Your Honor, if I can just make three -- three points on rebuttal."
2010.10-382,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3554.32,3559.974,"If I -- if I pay -- if I pay a lawyer to prepare a document for me, is that -- I do own that document or does the lawyer?"
2010.10-382,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3559.974,3572.948,"--I think as a general -- I think as a general matter, one would think that the client would -- it would belong to the client, at least in the sense that the client would have full access to that document."
2010.10-382,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3592.679,3598.249,"But aren't you confusing, just following up on the Chief Justice's, ownership with access?"
2010.10-382,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3613.508,3615.392,You're absolutely correct.
2010.10-382,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3648.063,3649.413,"Thank you, Mr. Shah, and Mr. Gordon."
