1978.77-1489,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,0.984,The case is submitted.
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,85.715,95.183,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, The respondent in this matter was entited by a New Jersey state grand jury in two counts."
1978.77-1489,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,251.833,272.162,"Is the case in its present pasture, in your view, any different from what it would be, if he had not made this engrave but had taken the stand testified and been impeached on the Harris rationale?"
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,272.162,273.871,Absolutely Your Honor.
1978.77-1489,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,273.871,274.846,No difference?
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,274.846,278.876,"Oh, yeah, no, there would be a significant difference, which I am about to get to."
1978.77-1489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,329.311,333.919,Would these question by question be in front of the jury?
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,333.919,335.324,"No Your Honor, there was a --"
1978.77-1489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,335.324,338.877,Is that in the in-camera discussion?
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,338.877,359.899,"Your Honor, there was a procedure that was established by the court and agreed to by the prosecution and the defense, during the course of the in-camera discussions, which were required the state in the event that the state wanted to use a pretrial statement against a respondent to ask for a sidebar conference before the question was asked in the presence of the Jury."
1978.77-1489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,359.899,360.98,Of each question?
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,360.98,363.888,Each question based on a prior statement.
1978.77-1489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,363.888,364.658,I did not see that.
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,365.838,367.841,"Yes Your Honor, it is in the appendix."
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,401.796,415.956,"Mr. Stier, I am trying to think through whether this argument you are making is a question of state procedure or a federal question, are you –because I gather the state Supreme Court considered for its purposes the question was adequately raised to address the merits of it."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,415.956,416.631,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,416.631,423.164,"And you are saying that it is a matter of federal law, a state may not permit this issue to be raised and preserved in this way exactly."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,423.164,424.749,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,451.452,474.64,"What if the New Jersey courts, the Appellate Division here said, it was wrong for the trial judge to refuse to make this kind of general ruling, and refuse follow the question by question approach that you say New Jersey law requires, would we then have a federal question before us?"
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,474.64,489.98,"I think it would be a more difficult federal question because of the fact that the state court’s ruling would have been based on state court procedure, but on the other hand in this case, there was no discussion of state court procedure."
1978.77-1489,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,497.69,521.143,"Now you say, just be sure I have it clear, that in the bench conference when this subject was discussed, the judge made it clear that he would not make anticipatory rulings but would require them to submit the question at a bench conference, when and if he took the stand."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,521.143,523.832,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,674.288,696.124,"What if he had never been in the immunized testimony at all and the defendant was going to take this, it was anticipated the defendant would take this stand and then the prosecutor made this motion at the close of its case or before the defendant started his case."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,699.679,701.625,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,713.128,731.179,"So I take it then that the prosecutor thought that by asking a question broader than the defendant’s direct, he could perhaps confirm some of the state’s case in chief."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,731.179,732.383,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,732.383,736.183,"You would ask him, whether or not a certain fact is true."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,736.183,737.117,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,737.117,738.865,That you had already put in the case.
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,738.865,740.29,That is correct.
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,740.29,754.333,And you anticipated that if he did not – that apparently the reason you wanted to ask that was that there must been something in his grand jury testimony that gave you that clue?
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,754.333,774.19,"No Your Honor, the position of the state is that the evidence that was obtained to put in, in the case in chief and the respondent never disputed that was all based on independent sources and it was that evidence, that the prosecution intended to use for purpose of cross-examination within the scope that the court permits."
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,774.19,787.471,"You may have obtained it from independent sources, but there might be something in the grand jury testimony that would be relevant to or confirm one or more facts in that state’s case in chief."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,787.471,789.226,"It is conceivable that, that might have occurred."
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,789.226,798.074,They would have to be or you would not want to -- you would never get around and wanting to impeach him with it.
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,798.074,815.65,"Alright, I think that his evidence that was clearly outside the scope of his prior statements, which may have been outside of the scope of direct examination, which the prosecution would want to use for purposes of cross-examination."
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,829.518,846.048,Your position must be then that the existence of this prior testimony could not possibly have or just did not exert any pressure whatsoever not to take the stand.
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,846.048,848.555,"Now, that may have been a factor, that may have been a factor."
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,848.555,853.612,Or how could it have been with what in the way you just answered me?
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,853.612,857.15,"It is possible, and the defendant hypothesized situation --"
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,857.15,866.472,"You are asking the question outside the scope of his direct, but which is relevant to your direct case and you want to confirm part of your direct case by his testimony."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,879.04,879.813,"Oh, that is true Your Honor."
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,887.106,890.184,"Not only relevant, but it supports your case in chief."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,890.184,891.447,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,891.447,904.514,"Oh, is not it your position that you had no way of knowing until he was asked specific questions on the stand whether you would want to use that grand jury testimony or perhaps some other independently acquired evidence to impeach him?"
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,904.514,907.082,"Yes, that is precisely the state’s position."
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,940.475,951.662,"But Mr. Stier, if the view of the law that the New Jersey Supreme Court expressed, that should happen to be correct, there would not be any purpose in all these preliminary questions, would there?"
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,972.085,974.887,I do not believe that is the case Your Honor.
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1026.339,1043.594,"No, but the other side of the coin is that if he had been told by the trial judge that, well, I know the Appellate Division views the grand jury testimony is not useable, he would have decided to get on the witness stand, he would have needed all that, if we can take the Appellate, what they represent to us anyway."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1043.594,1059.38,"If his representations are correct, then he might have gotten on the stand to testify, had the ruling been as broad as the Appellate Division conceived, however he still might have been faced, even under Martin Berry --"
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1059.38,1060.224,"Of course, it is really different."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1071.27,1071.858,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1071.858,1072.602,You would?
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1072.602,1082.939,"Yes because there are situations in which I would argue, we are not bound by the Hockenberry decision, we are not bound by its scope."
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1289.674,1301.361,"But nevertheless on that when he was opinioned in November 14th 1974, the immunity was certainly made express, was not that correct?"
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1301.361,1303.529,"Yes Your Honor, there is no question about that."
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1303.529,1308.124,And he was asked if he understood that I think?
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1308.124,1309.78,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1309.78,1318.018,And so there is no clarificaion on what the limits of the immunity were or what the extend of it was I guess?
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1318.018,1321.791,"No, there is not."
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1321.791,1324.193,"Well, I take it you are going to get to –"
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1324.193,1325.678,I am about to.
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1325.678,1328.058,Why you have not exceeded the limits of your promise?
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1328.058,1344.487,"I am about to. The Appellate Division of the Superior Court has relied on what is probably the leading authority in the circuits on this question that is US versus Hockenberry, 474 F.2d."
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1513.343,1515.283,"Well, did you read Michigan against Tucker?"
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1515.283,1516.008,Pardon.
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1516.008,1520.06,Have you read the opinion of this Court in Michigan against Tucker?
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1520.06,1520.883,"I am sorry, I --"
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1520.883,1525.359,"That is the one thought in that opinion if I have the, I think I have the indictment."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1540.423,1547.934,"Your Honor, I think that the term voluntariness has been used in different contexts, it is used different to mean different terms."
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1547.934,1560.866,"Right, and was not it pretty clear in the Harris case itself that the statement was not an involuntary statement, but one on the -- but the statement simply taken in violation of the Miranda, so called Miranda rules?"
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1560.866,1567.099,"I think that a statement taken in an immunity situation is no more involuntary, the statement taken in violation of Miranda."
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1567.099,1570.369,witness is guilty of contempt if he does not answer.
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1570.369,1571.169,"Pardon, I am sorry."
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1571.169,1574.079,"The witness is guilty of contempt if he does not answer, is not he?"
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1574.079,1574.69,That is correct.
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1574.69,1578.603,"Oh, that is generally being considered involuntary then."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1578.603,1600.807,And the court in Miranda described the coercive atmosphere of the police station as one in which the responses were compelled and described the statement taken under those circumstances as an involuntary statement and indeed compared the compulsion of the police station to the compulsion of a court proceeding.
1978.77-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1600.807,1611.589,"Well, just two years ago in Oregon v. Mathiason, we held that testimony given in a police station by someone who is not under arrest did not violate Miranda."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1611.589,1612.948,"That is correct, and I --"
1978.77-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1612.948,1618.402,"Well, how does that -- how can that be reconciled with the statement you just made?"
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1618.402,1651.744,"When the compelling atmosphere is created in the police station, which forces the individual in those circumstances to give up his inclination to remain silent, that is the threshold which I believe is reached in a grand jury when immunity is granted and when court compulsion, legal compulsion is exhorted to force the witness to testify."
1978.77-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1671.144,1674.197,"Oh, you are telling about rubber hoses?"
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1674.197,1676.479,"No Your Honor, that raises a different question."
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1747.04,1762.26,"Mr. Stier, I notice that the opinion of the Appellate Division refers to the privilege as a constitutional protection afforded by the Fifth Amendment and to cognate state constitutional guarantees."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1764.615,1767.576,"That is right, no, there are no state constitutional guarantees."
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1767.576,1768.743,"It is statutory entirely, is not it?"
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1768.743,1774.534,There is a rule of evidence which creates a privilege against the --
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1774.534,1780.267,"Yes, but I mean it is not -- we do not have any privilege in the state constitution."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1780.267,1781.047,"That is correct, there is no --"
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1781.047,1782.466,It is only statutory.
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1782.466,1783.005,That is correct.
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1783.005,1812.214,"But what of your respondent, I know your time is running, your respondent argues that really this Appalled Division opinion is simply a matter of construction of the state statues, the immunity statute and the privilege statute and therefore that the -- even though it draws on federal cases to inform or like interpretation of those two statues."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1819.31,1832.84,"I do not think that, that is what the Appellate Division said Your Honor, I think the Appellate Division rested its holding squarely on the Fifth Amendment, squarely on the Hockenberry case in defining the permissible limits of the --"
1978.77-1489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1832.84,1848.384,"Well, I gather your adversary's argument is sure, Appellate Division did all of that, but only to inform the content of the state statutes, and what all we have here is an interpretation of the state statutes."
1978.77-1489,0,23194,edwin_h_stier,,1848.384,1871.948,"Well, Your Honor, I think that had the Hockenberry case gone the other way, I think that the state statue would have been construed the other way by the Appellate Division that seems to be clearly what the Appellate division is saying in its opinion that it is bound by the scope of permissible use of immunized testimony as defined by the Hockenberry case, it relies strictly on the Fifth Amendment."
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2109.408,2115.532,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2194.994,2207.604,"But do you mean that the prosecutor could not impeach or undertake to impeach by use of the statements other than those in the grand jury, if he had independent contradictory statements?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2207.604,2213.876,"If he had independent, I submit Mr. Chief Justice that he could but he had no independent statements."
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2213.876,2217.016,You say they are all dependent on the grants of immunity?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2217.016,2223.676,"Yes, there was no speaking to the respondent in this case until after he obtained the immunity."
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2226.277,2231.541,Does the grant of immunity relate only to the testimony given in the grand jury?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2231.541,2232.868,I submit that it does not Mr. Justice.
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2232.868,2239.381,Is it a New Jersey Law on that it is different from all the other 49 states and the Federal?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2239.381,2255.599,"Mr. Chief Justice, I submit that under Kastigar, any evidence that flows directly from the immunized grand jury testimony is immunized to the same extend as the immunized testimony itself, and I think that under Kastigar in New Jersey at least I think in all the states, an independent --"
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2255.599,2267.034,"What if he happened to be presides among besides the other things he did, suppose he happened to be an alcoholic and went to Alcoholic Synonymous and got up and made a lot of these statements."
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2273.577,2278.484,"If it were the prosecutors who caused him to be intoxicated and took him to the Alcoholic Synonymous meeting, I think that there is no question."
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2278.484,2299.07,"Where there are actually some facts now, usually people are intoxicated today at meeting, so I am told you know, he is there not intoxicated or anywhere else, The Chamber of Commerce, wherever you want him to be and he makes these statements, you mean that all those statements are protected by the grant of immunity from the grand jury?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2299.07,2316.944,"No, I think the state could make an argument and possibly make a showing that it was independent and if they carried their burden in a Kastigar hearing that it was independently obtained, not through the grand jury testimony of the defendant, then they could use that, they can use that in the state of New Jersey in any event."
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2339.841,2344.679,Supposing they answer these questions in the – to the --
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2344.679,2351.73,"What compelled him was that, he felt that he had the same immunity that flowed from the prior grand jury testimony that he gave."
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2372.689,2374.743,You say that was compelled?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2374.743,2378.393,I submit that is compelled just as though he would still in the grand jury.
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2378.393,2384.969,"What if he refused to come there, was there any process or any contempt part that would force him to come?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2384.969,2394.954,"I think the state would have immediately called him before the grand jury and said, you have already given testimony under immunity, you now required to continue that testimony."
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2400.284,2412.319,You are so telling us that when he went to the prosecutor’s office in response to an invitation and answered questions under oath that he was compelled to do that by something?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2412.319,2414.899,I submit he was without question Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.77-1489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2500.845,2511.811,Do not you have to argue here that kind of a dry run of that sort is a federal constitutional right that attaches along with the Miranda rights?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2511.811,2519.873,I do not believe that I do Mr. Justice Rehnquist because I believe that the state found that the court had made the ruling.
1978.77-1489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2550.795,2564.625,"But what if the state court had simply said, we are not going have any in limine motions in this case, if you want to test my ruling, you get on the stand and start answering questions?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2564.625,2569.421,"I think that, that may have been a situation that violated Brooks versus Tennessee."
1978.77-1489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2586.929,2607.748,"Then you do have to say that a defendant in make it before he make his choice as to whether take the stand or not, is entitled as a matter of federal constitutional law to obtain from the judge some sort of ruling as to whether particular objections made to particular question will be sustained or not?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2607.748,2633.247,"I do not submit that I do in this particular case, because I believe that the Appellate Division ruling on a substantive state legislative enactment determine that no use could be made of the testimony in the manner attempted by the prosecutor and that therefore the -- and the court had ruled that it could be used and therefore the court had ruled erroneously and had violated the statute."
1978.77-1489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2638.469,2645.539,Why did the Appellate Division spent so much time on Harris against New York?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2645.539,2665.187,"I think that they were drawing the distinction that Your Honor is obtained in Mincey versus Arizona just this past term in June that we are talking about compulsion when we are talking about obtaining testimony under immunity and in talking about compulsion, we are not in a Harris situation."
1978.77-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2690.64,2703.846,"You have mentioned that you thought the Court of the Appellate Division rested this on questions of the construction and scope of the what, both the immunity statute and the privilege statute?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2703.846,2711.109,"The immunity statute -- Mr. Justice Brennan, it is the privilege statute."
1978.77-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2716.719,2721.912,"Oh, is not there are separate (Voice Overlap)?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2721.912,2723.198,"No, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1978.77-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2723.198,2723.753,I see.
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2723.753,2734.16,"Not in New Jersey, there is one, there is a Public Employee Immunity Statute that they relied upon and they were dressing himself that issue because this man was a Mayor and freehold director at that time."
1978.77-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2734.16,2741.687,"Oh, then your argument is that this whole case involves only a construction of 17.2A2, is that it?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2741.687,2742.323,Yes.
1978.77-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2742.323,2743.424,That is the immunity statute.
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2743.424,2746.766,"That is the immunity statute for public employees, which he fit that category at that particular time."
1978.77-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2746.766,2755.139,"How do you answer my brother Rehnquist’s question, why so much attention to federal cases in the Appellate Division?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2755.139,2764.469,I think they were drawing an analogy and construction of their statute and they were utilizing the law that they had available to them.
1978.77-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2769.387,2772.928,Hockenberry was a federal constitution?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2772.928,2775.452,It was Mr. Justice Brennan.
1978.77-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2775.452,2785.76,"Say in an ordinary criminal case, the state purports to call the defendant to the stand on their side of the case, they just want to cross-examine the defendant."
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2797.66,2800.673,Yes Mr. Justice White.
1978.77-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2808.913,2819.637,So there is no general -- there no New Jersey statute that generally grants the privilege not to testify against yourself?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2819.637,2823.997,"No, there is not a statutory act, but there is the general proceedings of the constitution."
1978.77-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2823.997,2828.021,What happen to the statute that we dealt within Tillo (ph)?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2828.021,2828.626,I am not familiar with that.
1978.77-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2828.626,2834.609,"I thought the attorney general said, that has been succeeded by another statute that independently of this immunity statute."
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2834.609,2840.452,That may have been a witness immunity statute to general witness immunity statute under 2A:173 in New Jersey.
1978.77-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2840.452,2853.864,"Well, I am talking about the – it is 25 years ago since I wrote that opinion but what we dealt with was a statutory provision, which declared a privilege against self incrimination, a general privilege."
1978.77-1489,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2853.864,2858.119,And what he did in immunity statute if there is no privilege not to testify?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2858.119,2868.995,There is a privilege not to testify but it is found from the New Jersey constitution of the general provision under 18 according to the New Jersey Supreme Court.
1978.77-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2870.998,2873.697,That is that the privilege is now constitutional in New Jersey?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2873.697,2880.722,"Yes, it is constitutional under the general provisions of the constitution, there is no specific --"
1978.77-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2880.722,2882.132,"Well, now general provision –"
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2882.132,2884.834,Can you read it to us?
1978.77-1489,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2884.834,2888.699,"I can not Mr. Cheif Justice, because it does not speak about --"
1978.77-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2888.699,2894.916,Is the constitution any different now than it was when I sat on the New Jersey Supreme Court 25 years ago?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2894.916,2897.77,"Mr. Justice Brennan, it is still a 1947 constitution."
1978.77-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2897.77,2904.253,"Well, then there was no privilege in that constitution that is why we have to deal with a statutory provision."
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2904.253,2907.577,There was no privilege specifically stated in that.
1978.77-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2919.024,2927.997,"I am not interested in the dissent, is there an opinion of the New Jersey Supreme Court that now reads a privilege into the New Jersey constitution?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2927.997,2929.363,The point was not in the majority.
1978.77-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2929.363,2931.304,But it is there?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2931.304,2938.499,There is not a majority case that I know of but the dissent was not dissented to on that basis.
1978.77-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2942.888,2956.033,"Yes, I know Mr. Justice Pashman has been better at the center I know but it does not follow that does it that his colleagues have agreed with him?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,2956.033,2964.047,I do not know that we need to reach that aspect of it because we did have a valid Public Employees Immunity Statute that was not self executing in this case.
1978.77-1489,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3023.199,3034.146,"Your original motion that if you took, that if your client took the stand that the cross-examination be limited to the subject matter of his own statements."
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3034.146,3050.068,"My first request was that the Court because I was alluded to this by the prosecutor raising it initially that they were going to use the immunized testimony to impeach, I asked that the court rule that they could not use the immunized testimony to impeach."
1978.77-1489,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3050.068,3052.017,That is not what I asked you.
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3061.127,3068.581,"I did not actually articulate that, what I was attempting to do was say that the immunity statute could not be used to impeach."
1978.77-1489,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3091.272,3111.661,"I think then your position is that if you had, if nothing like this had come up in advance and your client had taken the stand and he testified to a fact, made an assertion, your position would be that the state could not then resort to the grand jury testimony in an attempt to impeach that statement?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3111.661,3112.284,"Absolutely, and I --"
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3112.284,3121.089,"But you will also go beyond that and say that the -- not only is the grand jury testimony immunized but everything you said after that, so that everything is immunized."
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3121.089,3126.135,Everything is flows directly from that grand jury testimony is as immunized under Kastigar.
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3139.366,3147.586,"(Voice Overlap) the statements made long after, substantially after the grand jury, was it?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3147.586,3149.622,The test I do not believe is the distance between –
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3149.622,3151.33,Now was it or was not it?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3151.33,3153.291,Pardon me Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3153.291,3159.982,"Would Kastigar deal with testimony given outside the grand jury room, after the grand jury hearing?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3159.982,3169.257,"I do not believe it did, but Kastigar rule that any evidence that flow directly or indirectly from that grand jury testimony was immunized."
1978.77-1489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3169.257,3179.388,"What about the testimony that had been given before the grand jury testimony, statements made in outside a court context?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3179.388,3180.667,At the grand jury or prior?
1978.77-1489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3180.667,3181.376,Prior.
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3181.376,3187.576,"Before the grand jury meaning prior to it, I would say that, that testimony is not immunized and it could be used."
1978.77-1489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3187.576,3189.426,It could be used by the state?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3189.426,3208.452,"Yes and as a matter of fact, the state did use the testimony of a witness in Constance called Pinsky (ph) whose testimony they had obtained prior to, they had obtained it after the respondent took the stand under immunity, but they had the information that he was going to testify to beforehand."
1978.77-1489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3208.452,3212.778,How about the statement of the defendant made prior to the grand jury?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3212.778,3213.618,There was no statement of this respondent.
1978.77-1489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3213.618,3215.594,"Well, but what if there had been?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3215.594,3227.057,"If there had been, I believe that it would not be immunized because he has to seek immunity and obtain the immunity for his Fifth Amendment rights to flow."
1978.77-1489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3237.753,3256.59,"And the mere fact that he has made statements before ever going before a grand jury, then goes before a grand jury and claims immunity does not mean that the statements he made prior to going before the grand jury can not be used against him if he chooses to take the stand."
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3256.59,3260.846,"The statements that he gives before the grand jury under immunity, I would submit, can not be, because they are compelled."
1978.77-1489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3260.846,3265.973,"Yeah, but the statements made before, I mean before in time, prior in time?"
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3265.973,3277.407,"I do not recall the case but it may be US versus Knox, it says that statements made by a gambler on his income tax prior to any request for immunity could be utilized against him, I believe that, that is the case."
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3314.427,3333.32,We will resume there at 1’o Clock counsel.
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3336.219,3339.444,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3364.656,3366.406,I am not sure I follow you.
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3373.878,3376.687,"He did, under the Public Employees Immunity Statute."
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3387.2,3389.469,For contempt of whom?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3390.157,3392.417,For contempt of the Court because --
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3392.417,3395.258,Was there any court order directing him to go to the prosecutor?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3395.258,3396.62,"Yes, there was Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3410.221,3413.228,Speaking now of he is going to the grand jury or going to the prosecutor?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3413.228,3414.568,Going to the grand jury.
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3414.568,3417.498,"Well, I was talking about the prosecutor."
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3417.498,3419.144,He made no statement whatsoever.
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3419.144,3423.278,Was there an order compelling him to go to the prosecutor?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3423.278,3430.982,Only the previous order of the court that he had to give testimony and that he had immunity from the testimony that he gave that was still in effect.
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3430.982,3432.608,"And he gave the testimony at the grand jury, did not he?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3432.608,3433.115,He did.
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3433.115,3441.841,"Was there any force in that order, after he had given the testimony to the grand jury, which compelled him to go and talk to the prosecutor?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3441.841,3444.801,I submit that it was a continuing order.
1978.77-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3472.015,3482.003,"But your position, your constitutional position is made solely on the privilege against compelled self incrimination?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3482.003,3484.672,It is the constitutional --
1978.77-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3484.672,3491.414,"So far as it rests on the constitutional claim that is – it is just Fifth Amendment, the Fifth and Fourth Amendments?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3491.414,3495.711,"Well, I believe that also there is a due process are again to be made because --"
1978.77-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3495.711,3500.157,Did you ever make that to anybody?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3500.157,3502.217,I was under the impression that it was subsumed.
1978.77-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3532.605,3541.411,"But there is no due process, was there a due process argument submitted to the New Jersey court?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3541.411,3546.922,"There was not a due process argument submitted to the New Jersey Court, no Justice White."
1978.77-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3591.708,3634.224,"Suppose the New Jersey statute though had immunity statute, the Public Employees Immunity Statute had promised the defendant not to use the compelled statements or the statements that his testimony, in circumstances in which the -- against which the Fifth Amendment, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments did not protect the defendant, suppose that New Jersey had gone farther than it was constitutionally required to do and then at trial it purported to violate its agreement or its promise, would that be a federal constitutional issue then?"
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3634.224,3639.418,I think that would be strictly straight interpretation of a state statute.
1978.77-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3639.418,3642.188,Would that be a federal constitutional issue?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3642.188,3643.06,I submit it would not.
1978.77-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3676.443,3678.658,But it was no different from the statue?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3678.658,3681.073,It was no different from the statue.
1978.77-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3681.073,3683.974,It is almost in the terms of the statue.
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3683.974,3690.831,"Except for the use the word personally, but it did comply with the Public Employees Immunity Statue, that no use to be made."
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3709.399,3714.487,Could he be entited under New Jersey now for perjury?
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3714.487,3715.559,Yes he could.
1978.77-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3737.593,3760.738,"But your position as I take it on perjury is that, if he had taken the stand that the trial and testify and he was either convicted or acquitted as would be the case, his statements at the grand jury hearing, his previous statements could not be used to convict of the perjury at the trial."
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3760.738,3764.408,I submit -- the Appellate Division found that they could be used in carving out those exceptions --
1978.77-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3764.408,3773.872,Your position is that grand jury statements could not be used to convict him of perjury in his testimony at the trial.
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3773.872,3790.965,"That is not my contention; I submit that he is exposed to a charge of perjury, if he testifies and testifies untruthfully at trial the, statute prohibits the charge of perjury and allows the statement made at the grand jury to belay side by side with his testimonial trial."
1978.77-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3790.965,3801.332,I thought your position was that the only perjury that he could be convicted would be perjury at the grand jury stage.
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3801.332,3805.165,That was not my position Mr. Justice White.
1978.77-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3827.446,3851.709,"I am sorry I just do not understand why you think it is even that it is any more of violation of the statute to use his grand jury testimony at the trial to show that he is lined, if a day later in a perjury prosecution related to what he testified to a trial, you could introduce his prior grand jury testimony."
1978.77-1489,1,36869,michael_e_wilbert,,3851.709,3857.517,That is the real problem in this case because there was no contention that he had perjured himself at the grand jury.
1978.77-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3901.643,3902.414,Thank you gentlemen.
