2003.02-749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.256,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-749, the Raytheon Company v. Joel Hernandez."
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,79.467,82.272,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-749,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.941,156.166,"Mr. Phillips, it... the Ninth Circuit in its opinion on about page 8a in the appendix said, Hernandez raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was denied reemployment because of his past record of drug addiction."
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,193.728,197.443,"It's pretty clear that the rest of the opinion is not dicta, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-749,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,252.056,260.19,"I might agree with you that a no-hire policy, if that's what was used, is certainly not unlawful."
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,264.938,269.601,"Well, if there were a genuine issue of fact, you... you would... you know, you'd remand to allow the case to go forward."
2003.02-749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,291.149,305.555,"Well, aren't the two questions really severable, whether the Ninth Circuit's treatment of the no-rehire policy was correct under ADA law, and second, whether the employer was entitled to summary judgment?"
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,307.207,310.939,"Well, I... yes, they are two different questions, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-749,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,346.96,351.995,"Mr. Phillips, I'm having the same problem that Justice O'Connor and the Chief expressed."
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,422.955,429.643,"I mean, there's no question that respondent has asserted arguments that the... that... that there's a question as to whether the policy exists."
2003.02-749,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,435.465,437.694,"--Well, they held it in a footnote, and I'm--"
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,437.694,441.426,"--I don't take footnotes seriously in all court's opinions, Your Honor."
2003.02-749,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,480.541,502.543,"--We don't know from this record, for example, whether someone who had sexually harassed a fellow worker and for that reason was fired, whether such a policy would apply... has, in fact, been applied to such a person, whether someone who assaulted a co-worker would also be barred permanently from re-hire."
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,525.001,528.55,"But Justice Ginsburg, the respondent had a full opportunity for discovery in this case."
2003.02-749,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,539.491,541.181,I thought he said that he didn't even know the rule existed.
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,541.181,546.011,--Actually he's not specific in... in regard to that.
2003.02-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,575.983,582.214,"Mr. Phillips, can I ask you a question that makes the assumption that you want to make for the whole case, that the policy was just applied in this case?"
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,622.255,629.481,"--Well, you could... you could continue to assert that the... that our policy is our policy and we're entitled to assert that policy."
2003.02-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,637.571,638.148,And if--
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,638.148,638.685,--and also--
2003.02-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,638.685,639.428,--a whole bunch of people.
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,652.886,656.146,"--Well, there are sort of three answers to that in terms of the reasonable accommodation rationale."
2003.02-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,672.659,673.94,--Is it your view there's no duty to accommodate for applicants?
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,681.742,688.513,"No, I don't... I don't know that that doesn't require any... anything with respect to applicants or any accommodation with respect to applicants."
2003.02-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,716.599,717.985,"Well, the discharge isn't in question."
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,748.078,758.563,"--Well, because I think the reason is is that in order to allow this employee to come back under these circumstances, you have to... you have to discriminate in his favor because if... if this were a person who--"
2003.02-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,758.563,760.338,"That's right, and that's always the case of... of accommodation."
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,760.338,760.875,--Right.
2003.02-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,760.875,762.567,It's always a discrimination in favor of the applicant.
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,762.567,771.666,"Right, but that's why you have to look at 114(c)(4), which says specifically that you are entitled to treat former drug addicts precisely the way you would treat any other employee."
2003.02-749,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,824.118,829.031,"Mr. Phillips, I guess the Ninth Circuit did not address at all the reasonable accommodation question, did it?"
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,829.031,830.7,I don't think it did address the reasonable accommodation issue.
2003.02-749,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,830.7,831.071,No.
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,834.149,835.264,Any more than it--
2003.02-749,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,835.264,836.09,--may be a serious question.
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,836.09,838.957,"--Well, it might be and... and I don't think it would be in this case."
2003.02-749,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,863.461,870.065,"Well, Mr. Phillips, one of the things is... doesn't quite fit is in the case of this very employee."
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,905.935,912.955,"Well, because any employers who's in the middle of litigation would be irrational not to try to find some kind of a non-litigated solution to the problem."
2003.02-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,930.334,937.886,"Mr. Phillips, looking at 114(c)(4), I think that speaks to the... what the company may do to employees, not... it doesn't speak to former employees--"
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,937.886,938.34,Right.
2003.02-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.34,939.25,--or applicants for employment.
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,939.25,942.798,"But... but, of course, Mr. Hernandez was an employee in 1991."
2003.02-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,942.798,943.42,Right.
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,943.42,952.253,And we discharged him and then we imposed on him the same qualification standards that we would impose to anyone that we discharged under those exact same circumstances.
2003.02-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,953.739,954.854,I understand.
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,954.854,956.795,And he is permanently barred on... on a going-forward basis.
2003.02-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,956.795,957.205,But I don't think (c)--
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,957.205,958.774,That language clearly covers this.
2003.02-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,958.774,964.801,--I don't think (c)(4) explains why you didn't have a duty to accommodate him when he... when he sought re-employment.
2003.02-749,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,964.801,972.687,"Well, I think the answer to that is (c)(4) would... would trump the reasonable accommodation argument, if... if it had been properly raised and it were before the court."
2003.02-749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1034.192,1035.679,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2003.02-749,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1038.241,1046.636,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-749,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1087.32,1097.063,"Mr. Clement, does the Government take a position on whether there's an issue of fact hidden in this case about whether there is a neutral no-hire policy?"
2003.02-749,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1097.063,1104.289,"Justice O'Connor, in our brief we suggested that it would be possible to grant summary judgment for the employer here on this record."
2003.02-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1225.281,1228.171,You mean the best evidence supporting the plaintiff.
2003.02-749,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1228.171,1233.083,"Yes, the best evidence that the plaintiff has is that letter to the EEOC from Mr. Medina."
2003.02-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1261.812,1262.722,Then why did the company--
2003.02-749,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1276.468,1289.638,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that's not the way I read this Court's decision in Anderson against Liberty Lobby, which seems to suggest that simply the possibility that the jury will not disbelieve testimony even if there's no other evidence that draws that testimony into question--"
2003.02-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1289.638,1289.925,But there is.
2003.02-749,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1289.925,1291.207,--it's not enough.
2003.02-749,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1291.207,1303.855,"You mentioned Medina, Medina's letter, which says, look, we... we refused to hire this person because he didn't show... he didn't show that he was no longer an addict."
2003.02-749,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1303.855,1311.679,And I think that if the Medina... certainly if Medina were the decision maker or even one of the decision makers in this case--
2003.02-749,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1311.679,1316.22,But didn't the company designate him to put in the response to EEOC?
2003.02-749,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1316.22,1322.164,"--They certainly did, but the... the facts of this case are that Bockmiller was the ultimate decision maker."
2003.02-749,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1328.026,1330.049,What is the relative position in the company?
2003.02-749,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1336.532,1341.129,"--I think that's correct, Justice Ginsburg, but at the end of the day, he just wasn't the decision maker."
2003.02-749,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1417.19,1420.245,"Well, there's no disparate impact case here."
2003.02-749,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1422.353,1423.756,"No, that was not raised."
2003.02-749,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1423.756,1427.843,I don't know what about the reasonable accommodation theory.
2003.02-749,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1429.783,1430.36,They--
2003.02-749,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1430.36,1431.187,Was that a claim?
2003.02-749,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1431.187,1433.416,"--No, that was never addressed in the lower courts."
2003.02-749,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1433.416,1433.909,No.
2003.02-749,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1436.881,1444.477,"You don't have to get in, and we would suggest that you not definitively resolve the reasonable accommodation issue or the disparate impact theory."
2003.02-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1652.695,1654.553,"Thank you very much, Mr. Clement."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,1657.525,1661.036,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-749,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1748.464,1771.582,"Mr. Montoya, I'd like to go back to the opening statement you made because you... you said this was a legitimate disparate impact case, but looking on that same page in the footnote, the Ninth Circuit is agreeing with the district court that because Hernandez failed to timely raise disparate impact, this has got to be a disparate treatment case."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,1771.582,1772.985,"--Your Honor, I misspoke."
2003.02-749,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1794.699,1795.913,You don't mean terminate.
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,1797.012,1798.498,"Refuse to hire, yes."
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1800.932,1807.043,"I mean, that makes good sense, but how do you reconcile that with footnote... footnote 17?"
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,1820.312,1823.927,"--Your Honor, that is a... I... I can't resolve that."
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1823.927,1826.323,You want us to give text more weight than footnotes.
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,1826.323,1826.945,"I do, Your Honor--"
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.945,1827.688,That's not unreasonable.
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,1827.688,1830.947,--because that footnote is directly contrary to the record.
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1832.722,1835.322,Maybe the law clerks wrote the footnotes and the judges wrote the text.
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,1836.232,1837.263,"--I won't speculate on that, Your Honor."
2003.02-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1874.87,1887.38,"But the Ninth... the Ninth Circuit again, Mr. Montoya, in footnote 17 simply says there's no question that Hughes applied this policy in rejecting Hernandez's application."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,1887.38,1890.724,I know it says that Justice... Chief Justice Rehnquist.
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1937.513,1941.638,"We... we didn't take the case to... to determine whether... you know, to determine that."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,1962.337,1963.558,"Yes, that's--"
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.558,1973.589,"That's the reason we took the case, and you're telling us we can't get to it because... because in fact the Ninth Circuit was just wrong that there was the policy at all."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,1973.589,1978.956,"--That is correct, Your Honor, and I believe that that is a question of disputed material fact."
2003.02-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1978.956,1982.217,Did... did you raise this in your... in your brief in opposition to certiorari?
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,1982.217,1983.248,"Yes, we did, Your Honor."
2003.02-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1983.248,1984.529,That particular question?
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,1984.529,1985.356,"Yes, we did."
2003.02-749,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2005.911,2020.772,"Well, but the Ninth Circuit, I take it, was entitled to proceed on the assumption that the factual determination might turn out as... as Hughes says it is, and it then went on and gave instructions as to how the case ought to be resolved."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2023.994,2026.594,"Yes, you can."
2003.02-749,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2055.117,2068.409,Did the court of appeals exceed its authority under Article III in making the statements it... it did with respect to the lawfulness of the termination policy?
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2068.409,2077.324,"--Your Honor, I think that it... it certainly reached the borders of Article III."
2003.02-749,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2080.851,2086.036,So you think that in some later case the Ninth Circuit would... would say that this is not binding on other panels?
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2086.036,2087.728,"--Well, it would depend upon the facts."
2003.02-749,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2096.643,2104.985,"Well, if... if facts might be proven from the record, courts of appeals routinely give directions to the trial courts as to how the law is to be applied, don't they?"
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2104.985,2106.554,"That's true, Your Honor."
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2138.05,2149.112,"Well, that's all right, but we would still have achieved what we set out to achieve, and that is to determine whether the statement of law that the Ninth Circuit opinion sets forth is correct or not--"
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2149.112,2150.022,--That... that--
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2150.022,2157.862,"--that if there... if there is a firing solely by reason of policy, it is nonetheless invalid as applied to a rehabilitated drug addict."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2166.945,2170.744,"--Well, in... in that... in that event, Justice Scalia, the answer--"
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.744,2172.146,"I mean, you care a lot."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2174.83,2175.573,--I understand.
2003.02-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2223.87,2228.411,Undue hardship being under the accommodation requirement?
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2228.411,2229.171,Yes.
2003.02-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2229.171,2232.211,"But now, the... the court of appeals never got to that."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2232.211,2237.162,"Well, they... they didn't get to it using that terminology."
2003.02-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2246.616,2252.766,"Well, but surely, if they had meant the... the part of the... the part of the act that requires accommodation, they would have said so."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2252.766,2253.22,Well--
2003.02-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2253.22,2257.761,"I mean, you're really kind of rewriting the court of appeals' opinion, it seems to me."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2257.761,2286.961,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't know whether you'd call it a reasonable accommodation or a relaxation of the qualification requirement because the... the ADA, under 12112(b)(6), does apply to qualification standards, employment tests, or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals."
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2300.858,2303.392,What disability would you be accommodating?
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2303.392,2312.375,You would be accommodating the disability of disabling addiction to drugs and alcohol.
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2312.375,2313.49,He doesn't have that disability.
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2313.49,2314.605,"Well, but the ADA--"
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2314.605,2316.091,He used to have it but he doesn't have it--
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2316.091,2327.115,"--But the ADA... under the definition of disability set forth by the ADA, Justice Scalia, someone with a record of a disability is in fact disabled under the statute."
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2327.115,2332.892,"--He is in fact disabled, but... but what... what disability of his are you accommodating?"
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2332.892,2353.964,"His former... you're relaxing a qualification standard that would... that would hinder the entrance of a reformed alcoholic who was disabled under the statute into the job market, which is the purpose of the ADA, not to segregate disabled individuals who can work from the job market."
2003.02-749,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2353.964,2359.787,"But when he comes back years later, he's not disabled."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2362.592,2365.276,"Well, it... it... Justice O'Connor--"
2003.02-749,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2365.276,2365.664,It doesn't fit.
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2365.664,2366.762,--it doesn't fit in--
2003.02-749,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2366.762,2367.217,No.
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2367.217,2369.734,--to the traditional reasonable accommodation analysis.
2003.02-749,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2369.734,2370.311,No.
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2370.311,2380.896,"However, it does fit into the statute, to the language of the statute, 12(b)(6), those qualification standards that screen out."
2003.02-749,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.716,2423.689,"And that's what the Solicitor General says is not really presented in this case, though."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2423.689,2432.317,"Well, it's hard to say that it's not presented in this case, Justice Stevens, because the Ninth Circuit addressed that very issue."
2003.02-749,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2432.317,2434.463,"Well, they didn't address section 112, though."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2434.463,2438.14,"Well, it didn't cite 112, but it... it--"
2003.02-749,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2438.14,2440.779,"They didn't cite it, and they said it's not a disparate impact case, too."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2440.779,2448.952,"--And I... I think what the Ninth Circuit meant by that, Justice Stevens, is that we're not talking about a class of individuals treated disparately."
2003.02-749,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2455.351,2464.063,"He's only discriminatorily treated because he's a member of a... of a specially defined class, namely, reformed alcoholics and... and drug-addicted persons."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2474.216,2485.361,"--Well, Your Honor, even though there's that language regarding disparate impact, it nevertheless ruled the way it did and said that this... and... and in fact, the... the Ninth Circuit--"
2003.02-749,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2485.361,2496.673,"But the ruling that it adopted, as I understand the statute, really deprived the employer of an opportunity to... to set forth any of the affirmative defenses that would be available, business necessity, and so forth."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2496.673,2508.274,"--Well, Your Honor, the employer had the ability to assert those affirmative defenses in its complaint in the district court, which is part of the record in this case, and it did not."
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.763,2522.679,"They don't need to assert those defenses if someone was claiming a failure to accommodate, and if that was not what was before the house, they'd have no incentive to do that."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2522.679,2532.71,"--Well, clearly, Justice Scalia, Mr. Hernandez was challenging this rule that screened him out, and if in fact--"
2003.02-749,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2532.71,2534.652,But why do we even get to that?
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2581.213,2599.046,"--Well... well, Your Honor, I think that if you construe the facts and the inferences in Mr. Hernandez's favor, as you must, Mr. John Lyman's letter, who is the AA sponsor, says that he is in recovery from addiction."
2003.02-749,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2610.17,2615.271,Even though this is... this is solely from someone who knows him from the alcohol program.
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2622.452,2624.392,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2648.048,2656.526,The inference you want us to construe in his favor is that alcohol means things other than alcohol.
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2657.829,2658.755,Well... well--
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2658.755,2663.379,"--Is that a favorable inference, or is it a wild leap into the... into the dark?"
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2663.379,2669.324,"--I... I don't think it's a wild leap into the dark, and I think it's supported by the text of Mr. John Lyman's letter."
2003.02-749,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2669.324,2671.387,Where is that letter so we can look--
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2671.387,2688.477,"It is appendix 14a, Justice Ginsburg, and it says, Joel attends AA regularly, participates in discussion when appropriate, and is maintaining his sobriety, and is in all a good and active member."
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2691.327,2692.358,--Sobriety.
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2692.358,2693.184,That is a general statement.
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2694.299,2694.587,Really?
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2699.788,2701.896,"--Yes, clean and sober."
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2701.896,2702.927,"Gee, I don't think so."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2706.187,2709.614,I... I think it can refer to any--
2003.02-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2709.614,2711.471,You say a drug addict is stoned.
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2713.413,2720.35,"--Well, I... I think... I think that if someone is not on drugs, someone can be described as clean and sober."
2003.02-749,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2721.315,2729.1,"But in the next paragraph, it says, Alcohol Anonymous has been demonstrated the best recovery tool for alcoholics."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2729.1,2732.898,"--That is true, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-749,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2732.898,2740.534,"And it says he's... he's committed to this program, demonstrates his willingness to accept responsibility for his recovery."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2740.534,2747.676,But this letter... this letter is unequivocal that he was in recovery.
2003.02-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2805.223,2811.046,"Whether or not summary judgment should be granted is a question of law, not... not a question of fact."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2815.792,2816.906,--That is... that is correct.
2003.02-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2821.281,2824.42,The weight of the evidence has nothing to do with summary judgment.
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2824.42,2833.048,"--Well... well, if... if there's a factual dispute, Justice Rehnquist, then the summary judgment is no longer... then summary judgment is no longer appropriate."
2003.02-749,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2846.173,2853.892,I thought you were going to say that the... what the plaintiff claimed is a witness.
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2877.669,2879.117,That... that is true.
2003.02-749,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2931.008,2936.785,"--Well, all that adds up to the fact that he was not disabled when he reapplied."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2937.817,2938.271,--That is correct.
2003.02-749,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2938.271,2941.532,And... and nobody is arguing that he was.
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2945.33,2945.785,Well--
2003.02-749,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2945.785,2946.733,--as a disabled person.
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2961.223,2963.823,"--Yes, that is true, Justice Stevens."
2003.02-749,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2984.711,2988.138,"Of course, if he's still addicted, then he's not protected by the act."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,2988.138,2992.225,"--Well, they... it's a false belief that they believe he's addicted."
2003.02-749,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3014.533,3029.748,"Mr. Montoya, in your... you say now that you question the existence of such a rule, and yet you've had an opportunity for discovery in the district court and you didn't try to pursue any kind of disparate impact."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,3044.443,3059.182,"Your Honor, the rule was tested in the context of the deposition examination of the only two witnesses that Raytheon produced who testified about the rule: Bockmiller and Medina."
2003.02-749,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3137.694,3143.721,"I still don't understand why you didn't follow up those two depositions with interrogatories, saying what is the origin of this practice."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,3156.436,3158.954,"--That's true, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3202.133,3206.304,"Mr. Montoya, I... I hope... you don't have much time left."
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,3242.546,3243.744,Your--
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3243.744,3248.862,Is it anything other than the... the need for accommodating a disability?
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,3252.827,3255.444,"--No, that's not the only reason."
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3277.552,3284.528,But that's... that's all... those are all categories under the need to accommodate.
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,3285.604,3287.09,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-749,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3287.09,3298.153,"Apart... apart... assuming that... assuming that I don't think that issue was raised in the case, is there any other reason why it would have been unlawful, assuming that they were simply implementing a policy?"
2003.02-749,2,41765,stephen__g_montoya,,3298.153,3299.843,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3348.884,3350.37,"Thank you, Mr. Montoya."
2003.02-749,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3352.682,3354.251,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
