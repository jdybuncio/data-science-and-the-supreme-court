1990.89-1965,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,23.518,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-1965, Cottage Savings Association v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue."
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,24.836,38.605,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,250.115,253.047,"Of course, the Home Loan Bank Board doesn't give tax advice, does it?"
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,259.221,261.132,That's correct.
1990.89-1965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,261.783,262.484,"Yes, right."
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,262.484,263.783,--get a guarantee from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
1990.89-1965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,263.783,269.947,"And you could have... you could have gone to the Internal Revenue Service or to the Treasury and asked for advice on the matter, I suppose, couldn't you?"
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,271.249,274.111,"That was not done in the Cottage situation, no."
1990.89-1965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,276.452,280.245,You can't really say the Government misled you here.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,297.857,299.347,--That's correct.
1990.89-1965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,304.85,305.46,"Sure, it was."
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,316.838,318.109,"--That's correct, but--"
1990.89-1965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.109,319.148,And they made good on that promise.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,328.375,329.156,--That's correct.
1990.89-1965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,329.156,330.538,So they gave you everything they promised.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,330.538,343.656,"But they also had a stated objective, and the stated objective of R-49, as the Government recognizes, was to prepare the transaction that would produce the loss."
1990.89-1965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,350.92,354.602,They have no authority to pronounce on tax consequences.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,360.595,369.642,"We were rolling the dice, so to speak, but we did have a pronouncement from an agency that had a lot of authority."
1990.89-1965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,369.642,370.874,That you were free to roll the dice.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,371.943,375.145,I'll accept that statement.
1990.89-1965,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,375.145,376.948,Let me follow through on that.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,394.259,396.289,That was the effect of R-49.
1990.89-1965,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,415.994,422.376,What accounting effect was intended by R-49?
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,422.376,434.684,--The accounting effect is that R-49 was giving the taxpayer an option that if R-49 was followed they could book the loss or not book the loss.
1990.89-1965,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,440.408,441.329,What do you mean put the loss?
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,441.329,443.129,--Book the loss.
1990.89-1965,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,443.58,443.129,Book the loss.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,445.911,446.622,That's correct.
1990.89-1965,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,446.622,447.664,--under 49.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,447.664,449.154,And therefore it wouldn't have any effect--
1990.89-1965,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,449.154,456.219,"But they could claim a tax... even though you didn't book the loss, you would claim a tax loss?"
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,456.219,458.19,"--That's correct, from a tax standpoint."
1990.89-1965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,458.19,462.584,So the accounting effect was really nil if you elected not to book the loss?
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,462.584,463.523,That's correct.
1990.89-1965,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,463.523,464.505,"Well, Mr.--"
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,464.505,466.415,From accounting regulatory standpoint.
1990.89-1965,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,466.415,474.721,"--Mr. Manes, don't we really have to look at the Code provisions to see if there's a tax loss or not?"
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,476.471,477.182,"Yes, I do."
1990.89-1965,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,493.222,493.893,Well--
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,506.923,509.884,--We do not argue that issue.
1990.89-1965,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,513.107,515.628,So we take the case assuming it's an exchange?
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,515.628,516.229,--That's correct.
1990.89-1965,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,516.229,516.886,Okay.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,516.886,517.388,That's correct.
1990.89-1965,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,518.109,518.609,All right.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,526.134,526.635,Yes.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,615.363,617.974,"That's (a), correct?"
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,617.974,618.515,That's correct.
1990.89-1965,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,700.618,710.917,"Well, but we normally defer to IRS regulations that interpret the statute, and they say there has to be a material difference."
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,731.59,741.595,--The reference to the regulation and the effect on the statute is normally when the statute is not clear.
1990.89-1965,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,756.354,760.047,You say the regulation then is unauthorized by the statutes?
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,760.047,762.568,"No, I'm not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1965,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,779.991,787.716,"If one were to imply the converse from the regulation, would you say the converse implication was not authorized by the statute?"
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,787.716,792.317,--It's not authorized by the statute--
1990.89-1965,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,792.317,794.661,If you don't say that it seems to me you lose your case.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,794.661,800.755,"--It's not authorized by the statute, and it doesn't follow the Supreme Court cases that that regulation was really founded upon."
1990.89-1965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,811.081,817.967,"Well, but then you're saying the regulation could be valid, but that the IRS is interpreting it incorrectly."
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,817.967,819.266,I am not--
1990.89-1965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,819.266,825.209,That the regulation should be read to refer to these Supreme Court cases that established a constitutional distinction.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,825.209,832.084,"--I agree that the regulation... I'm not challenging the validity, per se, of the regulation."
1990.89-1965,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,858.462,876.043,"But there's language in some of this Court's opinions that there has to be... to the effect that there has to be a material difference, and perhaps the IRS was trying to codify that language, in effect, with its regulation."
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,876.043,886.221,"That regulation was based upon the case law at the time, which talked about having something materially different."
1990.89-1965,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,894.366,895.755,I don't know what you mean by that.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,910.164,916.278,"I think that it would be tested first under realization, or realization would be--"
1990.89-1965,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,916.278,916.769,Yes or no?
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,927.427,929.108,--I would answer that as yes.
1990.89-1965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,951.541,953.784,Is that consistent with Eisner v. Macomber?
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,953.784,955.764,Yes.
1990.89-1965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,968.565,969.664,"Well, I thought that there was an event."
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,975.488,987.555,"--Well, it's questionable whether that itself was an event, whether a stock dividend would be a triggering event."
1990.89-1965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,987.555,989.508,"Well, it would be if the stock dividend were disproportional."
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,989.508,992.31,That would be correct.
1990.89-1965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,993.118,1001.376,"And the only reason that it, it was held to be nontaxable was the economic position of the taxpayer hadn't changed."
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1001.376,1006.088,--And that really is a question of recognition.
1990.89-1965,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1022.488,1034.244,Suppose we disagree with you and think that the deference we owe to the regulation means that we will apply it?
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1036.669,1042.092,--We feel we fall within the definition or the regulation as to what is materially different.
1990.89-1965,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1093.745,1099.238,I take it the court of appeals agreed with you on 1001?
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1099.238,1103.432,That would be a fair interpretation of the Sixth Circuit.
1990.89-1965,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1103.432,1105.793,And they turned you down on 165?
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1105.793,1110.317,"Yeah, which the Government is now saying is a portion of the material different argument."
1990.89-1965,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1115.869,1122.124,So for you to win you have to say the court of appeals was wrong on 165?
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1122.124,1134.163,"Or we could say that the Government, and their position is that it's a material difference test, and it's still satisfied in material difference."
1990.89-1965,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1134.163,1137.543,"Well, I would suppose we wouldn't decide that."
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1155.955,1161.098,We feel that on trades of mortgages you would get the same answer.
1990.89-1965,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1161.098,1174.088,"So you would... if... if the... if we would say the regulation is valid, you would then go to the court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit rationale?"
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1174.088,1175.3,That's correct.
1990.89-1965,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1176.248,1177.771,Is it because all mortgages are unique?
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1177.771,1182.834,"We feel that mortgages are unique, especially with the different obligor and different--"
1990.89-1965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1182.834,1187.996,But that simply is inconsistent with the whole design of these transactions.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1213.104,1217.337,"--From a pure subjective point of view, I think you're correct."
1990.89-1965,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.409,1221.189,From a computer point of view.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1221.189,1221.609,--Right.
1990.89-1965,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1236.608,1253.91,"Did the computer matching and analysis seek to make an analysis of relative risk, so that the computer was attempting in effect to substitute one pool with a given level of risk with another at exactly the same level of risk?"
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1253.91,1256.111,Only within the context of R-49.
1990.89-1965,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1256.111,1260.625,I'm not sure that I know what you mean by that.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1260.625,1262.185,"Well, R-49 was--"
1990.89-1965,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1262.185,1263.497,Let's forget R-49.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1282.249,1294.927,--You're buying a potential stream of income that will perform differently--
1990.89-1965,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1294.927,1297.398,"Sure, but I want to know what the risk is that I'm not going to get the income."
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1327.327,1332.481,"--Justice Souter, that would depend upon what factors the computer was looking at."
1990.89-1965,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1332.481,1334.023,And that's what I want you to tell me.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1334.023,1335.205,"Okay, well--"
1990.89-1965,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1335.205,1344.869,"I mean, what I'm getting at is whether there is a material difference depends in part of what kinds of differences would be relevant to a mortgage lender."
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1366.663,1380.513,"--I'd like to direct you to Fannie Mae, and their amicus brief, because that issue was addressed there."
1990.89-1965,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1398.103,1406.639,"Well, is... your answer to my question then is no, the computer did not purport to give you two pools of identical risk?"
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1406.639,1407.591,--That's correct.
1990.89-1965,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1407.591,1408.111,Okay.
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1408.111,1412.012,"That's correct, because there is a lot of other factors that would have had to be taken into account."
1990.89-1965,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1518.203,1527.808,"Of course the only purpose of that was to enable the relationship between borrower and lender to continue, was it not?"
1990.89-1965,0,21256,dennis_l_manes,,1527.808,1534.653,"That... that's correct, because that's the normal way that mortgages are bought and sold."
1990.89-1965,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1543.569,1545.009,"Very well, Mr. Manes."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1547.422,1556.288,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1965,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1568.516,1571.917,They don't claim the losses arose from the swap.
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1576.46,1579.663,There was a real decline in the book value of the mortgage loans--
1990.89-1965,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1579.663,1581.844,So the loss had arisen prior to the transaction.
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1581.844,1584.726,--The loss was arising as time went by.
1990.89-1965,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1591.561,1604.649,"Mr. Roberts, if the facts had been just the reverse and the values of the properties had gone up and there was an exchange, what position would IRS take?"
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1604.649,1607.21,"Well, the position would be no gain would have been realized."
1990.89-1965,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1617.387,1632.007,"But you may have other situations where there are exchanges in the future for... where there might be a gain, and the IRS is prepared to apply exactly the same test to that one?"
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1632.007,1632.918,"Exactly the same test, Your Honor."
1990.89-1965,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1641.634,1642.754,And what do you look at?
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1650.589,1651.848,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1965,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1651.848,1652.429,No.
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1652.429,1653.301,The economic value--
1990.89-1965,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1653.301,1655.612,"What's your test, then, for material difference?"
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1655.612,1662.527,"--We think you should look at all the available evidence presented, and see if the difference had a capacity to affect the decision."
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1674.105,1676.636,This is a subjective test or is it an objective test?
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1676.636,1677.418,--It has been labelled--
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1677.418,1686.625,"You first said that the... whether the differences were of a nature as to affect the decision, and now you're saying here they in fact didn't affect the decision."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1688.147,1689.228,--The former.
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1700.314,1720.567,"--Suppose... suppose two taxpayers who have stock in different mutual funds have a study done by an expert, and he says these two funds, their performance in the past has been just about the same, in the future they are likely to be the same, as far as I can tell it's tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1728.412,1729.013,"Yes, it is."
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1729.774,1730.164,It is?
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1730.445,1733.766,--The mutual funds are not matched up the way that these pools of mortgages were.
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1739.448,1745.372,"Well, these houses are owned by different people, whose economic success and ability to pay their mortgages are quite different."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1745.372,1752.698,"--And if you're considering to... whether to invest in a mutual fund, you want to know who the management of the fund is, you want to know what their investment philosophy is."
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1753.409,1757.994,"If you take a mortgage on a house you want to know who the mortgagor is, too."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1757.994,1760.254,--Not in the secondary mortgage market.
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1770.45,1771.652,But that's being subjective.
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1778.606,1782.039,And that's strong evidence of what the nature of the transaction is.
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.039,1782.438,No.
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1795.257,1804.964,"No, I am saying that these particular traders didn't care who the mortgagors were, but not that that is the critical factor, but it's evidence of the objective nature of the transaction."
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1811.268,1811.739,"Oh, I see."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1814.959,1816.03,"--Well, yes."
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.03,1819.873,Does it have to be a trader in the secondary mortgage market living in New York?
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1819.873,1820.794,No.
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1821.393,1824.786,"You know, how specific... when you get specific enough then it's the same thing as a subjective test."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1824.786,1826.408,"--No, it's not."
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1863.431,1865.782,But that just shows that these traders didn't care.
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1865.782,1869.135,"That's the market I'm describing, not just these traders."
1990.89-1965,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1872.257,1882.265,"Yes, but the mutual... you could make the same argument about two mutual funds that pay the same interest rate and they are equally liquid, they are both short term funds, and one is the First National Bank and the other is the Chase Manhattan Bank, or something."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1886.967,1888.188,"--I think not, Your Honor."
1990.89-1965,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1900.725,1906.0,"Of course with a mutual fund you wouldn't care because it's not recognized under... what is it, 1031... anyway."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1911.534,1912.893,"I don't think that's true, Your Honor."
1990.89-1965,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1913.964,1915.414,"--Oh, it is recognized?"
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1915.414,1920.219,--I don't think the IRS regards different mutual funds as being of like kind.
1990.89-1965,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1928.525,1937.029,Was there any finding in the tax court or by the court of appeals that the secondary mortgage market had this characteristic which you describe?
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1937.029,1940.301,Not so much in the tax court in this case.
1990.89-1965,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1951.188,1955.512,That was a finding by the court of appeals or by the tax court?
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1955.512,1958.244,"In Centennial, by the Federal district court."
1990.89-1965,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1958.244,1960.264,By the... that came up through the Federal district court?
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1960.264,1960.665,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1960.665,1981.137,"So, if I understand what you're saying, what you recite in your brief as being a simple example, you very facilely say swapping one bushel of wheat for another bushel of wheat doesn't make any difference, that that's not an event that triggers recognition, that's really not true."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1984.581,1987.185,"You don't have to know who the traders are, but you have to know the market."
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1987.185,1988.204,That's right.
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1988.204,1995.76,"It could be in a particular case, if there is, if it turns out that South Dakota wheat is... sells at a premium to Kansas wheat, then you do have to know."
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1995.76,2004.025,"Well, there's two farmers and I say, you know, I have grown this new type of wheat, do you want to swap it for some of your old wheat and you try some of mine and I'll try some of yours."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2011.458,2013.411,"It is identifying the market, yes."
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2013.411,2015.191,I call it being subjective.
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2015.191,2020.234,"Well, an example we put forth in our brief is serial numbers on stock certificates."
1990.89-1965,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2053.146,2059.771,"There are going to be a lot more factual inquiries in cases involving the recognition of gain if the Court accepts your theory, I think."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2059.771,2070.728,"Well... it is unavoidable, I think, in the realization inquiry to ask, as the regulation sets forth, whether the properties are materially different."
1990.89-1965,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2077.713,2088.539,Do you think the regulation when it was adopted was intended to do any more than effectively codify this Court's decisions?
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2088.539,2095.625,"--Well, I think it was intended to define and clarify the concept that the Court began to articulate in the decisions in the 1920's."
1990.89-1965,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2102.838,2109.944,I'm just... I'm not sure that I understand what you say the limiting principle is here for the Government's test.
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2111.955,2119.952,"--The differences that are relied upon in the exchange of property have to be material differences, differences that make a difference."
1990.89-1965,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2119.952,2123.535,The differences actually relied upon.
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2123.535,2131.368,"Well, that are put forth by the taxpayer in response to the challenge that that was just an exchange of property that was not materially different."
1990.89-1965,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2131.368,2133.479,"Well, they have put forth those differences here."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2140.414,2143.146,There are not different risks of repayment.
1990.89-1965,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2143.907,2159.767,"Well, but they are, because each borrower has a different ability to repay the loan, and perhaps the security, the collateral, is different."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2159.767,2165.7,"--The value of the mortgage loans that are traded, that value, it's an asset that measures risk."
1990.89-1965,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2210.099,2210.83,But they--
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2225.76,2228.101,"Well, your net worth doesn't change."
1990.89-1965,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2238.847,2247.303,"But, you say your economic position changes dramatically when you sell stock... 50 shares of stock for $10,000."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2256.588,2259.771,--You're worth the same before the transaction and after.
1990.89-1965,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2259.771,2260.231,Yeah.
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2260.231,2260.632,I agree.
1990.89-1965,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2263.694,2264.655,"You're holding a different asset, yup."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2264.655,2268.396,"--Before the transaction you had shares in stock, and they could go up and could go down."
1990.89-1965,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2270.279,2276.233,"But for some centuries since the invention of money, I thought people would have said you economic position was the same."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2276.233,2281.846,"Well, to the extent you mean your worth, what you're worth, that hasn't changed."
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2295.524,2297.407,"No it didn't, no it didn't, no it didn't."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2303.281,2305.461,--Not just that they didn't care--
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2305.461,2311.626,"But they were really different loans, those... and it turned out that the loans they got paid off a good deal less than the ones they swapped."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2316.738,2321.533,"--Well, that fact, future performance, was unknown and unknowable at the time of the transaction."
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2321.533,2327.396,But that shows that in fact what they got was quite different from what they gave up.
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2329.838,2336.392,"With respect, Your Honor, the subsequent performance does not show that, because what the asset measures at the time is risk."
1990.89-1965,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2345.918,2348.011,Why isn't that true in the stock example?
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2348.011,2348.669,In the stock--
1990.89-1965,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2348.669,2358.686,"The market values the stock by taking the risk into consideration, and the market says in effect holding this stock gives you in effect the same economic risk as holding the $10,000."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2358.686,2365.722,"--No, because there are material differences in the... in an exchange of stock the material difference is in the issuers."
1990.89-1965,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2367.542,2369.322,"No, but that's true, but I think to the... maybe I misunderstood you."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2386.465,2389.708,"--Well, it's like a sinking fund bond."
1990.89-1965,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.887,2432.334,"Of course then the rights and obligations are exactly the same, too, but that's not like saying that 100 homes in North Carolina are identical to 100 homes in South Carolina, one in the cities and another in the country."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2436.218,2438.208,There is a difference in the underlying assets.
1990.89-1965,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2441.41,2442.421,You're just saying there's no difference in the risk.
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2457.872,2459.342,--Here it's not simply the fact that--
1990.89-1965,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2459.342,2460.023,--and it's a perfectly legitimate motivation.
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2460.023,2464.465,"--Here it's not simply the fact that the value coincides, that the risk is the same."
1990.89-1965,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2471.33,2472.442,"Yeah, but you say that doesn't matter."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2476.253,2481.615,"--It could happen to have the same risk, but we wouldn't say they are not therefore materially different."
1990.89-1965,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2481.615,2483.888,I think you're really making a subjective test argument.
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2483.888,2488.391,It depends on the nature of the transaction.
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2488.391,2490.003,"Of the market, you say, which--"
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2490.003,2490.351,And of the market.
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2490.351,2498.528,"--Let's go to your sinking... your sinking fund bonds again where, where they are selected randomly which ones will be paid off over the 10-year period."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2517.042,2517.249,No.
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2518.051,2518.561,Why not?
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2518.561,2520.952,--law doesn't look at idiosyncracies in particular taxpayers.
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2522.724,2524.195,"Oh, it has to rise to the level of being a market?"
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2532.963,2542.376,--It would be no different than if one of these trading partners decided it was only going to swap loans that happen to have red folders and not green ones.
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2562.289,2564.372,But this is a material difference for that market.
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2581.474,2582.804,"No, it wouldn't."
1990.89-1965,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2582.804,2583.683,I don't understand why.
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2583.683,2586.554,"Not a rational, economic--"
1990.89-1965,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2586.554,2587.606,"Well, let me give you another."
1990.89-1965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2609.101,2615.814,"--Well, that of course is the argument that Fannie Mae raises in the Centennial case where it's filed in an amicus brief."
