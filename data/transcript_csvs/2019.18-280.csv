2019.18-280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.0,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-280, the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association versus the City of New York. Mr. Clement."
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,9.0,23.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Text, history, and tradition all make clear that New York City's restrictive premises license and accompanying transport ban are unconstitutional."
2019.18-280,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,131.28,140.44,"But, Mr. -- Mr. Clement, the city has now been blocked by a state law, and the state has not been party to these proceedings."
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,162.56,207.72,"So, Justice Ginsburg, the Petitioners have not gotten all the relief to which they've been entitled if they prevailed in this litigation before the city and the state changed their law. I think the best way to illustrate that is if we prevailed in the district court before these changes in the law, we would have been entitled, of course, to a declaration that the transport ban is and always was unconstitutional. But we would also be entitled to an injunction that did three things: one, prohibit future enforcement of the transport ban; second, prevent the city from taking past conduct in violation of the ban into account in licensing decisions; and, third, an injunction that safeguard our right to transport meaningfully such that it wouldn't be limited to continuous and uninterrupted transport."
2019.18-280,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,207.72,208.16,But even as --
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,208.16,209.24,Now the state law --
2019.18-280,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,209.24,223.36,"-- as far as what you said about enforcing past violations, no plaintiff has alleged that they ever violated the regulations when they were in effect?"
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,223.36,225.88,"That's actually not correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2019.18-280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,255.64,256.88,Mr. Clement --
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,256.88,258.64,-- New York licenses handguns or --
2019.18-280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,258.64,267.88,"-- Mr. Clement, I believe that the city has foresworn any future prosecution for past violations."
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,267.88,268.84,Well --
2019.18-280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,268.84,272.68,I thought that that's the representation they made to this Court.
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,272.68,276.92,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, in their latest letter, they were very careful about what they represented."
2019.18-280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,292.84,298.44,"But that has to do with the current law, and that hasn't been decided by the court below."
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,307.36,309.0,"Well, I don't think so, Justice Sotomayor."
2019.18-280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,313.0,349.84,"No, Mr. Clement, what you're asking us to do is to take a case in which the other side has thrown in the towel and completely given you every single thing you demanded in your complaint for relief, and you're asking us to opine on a law that's not on the books anymore, and one that's not on the books, not because of something necessarily the city did but because the state, a party who's not a party to this litigation, has changed the law and prohibited them from doing. So this is, I think, something quite different."
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,353.4,353.64,Well --
2019.18-280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,353.64,357.12,And the new law hasn't been reviewed below yet.
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,357.12,362.88,"So, again, Justice Sotomayor, I really think what we're asking you to do is exactly analogous to what was before this Court in Knox."
2019.18-280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,373.24,374.4,But you've got what you want now.
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,389.64,408.48,"Well, so before I put it aside, let me just say I think we do know the answer to that because, in subsection 7 of the new regulations that they promulgated, specifically to try to moot this case, they made clear that the kind of transport they were allowing, at least within the City of New York, had to be continuous and uninterrupted."
2019.18-280,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,438.36,439.16,Did you --
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,439.16,453.0,"-- would be a continuing dispute that would render the case not moot, just like in Knox, there was a continuing dispute about the sufficiency of the refund notice that the union offered, post certiorari, in its effort to moot the case."
2019.18-280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,482.84,487.52,"I'm sorry, that -- that's the oddest decision I've heard."
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,505.92,507.32,"Well, with respect, Justice Sotomayor --"
2019.18-280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,507.32,539.0,"-- if -- if they've agreed and you agree that everything but the ""continuous and uninterrupted"" has been resolved and that you've gotten everything you wanted as demanded in your complaint, you can travel to a second home, you can travel to any lawful firing range, that's all your original complaint demanded, if you got all of that, that is the issue that was before us."
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,539.0,539.2,Well --
2019.18-280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,539.2,549.72,"And your question is whether -- and you've agreed we should leave that to the courts below, what contiguous -- ""continuous and uninterrupted"" is."
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,553.24,573.44,"With respect, Justice Sotomayor, we don't think we've gotten everything that we could have gotten if we prevailed in the district court, including continuous and uninterrupted. But also we would like, with all due respect, given our five years of history in this litigation with my friends on the other side, we'd like something more than their representations to protect us against the use in the future of past conduct --"
2019.18-280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,573.44,574.04,I -- I -- I have one --
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,574.04,574.84,-- in licensing decisions.
2019.18-280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,574.84,575.88,-- I have one question.
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,603.96,607.84,We -- we asked for all other appropriate relief in our complaint.
2019.18-280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,615.8,619.08,"You'd have to ask for permission to amend your complaint to seek that, don't you?"
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,619.08,638.32,"We would have to do that, but with all due respect to the Solicitor General, we were happy that they recognized the case wasn't moot, but we didn't really feel like we needed a damages lifeline because we think we had multiple strong arguments based on this Court's precedents, including the Knox case, that said that wholly apart from the damages issue this dispute isn't moot. So if I could turn to --"
2019.18-280,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,638.32,641.68,"Mr. Clement, just one more on the damages."
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,656.32,658.8,"I'm not aware of one either, Justice Ginsburg."
2019.18-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,706.12,706.84,I probably have a --
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,706.84,707.32,-- to have --
2019.18-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,707.32,741.44,"I mean, I don't think it's bad when people who have an argument settle their argument and, thus, there no longer is one, so I wonder if, should I ask them this question? You say this case is still alive because the City of New York might prosecute one of your clients because they stopped for coffee on the way to a firing range. I think I'm going to ask them that. And I have a suspicion they will say no, we aren't going to prosecute that particular individual."
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,746.4,747.56,Right.
2019.18-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,750.28,750.52,Here's your time.
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,750.6,773.44,"-- and if the standard for mootness is whether it is possible to provide effectual relief, I guarantee an injunction backed by contempt that enforces those promises is going to give my clients more effectual relief. And do keep in mind what makes this case quite different from a lot of others is this is a discretionary licensing process where the city makes judgments about good moral character."
2019.18-280,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,831.76,836.48,"Mr. Clement, as I understand New York's scheme, New York has two kinds of licences."
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,855.28,866.88,"Well, Justice Kagan, I think what my clients wanted in this lawsuit, and there are plenty of other lawsuits out there challenging carry restrictions, but they wanted the right to transport, not the right to carry. Now I --"
2019.18-280,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,866.88,868.96,"Well, transporting is a kind of carrying."
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,873.84,875.04,I -- I will agree with that.
2019.18-280,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,880.68,891.64,"All I'm asking is -- is -- is there's a premises scheme and a carrying scheme, and your clients want to carry, which suggests that you should have brought a challenge to the carrying scheme if you thought that that was deficient."
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,891.64,919.12,"Again, with respect, Justice Kagan, my clients for years had -- at least two of the three, had what the city for a while called a target license, and it didn't give them a full right to carry, but it did give them the right to transport their firearms to New Jersey and other places, probably would have allowed a second home, though I'm not sure that issue is squarely presented. My clients did not insist on getting a carry license either under the -- before this lawsuit was filed or in this lawsuit."
2019.18-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,988.88,989.56,I want to go back --
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,989.56,990.88,-- Second Amendment rights.
2019.18-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,990.88,994.6,-- for one second to the question presented.
2019.18-280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1029.72,1033.76,You can finish the question.
2019.18-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1033.76,1035.24,That was the finish. (Laughter.)
2019.18-280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1035.24,1037.36,Briefly. Thank you.
2019.18-280,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1037.36,1043.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you. So my answer in a -- in a nutshell is Knox."
2019.18-280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1068.84,1077.44,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall."
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1077.44,1083.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: One point on the merits and one on mootness."
2019.18-280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1116.92,1119.12,But they never asked for it.
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1119.12,1130.68,"That's true, Justice Ginsburg, but there's a specific federal rule on this, Federal Rule 54(c), which says the prayer of relief binds on a default judgment, but it doesn't bind when you've litigated on the merits."
2019.18-280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1155.6,1155.84,Has --
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1155.84,1157.08,-- as a result of the city's conduct.
2019.18-280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1157.08,1174.44,"-- has it -- has the SG, the Solicitor General, ever asked this Court to allow such a late interjection of a damages question to save a case from mootness? Mr. Clement said he was not aware of any such case."
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1175.16,1180.2,So I don't know of any case in which it's directly come up or we've weighed in on it.
2019.18-280,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1187.36,1196.2,"Didn't it come up in Alejandrino? Is that the -- the name of the case? And it was decided the other way, that the Court said no, we're not going to allow that to happen."
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1196.2,1200.44,"So I think -- but that's in -- first, it's in 1926, so it predates the federal rule."
2019.18-280,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1219.88,1222.96,"I mean, not focused on damages is an understatement."
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1239.52,1246.36,"So I -- I heard Mr. Clement say: I'm happy to affirm that my clients want damages, but we don't think we need that lifeline from the solicitor general."
2019.18-280,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1262.12,1262.44,All right.
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1263.0,1266.2,-- there is no barrier to their receiving an award of damages from a court.
2019.18-280,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1266.2,1270.56,Would you remind me what -- where in the complaint they set forth damages?
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1270.56,1270.76,Sure.
2019.18-280,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1282.48,1282.76,But --
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1282.76,1287.48,"Those are both the pleadings and the summary judgment affidavits, and they rely on two kinds of harm."
2019.18-280,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1300.12,1301.88,"Mr. Wall, I mean, they filed a complaint."
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1329.88,1334.64,"Look, Justice Kagan, I'll certainly grant that there's a lot of post-grant maneuvering on both sides."
2019.18-280,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1352.12,1359.8,"Well, I -- I thought that in your brief, in your letter brief, you specifically rejected every other theory of -- of why this case was live."
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1359.8,1363.64,We do think that the Court credits those kinds of assertions by governmental litigants.
2019.18-280,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1388.24,1388.6,And what do you think --
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1388.6,1389.28,-- if they prevailed on the merits.
2019.18-280,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1389.28,1396.68,-- of Mr. Clement's theory? I take it that you rejected Mr. Clement's theory about this continuous travel and stopping for coffee?
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1396.68,1398.88,I -- I think it's a close call.
2019.18-280,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1415.08,1444.88,"Well, why -- why isn't that good enough? If under the prior law the plaintiffs would have sought relief that would allow them to take their firearms locked safely to a range and stop along the way for a cup of coffee or a bathroom break and that that is still being denied under the -- if that's a proper reading, we'll ask New York about that, I'm sure, but if that's still a proper reading of their existing regulations, why isn't there a live controversy remaining?"
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1444.88,1445.04,I think --
2019.18-280,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1445.04,1448.6,There would seem to be a delta of relief that's been denied them.
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1448.6,1454.64,"Oh, I do think there is a -- a live controversy potentially now about the meaning of this ""continuous and uninterrupted"" requirement."
2019.18-280,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1457.84,1458.68,"Well, why doesn't --"
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1458.68,1459.4,-- we have doubts since --
2019.18-280,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1459.4,1479.12,"-- it arise -- why isn't the dispute still alive from the old law if that's a form of relief they would have sought and is still, despite the new law, being denied them? Isn't that a classic definition of relief that was sought but now still -- despite herculean, late-breaking efforts to moot the case, still alive?"
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1479.12,1485.0,"I -- if the Court wanted to say that, I don't think it would harm the United States' interests."
2019.18-280,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1485.24,1489.08,"You're not aware of any precedent that would foreclose that and, in fact, that's pretty much what Knox did, isn't it?"
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1489.08,1506.64,"Well, except that Knox wasn't a governmental litigant, so I think presumption of voluntary cessation worked a little differently, but to -- Justice Gorsuch, just to go to the question, I think in the district court, the fight was about whether they could do the thing at all. And now we have a -- what strikes us as a different fight about the manner in which they can go."
2019.18-280,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1512.36,1512.72,"Sure, they granted --"
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1512.72,1513.48,-- that would keep the Court from going there.
2019.18-280,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1513.48,1514.08,-- new relief.
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1517.92,1519.32,I -- I would agree with that.
2019.18-280,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1555.84,1574.28,"I'm sorry, can I go back to that question? In what other area, constitutional area, the First Amendment in particular, have we decided any case based solely on text, history, and tradition? This seems sort of a made-up new standard."
2019.18-280,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1663.08,1664.96,"So two points, Justice Sotomayor."
2019.18-280,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1695.6,1703.96,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dearing."
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,1703.96,1732.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Contrary to how they're presenting it now, Petitioners framed this case narrowly. They argue that a premises license, a premises license specifically, must allow certain limited transport of the licensed handgun to effectuate its possession and use in the premises, and they sought only injunctive and declaratory relief to require the city to allow that limited transport. And that narrow framing, in turn, has two implications now."
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1851.6,1852.76,But let's go to something --
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,1852.76,1853.52,-- under current law.
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1853.52,1855.76,-- beyond a coffee stop or a bathroom break.
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,1888.28,1892.48,"That would be, I think -- I'm not certain that it would."
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1896.8,1903.64,"No, no, no, no, we're back, without the new laws, city or state, would that have been -- would that have been legal conduct?"
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,1903.64,1906.08,If that had happened prior to the changes in conduct?
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1906.08,1911.16,"After a judgment that the old law was unconstitutional, prior to the enactment of any new law."
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,1911.16,1917.92,I don't think it's -- it's at all clear because that question -- those kind of questions were never put at issue or litigated in the case.
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1918.2,1922.92,"Well, what -- you don't know what -- you don't know whether there's any city law that that would violate?"
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,1922.92,1926.84,If there were a judgment that said that our law had been struck down -- our former --
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1926.84,1926.88,Yeah.
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,1926.88,1927.64,-- law had been struck down?
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1927.64,1927.72,Yeah.
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,1927.72,1929.16,I'm not aware of any city law that that --
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1929.16,1933.72,So then why is this case moot? Because they didn't get all that they wanted.
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,1957.48,1965.96,"I think that -- the answer is that Article III analysis is always focused on what the plaintiffs asked for, not speculation about what might have been an injunction here."
2019.18-280,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1981.04,1983.36,Where is the injunction that plaintiffs framed?
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,1983.36,2000.56,"It's in -- it's in a number of docket entries, and I don't remember the numbers offhand, but they're in the summary judgment in -- in both motions for preliminary judgment -- injunction, motions for summary judgment, across several different docket numbers, injunctions were repeatedly proposed by the Petitioners."
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2014.16,2017.24,And why wouldn't that include a non-direct trip?
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2017.24,2022.04,"Your Honor, the issue of directness was never ever litigated as part of this case."
2019.18-280,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2059.68,2064.76,Is there -- is there any way in which any violation could prejudice a gun owner?
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2064.76,2067.4,Not that -- not that I can think of.
2019.18-280,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2072.68,2085.96,"Is there any way in which a finding of mootness would prejudice further options available to the Petitioners in this case, for example, seeking damages?"
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2085.96,2087.68,I don't -- I don't think so.
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2128.12,2141.32,"Counsel, can I just make sure I understood you correctly earlier? I understood you to suggest that there there will be no collateral consequences to anyone for violating the city's prior ban, any kind of collateral consequences."
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2141.32,2143.44,I think there's no basis to think there would be.
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2143.44,2150.96,"No, I'm wondering -- you're -- you're representing the city, and so I'm asking the city's representative here --"
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2150.96,2151.2,Yes.
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2151.2,2158.6,-- that the city -- that there will be no collateral consequences from the city to individuals who violated the prior ban?
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2158.6,2160.4,"Absolutely correct, there will be none."
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2160.4,2161.64,All right.
2019.18-280,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2161.64,2164.44,And you're making that representation to this Court?
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2164.44,2168.4,I'm making that representation to this Court on the record on behalf of the City of New York.
2019.18-280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2168.4,2180.44,"I'm not going to, because I want to be careful for you and for society, you're not representing if they shot somebody with a gun that you're not going to prosecute them for that?"
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2180.44,2181.08,Correct.
2019.18-280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2181.08,2185.8,You're just not going to prosecute them for any violation of this old law?
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2185.8,2188.48,"Of the repealed provisions of the law, that's right."
2019.18-280,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2199.56,2202.96,"Well, I guess my -- my question and some of the others went beyond prosecution."
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2214.84,2215.04,It will not.
2019.18-280,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2232.88,2235.48,Do you have a way -- sorry.
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2251.64,2252.28,Absolutely.
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2306.68,2330.28,But do you think it's really fair for you at this point to look for specific allegations in the complaint to defeat a claim of mootness that the plaintiffs had no reason whatsoever to anticipate until after we granted certiorari and the city decided to try to moot this case?
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2330.28,2334.88,This -- that just confirms that the plaintiffs got everything they asked for in this case.
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2336.96,2366.48,"Well, how does that confirm that they got everything that they asked for? If you say, well, they didn't ask for nominal damages, they didn't ask for actual damages, they didn't specifically allege that they violated the old law, you -- you really -- they didn't allege that they wanted to make a non-direct trip, how could any plaintiff possibly have anticipated that until you took the quite extraordinary step of trying to moot the case after we granted review?"
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2366.48,2369.24,"First, the state legislature has passed a new State law here."
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2369.24,2369.6,Yeah.
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2372.44,2377.44,"The city supported the law, as we do with many -- many potential bills, and most of them go nowhere."
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2397.64,2459.48,"Counsel, let's say I -- I agree with you -- I mean, I accept that. It's -- it's great when local governments respond to the constitutional constraints that are suggested by others in litigation. But it does seem a bit much, doesn't it, to fault plaintiffs for not having a specific damages requirement in their prayer for relief in a complaint that was framed years ago. This litigation, I think, has taken five-plus years, and that has become relevant only at this late stage after the city and the state have enacted a new law. Why isn't the prospect of allowing damages to be added to the complaint enough? In a 1983 action, damages are clearly available. The complaint, long ago as it was filed, did say that they sought all available relief, you know, typical prayer for relief."
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2470.04,2471.68,"Well, two answers."
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2479.6,2482.0,A fair prospect of relief isn't enough to sustain?
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2482.0,2484.52,A fair prospect whether the claim is even in the case at all.
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2539.04,2550.0,So you think it's totally irrelevant that the state has at this late stage sought to moot the case when we're assessing the prospect and the interests of the plaintiff in seeking damages?
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2550.0,2561.44,"I think it is, because -- because the reason demands are made in litigation is to prompt a defendant to decide whether to meet them, not to decide later if they do meet them, to -- to -- to reinvent the case and make it something else."
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2562.36,2562.72,Do you agree that there --
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2562.72,2563.8,-- from this Court's cases --
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2563.8,2576.6,-- do you agree that there would at least be a fair prospect that a district court on remand might disagree with you and find that there is a reasonable excuse for the plaintiffs' introduction of damages at this stage?
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2576.6,2577.32,I don't think so.
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2584.4,2586.76,"Let's say if we disagreed with you, then what?"
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2586.76,2601.48,"Still not enough, I think, because the -- the prospect of adding a potential live claim is not enough to -- to sustain an Article III case or controversy now and to allow the court to reach the merits before that claim is in the case. And the clearest example is Alvarez versus Smith."
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2612.8,2616.04,What do you do about the fact that that was pre-Rule 54 and the federal rules and so on?
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2616.04,2619.6,Alvarez was not pre-Rule -- Alvarez was -- was about a decade ago. Alvarez was long --
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2619.6,2620.04,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2620.48,2622.16,-- after Rule 54. That's a different -- that's Alejandrino --
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2622.16,2622.6,"Alejandrino, sorry."
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2622.6,2623.64,-- which is a different case.
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2660.84,2669.88,"Mr. Dearing, are the -- are people in New York less safe now as a result of the enactment of the new city and state laws than they were before?"
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2669.88,2672.0,"We -- we -- no, I don't think so."
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2680.76,2688.16,"Well, if they're not less safe, then what possible justification could there have been for the old rule, which you have abandoned?"
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2688.16,2696.64,"It was a reasonable -- as we've outlined in our briefs, it was a reasonable implementation of the -- of the state premises license, carry license division."
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2712.28,2721.84,So you think the Second Amendment permits the imposition of a restriction that has no public safety benefit?
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2721.84,2745.84,"I think you have to look, first, to consider whether the -- the type of restriction -- how the restriction accords with the history under the Second Amendment before we answer that question. And so I -- I think -- I think the right place to start, and -- and for our purposes, maybe starting with shooting ranges is the best, first key point is this must be viewed as an adjunct to the premises license."
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2751.72,2766.48,"Well, if it's viewed in that way, could the city -- would it be consistent with the Second Amendment for the city to prohibit any trip by a person holding a premises license to a firing range?"
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2766.48,2768.12,I think that would be doubtful.
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2785.2,2789.6,"So you are conceding -- I take it ""doubtful"" means that it would be unconstitutional."
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2808.08,2816.52,"I think what I'm conceding is that, in the case of a premises license, the Second Amendment has something to say about what effective possession in the home means."
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2823.48,2847.44,"Well, if the person is taking the firearm, the handgun, from the home to a firing range, the person is out on the streets of New York, and if -- unless a total ban on taking it to a firing range would be consistent with the Second Amendment, it follows that the Second Amendment, under at least some circumstances, protects the possession of a handgun outside the home."
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2849.64,2898.56,"I think -- I think that's a fair way to look at it, that -- that -- that -- but -- but, from our perspective, the right question regarding a premises license is, did the -- did the rule impermissibly burden effective use of the handgun in the premises? In the same way that to get a gun to a premises, you have to get it somewhere outside -- you know, purchase it somewhere outside your premises and bring it there, that certain things that happen outside the home may -- may be integrally related to effective use of a handgun inside the home. But, when you look at a premises license, and not speaking about the Second Amendment at large or writ large, but the premises license specifically, the only proper lens to look at the question through is whether the restriction impinges on effective use of the handgun in the home. And with regard to training, we have two -- two related reasons why it doesn't."
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2959.84,2983.76,"Well, how should -- what methodology should the courts use in approaching Second Amendment questions? If they conclude that text and history protect a -- the text and history of the Second Amendment protect a particular activity, is that the end of the question or do they then go on and apply some level of scrutiny?"
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2983.76,2992.36,"I think -- I think, first, we look -- we look to history and determine whether history answers the question one way or the other, whether it's constitutional or unconstitutional."
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2992.36,2992.76,Right.
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,2992.76,3005.2,"And in a significant number of cases, history will not speak with one voice or conclusively on that subject and then the right step is to move on to an assessment of justification and fit under a means and scrutiny approach."
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3005.2,3012.6,"But if history says this is protected, then that's the end of the question, there's no resort to some level of scrutiny?"
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3012.6,3019.92,"If history conclusively shows that the restriction is impermissible, then I -- I think -- as in Heller, Heller is an example of that phenomenon."
2019.18-280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3039.64,3039.92,No --
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3039.92,3040.12,-- right.
2019.18-280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3040.12,3044.48,"-- you're supposed to do there, because you're correctly stating the views of some judges."
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3044.48,3045.2,Right.
2019.18-280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3045.2,3048.24,And some judges had an opposite view.
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3048.24,3051.04,"I'm aware -- I'm aware of that, that's correct. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3051.04,3071.16,"Our -- our -- our -- our view is that -- is that history can answer some questions pretty directly and -- and in other many -- in other -- in a -- in a significant number of cases, history doesn't speak so clearly and that the most reliable method of answering the question in those cases is a -- is means and scrutiny."
2019.18-280,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3071.16,3081.84,"One -- one problem with the prior regulation, if you wanted to have a gun in your second home, you had to buy a second gun."
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3109.48,3145.92,"I think that the -- the question on second homes, there Petitioners have identified a difficult application of our former rule that wasn't really contemplated when the rule was -- was adopted. I still think, though, if you look historically, and the -- the right way to answer a question about whether it was unconstitutional is to ask whether there had been some historical tradition of enabling individuals to use the same handgun to protect two different homes. Of course our rule never spoke to the question of whether an individual could have a handgun in a -- in a -- in a residence outside our jurisdiction."
2019.18-280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3159.92,3175.64,"Suppose -- I mean, this is why these things are difficult for you. All right? I understand that. But in Massachusetts, historically, all the guns and ammunition were stored in a central place at night, I believe, at the time of the resolution -- revolution."
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3222.28,3248.16,"That argument is the -- is the argument that -- that is presented on the record of the -- of the detective -- detective -- detective's affidavit, sorry. We, of course, took a close look at that question, and the police commissioner determined that -- that the rule could be repealed without a negative impact on public safety. I do think the police will have to work harder to verify what's happening in those situations, but we -- we are confident that they can do it and they will do it --"
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3248.16,3248.48,Why --
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3248.48,3248.96,-- successfully.
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3248.96,3269.36,"Why will they have to work harder? Somebody who lives in midtown is stopped and -- with a gun and the officer says, where are you going? I'm going to a firing range in Jersey City, which is right across the river. That's tougher than, I'm going to a firing range in Staten Island."
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3273.4,3274.56,Two -- two are in Staten Island.
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3274.56,3276.68,Two are in Staten Island?
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3276.68,3281.48,I think it is a little bit tougher but of course the -- the person may not say Jersey City either.
2019.18-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3281.48,3281.6,All right.
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3295.84,3300.36,"Well, still the -- still what happens in Staten Island is within the Police Department's jurisdiction."
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3376.04,3377.24,"Counsel, can I --"
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3377.24,3377.8,Through that lens.
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3377.8,3393.96,I JUST want to circle back to the direct and continuous travel requirement of the current rule and Justice Alito's question about visiting your mother. Is it now the city's position that any reasonable stops are permissible?
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3393.96,3398.28,That is our enforcement -- reasonably necessary stops in the course of travel --
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3398.28,3399.32,Reasonably necessary.
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3399.32,3400.32,-- are permissible.
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3400.32,3403.56,Now does that include stopping to visit your mother --
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3403.56,3404.08,I haven't -- I'm --
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3404.08,3404.16,Or use the --
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3404.16,3405.12,I'm not sure I know the answer to that.
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3405.12,3410.72,"Get a cup of coffee? I mean, I'm not sure a cup -- is coffee reasonably necessary? (Laughter.)"
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3410.72,3411.96,Probably depends who you ask.
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3413.88,3421.12,The Police Department has affirmed and we have made clear that -- the enforcement position is that a stop for a cup of coffee is not a problem.
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3421.12,3421.8,So that's reasonably --
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3421.8,3422.08,And in fact --
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3422.08,3422.6,-- necessary.
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3426.84,3435.24,"I think that -- well, the controlling standard here -- I'm -- I'm giving you the enforcement position of the Police Department on the questions we have considered."
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3455.64,3464.44,"So we have no representations to us as to what is -- is direct and continuous, other than coffee is okay."
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3464.44,3480.84,"Coffee -- what -- what I know -- what I -- what I can represent because -- because it's come up before, coffee, restrooms, food, gas, the kinds of things that you ordinarily would stop for in the course of -- of travel, I hadn't considered the mother or mother-in-law example before."
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3494.48,3494.88,I understand --
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3494.88,3495.08,-- litigation.
2019.18-280,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3495.08,3495.24,-- that.
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3506.56,3511.36,"Well, this is all -- I guess -- in short what I'm saying is -- Mr. Chief Justice, may I answer?"
2019.18-280,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3511.36,3511.64,Sure.
2019.18-280,2,63193,richard_p_dearing,,3511.64,3520.52,"In short what I'm saying is this is not relief that was ever sought. There may be a controversy here, but it's a new controversy, it would need to be litigated in a new case."
2019.18-280,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3530.0,3536.6,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Clement."
2019.18-280,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3536.6,3540.08,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points in rebuttal."
2019.18-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3567.12,3567.76,Mr. Clement --
2019.18-280,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3567.76,3568.32,-- state law.
2019.18-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3568.32,3602.64,"-- your complaint from relief states it: ""An order preliminarily and permanently enjoining the defendants"" -- I skip out whoever else -- ""who receive actual notice of the injunction from enforcing this prohibition from traveling beyond the borders of the City of New York to attend a gun range, shooting competition, or to use a lawfully possessed and licensed firearm for the purposes of defending one's home, person, or property."" And you asked for a declaratory relief in -- with those same words."
2019.18-280,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3602.64,3604.36,"That's right, Justice Sotomayor."
2019.18-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3623.92,3624.44,"Well, let --"
2019.18-280,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3624.44,3625.88,-- important to understand --
2019.18-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3625.88,3654.28,"-- let's stop. Justice Alito said stopping at your mother's. When you say unrestricted, does that mean I can carry my gun for three days? Do you think that a court actually would have crafted an injunction at all with hypothetical situations? It would have said you can carry your gun to the range, and then would have left for further litigation, specific applications of that general rule."
2019.18-280,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3654.28,3655.84,"I -- I don't think so, Your Honor."
2019.18-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3655.84,3656.44,Unless you had --
2019.18-280,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3656.44,3660.32,I think what would have happened is the parties would have had their proposed injunctions.
2019.18-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3675.28,3675.8,So you want us --
2019.18-280,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3675.8,3676.36,-- work together.
2019.18-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3676.36,3676.6,-- to create --
2019.18-280,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3676.6,3676.92,Maybe you could proceed --
2019.18-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3676.92,3677.12,-- the law.
2019.18-280,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3677.12,3679.04,-- with the other points you intended to --
2019.18-280,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3679.04,3687.8,"I -- I -- I would be delighted to, Your Honor. I think the way that city law and state law work together here is all the state law says is we're going to allow your transport if it's direct."
2019.18-280,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3742.44,3742.96,"Thank you, counsel."
