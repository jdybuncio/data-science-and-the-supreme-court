1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.504,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-428, Air Line Pilots Association v. Robert Miller."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,57.753,60.455,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,219.193,220.076,Mr. Anker--
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,220.076,220.626,Yes.
1997.97-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,220.626,226.946,--would you mind telling me as a practical matter how these fee challenges typically come up?
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,240.022,241.339,You're talking about specifically--
1997.97-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.339,241.689,--of the breakdown?
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,241.689,242.391,--in our case?
1997.97-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,242.391,242.958,Yes.
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,244.724,245.158,All right.
1997.97-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,277.929,281.147,Usually there's been some prospective estimates.
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,281.147,281.833,--That's correct.
1997.97-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,281.833,283.133,So that they're not charged the full amount.
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,283.133,283.716,That's--
1997.97-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,283.716,286.551,But then you... it doesn't get serious until after the fact.
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,286.551,289.67,"--Let me... if I can just finish, I think I'll... you'll see that part of it."
1997.97-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,289.67,290.272,"Yes, okay."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,290.272,291.605,The statement is issued.
1997.97-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,334.116,345.99,Have... has this Court ever required a nonsignatory to a contract to submit to arbitration rather than going to court?
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,345.99,348.791,"No, Your Honor, not to my knowledge, and I think that--"
1997.97-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,348.791,350.56,It's kind of a big step to do.
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,351.477,351.91,"--Well, it's... it may--"
1997.97-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,351.91,357.797,"--help as a practical matter, but I just... I wondered what kind of authority there would be for that."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,357.797,358.166,--All right.
1997.97-428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.251,389.268,"Of course, it is compulsory for the union here."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,389.268,390.035,--That's correct.
1997.97-428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,390.97,392.32,"I mean, we've done that half-way--"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,392.32,393.153,--This is a special procedure.
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,416.102,419.571,"--Is this, Mr. Anker, strictly speaking, an impartial decisionmaker?"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,421.923,423.323,--How are they picked?
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,423.323,426.225,How at the people picked for the tribunal or the--
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,426.225,426.742,All right--
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,426.742,428.426,--person who would make this decision?
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,428.426,437.782,"--In our case, and I think here we follow the pattern that most unions have adopted, we use a procedure which the American Arbitration Association created."
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,471.753,475.388,From a panel that the AAA has selected?
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,475.388,476.573,--That's correct.
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,476.573,480.625,And do the dissidents have any part in selecting that?
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,480.625,481.709,No.
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,482.644,483.044,Neither party?
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,483.044,496.202,"Neither party does, although there are, of course, provisions for challenging an arbitrator for cause if there's some ground to believe that he is biased in some way, or has some interest--"
1997.97-428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,496.202,498.587,"Mr. Anker, can I ask you a preliminary question--"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,498.587,498.987,--Surely.
1997.97-428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,498.987,499.938,--I just get out of the papers?
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,506.176,517.215,"In the year that this case arose, which was 1992, the fees were 2.35 percent of their airline earnings."
1997.97-428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,521.686,523.904,So for each member of the union it's a different dollar figure.
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,523.904,526.088,"It's based... it's a percentage of his earnings, right."
1997.97-428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,526.088,529.958,"And if they made, say, 100,000 a year they would get a... the dues would be--"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,529.958,531.742,"2,350."
1997.97-428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,531.742,538.331,"--I see, so that a... and then if you reduce that, say 10 percent was in dispute, it would be a couple of hundred dollars in dispute for each person."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,538.331,538.631,That's about right.
1997.97-428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,559.894,564.196,"Justice O'Connor's question was, what is the source of our authority to do this?"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,574.487,576.004,Well--
1997.97-428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,576.004,578.789,"Where do I have the power, does this Court have the power to do that?"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,578.789,582.075,"--I guess I would answer it this way, Your Honor."
1997.97-428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,631.173,631.607,"Well, I think--"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,631.607,632.942,It's judicially made law.
1997.97-428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,634.442,641.715,--But there's almost a history or tradition that Congress sets up remedial schemes.
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,643.681,648.785,"--Well, my answer would be, Your Honor, that that's exactly what the Court did in the Hudson case."
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,648.785,649.335,But--
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,649.335,655.206,The Court said that the union must provide this procedure.
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,656.089,659.26,"--But that was under the Due Process Clause, wasn't it?"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,668.782,673.834,"Well, certainly in Hudson there were constitutional provisions, Your Honor."
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,677.054,678.604,"Well, First Amendment."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,678.604,683.056,"Right, which is not, of course, a procedural provision of the Constitution."
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,693.162,694.464,There had to be--
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,694.464,695.464,--There had to be these procedures.
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,696.014,708.456,"--But now, to me it seems there is a difference here suggested by Justice Kennedy, perhaps, that there isn't any similar constitutional compulsion to set up the procedure you want to."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,708.456,720.697,"--No, there's not a constitutional compulsion, but there is... the same kind of a right which exists in the public sector under the First Amendment exists under the... in the private sector under the statute, based upon--"
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,720.697,725.149,"Yes, but this could be invoked by the dissidents--"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,725.149,725.416,--All right--
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,725.416,726.251,--but I think not by the union.
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,726.251,741.844,"--but the union has rights here too, Your Honor, and those are the rights after all, to collect these fees and to have a functioning agency shop agreement and to have it work without excessive burdens that make it impractical."
1997.97-428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,774.482,774.866,May I ask--
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,774.866,775.582,There's a balance.
1997.97-428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,776.184,777.034,"--May I ask one other detail, if I may?"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,785.123,786.973,"Correct, impartial decisionmaker."
1997.97-428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,786.973,787.373,--to look at what was done.
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,790.008,794.395,I suppose in practice it does.
1997.97-428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,803.418,804.218,"Well, why would they ever want to do that?"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,804.218,804.885,"Well, they might want to--"
1997.97-428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,810.755,811.441,"Oh, I see what you're saying."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,813.791,814.909,"--In practice, we do."
1997.97-428,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,814.909,830.403,"Mr. Anker, if I look at Hudson and don't go any further than that, I at least find it difficult to conclude that the provision for the neutral decisionmaker was intended to be anything but a protection for the dissidents."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,899.38,922.928,"Well, I have to say, Your Honor, that my knowledge about that is fairly limited, but I think the union that has the most experience with it is the National Education Association, which has filed a brief as an amicus here, and they have informed the Court in their brief that in... I don't remember whether they said in most, but in some large percentage of their cases their... they do not go beyond the arbitration."
1997.97-428,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,922.928,923.614,"Well, what--"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,923.614,926.732,"Now, I have no personal knowledge of that and I really can't take--"
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,926.732,938.957,"--You wouldn't, I take it... under the system you're proposing you wouldn't have the sort of deference to an arbitrator's finding that results when consensual arbitration has been in place, is that correct?"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,938.957,942.742,"--We would not have that degree of finality to the arbitration, no, Your Honor."
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,962.572,966.19,Do any of the other briefs expand on the question that Justice Souter asked you?
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,972.428,980.182,My recollection is that the only one that has anything to say about it was the National Education Association.
1997.97-428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,980.182,991.223,"And of course, there, at least as I remember the case, the dues are a lot lower, so the amount in dispute sometimes was just pennies on these small amounts, and it might be that it's just not worth litigating, whereas here it seems to be a little more money at stake."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,991.223,1003.697,"It's a little more money, Your Honor, but in every case the amount of money tends to be relatively small, certainly in relation to the income of the fee-payer."
1997.97-428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.803,1014.755,Is it typical for union dues to be calculated as a percentage of the income of the union member?
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1014.755,1015.521,"--Yes, I think it is, Your Honor."
1997.97-428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1015.521,1016.04,It is typical?
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1016.04,1016.473,Yes.
1997.97-428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1022.694,1030.717,"When the suit is brought, is it brought under 1983, or another statute that gives the prevailing party attorney's fees, if the suit goes to the Federal court?"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1030.717,1032.583,--If the suit goes to the Federal court--
1997.97-428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1032.583,1032.883,Yes.
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1032.883,1035.769,"--I suppose there is provision for attorney's fees, under 1983."
1997.97-428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1035.769,1036.453,Because... Is it 1983?
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1036.453,1041.905,"19... I'm not sure I understand what you're... if you're asking, is this case under 1983, the answer is no."
1997.97-428,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1041.905,1050.944,"But the union members... I mean, the nonunion members' case in court would be under 1983."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1050.944,1059.134,"No, it would not, Your Honor, not in the... well, not in the case of a private sector, because we are not a governmental entity."
1997.97-428,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1059.134,1059.434,Right.
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1059.434,1061.236,We cannot be sued under 1983.
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1063.854,1066.89,"Well, then--"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1066.89,1072.727,"--In the public sector the cases are brought under 1983, perhaps because they're usually brought against the State employer as well."
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1072.727,1074.91,--What's the basis of any sort of Federal--
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1074.91,1076.944,Federal question jurisdiction.
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1076.944,1081.046,--There will be Federal question jurisdiction in a case of a private employer?
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1081.046,1088.569,"That's right, Your Honor, because the obligation here is derived from the Railway Labor Act."
1997.97-428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1088.569,1095.64,"But no attorney's... no attorney's fees under the general Federal question jurisdiction, then?"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1095.64,1097.592,It's general Federal question jurisdiction.
1997.97-428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1097.592,1100.56,But that doesn't provide for attorney's fees for the prevailing party.
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1100.56,1101.01,"No, it does not."
1997.97-428,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1101.01,1105.364,Can you... you might want to elaborate a little bit--
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1105.364,1106.048,Yes.
1997.97-428,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1106.048,1108.316,--if you'd like on the question the Chief Justice asked.
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1110.283,1110.75,On the--
1997.97-428,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1110.75,1140.704,"--Because it seemed to me that the real objection on the other side, what they're upset about in part is that they see the union has a right to the 2,000, but it doesn't have a right to the part of the 2,000 that might go to nongermane expenditure, and then we decide, and this Court decides in Hudson that really the union can go and spend what it wants as long as it gives them, a dissenter a fair chance to see how much of that is being spent on nongermane things, and it says you have to have an escrow."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1140.704,1141.254,--Correct.
1997.97-428,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1141.254,1148.458,"You have to give them a list of what the expenditures were, and you have to provide for a decision by an independent decisionmaker."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1176.044,1176.36,"I appreciate that, Your Honor."
1997.97-428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1213.983,1228.243,"Well, under your theory that the procedure has to be expeditious and efficient, what would prevent a court from saying that the usual rules of presumptive correctness should not be applied?"

1997.97-428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1234.631,1235.297,"Well, but I mean, we're testing your theory."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1241.551,1271.487,"--Well, I would just suggest, Your Honor, that that would be inconsistent with this body of law, because this is statutory law, and the Court has some jurisdiction, we don't deny that, ultimately to adjudicate the rights of the parties here, but... and just to finish the standard of review as we had proposed it to the lower courts, we would say that the legal issues, which really I think are the key issues here, is, for example, in our case the issue of the chargeability of our safety activity."
1997.97-428,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1294.169,1294.835,Mr. Anker--
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1294.835,1295.235,Yes.
1997.97-428,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1295.235,1301.489,"--everything that you've said sounds logical, sensible, a regime that might be legislated."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1342.65,1343.935,"Well, that's correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1361.128,1364.247,"But with the union, Mr. Anker, there was a constitutional problem."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1364.247,1365.515,"In that case, yes, right."
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1365.515,1367.031,"Yes, and there isn't here."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1390.713,1394.515,"No, not constitutional rights, that's correct, Your Honor, but they are rights, nonetheless."
1997.97-428,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1441.663,1449.602,"Yes, but the answer to that may be to, in effect to... in effect to rethink the need for the arbitration, or the legitimacy of it."
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1488.127,1492.531,"Oh, I... no, Your Honor, it isn't, but the Court has set up--"
1997.97-428,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1492.531,1504.672,"So you would be... would you be happy to have us go in that direction and say we really did not think things through properly in Hudson, in fact it will be for the Federal court to provide the speedy hearing?"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1504.672,1505.972,--Instead of arbitration?
1997.97-428,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1505.972,1506.306,Yes.
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1506.306,1513.694,"I think that would certainly be much better than the situation with having to deal with both of them, that's correct."
1997.97-428,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1526.585,1541.179,"What is your experience, again, if you can tell me, with requests to have one or the other proceeding, either the arbitration or the judicial proceeding, stayed if the other one has already gotten underway?"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1541.179,1543.047,"Well, there was such a request in this case."
1997.97-428,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1545.347,1549.45,"Do you know across the board, again in a broader spectrum of cases--"
1997.97-428,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1549.45,1550.8,"I don't know of any other case, Your Honor."
1997.97-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.068,1554.185,"--Very well, Mr. Anker."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1556.035,1560.189,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1587.573,1598.964,"But isn't it also true that there was no case that, before Hudson, that said there had to be an impartial decision, impartial... what did we call it, impartial person who would verify these expenditures."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1600.98,1620.128,"As Chief Justice Rehnquist pointed out, that requirement is a matter of First Amendment due process, and it has to be imposed on the union if it's going to be able to exercise its statutory privilege of collecting the service fee, which in itself infringes on the First Amendment rights--"
1997.97-428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1620.128,1639.874,"No, but would not it have complied with, literally at least, with the Hudson opinion if, instead of using the American Arbitration Association, they had just said we've got all these figures here, we'll submit them to Price Waterhouse, or Young & Young, or whatever, some independent auditors and said you... you're independent, you verify these figures and let the minority members know what you think of them."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1641.991,1643.409,"--No, Your Honor, because--"
1997.97-428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1643.409,1644.159,Why not?
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1644.159,1647.611,--ALPA selects the--
1997.97-428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.611,1650.897,They have to select a person that everyone would agree is impartial.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1650.897,1664.49,"--And Number 2, the court of appeals here held that that independent auditor does not audit the lawfulness of the allocation of the expenses between chargeable and nonchargeable."
1997.97-428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1667.542,1690.557,"That's what this auditor does, but I'm asking whether, just starting from scratch, instead of setting up an arbitration procedure, suppose if they thought they'd comply with the language of Hudson to just say, we'll get an independent accounting firm to verify all the figures and decide which ones are germane and which ones are not, and we'll publish it in the report and make it available to the... to everybody, the members and the union officers."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1702.115,1704.198,"I'll agree with that, Your Honor."
1997.97-428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1704.198,1704.648,Yes.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1704.648,1715.354,"What I don't agree with, Justice Stevenson, is that it does not... that Hudson did require some form of impartial decisionmaker procedure to be made available--"
1997.97-428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1715.354,1716.104,"Correct, and it in effect said--"
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1716.104,1717.221,--primarily... if I may--
1997.97-428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1717.221,1723.275,"--It in effect said, and your cause of action would not be ripe until that has been made available for everybody to look at."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1723.275,1728.846,"--Well, the cause of action, Your Honor, is ripe at the time the funds are taken."
1997.97-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1765.952,1768.721,"We did require a hearing, though."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1768.721,1770.59,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1770.59,1779.862,"You don't accept that a Price, Waterhouse review and then just a statement issued by Price, Waterhouse saying we have audited all of this and these statements are correct, that that would suffice."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1779.862,1782.314,"No, I don't, Justice Scalia, because that's not a hearing."
1997.97-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.314,1783.081,Under the language of our opinion--
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1783.081,1783.698,That's not a hearing.
1997.97-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1783.698,1784.35,--it did require it.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1784.35,1785.766,It's not an absolute--
1997.97-428,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1785.766,1786.616,I didn't think that was the point.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1805.993,1807.279,--Hudson requires that.
1997.97-428,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1807.279,1808.512,If they do it in a timely way.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1808.512,1809.645,Hudson requires that that--
1997.97-428,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1809.645,1809.979,"Fine, and it also--"
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1809.979,1811.397,--be done before the money is collected.
1997.97-428,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1811.397,1826.491,"--Exactly, and then Hudson also requires that the union should have a shot... I mean, they have to run their union, and they can't have five people going to five differing courts which could... or five different decisionmakers all putting them under different, you know, conflicting obligations."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1857.193,1880.392,"What's wrong with that, Your Honor, is that the individual employee has a cause of action which has been given to him by Congress, and this Court has never, never held that exhaustion is required where there is not one of two situations, one, either an agreement to arbitrate, or a statutory administrative scheme involving deference to another branch of Government, and that is not this case."
1997.97-428,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.392,1886.445,"This, I think... and I'm curious about your view of this, and that's why I was pushing it... is not classical arbitration."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1942.882,1944.484,I'm not quite sure I--
1997.97-428,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1944.484,1958.66,"--I'm saying, that they're trying to say that within this statute, give us a chance before the judge goes ahead to do certain things that might resolve this in order to prevent us the union from being placed under potentially conflicting obligations."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1981.173,1982.525,--Justice Breyer--
1997.97-428,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1982.525,1986.894,"That's what I took out of this, and maybe I'm being... you don't have to answer if you don't want to, but I mean, I'm trying to--"
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1986.894,1988.263,"--Justice Breyer, my clients--"
1997.97-428,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1988.263,1988.613,--Yes.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1988.613,1996.535,"--And the typical dissident in the case where I have represented clients, and I've represented dissidents in many places, including the Lehnert case which this Court decided."
1997.97-428,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2033.392,2043.599,Does the American Association... American Arbitration Association which Mr. Anker says has set up these... do they require that members of those panels be trained in the law?
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2043.599,2058.609,"I don't know the answer to that question, Your Honor, but I can answer one question, and that is, if you look at the law review article by Mr. Malin, who was... one of his articles was cited by ALPA in one of its amici."
1997.97-428,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2083.139,2090.71,"Mr. LeJeunesse, you're essentially saying as far as you're concerned your clients, thanks but no thanks to Hudson, that... I mean, you really didn't want any of this."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2092.079,2106.07,"--Clients, nonmembers who are lucky enough to have an attorney represent them are going to say no thanks to this particular arbitration procedure, or this particular decisionmaking process."
1997.97-428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2160.307,2164.859,You can't say it's inconceivable when Justice White and Chief Justice Burger both said that's what it meant.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2166.46,2167.86,"--They conceived of it, that's correct."
1997.97-428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2167.86,2168.576,So it was not inconceivable.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2168.576,2169.06,"That's correct, Justice Stevens."
1997.97-428,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2174.78,2175.982,They didn't say one way or the other.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2177.466,2184.505,"--Well, I think the majority suggested the contrary at several points in its decision."
1997.97-428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2201.634,2215.857,"--What we said in footnote 20 was that we reject the union's suggestion that the availability of ordinary judicial remedies is sufficient, and this was... we were insisting that the... we were imposing obligations on the union, and the union lost that case 100 percent."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2215.857,2240.009,"--That's correct, Justice Stevens, and what the Court was doing there, as the Chief Justice has suggested, was providing a shield for the protection of employee rights, not giving the union a sword to take another right away from the employee, which is the right of immediate access to the Federal courts guaranteed to them by Article III of the Constitution and the right to redress of grievances under First Amendment--"
1997.97-428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2240.009,2240.825,May I ask you this question.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2249.797,2251.73,"--No, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1997.97-428,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2256.934,2261.338,How does Article III give anybody access to courts?
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2261.338,2272.028,Article III says that where Congress has granted jurisdiction to the courts the litigation has a right to bring his case into court.
1997.97-428,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2272.028,2278.115,"Well, I'd be interested in seeing exactly what provision of Article III you're quoting, because I've looked at it often and I--"
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2278.115,2283.9,"I was referring, Your Honor, to what this Court said--"
1997.97-428,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2283.9,2285.252,"--Well, I'm not talking about what this Court said."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2287.471,2306.198,"--Article III places the determination of Federal causes of action in Article III judges, and this Court has held that that means that a litigant has a right to have his Federal cause of action determined by an Article III judge, and those--"
1997.97-428,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2306.198,2308.55,But not in reliance on Article III.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2308.55,2309.716,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-428,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2342.187,2344.703,"Well, that's not saying that it's... Article III requires that."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2359.78,2360.78,"Certainly, Your Honor--"
1997.97-428,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2360.78,2361.03,--so let's get back to it.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2361.03,2362.732,--and the central theme of the case--
1997.97-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2362.732,2364.248,While we're in that mode--
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2380.341,2381.025,"--That's correct, Justice Stevens."
1997.97-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2381.025,2381.626,--still going on.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2381.626,2394.434,But as this Court said in both Patsy and later in Felder v. Casey the court does not have discretion to simply require exhaustion out of questions of practicality or judicial efficiency.
1997.97-428,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2394.434,2395.45,I notice the--
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2395.45,2397.302,It has to be consistent with congressional intent.
1997.97-428,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2397.302,2403.956,--I notice the one... I've been trying to think of an example of compelled arbitration without statutory authority.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2417.55,2418.816,"I'm not familiar with that, Your Honor."
1997.97-428,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2418.816,2430.421,"Is... imagine on this early dispute resolution, which is common now, but the... suppose that the union... what I want to try to find out is how you do you think this is going to work?"
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2484.591,2489.912,"Justice Breyer, your example points out the need for both systems."
1997.97-428,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2517.395,2517.879,All right.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2517.879,2519.062,--give him due process.
1997.97-428,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2519.062,2521.347,"So they say, we can tell you how this works out perfectly."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2553.253,2562.341,"It's an argument that doesn't hold water, Your Honor, because in any event there are going to be conflicting decisions from different courts, different arbitrations."
1997.97-428,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2572.447,2575.649,"Well, can the multidistrict litigation scheme solve that?"
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2576.949,2577.449,"Yes, it could, Your Honor."
1997.97-428,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2577.449,2581.317,"So that would eliminate the conflict, at least among courts, wouldn't it?"
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2581.317,2591.792,"But in either event you're going to have a decision by an arbitrator and then a decision by the court, whether it's sequential or--"
1997.97-428,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2591.792,2597.077,If the court reviews the arbitrator the court has the last word.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2613.388,2614.172,"--No, I don't think so, Your Honor."
1997.97-428,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2663.419,2669.156,"Well, I suppose Hudson was probably beyond the contemplation of Congress."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2690.819,2692.771,"Two questions, Your Honor."
1997.97-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2750.791,2758.261,"Mr.... is it clear to begin with that Hudson applies in your situation, where it is not the State--"
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2758.261,2760.93,"Yes, it is clear."
1997.97-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2760.93,2764.617,--that is depriving these workers of their First Amendment rights?
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2764.617,2786.948,"It's clear in this case for two reasons, Justice Scalia, first because this Court held in Hanson in 1956 that the Railway Labor Act authorization of agency shop agreements is governmental action, Federal governmental action, and so constitutional limitations do apply, and--"
1997.97-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2786.948,2790.566,"Well, but so then the Federal Government should set up the arbitration scheme."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2814.598,2818.567,"--You're making one of the points that I wanted to make, Your Honor, is that ALPA's in the wrong place."
1997.97-428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2833.06,2833.627,"Yes, but isn't that--"
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2833.627,2850.121,"--which doesn't have the discretion to impose exhaustion simply as a matter of practicalities unless it is consistent with congressional intent, and there are two aspects in which this requirement is inconsistent with congressional intent."
1997.97-428,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2887.979,2906.691,"--Mr. LeJeunesse, one of the things that you said about why you don't like this, you said there's no discovery, and I was trying to understand what the complaint is that you come to court with when you don't have any arbitration in the picture."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2923.152,2925.052,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2940.698,2941.264,"Wait, wait."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2945.716,2946.435,--That--
1997.97-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2946.435,2951.387,Don't you have to plead that you have reason to believe that the union is expending--
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2951.387,2955.006,--How is the nonmember to have reason?
1997.97-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2957.458,2958.743,"--Well, he does under Hudson."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,2958.743,2959.91,They're solely in the possession of the union.
1997.97-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2959.91,2961.112,He does under Hudson.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3000.903,3012.544,"I return Your Honor to the principle that this Court has followed consistently, which is that you cannot just as a matter of judicial discretion require exhaustion unless--"
1997.97-428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3012.544,3014.644,But it's not exhaustion.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3030.956,3034.873,"--Your Honor, he doesn't have the facts, because the notice that the... Hudson requires--"
1997.97-428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3034.873,3038.075,He has the union's version of the facts verified by an independent appraisal.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3042.96,3043.643,"--I'm not sure I understand you, Justice Stevens."
1997.97-428,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3050.816,3066.059,"--How does it work when a union official complains that the employer... not... sorry, when an employee thinks the employer is trying to censor him or something, or he thinks that the employer should have given him an excuse... it's related to his religion or something."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3069.661,3072.38,But they've agreed to go through the grievance procedure.
1997.97-428,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3075.165,3075.599,"Oh, I see."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3075.599,3076.866,--relationship with their employer.
1997.97-428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3148.63,3149.796,"May I ask one other question, though?"
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3159.437,3161.67,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
1997.97-428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3161.67,3161.953,Yes.
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3161.953,3185.033,"And I'm talking here about the pilots who have an attorney, who want to go to court to get a judicial determination with an Article III judge in a proceeding where they have the right to discovery, where they can compel the production of witnesses, where the proceeding is truly adversary and they can get that judicial determination of their... what we're talking about here after all is Federal statutory and constitutional rights."
1997.97-428,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3185.033,3193.739,"It really is an extraordinary claim, that you just come into the court and say, I think they drew the line in the wrong place."
1997.97-428,1,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3217.104,3245.607,"Justice Ginsburg, it's a truly extraordinary statutory privilege that the unions have to compel nonmembers to pay these dues, and this Court held in Hudson that First Amendment due process and fundamental fairness, which means it's also a matter of the duty of fair representation, require the union to make available a procedure which is a shield to protect the employee's rights."
1997.97-428,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3245.607,3247.223,"Thank you, Mr. LaJeunesse."
1997.97-428,2,28884,jerry_d_anker,,3249.392,3251.677,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.97-428,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3304.146,3307.848,"But one was... certainly Republic Steel was consensual, was it not?"
1997.97-428,2,28884,jerry_d_anker,,3307.848,3318.488,"Well, Your Honor, one could say that on the facts of Republic Steel, but the interesting thing about the case is, when you read it, that was not the principal reliance of the Court at all."
1997.97-428,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3321.607,3325.475,"Yes, but another... it seems another defect in your suggestion is that this is not a remedy."
1997.97-428,2,28884,jerry_d_anker,,3334.331,3338.05,"Well, I agree it doesn't bind him, Your Honor--"
1997.97-428,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3338.05,3340.402,Which most remedies do.
1997.97-428,2,28884,jerry_d_anker,,3340.402,3348.572,"--It's maybe just simply a semantic issue between us, but it's a remedy in the sense that it's a way in which he might get what he's looking for."
1997.97-428,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3370.171,3374.539,"What's another typical exhaustion case that you're talking about, Mr. Anker, other than Maddox?"
1997.97-428,2,28884,jerry_d_anker,,3374.539,3378.86,"Well, any kind of an exhaustion of administrative remedies."
1997.97-428,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3378.86,3380.077,But those are governmental remedies.
1997.97-428,2,28884,jerry_d_anker,,3380.077,3385.097,"They are governmental remedies, but they're nonjudicial remedies, and even where the statute doesn't require--"
1997.97-428,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3385.097,3390.882,But the typical reason for exhausting judicial administrative remedies is to get the view of the administrator.
1997.97-428,2,28884,jerry_d_anker,,3398.155,3402.106,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, you're making two points."
1997.97-428,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3443.6,3444.885,"Thank you, Mr. Anker."
