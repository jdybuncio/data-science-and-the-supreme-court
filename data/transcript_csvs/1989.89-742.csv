1989.89-742,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,"We'll hear argument next in Number 89-742, James A. Collins, Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice v. Carroll F. Youngblood."
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,15.51,19.045,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-742,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,135.337,140.257,But do you argue that this claim is barred by Teague v. Lane?
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,140.257,145.644,"Your Honor, we have not briefed that issue, and we have not chosen to rely on it."
1989.89-742,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,154.75,159.57,Do you understand Teague to be a jurisdictional rule or is it something you can waive?
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,159.57,164.706,"I understand it to be jurisdictional, Your Honor."
1989.89-742,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,187.137,200.814,"Mr. Palmer, you know, in the opinion, even in Calder against Bull, and you find in a couple other of our opinions, they do lay down... like Beazell, for example... they do lay down these three general principles that you have adverted to."
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,206.718,218.609,"Well, there are decisions of this Court that contain language to the effect that changes which are procedural in nature may violate the clause if they affect substantial personal rights."
1989.89-742,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,278.314,285.301,Although clearly the right to jury trial did not apply to the states at that time.
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,285.301,287.103,"--That's what I am saying, Your Honor."
1989.89-742,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.991,299.578,So a change in jury size meets the ex post facto test?
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,299.578,310.202,"Well, in the sense that the jury size question in that case was thought to be inherent in the constitutional right to trial by jury."
1989.89-742,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,390.487,395.189,"What was the absolute defense that the defendant was deprived of in Kring, did you say?"
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,395.189,403.645,"Well, Your Honor, the Court itself has not interpreted Kring consistently since that time."
1989.89-742,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,437.635,442.687,"That reasoning really doesn't hold up under the later cases, the reasoning that the Kring court used, does it?"
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,442.687,444.589,"I think it is quite questionable, Your Honor."
1989.89-742,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,452.228,469.689,Would you explain why the right of the defendant to a reversal of his conviction or having it set aside and to get a new trial is not a substantial personal right under the former Texas law?
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,469.689,480.378,"Well, Your Honor, to the extent that this so-called right existed under Texas law, I suggest the Court should defer to the Texas court's interpretation of that law."
1989.89-742,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,498.507,504.261,And so why isn't that a substantial right of the defendant to get a new trial?
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,504.261,511.433,"--Well, Your Honor, what I am suggesting to the Court is that it was not only not a substantial right, it was no right at all."
1989.89-742,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,527.209,534.465,"Well, certainly under prior Texas law this sentence would have been set aside and the defendant would have had a new trial."
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,535.715,538.167,"--That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-742,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,538.167,543.571,And the defendant presumably could have gone to court to make sure that happened.
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,543.571,545.071,"He could, Your Honor, but--"
1989.89-742,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,545.071,549.991,Based on the lack of power of the state court to remedy it.
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,549.991,551.259,"--That is true, Your Honor."
1989.89-742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,601.074,605.478,"Well, the, under the old law the conviction would just be set aside."
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,607.928,608.53,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,617.786,622.755,"I know, but he has been convicted and illegally sentenced."
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,624.357,624.973,He--
1989.89-742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.973,632.462,"And the appellate court says this is an illegal sentence, and his conviction is hereby set aside."
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,632.462,633.178,--That is correct.
1989.89-742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,633.178,634.328,And you get a new trial.
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,648.555,655.411,"Well, Your Honor, it fits none of the categories of Calder."
1989.89-742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.315,662.715,"Well, it certainly affects punishment."
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,668.052,668.786,--He may not be.
1989.89-742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,668.786,676.657,"And at the very least, he is not going to be punished for quite a... until quite a bit later."
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,676.657,682.978,"Well, that turns, I suppose, on whether or not he is freed on bond pending the retrial."
1989.89-742,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,682.978,690.232,"And please correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that he is not liable for a greater sentence either, under the Pierce case, under--"
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,690.232,690.834,"No, Your Honor--"
1989.89-742,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,690.834,691.817,--under double jeopardy.
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,694.369,695.903,"--No, Your Honor, that is not correct."
1989.89-742,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,716.132,730.726,"And Texas takes the position that after an appeal the defendant can be subject to a greater sentence than he originally received, without any showing of new evidence shaping the sentencers' determination?"
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,730.726,731.709,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,757.026,767.917,"Under Texas law, if the... under the old law you vacate the sentence and remand for a new trial, and it ran... the jury would have sentenced in the next trial."
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,767.917,769.384,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,769.384,781.142,"He wasn't exposed to any greater... I mean the limits of the sentence would be the same, but the jury might, the second jury might not impose the same sentence as the first jury."
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,781.142,782.125,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1989.89-742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,782.125,783.927,And it might be greater?
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,783.927,784.844,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1989.89-742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.844,788.248,Yes.
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,788.248,799.87,Youngblood relies on language in Weaver v. Graham to the effect that an ex post facto law is one that is retrospective and disadvantages the defendant.
1989.89-742,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,873.887,876.637,In this case how could he be punished more severely?
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,879.674,882.49,"In this case he could not, but if his--"
1989.89-742,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,882.49,884.926,But in this case he could not.
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,884.926,889.696,"--But in similar cases he could, Your Honor."
1989.89-742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,894.332,896.7,He might get less.
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,896.7,899.986,"He might get less, he might get more, he might get acquitted."
1989.89-742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,899.986,906.825,"Exactly, exactly."
1989.89-742,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,906.825,916.763,"We would suggest to the Court that, as the Federal government has, the case that is most analogous to this is Mallett v. North Carolina."
1989.89-742,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,975.886,978.004,"Thank you, Mr. Palmer."
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,983.075,986.11,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1039.243,1045.732,"Can it fairly be described as void when rendered, after the legislature has said that it is subject to appellate reformation?"
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1045.732,1053.552,--I would say it is void in the sense that in the Bogany decision Georgia said it was void at its inception.
1989.89-742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1061.325,1068.062,"Well, then the legislature comes along, as I understand it, and says the appellate courts can reform a sentence like that."
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1068.062,1071.264,"That is what the legislature is intending to do, yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1071.264,1074.416,"And there was no problem with that under Texas law, was there?"
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1078.954,1085.023,The majority of the court and the Ex parte Johnson case agreed that that was okay.
1989.89-742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1153.752,1166.511,"Well, then, but that really doesn't offer the Court any standard at all, Mr. Farrar, to say we have these three categories that are rather easily identifiable, and then anything else that is manifestly unjust or oppressive."
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1171.396,1176.617,I would use a response written by Justice Stone in Beazell v. Ohio.
1989.89-742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1191.843,1198.983,"But what... what... how does the phrase substantial personal right really help us, other than say it's a matter of degree."
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1209.754,1223.431,"I think you need to look at whether utilizing the standards of the Court in a few of the more recent cases such as Weaver v. Graham and in Miller v. Florida, the Court indicated that we are trying to determine whether the new statute is more onerous."
1989.89-742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1225.216,1226.616,"Is more onerous, you say?"
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1226.616,1229.168,The new statute is more onerous than the old statute.
1989.89-742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1257.085,1275.483,"Well, supposing it is... supposing there is a change in the rules of evidence, so that between the time the act was done and the time the fellow is tried the rules of evidence are more liberal, and critical evidence comes in because the state has expanded its hearsay rule, evidence perhaps without which he wouldn't have been convicted."
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1278.868,1282.969,"The... it depends on how the statute is written, Your Honor."
1989.89-742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1302.233,1304.6,"Well, let's say it is applied evenhandedly."
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1320.345,1324.38,"--Again, the attitude that I have is that if the statute is neutral on its face, it is fine."
1989.89-742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1325.998,1326.981,No problem there.
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1330.033,1351.631,"Again, I want to focus on the idea that you have here that the cases that this Court has ruled were okay to apply retrospectively and were not ex post facto had the basic elements that they were neutral on their face, they were applied evenhandedly to all the parties, and if there was a harm, it was simply on a case by case basis."
1989.89-742,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1399.214,1412.437,"Mr. Farrar, under the Dobbert case, changes in sentencing procedures that don't increase the quantum of punishment are not thought to be ex post facto laws."
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1415.073,1428.531,"I think the way I would distinguish Dobbert from the other two cases is that if the changes on their face are beneficial, or the Court uses the term ""ameliorative"", then the statute is okay."
1989.89-742,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1438.939,1445.576,"Well, here the legislature is trying to eliminate the portion of the sentence that is unlawful."
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1445.576,1449.479,"That is, of course, the argument that the state has taken."
1989.89-742,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1493.573,1508.685,"If we disagree with you and think that what the defendant here was seeking was basically a new rule, is the claim barred under Teague against Lane?"
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1508.685,1511.387,I would have to say basically the same thing that the state has.
1989.89-742,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1584.483,1585.351,Mr. Farrar--
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1585.351,1586.601,xxx fixed that all this was fundamental.
1989.89-742,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1586.601,1596.807,"--Mr. Farrar, in deciding whether something is ex post facto, I guess you have to decide what the relevant point of time is."
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1656.031,1669.839,What seems strange in this case is that the court of criminal appeals in Bogany determined after the respondent was actually convicted that this type of right existed.
1989.89-742,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1713.384,1719.522,"Where a procedure does not exist, antecedently you have a right not to have that procedure."
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1751.743,1761.032,--I would not interpret the focus of the Bogany case in that light.
1989.89-742,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1814.566,1820.57,"May I ask this question, your opponent and you have been asked about the application of Teague to the whole... this whole problem."
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1834.647,1842.419,"The particular error involved here was first recognized in Bogany, and in that sense certainly it is new law."
1989.89-742,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1847.205,1849.407,"And of course, they have since applied it retroactively."
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1855.326,1856.643,That is correct.
1989.89-742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1938.714,1966.15,"But under the theory that you and Justice Scalia were discussing a moment ago, might not someone on your side argue that the defendant had a vested right in seeing that there was no procedure for the state to appeal to the Supreme Court of North Carolina, since it never had that before, and it is a benefit to the defendant not to have the state have the right to appeal."
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,1966.15,1973.638,"That is what I was getting at basically, but I do not feel like it would be a deprivation of the rights of the defendant."
1989.89-742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2002.423,2006.042,"Also, the superior court reversed the conviction, didn't it?"
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,2006.042,2006.709,That is again--
1989.89-742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.709,2016.832,"And at the time of his... under the law when he... when he committed the offense, he would have had a new trial."
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,2016.832,2017.782,--That is correct.
1989.89-742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2017.782,2027.705,"And the new law was that the state, there wouldn't be a new trial, the state could appeal and maybe have the conviction reinstated."
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,2027.705,2028.474,That is correct.
1989.89-742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2029.574,2031.942,That is not a substantial right?
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,2031.942,2033.878,"--Again, I have focused on--"
1989.89-742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2033.878,2037.33,"He had a right to a new trial, which has been taken away from him."
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,2037.33,2044.15,"--What I think the Court has focussed on in its past decisions, though, is what rights were defined on the face of the statute."
1989.89-742,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2271.865,2277.619,"May I ask if the first time it was decided they could get their conviction, it was in the Johnson case, wasn't it?"
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,2277.619,2280.388,"--Johnson was the first case that applied Article 37.10(b), that is correct."
1989.89-742,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2280.388,2285.958,What if the day before Johnson was decided this legislation had been passed?
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,2299.116,2302.067,"I would say it would be ex post facto, and--"
1989.89-742,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2302.067,2305.455,Even though we wouldn't... never would know how Johnson was going to be decided?
1989.89-742,1,30379,jon_r_farrar,,2307.338,2307.688,--Certainly.
1989.89-742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2441.66,2443.527,"Thank you, Mr. Farrar."
1989.89-742,2,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2446.046,2450.683,"Very briefly, Your Honor."
1989.89-742,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2599.296,2600.296,"Thank you, Mr. Palmer."
