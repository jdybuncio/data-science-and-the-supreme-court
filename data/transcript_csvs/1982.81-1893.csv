1982.81-1893,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.764,"Mr. Mayfield, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,9.371,12.292,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1893,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,367.101,372.084,"Mr. Mayfield, is the phrase"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,379.847,387.452,"It is, Your Honor, in the sense that it does not literally mean what it says."
1982.81-1893,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,422.235,425.267,"And, that was by referendum, wasn't it?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,425.267,428.419,"Initiative, yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1893,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,428.419,431.825,I mean it was referendum... it was not debated or anything?
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,431.825,435.261,"Yes, Your Honor, there was--"
1982.81-1893,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,435.261,437.651,"Well, it was not debated in the legislature?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,437.651,439.323,"--No, Your Honor, not in the legislature."
1982.81-1893,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,439.323,447.554,Is there any possibility of parole for a person who is sentenced to life without possibility of parole?
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,447.554,449.13,"Yes, Your Honor, there is."
1982.81-1893,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,449.13,450.646,He can be paroled?
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,450.646,460.704,He can be paroled because of the statutory and constitutional provisions for the governor to commute his sentence.
1982.81-1893,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,460.704,463.189,Is the commutation by the governor considered a parole?
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,463.189,466.405,The governor can commute the sentence--
1982.81-1893,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,466.405,467.342,Can the governor put him on parole?
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,467.342,469.981,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1893,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,469.981,476.854,"So, that the life sentence without possibility of parole is really accurate, isn't it, because he cannot be paroled?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,476.854,479.556,"No, Your Honor, it is not accurate."
1982.81-1893,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,479.556,483.836,"Parole is quite different from the commutation of the sentence, is it not?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,483.836,485.304,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1893,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,493.738,497.346,It may just be commuted to a sentence of life imprisonment?
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,497.346,498.268,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1893,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,502.109,506.264,In which event the parole would be a possibility?
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,506.264,507.311,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1893,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,525.085,532.503,"Incidentally, did I understand you to say that a death sentence, too, may be commuted by the governor to a parole?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,532.503,540.765,"--It may be commuted by the governor to a sentence, life without possibility of parole, or--"
1982.81-1893,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,540.765,542.109,Life sentence?
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,542.109,543.92,"--Yes, that is correct."
1982.81-1893,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,543.92,549.542,"So, in the latter instance, he also could be admitted to parole?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,549.542,550.23,That is correct.
1982.81-1893,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,550.23,565.021,Is there any difference between the governor's considering commutation or life without parole in a death penalty if both done the same way by the governor?
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,565.021,569.114,Not necessarily--
1982.81-1893,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,569.114,571.472,I mean are there different standards or criteria or anything?
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,571.472,574.721,--The governor can set his own criteria.
1982.81-1893,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,626.871,639.194,"Mr. Mayfield, did the Supreme Court of California in its analysis of the federal constitutional question differentiate between the first and the second sentence of the so-called Briggs instruction?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,639.194,641.615,"No, Your Honor--"
1982.81-1893,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,641.615,646.098,"The reason I... Let me read you the first sentence, which you are doubtless very familiar with."
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,662.14,664.404,--That is correct.
1982.81-1893,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,664.404,667.279,Did the Supreme Court of California feel that instruction was misleading?
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,667.279,669.793,No.
1982.81-1893,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,686.692,690.174,"Well, the instruction has two sentences in it."
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,695.532,714.368,--I believe the California Supreme Court objects to the entire instruction because of the view that any part of the instruction puts an extraneous factor into the jury's consideration.
1982.81-1893,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,714.368,722.958,"So, you think its holding extends to holding the first sentence of the instruction unconstitutional on federal constitutional grounds?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,722.958,724.271,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe so."
1982.81-1893,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,724.271,734.61,"So, you get the same result if the instruction said, the governor may commute any sentence, including a sentence of death?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,734.61,738.358,"I believe so, yes."
1982.81-1893,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,738.358,741.201,"That is essentially what the instruction says, doesn't it?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,741.201,744.419,The first part of the instruction does not differentiate.
1982.81-1893,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,744.419,748.215,"The governor can commute anything, including a death sentence?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,748.215,751.026,Yes.
1982.81-1893,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1015.012,1021.4,"Was that earlier decision you were referring to, Mr. Mayfield, based on federal constitutional grounds?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,1021.4,1032.036,"--No, that was based on the view of what it was a good idea to tell--"
1982.81-1893,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1032.036,1036.613,What the highest court of any state might do in reviewing jury instructions given in that state?
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,1036.613,1065.054,"--Yes, but this was not based on federal constitutional grounds because the rationale for that was they said that if you tell a jury that someone else might change their death penalty decision, that may lessen their sense of responsibility for this awesome thing they are going to do in imposing the death penalty."
1982.81-1893,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1089.185,1091.434,"Mr. Mayfield, may I ask you a question?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,1105.695,1134.76,"At page 4, I believe, of the Opposition to the Petition for Certiorari, the counsel, I believe, set forth a list over a period of some years... there have been 41 death sentences commuted and 24 life without parole during that period."
1982.81-1893,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1134.76,1136.963,In what period was that in?
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,1136.963,1142.929,I cannot tell you... I do not recall the exact--
1982.81-1893,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1142.929,1144.96,Twenty four over some several year period?
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,1144.96,1146.725,"--Yes, a period of quite a number of years."
1982.81-1893,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.725,1158.658,"In your view, would the defendant be entitled to have the judge tell that to the jury that this possibility had actually occurred only 24 times in the past 20 years or whatever the figure is?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,1158.658,1167.981,"I do not believe so, Your Honor, because I do not think that tells very much."
1982.81-1893,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1167.981,1171.276,"Well, but doesn't it tell more than Briggs instruction tells?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,1171.276,1183.365,"It does, but I think perhaps expansion would, in fact, invite speculation."
1982.81-1893,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1206.371,1224.88,"But, Mr. Mayfield, supposing your 24 examples are 24 out of 24,000... I don't know how many sentences this kind of put in effect... but if in 99 and 99/100 percent of the cases, it is, in fact, life without the possibility of parole, how misleading is it?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,1224.88,1249.573,"--It would not be misleading, but the fact remains that the possibility of commutation for life without possibility of parole remains... it isn't... you didn't get commuted now so you are all through."
1982.81-1893,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1254.118,1257.882,"Well, I suppose, you might tell them about the possibility of escape, then, too?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,1257.882,1263.005,Well--
1982.81-1893,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1263.005,1264.192,"I mean it is equally frequent, isn't it?"
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,1264.192,1268.223,"--I think not, Your Honor."
1982.81-1893,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1368.961,1375.006,How many other cases are likely to be affected by a decision in this case?
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,1375.006,1376.334,I do not know the exact number.
1982.81-1893,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1377.271,1381.363,Somewhere in the record I had seen a figure of 90.
1982.81-1893,0,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,1386.846,1393.624,"That was the number of cases, I believe, that had been perhaps tried under the--"
1982.81-1893,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1393.624,1396.045,1978 statute?
1982.81-1893,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1415.24,1422.112,Mr. Hendon.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1422.112,1428.062,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1893,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1445.368,1447.821,I misunderstood your first statement.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1447.821,1453.209,"--Well, there is no other statute like it."
1982.81-1893,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1475.544,1478.59,"Well, that may be true, but on state grounds--"
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1478.59,1479.465,"--No, I think--"
1982.81-1893,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.465,1482.384,--Is this supervisory or federal grounds?
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1482.384,1486.633,"--Well, many of them are cases which precede this Court's decisions in Furman."
1982.81-1893,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1512.701,1514.388,Are all 26 of those cases capital cases?
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1514.388,1516.153,"No, they are not."
1982.81-1893,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1532.71,1534.304,Does it make a difference where the trial is bifurcated?
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1534.304,1542.517,"Well, only to the extent that it may be more prejudicial for a jury in a unitary proceeding to hear about it."
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1549.359,1558.418,"Mr. Hendon, you said that there were some twenty-odd state cases involving instructions like this, were they perfect counterparts to the California instruction?"
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1560.777,1572.365,"Yes, they are even more fair than the California instruction because our contention is that the California instruction in its present form is misleading because it involves partial disclosure--"
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.365,1576.083,Do you think the first part of the first sentence is misleading?
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1576.083,1580.939,"--Yes, Your Honor, I do because I do not frankly read it the same way you do."
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1594.324,1599.167,"But certainly the use of the article, a, is a very indefinite article."
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1599.167,1607.226,A is... my grammar is not what it should be... but I think it is a definite... I think it is a particular sentence.
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1616.879,1628.514,What is the federal... what is the reasoning of the state courts who have held... how many did you say there were... who have held this invalid on federal constitutional grounds?
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1628.514,1683.055,"I think if you examine the reasoning behind the state court decisions, they go off on grounds which are ultimately federal constitutional grounds, though they may have preceded Furman so that they are not couched in constitutional terms, but the logic and the reasoning is that the issue of commutation, even when the issue of commutation is put before the jury... even when a jury is told that governor can commute both life without parole sentence and the death sentence, which this instruction does not do... but when the issue is put before the jury even-handedly, that injects a level of speculation into the jury's sentencing phase which renders any decision it may return unreliable and which diverts it from its primary task, which is after all what?"
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.725,1693.926,How many of the state decisions are expressly couched in federal constitutional terms?
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1693.926,1694.877,Of the recent ones--
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1694.877,1696.221,Of all of them.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1697.407,1701.484,--I can think of three off-hand.
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1777.969,1782.655,What was the inception of this constitutional... this initiative.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1786.668,1813.955,"Yes, I think that the purpose of this initiative was to overrule the case of People v. Morse, which told the jury... What the case of People v. Morse did was to tell the jury, look, you may speculate about issues such as parole or commutation, and I, the judge, will tell you about parole and commutation so that you will know what the truth is, and so that you will not speculate."
1982.81-1893,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1829.449,1831.619,You are going a little bit too far.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1849.597,1853.252,"No, my only position is--"
1982.81-1893,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1853.252,1854.658,You do not have to go that far--
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1854.658,1855.268,--No I don't.
1982.81-1893,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1856.705,1857.767,--That is all I am trying to get to.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1857.767,1858.531,--Yes.
1982.81-1893,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1866.826,1873.855,"Well, shouldn't the question then be asked at voir dire, do you know about this... anybody who knows about it should be off the jury?"
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1873.855,1883.882,"--You see, the way the states... the issue on which the state split is not whether a jury can know about commutation."
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1919.961,1927.49,You think a federal constitution may require a rule that says even though we tell you something you cannot consider what we are telling you?
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1927.49,1947.637,"I think the federal constitution requires that there be an assurance that a jury in a capital case does not predicate its decision on unreliable, speculative information which deflects from its constitutionally mandated task, and yes, I think that--"
1982.81-1893,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1947.637,1948.356,Mr. Hendon--
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1948.356,1955.151,--Why wouldn't it be permissible to inform them about it so that they do not speculate about it.
1982.81-1893,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1959.446,1972.143,"--Perhaps you have already answered this, but... if so, I missed it... would you be here if the instruction also covered the capital punishment?"
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1972.143,1973.579,Yes.
1982.81-1893,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1973.579,1978.188,Why?
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1978.188,1990.058,"Because in that event, which is a question that the Court need not reach in this case, but in that event the issue of commutation would still be before the jury."
1982.81-1893,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.095,2021.498,"Well, would you be satisfied if the... if any reference to commutation were eliminated from the instructions?"
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2021.498,2022.123,"Yes, I would."
1982.81-1893,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.138,2030.448,Even though jurors who know about this power are not told not to consider it?
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2030.448,2035.68,"--Well, the state law is and--"
1982.81-1893,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2035.68,2040.304,So part of your submission is not that there must be an instruction not to consider?
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2040.304,2045.973,"--No, only that if there is one, some steps must be taken to make sure that it is not being considered by the jury."
1982.81-1893,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.985,2061.545,"If you... if this instruction went on and said exactly... if this instruction were the same except you had appendent to it, but you should not consider this?"
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2066.667,2069.01,--Well I am not going to make that--
1982.81-1893,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.01,2074.445,Well you might be here on some other case.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2074.445,2074.726,--That is right.
1982.81-1893,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2074.726,2078.148,"Maybe you have know choice, you are the Respondent any way."
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2078.148,2083.364,"No, I would have a much more difficult argument."
1982.81-1893,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2289.578,2296.794,Do you really think you can generalize that way about what motivates governors to exercise the commutation power?
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2314.881,2317.722,"Well, I think that makes my point, with all due respect."
1982.81-1893,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2324.392,2331.639,Johnson... Andrew Johnson and Governor Rockefeller of Arkansas certainly did purely political--
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2331.639,2332.653,Yes.
1982.81-1893,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2332.653,2339.182,--That does not mean that commutations generally are based on political considerations.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2339.182,2340.776,"No, they may not be, but they can be."
1982.81-1893,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2352.661,2354.411,You are still not correct.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2367.719,2375.745,"--Well, what I mean by political... Historically... perhaps I am not using the word correctly... historically--"
1982.81-1893,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2375.745,2376.308,Nonjudicial.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2376.308,2385.117,--Nonjudicial... Historically the power of commutation stems from the power of the sovereign to dispense grace.
1982.81-1893,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2387.429,2390.286,For political reasons or any other reasons.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2390.286,2392.567,"--Any other reasons that he saw fit, yes."
1982.81-1893,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2395.004,2401.579,Maybe this has happened because the governor has conscientious objections to the death penalty per se.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2401.579,2402.735,--Absolutely.
1982.81-1893,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2402.735,2405.953,Very likely it is true with the Arkansas situation.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2405.953,2406.969,Absolutely.
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2423.132,2433.551,No no is asking the jury to apply a standardless arbitrary... You are just being told as a juror that there is such a standardless arbitrary factor in existence.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2433.551,2439.033,--This statute puts the issue of commutation before the jury for its consideration.
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2439.033,2446.499,But it does not ask the jury to commute or exercise political judgment to assess the penalty.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2446.499,2452.09,"No, but it puts it before the jury as a factor for the jury's consideration."
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2452.09,2453.605,But it is a fact.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2453.605,2456.964,"Yes, but how does a jury account for that fact?"
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2456.964,2460.057,How do they account for lots of facts that they find?
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2461.103,2479.627,"But this is a classic instance in which you are going to have two juries with different views of when a governor, perhaps as yet an unelected governor, is going to exercise the power of commutation coming back with different verdicts in cases which would otherwise be the same--"
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2479.627,2487.124,"How about a jury considering as some death penalty statutes allow, the possibility of rehabilitation of this particular defendant?"
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2491.232,2494.465,"--Well, but it is a factor that is tied to the defendant in the case."
1982.81-1893,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2513.379,2529.248,"Isn't it entirely possible that if some of the members of the jury have their civics courses within ten years before the time of their jury service, they will remember that governors have that kind of commutation power."
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2541.649,2545.631,It is possible that jurors would know about commutation.
1982.81-1893,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2547.522,2552.285,Isn't it very likely that some of them will know out of 12 members of the jury?
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2552.285,2557.799,"Yes, I would say that it might be likely that some of them would know about it."
1982.81-1893,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2561.641,2564.858,As they might know that he could commute the death penalty.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2564.858,2566.638,--They might.
1982.81-1893,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2566.638,2570.512,This is why I still do not understand why you draw a line between the two.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2588.943,2599.75,Because if the jury thinks about... what is going to go on in the mind of a juror when he or she thinks about the power of the governor to commute the death sentence?
1982.81-1893,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2625.74,2627.334,"It simply balances the situation, doesn't it?"
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2627.334,2630.147,"--No, it eliminates that defect, yes."
1982.81-1893,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2641.658,2644.453,"Of course, then you run into the Chief Justice's question."
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2650.278,2651.042,"--No, you cannot."
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2661.102,2689.217,"But, given these various imponderables such as jurors knowing it from civics class or perhaps having voted for or against this particular initiative, wouldn't it be fair to say that the state ought to be entitled to the very wide latitude in making decisions as to what kind of facts go before the jury and what do not... that it is not simply only one particular set of instructions which pass constitutional muster?"
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2689.217,2692.807,"No, I agree with that, and I do not contend otherwise."
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2712.175,2716.892,"Well, what if they said everything but the last... everything but, you are not to consider?"
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2716.892,2721.094,"Well, then I think the presumption has got to be that they are considering it."
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2721.094,2722.312,Supposing it is.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2724.202,2753.862,"Because there is no way that a jury can factor that in to its decision in a way which satisfies the repeated injunction of this Court's cases since Furman, that the state must take extraordinary measures... I believe was Justice O'Connor's language in Eddings... must go to extraordinary measures in order to ensure that death sentences are not returned on the basis of arbitrariness, caprice, or mistake."
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2753.862,2777.258,"Well, do you think it is less likely that a jury given this instruction will return an arbitrary verdict than if a jury which is given no instruction, goes out to the jury room... three of the people voted for this initiative, four of them voted against it, two others know something about the commutation part, they probably each have a somewhat different perception about it... and the jury argues about it in that context?"
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2777.258,2795.875,"Your Honor, that is not that this case... You are posing to me the situation... as I understand your question... you are posing to me the situation where the choice is between an instruction, which tells them about it and tells them to disregard it or this instruction."
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2795.875,2800.859,"No, I am posing no instruction, which I think is what you were posing."
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2800.859,2805.544,"No, I am saying that no instruction may pass constitutional muster."
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2805.544,2824.802,"It seems to me you are putting the state courts at power to instruct in these cases in a very narrow bind under the federal constitution, given the fact that courts are constantly wondering, will the jurors probably already know this, should I instruct on it, should I not?"
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2835.484,2843.7,"No, I think the federal constitution makes very clear the nature and quality of the information that can go before a sentencer in a capital case."
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2967.744,2969.306,Did the defendant request an instruction like that?
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2969.306,2972.881,State law prohibited the defendant from requesting--
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2972.881,2979.394,"Well, wasn't it possible after the enactment of this initiative that a reasonable lawyer might think that state law would change in that regard?"
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2979.394,2984.659,--I do not know what the federal constitutional significance of that reasonable possibility is.
1982.81-1893,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2987.782,2992.624,"Well, ordinarily you cannot complain about the failure to give an instruction which you did not request."
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,3001.433,3011.211,"--Well, I think, if I take the thrust of your question correctly, what you are really talking about is a procedural default, in essence object at trial."
1982.81-1893,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3159.026,3163.228,Did that just go to the... what did it go to?
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,3163.228,3167.881,"--It went to the penalty phase... strictly to penalty, yes."
1982.81-1893,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3204.79,3208.225,Suppose we agreed with you.
1982.81-1893,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,3209.053,3235.325,"--Well, the two options that this Court's cases have followed in that situation is either to dismiss the Writ as having been improvidently granted, or to vacate the opinion of the California Supreme Court and remand for a determination of whether the violation of California evidence law, standing by itself would... and apart from any consideration, federal constitutional considerations... would require reversal of the penalty."
1982.81-1893,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3235.325,3238.884,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Mayfield?"
1982.81-1893,2,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,3238.884,3240.134,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1893,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3426.606,3429.589,What you want to say is that the sentence is not true?
1982.81-1893,2,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,3429.589,3432.151,That is correct as it--
1982.81-1893,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3432.151,3437.445,"Well, is a statute that is not true a valid statute?"
1982.81-1893,2,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,3437.445,3461.232,"--I am not saying that the sentence is... I am saying that there is a possibility of parole, and I am saying, yes, the statute is valid and particularly if jurors are made aware of the fact of what this alternative sentence is."
1982.81-1893,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3475.774,3479.475,May I go back to the jurisdictional point for a moment?
1982.81-1893,2,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,3493.516,3494.266,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1893,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3494.266,3502.528,"Now, and your view is, even though that is a matter of state law... an error of state law... it would presumably be harmless error, is that your thought?"
1982.81-1893,2,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,3507.339,3519.176,What I am saying is that the reason it was found to be erroneous... the California Supreme Court said it was this instruction--
1982.81-1893,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3519.176,3522.3,Because the instruction emphasized the fact that the sentence might be commuted?
1982.81-1893,2,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,3522.3,3533.312,"--Since this instruction permitted this evidence to be introduced, it found that the mere mention--"
1982.81-1893,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3533.312,3536.654,"Well, but I am not quite clear on what your response is."
1982.81-1893,2,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,3565.612,3582.886,--My response to that is that the error they found on state law grounds was error because of the conclusion that the instruction regarding the possibility of parole was erroneous on federal constitutional grounds.
1982.81-1893,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3582.886,3589.228,"Well, that may be true, but it is still ultimately a state law ground as to the erroneously admitted evidence, isn't it?"
1982.81-1893,2,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,3589.228,3590.836,"No, Your Honor, it is not."
1982.81-1893,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3590.836,3591.211,"Oh, I see--"
1982.81-1893,2,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,3591.211,3605.111,Because it is... the only reason... the reason it was erroneously admitted was because of the ruling on the federal constitutional error.
1982.81-1893,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3605.111,3609.734,--You are not suggesting that it would have been harmless error?
1982.81-1893,2,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,3611.077,3629.742,I am suggesting that on state law... if it is strictly state law grounds... then under the state law the California Supreme Court would have to examine the evidence and determine that a miscarriage of justice occurred.
1982.81-1893,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3629.742,3651.046,"If this were remanded as your colleague suggests, or if we ruled that there is an adequate independent state ground, I take it that would be on the basis there was going to be a new trial."
1982.81-1893,2,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,3662.525,3662.9,Yes--
1982.81-1893,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3662.9,3671.553,"And, if the new trial went forward and the state lost, the federal issue would be foreclosed, I suppose."
1982.81-1893,2,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,3671.553,3673.631,--That is correct.
1982.81-1893,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3683.002,3695.559,"You say that without the federal constitutional ruling which you say is erroneous, the state would never... the state court would never have made this evidentiary rule."
1982.81-1893,2,27638,harley_d_mayfield,,3695.559,3698.418,--I do not go that far.
1982.81-1893,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3711.318,3713.787,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
