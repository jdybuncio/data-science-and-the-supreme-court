2000.99-1613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.782,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-1613, Robert Shaw v. Kevin Murphy."
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,18.406,21.408,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1613,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,38.735,51.705,There's some discussion in the briefs about the penalties that were imposed on the prisoner by virtue of his writing the letter that he wrote.
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,55.358,57.079,"--I don't believe they are, Your Honor."
2000.99-1613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,88.075,97.911,"Can we take it as a given that this was insolent language, because, you know, I'm somewhat dubious whether this was insolent language, but that's a given in this case?"
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,97.911,99.586,--We believe it's a given.
2000.99-1613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,107.263,108.441,He had the opportunity to contest that?
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,108.983,118.061,"--He did, Your Honor, and as I indicated to the question from Justice O'Connor, he has not sought expungement of that disciplinary infraction."
2000.99-1613,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,142.117,162.187,"--Mr. Ohler, may I ask if... at least I understood that the position of the United States is not the same as the one that you are telling us about, nothing else being at issue but the insolence and the other charge."
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,174.596,182.07,"That is the position of the United States, and that is a position that we disagree with."
2000.99-1613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,258.266,273.413,"Well, suppose you have a prison where, in a disciplinary proceeding, not a criminal charge but a disciplinary proceeding, one inmate, as the custom, often represents another."
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,298.794,311.734,"Well, in this case, and this case is an example, perhaps, of the hypothetical you pose, but Mr. Murphy had the opportunity in this case to communicate to the Inmate Tracy."
2000.99-1613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,323.528,327.499,"No, but my question is, does he have a right to send the communication?"
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,340.143,350.751,"--With respect to inmate-to-inmate communications it's our position, no, that there is no right for inmate-to-inmate communications."
2000.99-1613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,350.751,355.872,"Even when one inmate's representing another in, say, a grievance proceeding, or, pardon me, a disciplinary proceeding?"
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,355.872,362.747,"Not with respect to communication under the Turner opinion, Your Honor."
2000.99-1613,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,362.747,379.173,"Well, if... are you answering your question limited simply to sending letters, or are you saying that one inmate can be assigned to defend another, and the prison may preclude all communication between them of any sort whatsoever?"
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,379.977,381.372,"No, Your Honor, we're not saying that."
2000.99-1613,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,381.372,381.674,Okay.
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,381.674,382.127,No.
2000.99-1613,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,382.127,387.259,So you're limiting it simply to written... your answer to Justice Kennedy is limited simply to written statements?
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,387.259,387.63,Correct.
2000.99-1613,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,387.63,406.808,"And you take the position, then, that if an inmate were, by the prison, assigned to provide legal assistance to another prisoner, that no written communication could be sent from the one providing the assistance to the other prisoner?"
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,406.808,410.149,"Under Turner, I believe Turner can be read that way."
2000.99-1613,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,425.176,446.404,"What possible interest would the prison have in prohibiting... assuming you allowed an inmate to provide legal services to another, which sometimes I understand happens, what interest of the prison is there in making sure that it is never done in written form, which the prison can then read?"
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,446.404,452.385,"With respect to an inmate law clerk program, as occurred here--"
2000.99-1613,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,452.385,452.734,Yes.
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,452.734,457.359,"--we permitted, the prison permitted communications between--"
2000.99-1613,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,457.359,468.407,"But you just told me that you would not allow any written communication, even though a law clerk assignment had been made."
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,468.407,471.54,"--I'm sorry, I may have... I misspoke or misunderstood."
2000.99-1613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,496.532,500.423,"Well, you don't have to go that far in this case, nor do we."
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,529.462,531.53,"--That is correct, Justice Scalia."
2000.99-1613,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,531.53,541.262,"Well, I'm slightly mixed up, because I thought, suppose that Inmate A wants to represent Inmate B, but he isn't."
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,552.803,553.128,Correct.
2000.99-1613,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,553.128,554.785,But there's a different situation.
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,566.422,575.436,If we're going to term the communication that occurred here as representation--
2000.99-1613,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,575.436,577.108,"This has nothing to do with that, I thought."
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,582.41,583.876,"--That's correct, yes."
2000.99-1613,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,583.876,584.799,All right.
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,610.023,610.925,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1613,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,610.925,611.371,Okay.
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,632.904,639.165,"Your Honor, with respect to--"
2000.99-1613,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,639.165,641.173,Do you want to say we don't have to get into that here?
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,641.173,644.434,--I don't think we have to get into that.
2000.99-1613,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,682.16,701.703,"Would it have been the same offense, in your view, if the... was it Murphy, had sent the letter not to Tracy but to Tracy's assigned counsel?"
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,701.703,728.872,"That would be another matter and, in fact, that correspondence could have occurred, and the difference between that situation and the situation that's presented in this case is the correspondence that is going outside the prison, and so it's... the confrontational aspect of Inmate Murphy's letter is not the same, because it's being sent outside the prison."
2000.99-1613,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,728.872,731.741,Suppose it were sent to an investigative reporter?
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,731.741,735.991,That would have been fine.
2000.99-1613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,743.336,752.381,"Well, in both of Justice Ginsburg's hypotheticals, I assume the prison authorities would read the letter first, or am I wrong about that?"
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,756.302,756.874,No.
2000.99-1613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,760.885,761.744,Whether or not it's read.
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,763.058,773.509,"--It's only read if there's a reasonable probability to believe that it contains certain types of information that would be detrimental to the prison, so in most cases outgoing correspondence is not read."
2000.99-1613,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,773.509,777.183,What is the confrontation that you're talking about?
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,780.085,781.016,Well--
2000.99-1613,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,781.016,782.937,You spoke about confrontational aspect.
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,784.06,790.951,--The language contained in the letter was disparaging about Correctional Officer Galle.
2000.99-1613,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,790.951,791.515,Yes.
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,791.515,802.538,"And it was a challenge to the authority of Correctional Officer Galle in particular, but correctional staff in general, and it's that--"
2000.99-1613,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,802.538,809.165,"Well, it was a challenge to his exercise, or as the letter claimed, his abuse of authority."
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,809.165,822.055,"--Correct, and there were also other comments in there concerning his sexual orientation which this Court I believe in Thornburgh recognized as a security concern in the prison context."
2000.99-1613,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,822.055,822.436,Right.
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,830.18,831.063,No.
2000.99-1613,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,841.28,848.027,"Well, Officer Galle never saw the letter, could not have been, I take it, expected to see the letter."
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,852.595,862.812,"The problem is, we don't know what happens to the letter once it gets... assuming that the letter was transmitted to Inmate Tracy, that letter could have been--"
2000.99-1613,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,862.812,865.596,"Yes, but you're talking about the confrontational aspect of the letter."
2000.99-1613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.596,874.035,I thought you meant that it encourages the recipient to become confrontational with the guards.
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,874.035,875.453,"--It does that also, Your Honor."
2000.99-1613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,875.453,876.424,It does that also?
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,876.424,876.861,Yes.
2000.99-1613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,876.861,877.481,Oh.
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,901.501,912.237,"And that's one aspect of it, and that is a concern, is that in fact this particular inmate that the letter was sent to had just recently assaulted a correctional officer."
2000.99-1613,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,921.207,930.723,"More so than if his lawyer had told him, his lawyer said, I got this letter from a fellow inmate, what do you think of it, or if an investigative reporter asked him?"
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,935.523,940.708,"--There are... there still are concerns there, Justice--"
2000.99-1613,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,940.708,942.628,"You have no control over the lawyers, I take it."
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,942.628,943.152,--That's correct.
2000.99-1613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,943.152,945.001,You do have control over the prisoners.
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,945.001,945.605,That's correct.
2000.99-1613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.605,946.082,More or less.
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,946.082,947.006,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,951.279,952.761,"Very well, Mr. Ohler."
2000.99-1613,0,21320,david_l_ohler,,952.761,953.254,Thank you.
2000.99-1613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,953.254,954.751,"Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you."
2000.99-1613,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,954.751,969.62,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1613,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1028.243,1035.373,"Ms. Millett, will you clarify for us what the United States would remand?"
2000.99-1613,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1060.98,1067.392,The remand would be on an as-applied challenge to this particular communication.
2000.99-1613,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1086.296,1092.932,"But am I wrong, or was the petitioner wrong in suggesting that that had not been raised?"
2000.99-1613,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1092.932,1107.975,"--Well, our understanding is that what was not raised is whether or not this communication fell within the definition of insolence or violation of a due process, or interference with a due process hearing under the terms of the regulations, and that's not what we're saying should be remanded."
2000.99-1613,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1118.542,1120.383,Which would be based on that same thing.
2000.99-1613,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1127.744,1131.156,"No, you could have... prisons could have a regulation."
2000.99-1613,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1159.498,1173.313,"Are you suggesting that there are two levels of application of Turner, that even if a regulation on its face, so to speak, is valid under Turner, it could be invalid as applied?"
2000.99-1613,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1173.313,1204.152,"--Absolutely, and I think that's what... for example, in Thornburgh v. Abbott this Court upheld regulations as applied to the public generally... I'm sorry, not as applied, facially, the application of a prison regulation limiting the types of publications and magazines that could come into a prison, but remanded for as-applied review of whether publication by publication the prison's decision to keep a particular publication out violated the First Amendment, and that's all that we think the remand here would need to encompass."
2000.99-1613,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1208.146,1209.843,Did he raise that question below?
2000.99-1613,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1209.843,1226.746,"--That's our understanding of the complaint, and it's based in part on the magistrate judge's analysis which is in the petition appendix, where they talk about the failure of the State to come forward at that stage with information showing why this particular communication was a threat to security."
2000.99-1613,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1226.746,1227.629,"Well, I take it--"
2000.99-1613,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1227.629,1228.535,--So in your view there is--
2000.99-1613,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1228.535,1236.975,"--that is going to whether the regulation was violated, whether this particular communication was, indeed, insolence towards the guard."
2000.99-1613,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1243.258,1262.665,"Well, we understood that argument in the complaint, that analysis by the magistrate judge and respondent's, including respondent's arguments here about whether, you know, how this particular communication does or does not challenge security interests as an as-applied challenge, but we're not here because we have a strong interest on that."
2000.99-1613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1267.736,1280.212,"Is another way of saying what you're trying... maybe I don't quite get it, that even though he doesn't have a First Amendment right to act as a lawyer and practice law in the prison context, he had a First Amendment right to write this particular letter?"
2000.99-1613,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1280.212,1281.574,Yes.
2000.99-1613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1288.935,1290.773,"Right, but just under ordinary First Amendment review--"
2000.99-1613,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1290.773,1291.521,Exactly.
2000.99-1613,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1298.604,1302.089,--In your view there's a First Amendment right for prisoners to communicate with each other?
2000.99-1613,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1306.33,1314.138,"--Well, our position is that inmates could always claim that and then the burden would be on the prison to show in the circumstances that there is or is not."
2000.99-1613,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1320.08,1320.908,But that's a very substantial holding.
2000.99-1613,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1320.908,1321.345,Yes.
2000.99-1613,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1321.345,1326.506,You're asking us to have a foundational proposition that there's a First Amendment right for prisoners to communicate.
2000.99-1613,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1326.506,1327.564,We've never held that.
2000.99-1613,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1327.564,1351.102,"The... I think the premise of the recognition that you read would be reviewed under Turner v. Safley, and I think a regulation that said, prisoners shall never, under all circumstances shall never speak to another inmate, no inmate shall ever speak to another inmate, would have to be reviewed under Turner v. Safley, and the Government would have to come in and show why any communication at all between inmates is a threat to security."
2000.99-1613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1351.102,1367.854,"There's another point, too, that if the prison regulations do permit communication, there is still... there arguably could be a First Amendment right to say certain things in those communications without... in other words, they say, we'll let you write letters, but we're going to tell you exactly what you can say."
2000.99-1613,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1370.88,1373.271,I'm sorry if I misunderstood your question.
2000.99-1613,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1385.706,1388.52,"--Well, I thought this involved such a situation."
2000.99-1613,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1395.699,1396.119,--He was.
2000.99-1613,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1396.119,1408.482,And I had understood the prison did not permit communication from prisoners in other parts of the prison with lesser restrictions to prisoners in the maximum security.
2000.99-1613,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1409.214,1424.895,"Our understanding is that he was allowed to write a letter to this inmate, so there was not a complete ban on communication between people, inmates in respondent's category and this high risk, or this maximum security unit."
2000.99-1613,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1568.396,1569.511,"Thank you, Ms. Millett."
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,1573.09,1581.744,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1613,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1666.154,1682.161,"Well, I thought the Ninth Circuit articulated at least some freestanding First Amendment right of a fellow prisoner to offer legal advice to another prisoner."
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,1687.057,1692.264,I think that the language in the Ninth Circuit's opinion--
2000.99-1613,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1692.264,1695.102,Do you defend that as a proposition here?
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,1695.102,1709.874,"--Well, I would contend, Your Honor, that the Ninth Circuit was being somewhat circular when they said that the prison's emphasis is at a low edge, ebb when the language is legal advice."
2000.99-1613,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1710.47,1712.495,"--Well, do you contend... excuse me."
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,1721.531,1721.92,No.
2000.99-1613,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1722.796,1723.679,But that's the only--
2000.99-1613,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1723.679,1724.539,--The question presented.
2000.99-1613,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1724.539,1725.702,That's the question that was presented.
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,1730.929,1732.484,"That's not the end of the case, Your Honor."
2000.99-1613,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1737.731,1741.071,"Well, but I mean, this is the question that we're interested in."
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,1741.071,1745.448,"Yes, but this in my view is a straightforward Turner application."
2000.99-1613,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1745.448,1747.377,"Well, but do you have an answer?"
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,1763.776,1777.207,"I would agree with that, yes, but what we have here is, we have a communication permitted by the prison that contained information and contained legal advice, and Mr. Murphy was punished for what he said."
2000.99-1613,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1797.551,1807.243,"Mr. Renz, would you clarify... what we were told before was that you had waived all of that, that you were not contesting the disciplinary action that was taken against him."
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,1812.33,1813.979,I'm not sure--
2000.99-1613,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1813.979,1821.005,We were told that you were not contesting the disciplinary action that was taken.
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,1821.005,1827.489,"--If the question is whether we are seeking relief to purge the discipline, that's right."
2000.99-1613,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1827.489,1832.322,"Well then, what sort of relief are you seeking?"
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,1832.322,1841.127,"We're seeking declaratory relief, Your Honor, that says the prison may not do this without demonstrating some sort of connection between its interests and what it has done."
2000.99-1613,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1842.784,1845.438,But you said you're not challenging the punishment.
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,1857.169,1858.18,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-1613,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1858.18,1869.841,"Well, if you're not challenging that, then I don't understand what interest you have in an abstract statement of what the law should be in another case."
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,1869.841,1872.615,"Well, Mr. Murphy continues to be imprisoned."
2000.99-1613,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1880.844,1899.077,"But that's... I think what's bothering us is, we understand that there very well may properly be requests for declaratory relief of a general sort, but what you're seeking here apparently isn't declaratory relief as a general sort."
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,1923.219,1924.909,I think I understand the question.
2000.99-1613,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1940.789,1943.858,"Okay, but is... I'm sorry."
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,1969.505,1969.821,--I see.
2000.99-1613,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1969.821,1970.904,--even if we accept your position.
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,1970.904,1976.287,The... let me catch up.
2000.99-1613,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1996.9,2003.281,"Well, Mr. Renz, you say he wants to continue to say these words, but I take it you don't mean exactly these words."
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,2011.716,2013.382,--A letter like this.
2000.99-1613,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2033.486,2054.815,"Well, if you say that you're in agreement that there's no special right to render legal advice, then all this is is a question whether or not this communication, or other communications like them, can, for general purposes be suppressed, and the fact that he wants to give legal advice, he doesn't have a right to do that."
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,2054.815,2057.192,I think that's--
2000.99-1613,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2057.192,2065.237,I just don't know what... this is just a routine prison disciplinary case once you concede the main proposition on which we granted the case.
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,2065.237,2066.393,"--Well, he certainly has no special right."
2000.99-1613,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2093.869,2114.982,"Turner v. Safley dealt with a constitutional right, I mean, you know, the right to marry, and you know, rested on the proposition that it is settled that a prison inmate retains those constitutional rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner."
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,2127.506,2130.695,"Well, I disagree with your statement, Justice Scalia."
2000.99-1613,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.447,2143.147,Now you have me confused.
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,2152.423,2159.784,"As I understood Justice O'Connor's question, it was whether or not there was a special, sort of elevated right, and I would have to agree--"
2000.99-1613,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2159.784,2170.815,"A freestanding First Amendment right to represent another prisoner, and I thought you told me no, there is not, that you did not defend--"
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,2170.815,2171.372,--Then--
2000.99-1613,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2171.372,2174.122,--what it was the Ninth Circuit panel said.
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,2174.122,2177.781,"--Then, Justice O'Connor, I apologize, because I misunderstood your question."
2000.99-1613,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2179.255,2182.42,"Well, are you defending the Ninth Circuit, or are you not?"
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,2185.21,2186.444,--I'm prepared to defend it.
2000.99-1613,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2188.197,2195.319,"Let's rephrase that, because I read the question to you before and I thought I got a different answer."
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,2218.758,2229.613,"--I... as I construe it, I think it's a fair statement, and that is that were Mr. Murphy outside the prison, he would have an independent and freestanding right--"
2000.99-1613,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2229.613,2231.055,But he's inside the prison.
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,2231.055,2236.12,"--That's correct, and once he is inside the prison we then engage in the Turner analysis."
2000.99-1613,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2238.415,2239.251,I'm at a loss to--
2000.99-1613,2,32537,jeffrey_t_renz,,2239.251,2240.055,"--I'm at a loss, too."
2000.99-1613,3,21320,david_l_ohler,,2813.717,2820.073,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't have any rebuttal, but I would be happy to answer any questions."
2000.99-1613,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2820.073,2821.459,Would you respond to the last point?
2000.99-1613,3,21320,david_l_ohler,,2835.464,2840.711,I believe that he could have sought expungement of the disciplinary infraction.
2000.99-1613,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2840.711,2843.756,How would that proceed?
2000.99-1613,3,21320,david_l_ohler,,2853.03,2854.687,"He could have gone to the State court, yes."
2000.99-1613,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2854.687,2856.033,And what about Federal court?
2000.99-1613,3,21320,david_l_ohler,,2856.033,2860.58,"It seems to me that he could have raised that in this particular case, Your Honor."
2000.99-1613,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2860.58,2873.741,"What if he were now to go back to the district court and ask to amend the complaint and say, under my prayer for any other relief, or whatever the language is, I would like to have this order expunged from my record?"
2000.99-1613,3,21320,david_l_ohler,,2875.24,2883.007,"It seems to me it would be untimely, Your Honor, but I don't have a firm answer with respect to the law."
2000.99-1613,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2883.007,2884.864,"Thank you, Mr. Ohler."
