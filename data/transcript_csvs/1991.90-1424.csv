1991.90-1424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.618,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 90-1424, Manuel Lujan v. The Defenders of Wildlife."
1991.90-1424,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,9.657,14.282,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1424,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,140.223,146.106,"Mr. Kneedler, how does the citizens' suit provisions affect the standing inquiry?"
1991.90-1424,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,146.106,156.144,"In the first place, we think the citizen suit provision is inapplicable in this case because that refers to situations generally where persons alleged to be in violation of the act."
1991.90-1424,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.999,206.666,"Well, I guess it could, though, provide that abridgement of the right that Congress has given would constitute injury."
1991.90-1424,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,206.666,214.262,"--Well, what would be... to be sure, if the statute defines a statutory right and then says that a person may sue for a violation--"
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1500.762,1502.895,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1568.067,1582.297,"Did she say anything more specific about her plan to return than that, other than that she planned to... as I understand it from the Solicitor General, she said she did not have any definite plan to return."
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1583.428,1587.28,"She said, specifically, I can't return now because of the civil war."
1991.90-1424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1600.059,1604.239,"Well, she not only didn't have a plan ticket, she didn't have any plan, it sounds from that."
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1604.239,1608.233,"One of the deponents, Steven Schroer had a plane ticket, and had a passport."
1991.90-1424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1608.233,1612.126,"Well, did the Eighth Circuit grant him... grant your organization standing on his behalf?"
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1612.126,1612.927,"No, sir, they did not."
1991.90-1424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1612.927,1613.817,Did you cross-appeal?
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1613.817,1615.149,"No, we did not."
1991.90-1424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1615.149,1618.061,Then I don't think he can be involved in this case.
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1618.061,1624.355,I'd respectfully offer the following proposition: the Eighth Circuit sustained the organization's standing.
1991.90-1424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1630.947,1639.573,"So you say that you can invoke different persons who may have been deposed, since what we're talking about is organizational standing."
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1644.186,1645.239,"That's our position, Your Honor."
1991.90-1424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1660.746,1664.23,If you want to speak about Mr.... the gentleman you just spoke--
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1664.23,1675.717,"--Schroer was to visit a World Bank project, I believe in Thailand, and had a ticket to Thailand, and had a passport at the time of his deposition."
1991.90-1424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1675.717,1678.839,"--Well, but the World Bank isn't a United States agency."
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1678.839,1681.581,"No, but the Treasury Department funds the World Bank."
1991.90-1424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.736,1691.768,"Well, this sounds very much like the house that Jack built."
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1707.517,1709.97,We disagree that it is an interpretive regulation.
1991.90-1424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1720.237,1723.239,Does it still take that position?
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1723.239,1724.44,It doesn't before this Court.
1991.90-1424,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1749.885,1756.831,How could the Interior Department bind other agencies in this regard?
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1764.746,1772.271,The Interior Department is given authority in both sections 4 and 7 of the regulations to publish rules implementing the statute.
1991.90-1424,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1787.152,1800.589,"If the Interior Department had not issued these regulations, one of the points made by the Government is there's... there's nothing to show that the agencies, themselves, would not have adopted the position taken in the regulation."
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1800.589,1801.06,That's--
1991.90-1424,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1801.06,1804.123,"In which case they would not consult, in which case you'd have the same result you have here."
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1804.123,1806.834,--That's a correct statement.
1991.90-1424,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1806.834,1819.801,"Well, if that's a correct statement, then you haven't met one of the conditions for standing, is... which is that the injury you complain about would not occur if the relief you were given is accorded."
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1819.801,1820.522,What--
1991.90-1424,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1820.522,1826.475,"What you've just said is that whether the... whether the Secretary has this regulation out or not, it may well be that these agencies won't consult."
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1826.475,1827.307,"--Well, let me address that."
1991.90-1424,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1835.522,1836.123,Excuse me.
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1851.021,1857.817,--It gives... we are not required to address every aspect of our injury.
1991.90-1424,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.131,1902.625,"But you can attack that when somebody doesn't consult, goes ahead and funds a project."
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1931.555,1942.512,"--The initial reason that nobody consults today is that the service is not available, because the Secretary, by regulation, refuses to make it available."
1991.90-1424,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.512,1943.363,"Well, we don't know that."
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1954.21,1958.732,"Well, then you have a situation where you have the whole Government refusing to comply with the statute--"
1991.90-1424,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.732,1960.474,And you have a means of challenging that.
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,1964.906,1968.76,--I agree that we have that means of challenging the project.
1991.90-1424,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2026.335,2043.519,"But Lab says you can challenge a rule, but... in Abbott Labs, by striking down the rule, we would... we eliminated the obstacle that the plaintiffs were complaining about... namely, they thought that they could not issue these pharmaceuticals with these labels, because the Secretary had said if you do, you'll be prosecuted."
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,2067.762,2069.844,I hope I'm not wasting your time.
1991.90-1424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2077.299,2082.913,You're presuming that those agencies would disregard a decision of this Court interpreting that statute?
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,2082.913,2083.853,I said there was a chance.
1991.90-1424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2085.146,2089.418,"I don't think that's a reasonable presumption, is it, that the agencies would xx to follow our interpretation of the law?"
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,2089.418,2094.513,"The Justice... I would assume that, if this Court rules, that's the end of the subject."
1991.90-1424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2238.646,2241.21,"May I stop you there, for just a moment?"
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,2241.21,2242.039,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-1424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2242.039,2257.339,"Is the authority for that the guideline that's in pages 28 to 30 of the joint appendix, where they talked about the general parameters, that section 7 applies to activities and programs by Federal agencies affecting listed species in foreign countries and high seas?"
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,2257.339,2261.383,The guidelines were published before the 1977 and '78 regulations.
1991.90-1424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2261.383,2263.474,"But is that the language, basically, you're talking about?"
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,2263.474,2264.165,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-1424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.165,2265.234,Because... I have this question in reading it.
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,2286.107,2299.257,The '70... the regulations that went into effect in January of 1978 made clear that the protection of the act applied to species outside the United States.
1991.90-1424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.257,2299.808,"Right, I can see that."
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,2309.592,2310.954,I believe they would.
1991.90-1424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.954,2318.658,"And why do you... what is it that you say, in the prior guidelines, made it clear that the... that the project outside the United States was governed?"
1991.90-1424,1,17921,brian_b_oneill,,2318.658,2324.433,The regs... the 1978 regulations did make it clear that they were addressing projects outside the United States.
1991.90-1424,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3118.293,3120.075,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-1424,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3148.374,3154.496,"Yeah, but that doesn't... it doesn't reach the question of whether there's... they're bound to consult."
1991.90-1424,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3154.496,3158.731,"Well, but the... this is an interpretive regulation."
1991.90-1424,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3166.105,3180.364,"Your colleague on the other side said that at one time, the Secretary took the position that the agency is bound to consult, if he has a regulation that they have to consult."
1991.90-1424,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3182.507,3189.109,"No, the best evidence that they did not is the fact that respondents have not pointed to, and we are not aware of a single instance in which an... in which an agency--"
1991.90-1424,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3189.109,3192.922,So you did say that... you did say the Secretary has never taken that position.
1991.90-1424,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3192.922,3193.633,--Has never taken the position--
1991.90-1424,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3193.633,3195.754,"Well, that's with respect to foreign projects."
1991.90-1424,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3197.804,3198.725,--There's an obligation to consult.
1991.90-1424,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3199.517,3202.859,"--But isn't that equal... I mean, it just depends on the scope of the obligation."
1991.90-1424,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3205.361,3208.072,--The statutory duty is mandatory.
1991.90-1424,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3211.004,3213.987,"--But if the statute clearly applied to foreign projects, then there would be a mandatory duty to consult."
1991.90-1424,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3213.987,3219.229,"--Right, but that's not... that's different from saying the Secretary's interpretive regulation is binding on the agency."
1991.90-1424,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3222.913,3226.686,But would the... would this Secretary's interpretation of the statute be entitled to deference from other agencies?
1991.90-1424,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3226.686,3230.096,"Yes, it would be entitled to deference the same way as any others."
1991.90-1424,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3236.73,3242.154,"Do you agree with his reading that that regulation clearly applied to foreign projects, as well as species in foreign countries?"
1991.90-1424,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3242.154,3242.674,Yes.
