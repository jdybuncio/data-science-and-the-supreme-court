1994.93-1197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.67,"We'll hear argument now in Number 93-1197, Albert Hess and Charles F. Walsh v. the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,12.582,15.253,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-1197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,34.186,36.657,Why does one follow from the other?
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,49.307,55.381,The statute creating PATH gives it all the rights and immunities of the Port Authority.
1994.93-1197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,57.715,64.927,"But if a State created a corporation and gave it all the immunities of the State, it wouldn't necessarily follow that it would have immunity as a matter of Federal law."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,66.128,67.26,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,67.26,75.135,"So I'm not... so nothing turns, in your view, on the fact that this is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Port Authority?"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,75.135,90.805,"We believe that there is certainly a connection between the Port Authority and PATH that would in all probability permit this Court to find that if the Port Authority is entitled to the Eleventh Amendment immunity, it is likely that PATH is similarly, because their structure is very similar."
1994.93-1197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,90.805,94.008,"Then that's the analysis that we have to follow here, isn't it?"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,94.008,94.619,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,98.061,121.727,"But in any case, the terms of the corporate charter have nothing to do with our inquiry except insofar as it identifies the powers of the corporation and allows us to determine whether the corporation is equivalent to the Authority, and hence whether the Authority is equivalent to the State."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,121.727,122.478,That's correct.
1994.93-1197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,134.768,137.981,"But you don't think anything turns on that first inquiry, as I understand your brief."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,142.616,146.205,"--We do, because by statute it is considered the same."
1994.93-1197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,146.205,156.994,"But if it is the same, it's not because its charter says it's the same, it's because under straight Eleventh Amendment analysis it is the same."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,165.61,178.619,The only thing that at all is added is the fact that the discussion relating to the Port Authority in several instances will also apply to PATH because the same Compact is used in creating the rights and regulations with regard to both under State law.
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,178.619,179.591,Yes.
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,194.621,197.532,"Justice Scalia, I would agree with that."
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.898,274.683,"Let's take a similar internat... do you think that is enough just with those givens we can say it's not entitled to sovereign immunity, neither a State nor--"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,274.683,279.287,--A State or the functional equivalent of a State--
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,279.287,279.497,--Right.
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,279.497,280.847,--that would show the relationship between them.
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,281.397,287.422,"Right, nor can it act... can a State require its action."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,287.422,288.684,--That's critical--
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.684,288.854,Yes.
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,288.854,289.345,"--to the case, Your Honor."
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.345,313.4,"What about an international organization like OPEC, for example, an international organization of sovereigns to operate in one particular field, or what about something like a joint command of a military operation like a crusade in Europe, I mean, the unified forces?"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,313.4,318.336,"Justice Scalia, I would have to know how those international agencies are structured."
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.554,328.754,Really?
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,328.754,329.175,--we seek here.
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,329.175,333.038,You think OPEC is suable in American courts?
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,333.038,337.382,"Well, no, I don't think that OPEC is covered by the Eleventh Amendment at all."
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,338.654,348.51,"Well, I'm talking about sovereign immunity in the international sense, which has a lot of bearing upon what sovereign immunity in the Eleventh Amendment is."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,348.51,349.219,"Your Honor, I must be--"
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,349.219,352.802,"You see, I've always thought that an organization like OPEC surely is not suable."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,352.802,356.414,"--Your Honor, I would have to plead ignorance to OPEC, because I'm not certain as to their structure."
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,364.361,367.243,No individual nation can control it.
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,373.167,383.255,"--If the consent of all the States are necessary, then using an Eleventh Amendment analysis, I would contend that OPEC is not protected by the Eleventh Amendment or the analogous international law."
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.826,387.138,"I think you're wrong, but--"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,404.119,410.434,"--Well, we believe that this Court has indicated that the significant factor to look at is in fact what's been called the Treasury factors."
1994.93-1197,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,420.003,422.197,"Well, can we talk about that a little bit?"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,425.84,426.651,"That is not correct, Justice O'Connor."
1994.93-1197,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,461.316,463.287,"Even up to the $100,000?"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,463.287,464.799,"Even up to the $100,000."
1994.93-1197,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,464.799,469.12,What about the other side of the coin?
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,478.837,479.698,"No, it does not, Your Honor."
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,521.085,526.2,"But why should the fact that two States are involved, or two sovereigns are involved, eliminate sovereign immunity?"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,531.385,534.436,"--On its face, Your Honor, it certainly appears that way."
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,548.298,548.498,"Well, that's very true--"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,548.498,549.109,--can do so.
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,549.109,549.329,--but so what?
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,561.029,561.96,A tradition--
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,561.96,569.554,It seems to me that those standard conceptions of sovereign immunity extend to two sovereigns acting jointly just as they extend to a single sovereign.
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,569.554,584.103,"--By entering into this Federal system, Your Honors, the Founding States and all subsequent States have as part of the plan to the Convention, as part of the Compact Clause, changed their role with respect to interstate Compact entities."
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,609.782,624.352,"That's true, but why does that lead to the conclusion... that says they cannot act jointly without the approval of Congress, but why does it follow from that that when... moreover, which is what you're saying, when they do act jointly, they no longer have sovereign immunity the way they used to?"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,625.454,637.372,They don't have sovereign immunity any longer because the practical day-to-day realities of bi-State Compact entities is that the States cannot exercise their sovereign control over the entity.
1994.93-1197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,637.372,646.429,"Well, are you saying as a matter of law if there's a bi-State entity it does not have Eleventh Amendment immunity?"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,646.429,648.632,"No, Your... Mr. Chief Justice, I am not saying that."
1994.93-1197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,658.646,665.092,"You would apply no different test to a bi-State entity than to a single State entity, then."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,665.262,665.743,"--No, on the contrary."
1994.93-1197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,685.207,698.016,"--Well, in the Lake Country Estates there's certainly no suggestion, as I read the opinion, that the analysis is different because it's a bi-State entity rather than a single-State entity."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,698.016,713.447,"--I believe implicit in Lake Country is the underlying factor that this is a Compact Clause entity, and for that reason, the Court was not willing to extend the Eleventh Amendment protection any further than it did."
1994.93-1197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,713.447,726.484,"Well, the reason... I thought you had just said your main argument doesn't have to do with who controls, or it's bi-State, but it has to do with how this organiz... what it's operation is, how it pays for that operation."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,729.387,734.421,"That would be correct, but I believe the burden of proof is stronger with a multi-State entity."
1994.93-1197,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,795.941,803.776,"Well, I tried to ask you about whether the States would receive any surplus revenues, and you never really answered the question."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,804.157,804.377,I apologize.
1994.93-1197,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,804.377,805.318,--in a different direction.
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,805.318,806.808,The answer to that question--
1994.93-1197,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,806.808,811.253,"Now, it is possible that the States may receive surplus revenues under this scheme?"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,811.253,811.413,--It is possible.
1994.93-1197,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,811.413,817.718,And have there ever been years in which there were such revenues that the States shared?
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,817.718,827.755,"In response to the first question, yes, it is possible for the States, by cooperative decision of the legislatures and their Governors, to share the general revenue fund."
1994.93-1197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,858.516,865.328,"Well, then you're saying as a matter of law a bi-State entity cannot have Eleventh Amendment protection."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,871.512,878.097,"--Mr. Chief Justice, based on the current posture of this case, I agree, but I disagree with the conclusion."
1994.93-1197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,878.097,883.132,"Well, but you've agreed with several totally inconsistent propositions, it seems to me."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,893.558,894.74,"Let me give you an example, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.93-1197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,894.74,896.292,"Well, just tell me."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,896.292,903.679,My position is that any entity structured as the Port Authority is structured is not entitled to the protection of the Eleventh Amendment.
1994.93-1197,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,924.514,925.646,Isn't that kind of a silly approach?
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,935.325,946.692,"Well, Justice Stevens, we believe that's another argument supporting our position here, that in fact there's nothing in the Compact itself to indicate that the States intended to give Eleventh Amendment immunity to this entity."
1994.93-1197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,947.473,953.727,"What's the intent got to do... as I understand it, what Justice Stevens has suggested is not Eleventh Amendment immunity."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,961.313,963.374,--I believe that's true.
1994.93-1197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1000.563,1017.193,"Well, let me ask you... and I suppose this is just a theoretical question, but let's assume that in this case we were to find an intent on the part of the compacting parties, approved by Congress, to extend immunity to PATH."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,1020.726,1024.728,Let me make certain I understand the question.
1994.93-1197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1024.728,1040.017,"Because we took a case, as I understand it, to decide what the Eleventh Amendment provides, and I think you have agreed with me that whatever this immunity might be based on intent with congressional approval, it wouldn't necessarily be Eleventh Amendment immunity."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,1040.017,1061.693,"If this Court were to find that the parties... that the States specifically intended to confer some sort of sovereign immunity from suit in Federal court to this entity, and that Congress, understanding that intention, specifically and explicitly concurred with it, then I would agree that under Federal law, Article III jurisdiction would not vest in the Federal courts."
1994.93-1197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1061.693,1063.075,Then the Treasury factor isn't important at all.
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,1068.4,1076.455,"The Treasury factor is an extremely relevant, the most relevant factor in the analysis on the constitutional issue."
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1095.631,1099.364,It looks to the Treasury factors when there's any doubt whether you're suing the State.
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,1110.363,1112.103,"--None at all, Your Honor."
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1114.317,1118.346,"--Treasury or no Treasury, you can't sue a State agency as such."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,1118.346,1118.457,--That's right.
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.814,1131.186,"It's one factor, but don't make it the be-all and end-all."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,1136.552,1138.943,"Justice Scalia, let me address another factor, then."
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1246.296,1260.207,"--That all reduces back down to your basic argument that you have no sovereign immunity unless you are within the control of a single State, and that being within the control of two sovereign States suddenly eliminates sovereign immunity."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,1260.207,1276.338,The reason that eliminates sovereign immunity unless the statutory structure gives those individual States some independent control is because the purpose of extending sovereign immunity is because the agency is derivative of the sovereign.
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1285.454,1286.906,It's derivative of two sovereigns.
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,1297.224,1299.277,--Only if they had the authority to act and they can agree.
1994.93-1197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1299.277,1300.717,"Well, do you agree with that, counsel?"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,1305.842,1313.545,"Personally, I believe, Justice Kennedy, that two sovereigns are the equivalent of no sovereign with respect to a bi-State entity, because independently--"
1994.93-1197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1313.545,1313.775,"All right, so--"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,1313.775,1314.837,--they cannot exercise control.
1994.93-1197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1314.837,1327.166,"--and that's almost always the case with any State agency, so why isn't your argument that, sui generis, this is a category where no State, no Eleventh Amendment immunity can apply?"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,1327.166,1330.168,Because I don't believe that... let me rephrase that.
1994.93-1197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1355.956,1366.692,"Would you make a distinction between an entity that enriches the State by making... or makes its own money, so it doesn't deplete this Treasury."
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,1378.872,1381.146,May I say two things in response to that question?
1994.93-1197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1398.26,1399.968,"And if it did, would that account against your argument?"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,1409.816,1421.273,"--I believe that if the individual States had the authority to independently take money out of that surplus fund toward its own use, that would point in favor of Eleventh Amendment immunity."
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.296,1428.739,"And the fact that they can do it jointly by agreement with one another, we have to rule that out of accounting?"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,1428.739,1438.086,"--I believe there are several historical examples to show that the States often cannot agree, and therefore... the concept of sovereign--"
1994.93-1197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.086,1438.256,"Well, what do you do?"
1994.93-1197,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,1439.899,1444.249,"--Absolutely, but the concept of sovereign is that the sovereign has the power to do something."
1994.93-1197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1454.107,1455.689,"Very well, Mr. Katz."
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,1456.988,1464.385,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1654.146,1656.039,May I ask a background question?
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,1662.183,1662.263,Yes.
1994.93-1197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.64,1674.111,"Those were all... all those were New York and New Jersey cases, were they?"
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,1674.111,1674.662,"That's right, yes."
1994.93-1197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1674.662,1679.687,What did a person injured by the negligence of the Port Authority do during that period?
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,1680.388,1681.439,There was no remedy.
1994.93-1197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1690.824,1691.976,Resolutions passed by whom?
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,1691.976,1696.42,--By the Board of Commissioners of the Port Authority resolving the cases and providing for payment.
1994.93-1197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1696.42,1696.65,I see.
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,1696.65,1709.93,"And it's my understanding that a number of cases before they waived... a number of States before they waived sovereign immunity would deal with claims in a similar manner, until they created court of claims or decided to waive it through some tort claims act."
1994.93-1197,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1746.935,1754.409,"But how would that be different from the Bolden and the later cases involving Pennsylvania, just a one-State authority?"
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,1765.325,1779.075,"--In Bolden and other Third Circuit cases, the Third Circuit did focus on the fact that the Treasury factor was an important factor, but it made it quite clear it was not the only factor, and they applied a balance of those factors."
1994.93-1197,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1780.274,1801.76,"But they did say, did they not, that it was probably the most important factor, and they distinguished the Third Circuit... whose decision is before us for review... distinguished the Port Authority cases on the ground that the States really would come to the rescue of the Port Authority, that the State's credit really did stand behind that entity?"
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,1801.76,1816.548,"--That was part of the distinction that was made in Bolden to, I think it was the Southeast Pennsylvania Transit Authority in the Bolden case, that they focused on the fact that the States might step in in the case of the Port Authority, but I suggest that they also looked at other factors in Bolden."
1994.93-1197,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1905.539,1910.254,Do you want us to say that the Port Authority is an arm of the State of New York?
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,1910.254,1913.546,"Yes, I believe it is an arm of the State, of both New York and New Jersey."
1994.93-1197,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1913.546,1922.312,"Well, it seems it has a more autonomous existence than that when the State of New York has to go into court to sue it."
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,1922.312,1923.762,"Yes, Justice--"
1994.93-1197,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1923.762,1927.754,"To compel it to take action that it wishes, that New York wants."
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,1927.754,1939.254,"--Justice Kennedy, there are a number of cases such as that where the State Attorney General has lent his office and his name to injunctive actions that would award against the Port Authority, and that was one of them."
1994.93-1197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2003.418,2013.234,"But you're not saying that one may sue the Port Authority only by going to the Attorney General and having him bring the suit in your stead, are you?"
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2013.234,2020.93,--The cases have held that a suit for an injunction against the Port Authority may only be bought by the Attorney General of one of the States.
1994.93-1197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2020.93,2024.163,But a suit for damages is otherwise.
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2024.163,2025.463,A suit for damages is otherwise.
1994.93-1197,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2028.485,2033.58,"You mean, if the Port Authority were trespassing on my property, as a private property owner I couldn't obtain an injunction?"
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2033.58,2034.26,No.
1994.93-1197,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2049.414,2053.226,And does PATH have the same protection--
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2053.226,2053.438,"--Yes, it does."
1994.93-1197,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2053.438,2054.739,--that only the Attorney General can enjoin PATH?
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2054.739,2055.931,"Yes, it does."
1994.93-1197,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2070.152,2071.973,I thought PATH was created by the Compact.
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2072.603,2072.764,--No.
1994.93-1197,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2077.936,2080.748,"--Well, that... I mean, just saying it doesn't make it so."
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2106.958,2107.108,"Well, the--"
1994.93-1197,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2107.108,2113.744,So you have to convince us not only that the Port Authority but that PATH meets the test that you've been talking about.
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2113.744,2133.916,"--The... I believe that if we find that the Port Authority shares the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States, and it was created as such an agency... not necessarily with the intent, but because of its fundamental nature is an arm of the State, I believe it does follow that that subsidiary corporation, because it is established under the authority from the two States, would share in the immunity."
1994.93-1197,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2147.977,2149.357,I'm not sure you answered my question.
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2154.652,2157.256,--I think the functions are one of the criteria that has to be looked for.
1994.93-1197,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2158.578,2159.78,Then can you tell me--
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2168.725,2169.406,Exactly.
1994.93-1197,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2169.406,2171.547,The fact that the State says it is not controlling.
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2171.547,2181.355,"Well, the State's announcement is certainly strong evidence of the nature of the agency, but that alone does not, of course, grant a State agency Eleventh Amendment immunity."
1994.93-1197,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2188.371,2211.865,"Mr. Welsh, if it's the function that counts now, how does this PATH differ from the Pennsylvania... the Southeastern Pennsylvania, the New Jersey Transit, and why... explain to me rationally why PATH would get immunity that Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority didn't have in the Third Circuit's view and the New Jersey Transit rail operators didn't have."
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2211.865,2218.841,"To be perfectly honest, Justice Ginsburg, I have a great deal of difficulty understanding the Fitchik case involving New Jersey Transit."
1994.93-1197,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2250.563,2253.375,And in the other cases they were appointed by--
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2253.375,2255.546,--I'm not sure how they were appointed.
1994.93-1197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2282.897,2290.584,--May I ask a question about your... you earlier explained to us in injunctive actions that the citizen has to go to the Attorney General to bring the action.
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2291.836,2292.266,That's right.
1994.93-1197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2292.266,2300.654,"In a Federal... if there were a Federal question such as whether the authority had violated an environmental statute or something like that, would you contend the same procedure had to be followed?"
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2300.654,2301.235,"Yes, I do."
1994.93-1197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2301.235,2306.56,That the Federal court would not have jurisdiction of an individual's complaint unless the individual went to the--
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2306.56,2308.681,Unless we can find--
1994.93-1197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2308.681,2309.991,--Do you have any authority for that?
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2309.991,2314.585,"--No case on point, other than cases that involved other statutes."
1994.93-1197,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2324.509,2327.552,You can enjoin the officer acting on behalf of the authority--
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2327.552,2328.042,"--Yes, you can."
1994.93-1197,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2328.042,2329.575,--just as you can enjoin a State officer.
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2329.575,2343.666,"You can enjoin the State officer prospectively, and there are a number of cases involving grants-in-aid and the like, or a violation of civil rights, where you can seek an injunction against the officer barring their prospective action."
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2343.666,2345.329,You're talking about Federal actions.
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2345.329,2346.08,You may not bring the action for past damages.
1994.93-1197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2346.08,2350.073,"You're talking about Federal court actions now, but you couldn't do that in the State court, I don't suppose."
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2350.073,2351.225,"Well, there's a--"
1994.93-1197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2351.225,2356.871,"Your bar would apply to an action brought against an officer of PATH as well as PATH itself, wouldn't it?"
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2356.871,2362.534,--I suggest that there is a cause of action available against a State officer as opposed to the agency itself.
1994.93-1197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2362.534,2363.272,In State court?
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2363.272,2373.98,"In the State court, an action in lieu of prerogative writ, or in the State of New York, an Article 78 action would be available against the officer even though it would not be permitted against the State agency itself."
1994.93-1197,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2381.316,2383.787,"So why does anybody bother with the Attorney General, then?"
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2383.787,2387.379,"Frankly, I don't know."
1994.93-1197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2414.371,2417.112,"May I ask you one other question, since I've interrupted you already?"
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2429.929,2446.931,"--Well, if one remembers that the Eleventh Amendment immunity is a constitutional provision that protects the States... State or States, there's no reason to distinguish between the immunity that a State has, acting as one State, or if that one State chooses--"
1994.93-1197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.931,2450.592,"Except that in the Lake Country opinion we said there was, based on the plain language."
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2450.592,2474.578,"--Well, in Lake Country the Court looked at the Compact itself, and it found language in the Compact itself that it felt was a clear indication that it was... the States did not intend for this new agency that was created to have Eleventh Amendment immunity, and then it went on, I believe... I think... I believe it's page 401 of the Lake Country Estates."
1994.93-1197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2493.652,2499.636,So there's nothing in the Compact that would justify reading additional meaning into the limited language of the amendment.
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2500.767,2501.257,--Yes.
1994.93-1197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2505.981,2510.726,But you think there's something in this Compact that justifies a departure from a general rule that the Eleventh Amendment means what it says.
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2510.726,2525.225,"--I believe the general rule should be that in the absence of language, one should assume that the Eleventh Amendment does protect the agency if it is an agency of a nature that would make it an arm of the State for those purposes."
1994.93-1197,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2525.225,2544.168,"Mr. Welsh, I thought you were going to say that we've also had cases subsequent to Lake Country which say that the Eleventh Amendment means more than it says, that it is simply exemplary of a sovereign immunity which was assumed to exist even before the Eleventh Amendment was passed, and that--"
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2544.168,2544.389,Yes.
1994.93-1197,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2544.389,2547.52,--it simply addressed the most common instance of it.
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2547.52,2548.922,There have been cases--
1994.93-1197,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2548.922,2550.663,And that is all post Lake Country.
1994.93-1197,1,28331,hugh_h_welsh,,2550.663,2552.405,--And one of the recent cases--
1994.93-1197,2,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,3157.192,3169.369,"Justice Ginsburg, I'd like to begin by responding to one of your questions to Mr. Welsh concerning the difference between Fitchik, Bolden, and this case and Police Benevolent."
1994.93-1197,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3263.011,3275.81,"Mr. Katz, before you get off that question, why should it make a difference whether there is technically an obligation on the part of the State of New York and New Jersey to come to the assistance of a now-bankrupt Port Authority, or PATH?"
1994.93-1197,2,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,3284.035,3291.621,"Your Honor, I don't expect that the State of New York is going to let New York City go totally bankrupt, either, but New York City would not be entitled to the protection of the Eleventh Amendment."
1994.93-1197,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3301.049,3315.038,"Not... there are good reasons why New York would not be entitled to sovereign immunity, but I question whether the good reason is just simply the State of New York does not bear the expenses of the City of New York."
1994.93-1197,2,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,3315.038,3318.211,The State of New York and the State of New Jersey do not--
1994.93-1197,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3318.211,3338.894,"If in all other respects the unit in question is at a State level, is performing State functions, is governed by State officers, I don't know that it makes a whole lot of difference whether technically the funds come directly out of the Treasury or the functions are so important to the State that, as a practical matter, if the entity is bankrupt the State is going to have to reach into its pocket to support it."
1994.93-1197,2,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,3342.847,3344.519,"--Justice Scalia, let us actually look at the Port Authority."
1994.93-1197,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3366.506,3372.641,"They're subject to a veto in 10 days of anything that they do, which, of course, you know the councilmen from New York are not."
1994.93-1197,2,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,3372.641,3377.332,"--Subject to a veto, but if we presume that there are... we don't have to presume, it is true."
1994.93-1197,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3442.369,3443.912,"Thank you, Mr. Katz."
