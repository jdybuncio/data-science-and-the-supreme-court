2013.11-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.07,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-681, Harris v. Quinn."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,7.954,11.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.11-681,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,37.189,46.212,"I thought it was to negotiate -- or it's typically negotiated in collective bargaining; that is, wages, is that not so?"
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,48.081,58.437,--The subjects of bargaining here are the reimbursement rates given to the providers and the State now offers or pays money to the SEIU for a health benefit.
2013.11-681,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,62.906,68.41,But how does it differ from the typical bargaining that a union does?
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,82.218,83.237,Yes.
2013.11-681,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,99.497,119.41,"Is your argument dependent on this being sort of a dual employee situation, that it's reimbursement as opposed to policemen, fire -- police people, fire people, teachers, other public -- other public employees who are directly employed by the State?"
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,119.41,127.849,"That is our position for why Abood is distinguishable on that point, is that here the State is not the common law employer or the sole employer of these providers."
2013.11-681,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,134.187,136.705,"But your argument, of course, isn't limited to that."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,139.757,140.524,Yes.
2013.11-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,149.862,170.693,"Is there any likelihood that the union that represents these, what I call them healthcare workers, health providers, care providers, is there any likelihood that they would try to bargain for benefits for these -- these workers?"
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,170.693,172.712,Would the union attempt to?
2013.11-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,172.712,173.195,"Yes, yes."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,182.584,194.725,"Well, one thing that has happened, this is in the collective bargaining agreement, is the State has agreed to give certain amounts of money to an SEIU healthcare fund to offer access to health benefits for those providers."
2013.11-681,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,199.379,200.897,Did they have that before the union?
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,200.897,201.764,No.
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,201.764,206.366,Suppose you have a policeman who -- who is dissatisfied with his wages.
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,227.298,227.898,No.
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.898,231.916,He is prevented a petition for a redress of grievances?
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,231.916,242.224,"No, because in that -- with an individual speaking, it's, sir, a matter of private or internal proprietary matter that under this Court's precedence don't rise to a matter of public concern."
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,254.282,255.699,I really don't understand that.
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,265.572,272.427,"--The line would be once you have the collective, it would be start to become a matter of public concern."
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,273.827,284.635,"It seems to me it's always a matter of public concern, whether you're going to raise the salaries of policemen, whether it's an individual policeman asking for that or -- or a -- a combination of policemen or a union."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,286.853,290.289,"And if it is, then I submit that it's unconstitutional for--"
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,290.289,290.722,Okay.
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,293.591,294.474,--No.
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.145,307.166,"Well, how can he shut his door if he has a right to petition, a constitutional right to petition for the redress of grievances?"
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,309.816,320.991,"--But in that case under our public concern test, which goes within the Pickering line, that that individual grievance would not rise to a First Amendment petition."
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,320.991,323.86,But it's the same grievance if the union had presented it.
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,328.164,328.814,But the--
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.814,331.532,He's not asking for just his salary to be raised.
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,334.668,336.001,"--Well, two points."
2013.11-681,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,350.343,366.536,"But what -- what you're objecting to, to the extent that you're not objecting to the entire system of collective bargaining, you're objecting -- you're saying an individual employee can say I don't feel like supporting a union that makes a certain kind of argument about wages or about benefits."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,397.472,398.69,"--Well, I'd say--"
2013.11-681,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,398.69,400.859,"Same subject matter, same sanction."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,402.709,404.978,--There's two differences.
2013.11-681,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,410.715,413.683,"But you're not objecting, I think, to the union as a whole."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,421.539,427.093,"--Yes, it's an individual employee being forced to support that expressive activity."
2013.11-681,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,441.484,447.155,But that's exactly what the individual employee in Justice Scalia's hypothetical is arguing for.
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,454.66,465.366,"--But, again, under this Court's private -- under the public concern test, an individual simply speaking to that usually does not rise to a matter of public concern."
2013.11-681,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,465.366,469.253,"Well, Mr. Messenger, I'm confused by this whole line of argumentation."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,482.994,483.88,"No, they're not."
2013.11-681,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,483.88,485.446,So there isn't any issue about that in the case.
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,506.693,514.549,"Yes, exactly, that they are being forced to support an organization, here the SEIU, to speak or petition the State over its Medicaid rates."
2013.11-681,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,515.315,517.917,So let's break this down.
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,530.744,532.444,"--Yes, under -- I'm sorry."
2013.11-681,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,535.362,543.884,"Is there a problem for the State to say -- the union, to organize, has a certain amount of costs."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,560.93,561.963,--Yes.
2013.11-681,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,575.439,578.557,So there's no problem here with the representation.
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,581.009,590.382,"Yes, forcing the individuals to support the union for the purpose of petitioning the State over here the Medicaid rates for homecare."
2013.11-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,590.382,598.203,"Are there any -- you suggest, in response to my colleague's question, that they could -- the State could pay health care providers different rates."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,608.161,609.644,There may be statutory.
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.49,644.684,"Mr. Messenger, just to clarify what was the purpose of my earlier line of questioning, it was simply to show that if you have a case it doesn't rest on the right to petition the government for redress of grievances."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,656.808,657.676,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.676,670.317,"Now, that is, you know, that is an arguable position, but I don't -- I don't think it's even arguable that the right to petition the government for redress of grievances is -- is involved here."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,670.317,673.869,"It's the expression they're being forced to support, Your Honor."
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,679.59,685.761,"That's a First Amendment violation, not a violation -- not a denial of the right to petition the government."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,685.761,687.696,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.11-681,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,696.735,701.503,"Mr. Messenger, I'm not sure that Justice Scalia's answer satisfies his own question."
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.657,705.757,What -- what was the question?
2013.11-681,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,707.859,716.982,Because here's the thing: That in the workplace we've given the government a very wide degree of latitude and there's much that the government can do.
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,752.221,761.161,"I want to hear the answer, too, because, contrary to what Justice Kagan suggests, I -- I didn't say your First Amendment argument was valid."
2013.11-681,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,762.494,762.777,"Good, okay."
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,762.777,766.565,I said at least it was a comprehensible argument.
2013.11-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,766.565,770.1,Jump in whenever you'd like.
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,771.283,785.692,"The way in which homecare providers petition the State, I submit, is not an internal proprietary matter that the government has free rein to manage."
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,810.844,811.627,Why isn't it?
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,840.463,848.433,Because when the government is involved the First Amendment interests are much heightened because you're dealing with attempting to influence government policy.
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,848.433,848.767,All right.
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,856.956,858.575,"Yes, it's not considerable enough."
2013.11-681,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,859.724,880.071,"But what stops the non -- the people who oppose the union policy from sending a letter, asking a meeting, expressing their disapproval in any forum they want and in any way they want to whatever policy a union is advocating?"
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,883.79,885.492,"--No, there isn't, Your Honor."
2013.11-681,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,886.958,888.76,So where's the First Amendment abridgement?
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,900.001,906.738,"--It's -- Your Honor, it's the compelled speech, and the fact that the individuals have other First Amendment rights is not exculpatory."
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,914.827,927.135,I suppose -- I suppose the fact that you're entitled to speak against abortion would not justify the government in requiring you to give money to Planned Parenthood?
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,927.135,929.004,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,929.004,929.804,That's the argument you're making.
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,929.804,930.204,Yes.
2013.11-681,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,959.356,959.79,Mr. Messenger--
2013.11-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,959.79,965.26,"Well, but I mean, I suppose there could be labor peace if the Respondents were to prevail."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,973.45,974.383,"--Well, no."
2013.11-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,976.152,991.077,"I mean, doesn't the -- isn't there labor peace -- let's assume that's a valid interest -- isn't there labor peace if one union represents these health care providers and makes and negotiates a contract with the government?"
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,991.077,1002.533,"--No, I submit that the labor peace interest isn't valid here because in dealing with the Medicaid program, the State doesn't have an interest in avoiding competing demands from rival groups regarding its policies on that."
2013.11-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1003.802,1004.502,"Well, why doesn't it?"
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1010.473,1013.758,"--Well, the State could unilaterally do that, without bargaining with the union."
2013.11-681,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1013.758,1022.597,"Mr. Messenger, do you think the issue of exclusive representation is inextricably tied to the issue of the assessment of an agency fee?"
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1024.632,1026.065,"Yes, you can."
2013.11-681,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1048.664,1057.537,But you're not -- you're not challenging -- or it's confusing whether you are or not -- the very idea of exclusive representation by a union.
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1065.042,1076.95,"It's not directly challenged in this case, but it becomes relevant under the first Knox test, which asks whether the mandatory association being supported by the compulsory fees is justified by a compelling State interest."
2013.11-681,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1076.95,1087.223,"Is the mandatory -- let's take out, as Justice Alito suggested, take out the agency fee or fair-share fee or whatever it is."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1128.8,1130.902,"Not in this case, Your Honor."
2013.11-681,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1143.31,1151.731,"--So, Mr. Messenger, even on the compulsory fees, I mean, what strikes me is that this is -- I'm just going to use the word here, it is a radical argument."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1204.466,1217.008,"In the public sector, yes, that it is in fact -- well, the first public sector labor law was actually 1959 in Wisconsin, so it's relatively recent when you're involved with government."
2013.11-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1223.428,1236.854,"Suppose the Court were to say that on the issue of salaries there is no First Amendment violation, that -- that Abood should remain applicable to public employee unions."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1252.431,1254.149,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.11-681,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1279.998,1282.216,How about here for your employees?
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1290.556,1291.106,Yes.
2013.11-681,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1291.106,1291.656,--parties.
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1297.126,1297.912,No.
2013.11-681,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1302.997,1303.53,All right.
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1316.789,1320.675,"--Well, what -- as far as what they're being forced to support is the reimbursement rate."
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1336.287,1350.11,Those things you can argue are not part of the representation for which they should be charged and they should get their money back for those things if they're actually not -- not getting any benefit from them.
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1350.11,1358.2,"Well, I would submit that they shouldn't be forced to pay for any of this petitioning regarding how the State chooses to run this Medicaid program."
2013.11-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1358.2,1370.524,"No, but they're -- I mean, what our cases say is you -- you can be compelled not to be a free rider, to -- to pay for those items of bargaining that benefit you as well as everybody else."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1378.447,1390.504,"That's true for true employees under this Court's previous cases, but the question, of course, here is do those same principles apply to Medicaid providers or anyone else who receives money from government."
2013.11-681,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1391.371,1400.46,"They receive a salary -- I mean, they receive -- it's not a government branch to the -- to the healthcare worker."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1436.818,1437.818,"--Oh, yes."
2013.11-681,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1439.502,1442.137,As -- as employees of the State.
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1442.137,1444.322,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.11-681,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1482.681,1497.457,"They're not getting a paycheck and the insurance -- insurer is not deducting withholding tax, isn't paying FICA tax?"
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1497.457,1499.976,"That is paid, but the State is doing it as pay agent."
2013.11-681,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1507.397,1515.918,"I thought the State took the position that these individuals are State employees for one purpose only, collectively bargaining."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1517.02,1521.239,"Yes, that's right in the statute, Your Honor, that's it's solely for purposes of collective bargaining."
2013.11-681,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1521.239,1530.345,"So if one of these individuals commits gross misconduct, causes the death of a patient, the State has no liability?"
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1530.345,1531.797,It's right in the statute.
2013.11-681,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1536.582,1544.422,"When you come back, I'd appreciate your thinking about this, but obviously you're asking us to overturn a case that's been the law for 35 years."
2013.11-681,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1562.899,1564.168,Sure.
2013.11-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1564.801,1565.751,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1572.172,1573.457,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2013.11-681,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1600.524,1601.324,Why?
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1613.582,1618.053,"--There is no reimbursement rate for these workers set by the Medicaid program, Your Honor."
2013.11-681,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1637.633,1638.033,I don't understand what you're saying.
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1642.018,1653.493,"Your Honor, the State's judgment is that it can better make these determinations in partnership with the union and that the process of negotiation gives it both tangible and intangible benefits."
2013.11-681,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1656.778,1661.332,"So from the outset, it set up the union, right, and the union said, We want 7 bucks an hour."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1662.449,1668.503,"The 7 bucks an hour was what they were getting paid before the union was on the scene, Your Honor, and the State--"
2013.11-681,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1668.503,1669.753,And who picked that number?
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1669.753,1671.188,--The State did.
2013.11-681,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1671.188,1672.321,The State did.
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1673.222,1682.745,"And it gave the workers the opportunity, as it has every right to do, to have a majority of the people in the workforce say, we'd like to be represented, we'd like to have somebody in the room representing us."
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1693.653,1699.088,I thought Medicaid had something to do with how much they were reimbursed.
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1701.39,1710.563,"--Your Honor, in this kind of thing, we're talking about the wages of basic care workers like if they were in a nursing home or in a State hospital or wherever they might be."
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1711.448,1722.387,"If you hire a homecare provider to provide homecare services, isn't how much the person is compensated -- you have a Medicaid program, a cooperative program with the Federal Government."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1726.691,1730.409,--The wages for these kinds of workers are set by the State under the Medicaid program.
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1732.095,1735.297,"Well, right, it's a cooperative State/Federal program."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1744.069,1759.762,"Your Honor, these are people being employed by the State with money that happens to come from the Medicaid program in order -- it's a Federal project to get people out of nursing homes into their homes, and so they let the State divert money over to pay for these people to be in the home."
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1759.762,1773.672,"But they don't just give you a bunch of money and say, well, here it is, you figure out how much you want to -- I mean, I thought this case had something to do with the fact that Medicaid was used to reimburse these employees, and you're saying it has nothing to do with that at all?"
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1773.672,1778.557,"Your Honor, as I understand the constitutional challenge in this case, the source of the money, the State's decision about--"
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1778.557,1781.259,"I just want to know, not what their challenge is."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1789.198,1790.448,"--I'm not aware of any, Your Honor."
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1791.9,1797.303,So you can negotiate whatever rates you want with the homecare providers regardless of what Medicaid says about those services?
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1797.303,1799.905,"--‶ You ″ the State of Illinois, you mean?"
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1799.905,1800.355,"Yes, yes."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1800.355,1803.774,"The State of Illinois, Your Honor, as far as I know, I'm not aware of any limitation."
2013.11-681,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1806.326,1812.38,"Mr. Smith, I think that there's -- I must say that I might have labored under it."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1838.697,1847.053,"--Your Honor, the exact nature of the fund transfer from the Federal Government to the State may well be based on an individual's annual costs with a particular diagnosis."
2013.11-681,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1868.384,1872.852,"Mr. Smith, what I don't understand is why the union's participation in this is essential."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1891.682,1907.609,"The State of Illinois, like many employers, decided that, A, they would get that right more likely if they were dealing with a representative of the workers who told them what they care about, whether it's paid vacation versus higher wages versus less hours during the week or more hours during the week or whatever it might be."
2013.11-681,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1921.601,1927.588,"Well, that's fine for the workers who want the union to represent them in making these demands."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2004.172,2025.502,"--Well, Your Honor, I would say that the Court has correctly held over a period of more than 30 years that that requirement is an appropriate thing which a public employer is allowed to impose because of the duty of fair representation and because of the benefits of allowing collective bargaining to proceed with the duty of fair representation imposed on the union."
2013.11-681,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2039.345,2048.384,"Mr. Smith, are you saying that this -- that the unions reluctantly accept the duty of being the exclusive representative for all the employees?"
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2057.973,2060.009,"Well, that is the system we have, Your Honor."
2013.11-681,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2061.959,2069.281,"Seriously, the unions do not want to have the -- they don't want to be given the status of the exclusive bargaining agent for the employees?"
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2069.281,2071.65,--I -- I think there may be variation on that.
2013.11-681,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2118.112,2132.355,"But in talking about First Amendment interests, let me ask you this: Is it not a standard issue in collective bargaining for the employees' union to talk about the size of the workforce?"
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2132.355,2134.557,--Your Honor--
2013.11-681,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2134.557,2137.759,"Well, it's necessarily so if they're talking about hours."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2137.759,2140.811,--It is -- it is certainly possible that in some situations--
2013.11-681,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2140.811,2141.277,All right.
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2150.5,2155.221,--It is certainly not a subject of collective bargaining that could arise in this situation.
2013.11-681,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2156.004,2157.856,"No, I'm talking about -- let's say the teachers' union."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2164.259,2165.778,"--It -- it is possibly, Your Honor."
2013.11-681,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2166.394,2168.411,It's not only possible; it's necessarily true.
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2169.58,2171.296,--Assuming -- Assuming a school district decides to let--
2013.11-681,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2171.296,2178.419,"Let's -- let's assume that it's true, that a union's position necessarily affects the size of government."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2214.592,2233.856,"--Any outcome of a negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement involving public employees will involve the expenditure of public money in a variety of ways, and the outcome of that will, in that limited sense, at least, be a matter of public concern every bit as much and -- and no more than when a government contractor--"
2013.11-681,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2233.856,2236.056,I'm not talking about a question of public concern.
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2247.48,2253.467,"--Well, Your Honor, that is what the Abood distinction between chargeable and nonchargeable--"
2013.11-681,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2253.467,2257.621,And I'm -- I'm asking the justification for that under the First Amendment.
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2257.621,2258.038,--Right.
2013.11-681,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2258.538,2264.608,"In -- in an era where government is getting bigger and bigger, and this is becoming more and more of an important issue to more people."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2264.608,2284.271,"--But I think it's important to understand that while there is an impingement on the First Amendment interest on any employer -- employee required to pay the fair share fee, this isn't any -- the government employee context in which the government has the ability when it serves its important interest as employer to demand that its employees--"
2013.11-681,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2284.271,2289.323,"Well, you say it's a fair share, but that's the issue in the case if you're looking at the legitimacy of Abood."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2289.323,2291.859,"--Well, Your Honor, look at -- look at--"
2013.11-681,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2291.859,2292.592,"I mean, you say it's fair share."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2294.977,2299.881,--Look at what the union is -- what the -- what the money is being spent on in this case.
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2351.148,2351.598,One thing.
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2390.023,2390.458,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2392.125,2393.91,"Teacher -- teacher union, okay?"
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2393.91,2394.377,"Yes, sir."
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2394.377,2397.112,They have a political position on Medicaid rates.
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2403.699,2408.002,"It would seem to me, Your Honor, something that's not within the chargeable expenses that a teachers' union could charge."
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2408.002,2408.586,Right.
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2412.304,2412.704,Yes.
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2412.704,2415.34,--but you're a home care provider.
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2424.862,2433.285,"To the extent that you're talking about the negotiation over how much you're going to be paid for providing services, I think it's perfectly appropriate under the Court's cases to--"
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2433.285,2433.952,So one -- I'm sorry.
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2444.86,2453.048,--It's on the chargeable side of the line when it has to do with the -- the terms and conditions of employment of the -- of the members of the union or the nonmembers of the union.
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2453.048,2453.348,Okay.
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2466.356,2472.677,"If what you mean by Medicaid reimbursement rates, Mr. Chief Justice, is the hourly rate that's going to be paid to those people--"
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2472.677,2474.395,I mean Medicaid reimbursement rates.
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2476.747,2484.318,"--Well, if that's what you mean, then it seems to me very clear that they should be allowed to charge the dissident nonmember because that person is going to get all the benefit of it."
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2484.318,2490.74,"So in this case -- in this case, if this union negotiates over Medicaid reimbursement rates, it is chargeable."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2490.74,2493.223,"Yes, Your Honor, to the extent--"
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2493.223,2498.244,"Even though, what I understood your answer to be, is that Medicaid reimbursement rates had nothing to do with this case."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2498.244,2507.516,"--The only thing that can be negotiated about in this case, Your Honor, is the terms and conditions of employment of these workers that is within the control of the State."
2013.11-681,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2509.518,2510.202,What about the issue of--
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2510.202,2512.254,And that includes Medicaid reimbursement rates.
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2512.254,2516.522,"--In the -- in the limited sense that they're hourly wages going to these individuals, yes."
2013.11-681,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2516.522,2520.01,"The question you're being asked, I think, is a broader question."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2532.233,2532.917,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.11-681,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2532.917,2552.814,"But I think the question you're being asked is where you have SEIU or AFSCME, and they're government unions, does it have a bigger mix of public policy issues; and therefore, should this Court get into the business -- I'm putting it in a little loaded way because I don't want to suggest the answer."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2583.166,2594.808,"My answer, Your Honor, would be that the fact that it is a public employee union, representing public employees means that in one sense, everything that is being negotiated could be viewed as a greater matter of public concern."
2013.11-681,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2608.733,2610.517,"--Well, let me ask you a question about pensions."
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2628.462,2631.581,--It would be a subject if the State chose to let -- let it become a subject.
2013.11-681,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2635.385,2640.77,"Well, if the -- if the union spends a lot of money trying to bargain on that issue, that's -- that's a chargeable expense, is it not?"
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2640.77,2644.157,"If the State has chosen to make it part of the contract that can be negotiated, yes."
2013.11-681,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2644.157,2644.541,All right.
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2669.639,2670.724,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.11-681,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2700.927,2713.068,Suppose the young person thinks that the State is squandering his heritage on unnecessary and excessive payments or benefits and wages.
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2736.516,2749.741,"What's missing I think in this conversation, Your Honor, is that all of these burdens on people's associational rights or free speech rights or whatever you want to call them arises only because somebody has chosen to come take this job working for the State on the terms the State offers."
2013.11-681,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2752.026,2759.366,So your position is that the public employees must surrender a substantial amount of First Amendment rights to work for the government?
2013.11-681,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2759.366,2765.353,--When there are substantial interests of the government as employer that are served by the sacrifice.
2013.11-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2780.379,2780.845,"Thank you, counsel."

2013.11-681,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2880.578,2883.947,"General Verrilli, does Medicaid have anything to do with this case?"
2013.11-681,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2883.947,2884.297,Yes.
2013.11-681,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2921.972,2922.405,"Right, right."
2013.11-681,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2922.405,2931.911,Are they high enough to make sure the services providing -- they're provided effectively and are they -- and are they constrained enough--
2013.11-681,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2931.911,2932.278,Right.
2013.11-681,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2938.997,2946.753,"--Right, but it's not that the -- but the Federal Government isn't approving the specific hourly wage rate as Medicaid reimbursement within this program."
2013.11-681,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2951.074,2967.434,"If the union wants to talk about Medicaid rates with the State because they would get a higher wage or could get a higher wage if Medicaid reimbursement was higher, is that within the -- their functioning as a union rather than a political group?"
2013.11-681,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2967.434,2968.367,Not as I understand it.
2013.11-681,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2977.974,2988.514,"Oh, so if the union wants to say, look, the only way our people are going to get higher wages is if there's a higher Medicaid reimbursement rate for this service, that is not within the scope of collective bargaining?"
2013.11-681,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2988.514,2994.334,--I think -- my understanding is that that would be -- the question there was at which side of the line that the Court drew in Lehnert is that on.
2013.11-681,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3032.209,3040.815,"If the plaintiffs in this case were to be unionized -- excuse me -- in a unionized Federal workplace, would they be assessed a mandatory agency fee?"
2013.11-681,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3040.815,3049.321,"No, they would not, Justice Alito, and we're not -- we're not here making an argument that as a matter of policy States ought to adopt fair share or not."
2013.11-681,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3053.623,3060.628,"So the Federal Government doesn't think that it needs to assess a mandatory agency fee from, let's say, the employees in the Border Patrol."
2013.11-681,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3069.568,3080.357,"It hasn't, but the key point for us, the point of vital importance for the United States here, is that the Court continue to recognize the context, the First Amendment context of the government as manager of its own operations."
2013.11-681,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3107.876,3123.453,"Of course, one can be skeptical about whether, when States do this they are doing it because it's more -- more efficient as an employer, because some States have tried to force private employers to have a closed shop, haven't they?"
2013.11-681,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3123.453,3124.886,"--Well, I think--"
2013.11-681,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3124.886,3130.123,"And there's no, you know, no State government interest in it."
2013.11-681,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3132.325,3133.492,"--Yes, but here we argue--"
2013.11-681,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3133.492,3136.194,And unions getting a lot of money from people who don't belong in the unions.
2013.11-681,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3147.484,3165.796,"--I guess what I would say about that, Justice Scalia, is that one could speculate about motives of States like Illinois, one could speculate about motives of the right to work States, but I would suggest that under our Federal system that States get to make those kinds of policy choices."
2013.11-681,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3181.574,3191.28,Do you think that the specific factual background of what occurred here provides a basis for skepticism about Illinois's reason for adopting this?
2013.11-681,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3191.28,3192.213,I don't think so.
2013.11-681,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3206.99,3223.818,"I thought the situation was that Government Blagojevich got a huge campaign contribution from the union and virtually as soon as he got into office he took out his pen and signed an executive order that had the effect of putting, what was it, $3.6 million into the union coffers?"
2013.11-681,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3223.818,3224.384,--Whatever happened--
2013.11-681,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3224.384,3226.317,That's the sequence; isn't that correct?
2013.11-681,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3226.317,3241.227,"--Well, I think the issue before the Court is the constitutionality of the statute that was enacted subsequent to that by a large bipartisan majority, and I don't think it would be appropriate to look behind the legislature's action to consider and try to evaluate its motives."
2013.11-681,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3256.087,3258.356,They may do so because of that reason.
2013.11-681,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3263.759,3267.561,And they ought to have the discretion to make that choice under this Court's case law.
2013.11-681,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3382.619,3397.112,"Is it true that from -- from the beginning, there have been members of this Court who have questioned whether there is any principled basis for distinguishing between the chargeable and the nonchargeable expenses and also have questioned whether as a practical matter that can be done?"
2013.11-681,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3399.064,3399.631,Yes.
2013.11-681,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3405.568,3407.218,Please finish your thought.
2013.11-681,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3407.218,3412.836,"--before it was reaffirmed in Lehnert, before it was reaffirmed in Ellis and before it was reaffirmed unanimously in Locke."
2013.11-681,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3413.288,3414.573,"Thank you, General."
2013.11-681,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3416.339,3423.16,"I suspect you're going to answer my question, so I want to focus it -- and I'm sorry to do this, but I think it's important."
2013.11-681,3,45468,william_l_messenger,,3469.891,3480.531,I believe there -- the reliance interests here are insignificant if Abood is overruled because the result will simply be that employees cannot be forced to support union representation.
2013.11-681,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3481.181,3488.002,Why would anybody join the union under those circumstances or pay enough to support the union efforts?
2013.11-681,3,45468,william_l_messenger,,3488.002,3500.262,"--Because the union first would control their terms of their economic conditions of employment and have control of their relations with their employer, which creates a strong incentive for an employee to want to be on good terms with that union."
2013.11-681,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3507.916,3512.987,"But -- but it's only people who -- who disagree with the -- what the union's doing who could refuse to pay, you say?"
2013.11-681,3,45468,william_l_messenger,,3514.387,3515.188,--Yes.
2013.11-681,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3516.221,3520.323,"Why can't people who -- who agree with the union just say, hey, I don't -- I don't have to pay."
2013.11-681,3,45468,william_l_messenger,,3525.394,3528.846,"--People could have different motives, but I submit that the union has--"
2013.11-681,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3528.846,3534.233,Is there any -- is there any way to decide who's doing it just to save money and who's doing it on principle?
2013.11-681,3,45468,william_l_messenger,,3534.233,3536.452,--Not that I'm aware of.
2013.11-681,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3536.452,3549.41,"So -- so you're essentially destroying not just the -- not just the -- the -- closed shop, but you're destroying the ability of the union to -- to get money even from the people who don't agree with what it's doing."
2013.11-681,3,45468,william_l_messenger,,3549.41,3550.612,"Well, two points."
2013.11-681,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3580.047,3585.433,"Mr. Messenger, do you doubt that these -- you said that there were no reliance interests, and -- and that's curious to me."
2013.11-681,3,45468,william_l_messenger,,3604.829,3610.066,--The main difference is just the compulsory unionism clause in the agreement would be gone.
2013.11-681,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3611.833,3622.724,"You think that the union would -- would not ask for anything, would not have different -- you know, would not ask for different mechanisms in order to support its own activity?"
2013.11-681,3,45468,william_l_messenger,,3641.769,3651.31,"I would submit that with compelled fees off the table, the union would actually have more leverage to get things for employees because the compelled fees clause is leveraged for the employer."
2013.11-681,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3659.047,3669.122,"So you think that if we just strike these provisions, in other words, the -- the contracts would have been negotiated in exactly the same way, nothing else would have changed?"
2013.11-681,3,45468,william_l_messenger,,3669.122,3671.155,"If I may finish, Chief Justice."
2013.11-681,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3671.155,3671.557,Please.
2013.11-681,3,45468,william_l_messenger,,3671.557,3674.426,I believe that they probably would be very much the same.
2013.11-681,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3682.679,3683.762,"Thank you, counsel."
