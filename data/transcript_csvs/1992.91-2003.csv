1992.91-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.989,"We'll hear argument next in number 91-2003, the United States v. California and the California State Board of Equalization."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,46.513,55.439,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-2003,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,142.397,152.384,"Mr. Jones, is... should we make a distinction in the kinds of unlawfulness that may be appropriate predicates for that common law action?"
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,183.764,192.94,"Well, there is no basis, or rationale even, for distinguishing in that sense, Justice Souter."
1992.91-2003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,245.314,247.965,"Well, Mr. Jones, who's the taxpayer here?"
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,247.965,258.273,"Well, as California uses that term, the taxpayer is the Federal manager of the Naval Petroleum Reserve."
1992.91-2003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.273,260.183,Who do you say is the taxpayer here?
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,262.855,267.72,In... there's two ways to answer that; one is factually and the second is conceptually.
1992.91-2003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,277.634,284.66,"Well, Federal funds reimbursed the contractor here."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,284.66,286.37,"--Actually, it was something more than that."
1992.91-2003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,302.773,311.327,"Well, in United States v. New Mexico do you think we thought the United States was the taxpayer?"
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,311.327,318.332,"--I don't know if... if that question, framed that way, was before the Court."
1992.91-2003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,326.698,327.409,Uh-huh.
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,327.409,329.12,And what the Court held in that--
1992.91-2003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,329.12,330.011,And we said it didn't.
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,330.011,333.493,--The Court held that it did not apply in that case.
1992.91-2003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,333.493,338.385,"And the United States is in no better position here, I assume, than in New Mexico."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,338.385,341.017,"Well, we are in a better position here."
1992.91-2003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,348.503,350.333,But you don't claim any sovereign immunity either.
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,350.333,350.974,--We're not--
1992.91-2003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,350.974,354.396,Either for yourself or for the contractor.
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,354.396,357.186,--We are not contending the tax is unconstitutional.
1992.91-2003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,357.186,357.797,Exactly.
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,357.797,367.504,"However, as... just to inform the Court and not because it's instrumental in our argument, the State's tax is shaped with constitutional constraints in mind."
1992.91-2003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,388.118,394.631,"Yeah, but maybe you're just in the position of... of being subrogated to whatever the right of the taxpayer was."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,406.911,409.492,"--Well that, of course, is the State's position."
1992.91-2003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,409.492,409.983,Yeah.
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,409.983,414.966,And I acknowledge that there is a bit of a chicken and an egg problem here.
1992.91-2003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,414.966,415.436,Yeah.
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,415.436,425.482,"And... and it's a little glib to say it, but nonetheless I think there's an element of truth; it's a Federal chicken and a State egg, and under the Supremacy Clause the chicken prevails."
1992.91-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,437.749,440.281,"But in much different circumstances, Mr. Jones."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,450.879,457.364,"This is the first time this issue has come to this Court, but it's been in the courts of appeals for decades."
1992.91-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,457.364,459.975,"Well, presumably that's why it's here now."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,459.975,460.556,That's correct.
1992.91-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,474.865,477.286,"Well, when your funds have been paid to the State by your agent."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,477.286,493.135,"That is correct, and that was exactly the context of the Bayne case in 1876, where a Federal officer had Federal funds, he misappropriated those funds and transmitted them to a third party."
1992.91-2003,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,512.688,515.64,"No, but we certainly cannot assume that the funds were unlawfully taken from the United States."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,515.64,517.111,"I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you."
1992.91-2003,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,517.111,523.684,"I mean in... in the Bayne case the funds were unlawfully taken by the Federal officer from the United States, they were misappropriated, as I recall."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,533.273,545.191,"Well, except that here the... this case falls with... does fall within the confines of this Court's prior decisions in that the funds were paid under protest and under threat of penalty."
1992.91-2003,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,572.918,574.5,What... so you've got... you've got the better of me on that legal point.
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,576.09,581.533,"Well, I think Bend v. Hoyt addresses that subject."
1992.91-2003,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,585.356,590.67,Is it incorrect to say that the State is indebted to the contractor?
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,590.67,599.244,"Well, under California law, the contractor is what is called the taxpayer."
1992.91-2003,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,645.445,664.628,"If... if this case had proceeded with the contractor's claim being adjudicated and there was a final judgment in the California courts as to the contractor and that judgment was in favor of the State, adverse to the contractor, would you still have the right to maintain this suit?"
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,664.628,671.763,"We would then have the problem that the Court, I believe, addressed in the Montana case about collateral estoppel."
1992.91-2003,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,680.458,683.21,"Which you did here, incidently, did you not?"
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,683.21,686.593,"--Well, but the... the State court litigation here did not proceed to conclusion."
1992.91-2003,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,686.593,689.404,"Well, you did at the administrative level."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,689.404,699.102,"Well, I don't... I don't think it can be said that we participated in any manner at the administrative level; we had no right to."
1992.91-2003,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,701.793,703.604,"Didn't you pay the... didn't you pay the attorneys, or am I incorrect about that?"
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,703.604,707.707,"Well, under our contract we had a duty to reimburse them for the costs."
1992.91-2003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,718.933,725.338,"Well, could you have stopped your contractor from settling this case?"
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,737.617,742.96,--The settle... the settlement of the claim presents a different issue than... than collateral estoppel.
1992.91-2003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,749.004,758.239,"Well, could you have... could you have forbidden the... your contractor from settling that case and... and instead, litigating it to its conclusion?"
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,758.239,763.823,Could we have forbidden them from settling it?
1992.91-2003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,767.714,771.498,"Well, if you could, you just... you just blew it, that's all."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,771.498,774.81,"--Well, this case wasn't settled in that respect below."
1992.91-2003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,803.641,804.061,Yes.
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,804.061,806.543,--To settle something and then sneak it away.
1992.91-2003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,806.543,807.632,Exactly.
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,807.632,808.293,But at least--
1992.91-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,808.293,812.266,"We take our facts, generally, as found by the court of appeals."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,814.587,816.398,"--Well, the court of appeals didn't find anything on that."
1992.91-2003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,819.651,821.393,"But it... but it was dismissed without prejudice, wasn't it?"
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,821.393,832.72,--It was dismissed without prejudice and at page 97 of the joint appendix there's a letter between counsel that makes it quite clear that the State was aware that the United States was going to pursue the claim in Federal Court.
1992.91-2003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,842.834,846.979,"Oh, let me just press one... one more question here."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,869.025,872.955,"Because it was in State court, under the State rules it had standing."
1992.91-2003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,874.945,877.379,"But under your theory here, it wouldn't."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,877.379,880.381,"--Well, I believe there's... there's two separate causes of action."
1992.91-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,955.748,978.273,"Well, Mr. Jones, might there not be, in that situation, one rule for actions by the United States against private parties who may have kind of absconded with Government funds, as it appears to have been the case in Bayne, and another rule where the State is... where the Government is simply protesting a collection that has already been made by a State of taxes?"
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,978.273,998.618,"Well, the only orderly way in which we can protest that collection is to subject ourselves to the risk of penalties and compulsory process at State law, or to bring... to make the payment in an orderly fashion, as this Court has... has held in... in the Courts I cited... in the cases I cited to Justice Souter."
1992.91-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,998.618,1004.71,"Well, did any of those involve proceedings that involved the collection of State taxes as opposed to private individuals?"
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1004.71,1012.376,"Actually, the common law rule has its roots in those two cases I cited that involve suits to recover Federal taxes."
1992.91-2003,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1024.494,1027.457,Was there any other process for doing so at that time?
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1027.457,1037.281,"There was no statutory remedy at that time, although I suppose that the taxpayer could have resisted the assessment and not voluntarily--"
1992.91-2003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1037.281,1046.858,"Well, could... under the California rule, you could not have intervened in the proceedings that your contractor had instituted."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1046.858,1052.051,--California cases seem to assume we can intervene.
1992.91-2003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1054.124,1055.924,They assume you could.
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1055.924,1056.325,--Yes.
1992.91-2003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1072.277,1072.758,Yes.
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1072.758,1086.445,"We would be intervening in a proceeding that would make the Federal claims subject to State law procedures, to the State statute of limitations, and to State court adjudication of the claim."
1992.91-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1125.531,1128.643,Plenary and exclusive?
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1128.643,1139.991,"Well, exclusive through the removal procedure... not expressly, Chief Justice Rehnquist, but pragmatically exclusive through the removal procedure."
1992.91-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1146.854,1151.528,"But... but when you talk about removal, you're talking about the United States as a defendant, then."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1151.528,1158.21,"Well, the United States has... has the option in every case to have its claims heard in Federal court."
1992.91-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1163.685,1172.141,"Well, but what may be the rule as to the United States as a defendant may be quite different than the rule as the United States as a plaintiff."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1197.357,1210.055,"Well, 28 USC 1345 gives the Federal court jurisdiction over all, and that's the statutory word, all causes of action, suits, or proceedings commenced by the United States."
1992.91-2003,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1290.839,1297.792,Does that apply even if the United States is subrogated to the claim and proceeds in a subrogation capacity?
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1297.792,1304.628,If the... I take it the premise of that question is there are two causes of action.
1992.91-2003,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1456.535,1457.987,"Yeah, but businesses do that all the time."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1464.382,1466.032,--I think the Court has--
1992.91-2003,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1466.032,1471.105,"The United States is... is claiming exemptions, or whatever, under State laws, to follow those procedures."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1471.105,1478.872,--I think the Court has recognized that the claims of the United States differ both in quality and quantity in that respect.
1992.91-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1504.948,1508.931,But the so-called Federal right here is simply a claim under California law.
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1508.931,1512.512,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, it is a claim under Federal law."
1992.91-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1519.108,1523.181,"Yeah, but the basis for that claim lies entirely in California State tax law, doesn't it?"
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1523.181,1525.751,I would put it the other way.
1992.91-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1548.106,1561.095,"Well who... who'd better decide that case, the California courts or the Ninth Circuit, as to whether a California State tax is unlawful or not, under... under California State law?"
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1561.095,1564.808,--Well this... there certainly has never--
1992.91-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1564.808,1568.04,For California courts are better equipped to speak on that than the Ninth Circuit.
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1568.04,1575.106,--There's no question that the Federal courts have competence to decide these questions of State law.
1992.91-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1608.646,1616.263,You're asking us here to extend previous holdings of the Court to a situation involving collection of State taxes.
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1629.821,1634.234,"Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, we think the case... this Court's cases do support it."
1992.91-2003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1659.04,1683.696,"Well, what if you... what if you got into court on this suit that... that you think the Federal court can hear, and it suddenly happens that a Supreme... a decision of the Supreme Court of California was found that squarely decides the issue that you want litigated against you?"
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1685.927,1686.869,That--
1992.91-2003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1686.869,1689.03,"--That's a matter of State law, then, isn't it?"
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1689.03,1696.974,"--I would expect the Federal court to look for sources of State law here, just as it does in any other case where it decides questions of State law."
1992.91-2003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1696.974,1697.895,"Why, sure."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1705.899,1708.453,"Well, actually, we want to litigate facts as well."
1992.91-2003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1715.306,1715.967,"Right, exactly."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1715.967,1722.952,"There are factual questions and legal questions that implicate the rights of the United States, and we think they should be decided in Federal court."
1992.91-2003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1722.952,1734.77,"Well, let's assume that there's a... a State supreme court case that's... that is so similar to this that anyone would say it would control."
1992.91-2003,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1734.77,1742.505,"In that event, I suppose the district court properly should decide that there was a lawful justification of public funds."
1992.91-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1771.173,1773.066,"Very well, Mr.... Mr. Jones."
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,1775.136,1778.449,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-2003,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1839.049,1842.61,"May I ask you this question, does that really make any difference?"
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,1847.014,1847.545,I agree.
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1848.654,1849.245,Yeah.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,1862.773,1874.77,"Your Honor, under... under the judicial remedy, the Code of Civil Procedure, section, I think, 389, authorizes and almost requires a real party in interest to be before the court."
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1879.646,1884.678,"And did it get to... it never got beyond the administrative stage, did it?"
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,1884.678,1888.311,"I don't understand the question, I'm sorry."
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1888.311,1891.413,"Did the... well, the contractor wanted a refund?"
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,1891.413,1891.994,Yes.
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.994,1896.265,And it... and it... and it employed the administrative remedy.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,1896.265,1896.726,Right.
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1896.726,1899.348,"Did it... did it... it never got to court, did it?"
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,1899.348,1905.582,"WBEC filed two court actions in State court, yes, at the direction of the United States."
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1905.582,1907.864,And those were... and those were settled?
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,1907.864,1916.628,"Those were not... I agree with Mr. Jones' characterization of that, that the... the Board of Equalization, through discovery, found that it had--"
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1916.628,1917.789,Uh-huh.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,1917.789,1920.221,--Misapplied the tax to some extent.
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1920.221,1920.912,To some extent.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,1920.912,1922.702,And so they agreed to pay that back.
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1929.358,1929.839,So--
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,1929.839,1931.568,"There was no settlement, as such."
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1931.568,1933.02,"--No, no, no."
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,1943.236,1945.379,Yes.
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1950.432,1955.023,And... and so that issue never went to judgment.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,1955.023,1956.045,It did not.
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1956.045,1957.655,It did not.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,1957.655,1959.077,It was... the cases were dismissed.
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1959.077,1966.831,And you think... and... and... you think the United States could have intervened in those two cases.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,1966.831,1967.853,"Yes, I believe--"
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.853,1973.206,"And if they lost in the... in the trial court on the issue they wanted to litigate, they could have appealed."
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,1973.206,1975.477,"--Yes, I believe that."
1992.91-2003,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1996.38,2008.158,"But assuming this is Federal property at issue, do you know of any other instances where in order to hold on to its own property the Federal Government has to appear in State proceedings?"
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2008.158,2012.653,I cannot identify any other instances.
1992.91-2003,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2025.319,2028.023,Do you accept the premise of its being Federal property?
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2028.023,2038.698,That... the money was... was paid from Federal funds.
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.856,2096.045,"Was... was Mr. Jones correct in saying that the... the State was told that... when the case was dismissed or the cases were dismissed, that the United States was going to pursue the issue in Federal court?"
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2096.045,2098.739,--I think he cited something in the joint appendix.
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2103.752,2111.977,"So, I suppose the State could have... could have refused to have the case dismissed?"
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2111.977,2116.231,"No, I think dismissal is... is a duty."
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.556,2134.861,Even after the case has... even after discovery and things like that?
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2134.861,2135.312,Yes.
1992.91-2003,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2162.7,2166.731,But you say the United States could have intervened at any time?
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2166.731,2167.762,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-2003,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2179.02,2183.824,"Now, would it have had the... the right also, in your view, to intervene in the administrative proceedings?"
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2183.824,2186.095,"I'm sorry, I did not hear you."
1992.91-2003,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2186.095,2188.797,Would it have had the same right to intervene in the administrative proceedings?
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2188.797,2199.184,"Under the circumstances of this case, they could have either intervened, stepped into the shoes, or, on their own, pursued the administrative remedies."
1992.91-2003,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2431.857,2437.33,May I ask a question that's kind of running through my mind about the analogy with the litigation costs and all?
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2442.863,2444.682,They obligated themselves to... to pay--
1992.91-2003,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2444.682,2459.693,"And if... if they were persuaded that the attorney had overcharged the client and they wanted to recover the overcharge from the client, would they... and... and the California statute of limitations had run, would they be able to sue in Federal court, in your view?"
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2459.693,2462.097,--I do not know the answer to that question.
1992.91-2003,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2462.097,2463.476,Isn't that the same question we have here?
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2463.476,2465.567,I don't believe so.
1992.91-2003,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2465.567,2466.969,Why not?
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2491.185,2500.419,"Well, the only... the thing that I'm relying on in this... in this case is the sovereign power of California to impose taxes."
1992.91-2003,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2508.296,2515.47,"Well, they have the sovereign power to decide how much... what is a fair fee for a lawyer, I guess, a member of the State bar, and so forth and so on."
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2517.583,2518.421,"--I think it's different, yeah."
1992.91-2003,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2518.421,2518.952,Yeah.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2533.41,2536.413,"I'm not sure I understand the question, Justice--"
1992.91-2003,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2536.413,2539.225,We're just arguing about what statute of limitations applies.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2540.877,2542.368,--Well if--
1992.91-2003,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2542.368,2553.745,"So even if your response to Justice Stevens were yes, the United States would... could proceed in Federal Court against the... against the lawyer, you... you still might be--"
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2558.862,2575.953,"--Now, the State's... the difference between sovereign power and a running of a State statute of limitation is that under this Court's decision in United States v. Dalm, the principles of sovereign immunity indicate whether or not there's a claim against the sovereign."
1992.91-2003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2589.35,2592.342,"We'll resume there at 1:00, Mr. Milam."
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2610.374,2612.736,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.937,2669.823,"Well, I take it you're... you're saying that this so-called common law cause of action the Government relies on just doesn't apply in the... the State tax context."
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2669.823,2671.964,That's our position.
1992.91-2003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2672.495,2673.226,"Yes, uh-hum."
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2675.897,2678.94,Dows v. City of Chicago in 1870.
1992.91-2003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2678.94,2679.601,Dow?
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2679.601,2680.98,"Dows, I believe."
1992.91-2003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2680.98,2681.331,Yeah.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2683.812,2686.404,I don't believe I cited it in my brief.
1992.91-2003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2687.255,2688.046,Why didn't you?
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2688.046,2690.878,I have no excuse.
1992.91-2003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2690.878,2694.53,Could you give us the citation now?
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2694.53,2701.242,"I do not have it handy, Your Honor."
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2708.629,2719.896,"But there are several court of appeals cases that... to the contrary to your position, aren't there?"
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2719.896,2729.012,"There are and I'm going to... I'm going to discuss those in a few seconds, but first I want to discuss the Department of Employment case which deals specifically with this area."
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.012,2730.622,The what?
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2730.622,2733.855,Department of Employment v. the United States.
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2733.855,2734.856,"Oh yes, uh-hum."
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2734.856,2735.918,Mentioned by Mr. Jones.
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2735.918,2736.757,Uh-hum.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2736.757,2751.666,The Department of Employment case was a case that refused to apply the Tax Injunction Act as to State taxes because a Federal instrumentality was being taxed in violation of its sovereign immunity.
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2826.905,2832.83,"Those are the ones on the Government's brief page 20, I think, yeah, yeah."
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2832.83,2868.924,"So California's answer to the question presented by the United States is that assuming it had... just assuming for purpose of argument that it can state a quasi-contract cause of action, when the issue is one of application of State tax law only and there are no Supremacy Clause issues, pursuit... effective pursuit of State remedies is required before the access to Federal Courts, and this includes meeting all the procedural requirements of State law."
1992.91-2003,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2868.924,2870.174,Why is that?
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2898.344,2900.094,"Well, that was the question presented."
1992.91-2003,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2900.094,2900.705,"--That seems, that's a lot harder to swallow."
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2900.705,2902.545,"I'm sorry, I'm... I interrupted you, I didn't--"
1992.91-2003,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2902.545,2904.027,That... that was the question presented?
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2904.027,2912.231,"--The question presented is that the United States assumes it has a quasi-contract cause of action, and the question then is do they have to pursue State remedies."
1992.91-2003,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2916.543,2922.33,The quasi-contract cause of action precludes any subrogation theory.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2922.33,2926.471,--I don't believe it precludes subrogation theory.
1992.91-2003,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2936.588,2947.224,"Oh, so I have to assume that this case is the same as though the United States were suing in its own right, as though the tax had been posed on the United States and not on its contractor?"
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2960.294,2961.243,Yes.
1992.91-2003,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2962.044,2962.845,Uh-hum.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2978.374,2980.607,Well it... it... it... it is.
1992.91-2003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2985.839,2986.279,"Yes, but you say--"
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,2986.279,2987.83,--There's no court that has... has held that.
1992.91-2003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2994.214,2995.366,--Well why is that... why is that a problem?
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,3002.182,3002.539,It doesn't.
1992.91-2003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3014.288,3016.731,You want to have several strings to your bow.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,3016.731,3017.651,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1992.91-2003,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3017.651,3019.333,What about the--
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,3030.54,3033.162,"That's my understanding, yes."
1992.91-2003,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3033.162,3036.226,Well is... was that an equitable action at common law?
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,3036.226,3039.417,I don't know the answer to that.
1992.91-2003,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3039.847,3049.724,"Well, I... I think it was not, which is what... why I'm not sure why you say that equity requires that it follows exhaustion of remedy."
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,3054.787,3056.68,"--I have no authority, Your Honor."
1992.91-2003,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3056.68,3061.141,Do you... let's... let's go back to the cause of action again for a moment.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,3071.527,3080.433,I don't accept them as having a... a contract... a quasi-contract cause of action.
1992.91-2003,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3087.508,3088.529,Well I thought... I looked at them very quickly.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,3095.433,3107.281,The only basis that... that I've been able to distinguish the common law quasi-contract action is that the money was supposed to be paid involuntarily.
1992.91-2003,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3118.19,3118.969,Yeah.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,3118.969,3121.012,So I'm not sure they meet the common law definition.
1992.91-2003,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3121.012,3121.9,Okay.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,3121.9,3134.408,"All the other cases... all the cases, besides the three I mentioned, relied upon by the United States involve Supremacy Clause issues."
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3321.462,3334.499,"Well, as I suggested, that is somewhat inconsistent with your notion that the United States was the real party in interest and could have and should have intervened."
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,3334.499,3336.141,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3352.631,3359.366,"Well, why is the United States the real party in interest if it isn't its money that's involved?"
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,3359.366,3364.98,That's the reason it is the real party in interest.
1992.91-2003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3364.98,3365.52,Okay.
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,3365.52,3368.692,But that... I don't think that conflicts with being a subrogee.
1992.91-2003,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3456.119,3459.621,But can you bring a suit for money had and received as subrogee?
1992.91-2003,1,39952,robert_d_milam,,3472.12,3480.686,--I don't... in this case I don't believe so because WBEC had no such action and a subrogee just takes the remedies of the subrogor.
1992.91-2003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3538.712,3540.805,"Thank you, Mr. Milam."
1992.91-2003,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3542.986,3546.238,Excuse me.
1992.91-2003,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3564.091,3568.512,"But there the only question this Court decided was whether interest would be available, wasn't it?"
1992.91-2003,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3568.512,3573.196,"--It's the only question the Court decided, but it's not the only question the Court discussed and addressed."
1992.91-2003,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3582.941,3585.312,But nobody was arguing otherwise in that case.
1992.91-2003,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3585.312,3589.186,"I... I assume that's correct, but I don't know, I wasn't up there."
1992.91-2003,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3589.186,3593.169,"Well, I mean judge... I don't claim to have been present at the argument."
1992.91-2003,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3597.24,3605.587,"Well, the opinion discusses the issues as if they were relevant to its decision, and so I assume that those issues were discussed before the Court."
1992.91-2003,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3634.158,3634.966,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
