2000.99-1379,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.458,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-1379, Circuit City Stores v. Saint Clair Adams."
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,10.756,14.113,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-1379,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,72.677,76.282,Is the word class important to your argument?
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,76.282,78.41,Your Honor--
2000.99-1379,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,78.41,80.275,Or would your argument be just the same without--
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,80.275,84.939,--I do not believe that it significantly alters it.
2000.99-1379,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,97.717,110.064,"--Well, it would seem to me to help your argument somewhat, because we... the statute asks us to think in terms of classes of workers, rather than individual workers engaged--"
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,110.064,110.756,"Oh, certainly, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,140.766,151.391,"--Mr. Nagle, I guess at the time that this act was adopted in... what, 1925?"
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,151.391,152.179,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,152.179,160.241,"We had not taken as broad a view of the Commerce Clause power as is true today, is that correct?"
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,160.241,161.294,"I would acknowledge that, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,161.294,192.522,"And so Congress probably didn't have in mind that its jurisdiction was as broad as we would have subsequently indicated, and apparently it intended at least that the act not include or cover contracts of employment over which their authority to regulate was very clear, right?"
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,192.522,193.877,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,196.549,232.301,"And the indications were that at least then Secretary of Commerce Hoover thought employees shouldn't be covered at all, and he presented language to the Congress which approved it, and yet you want us to say that Congress did intend to include for arbitration contracts of employment over which the jurisdiction was most questionable, and yet exclude it for those where the jurisdiction of Congress was clearest at the time, which seems a little odd to me."
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,232.301,236.016,"Well, there are several points in response, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,293.102,313.234,"Well, the other most troublesome point for me, anyway, is this Court's decision in Allied Bruce, which dealt with section 2, and said that we're going to interpret it now as reaching the full scope of Congress' Commerce Clause power."
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,316.575,333.118,"Well, in Allied Bruce, which is one of the cases upon which we would principally rely, that was an interpretation of section 2, the coverage, and certainly was making it clear that the Court recognized that Congress was acting to the full with respect to its Commerce Clause power."
2000.99-1379,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.428,351.849,Why is that?
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,361.625,363.394,I certainly would not suggest that--
2000.99-1379,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,363.394,365.187,Would you tell that to the members of Congress?
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,373.499,374.494,"--I apologize, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,381.239,397.391,"Well then, fine, so your case really turns, it seems to me, on the point that the language used by the Congress that enacted this statute in section 1 was at that time narrower than the language used in section 2."
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,397.391,398.426,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.426,400.819,"Now, what support do you have for that?"
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,400.819,440.097,"I would point the Court first to... for contemporaneous construction of the language I would point the Court to Illinois Central Railroad v. Behrens, a 1914 case, where the Congress clearly recognized... the Court clearly recognized that the Congress had very broad authority under the FELA statute over interstate commerce, recognized that even trains, for instance, moving in intrastate commerce were nevertheless in the channels of commerce, and so when the FELA in 1914 limited its coverage to an employee who was injured while employed in commerce, this Court found that that was a narrower construction--"
2000.99-1379,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,440.097,447.107,"Employed in is not the same as engaged in, but I'd like to go back, first, to the involving term."
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,447.107,447.792,--Yes.
2000.99-1379,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,447.792,458.176,"You're using words and say that... saying that in the second section, involved is a very broad term, and in the first section engaged is a narrow term."
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,458.176,459.259,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,459.259,472.085,"But some of the briefs in this case tell us that involved in is not affecting commerce, that indeed this is the only piece of Federal legislation that uses the words, involved in."
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,472.8,478.55,"To my knowledge it is, and that's what the Court indicated in the Allied Bruce decision."
2000.99-1379,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,478.55,488.217,So... but you're asking us to say that Congress meant in 1925 something different in using these two words.
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,488.217,495.554,"In involving commerce says, as this Court found in Allied Bruce, that it's the functional equivalent of affecting commerce, which is--"
2000.99-1379,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,495.554,496.59,"Well, let's be precise about the words."
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,500.68,502.465,"--Involving commerce, in section 2, the coverage."
2000.99-1379,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,502.465,505.286,That's quite different than involved in commerce.
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,513.179,518.181,"I... I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'm not using the phrase, involved in--"
2000.99-1379,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,518.181,527.727,I think it's important to your case that involving commerce is a broader concept than involved in commerce.
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,527.727,530.0,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,531.537,533.665,Involving commerce means pertaining to commerce.
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,533.665,535.226,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,535.226,550.884,"Involved in commerce means pretty much the same as engaged in commerce, it seems to me, and so if involving commerce is the same as involved in commerce, and involved in commerce is the same as engaged in commerce, you lose."
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,550.884,553.41,"Your Honor, I--"
2000.99-1379,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,553.41,554.286,To put it shortly.
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,554.286,558.775,"--I am not referring to the phrase, involved in commerce."
2000.99-1379,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.775,560.185,Because it doesn't appear.
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,562.201,562.781,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,562.781,565.045,That's the broad coverage of section--
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,565.045,566.886,"Section 2, yes."
2000.99-1379,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.886,567.697,--Of section 2.
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,567.697,568.421,Yes.
2000.99-1379,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.902,585.137,"And they could have said in that section, don't you think... do you think it would have been any different if they had said, seamen involved in commerce, as opposed to engaged in commerce?"
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,585.137,589.715,"As Your Honor has recognized, they did not use involved in."
2000.99-1379,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,610.618,617.319,"But isn't the Congress' notion of the limits of its power, doesn't that explain why they didn't say contract of employment, period?"
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,617.319,637.858,"I would not, Your Honor, because if section 2 is the coverage provision and Congress was making reference to its Commerce Clause power in coverage, there would certainly be no reason for them to make reference to or be concerned by the limits of their Commerce Clause power in drafting an exclusion from the statute."
2000.99-1379,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,639.515,640.934,"Well, can you give us a better explanation?"
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,677.662,692.011,"--I would point to Judge Posner's opinion in the Pryner case out of the Seventh Circuit, in which he concluded that the Seventh Circuit concluded in his opinion that this section 1 exclusion should be narrow."
2000.99-1379,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,706.033,708.208,Then why didn't they just stop with seamen?
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,708.208,716.566,"His... Judge Posner's suggestion is that the railroad industry, the Railway Labor Act was in the works at the time."
2000.99-1379,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,716.566,717.721,Okay.
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,717.721,719.339,It was also a similarly heavily regulated--
2000.99-1379,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,719.339,720.054,All right.
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,720.054,733.247,"--heavily unionized industry, and Judge Posner's opinion goes on that Congress may have anticipated, quite correctly, that motor carriers would also become a heavily regulated industry, and in the--"
2000.99-1379,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,733.247,735.662,What conclusion do you draw from that?
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,742.386,749.651,"--Travel agents, I would... under our interpretation I do not believe that they would be covered because they're not engaged--"
2000.99-1379,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,749.651,750.95,How about ticket agents for railroads?
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,750.95,767.779,"--Railroad employees, to the extent that they fall within the definition of employee, for instance, under the Railway Labor Act, I would submit that because railroad employees is a... or employees is a term under that statute, which includes various employees--"
2000.99-1379,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,767.779,773.935,So you draw a distinction between ticket agents who sell them as employees of the railroad and those who sell them as employees of the travel agent?
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,773.935,775.146,--I draw a distinction--
2000.99-1379,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,775.146,776.708,You think that's what Congress had in mind?
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,776.708,781.077,--I draw the distinction because Congress specifically referred to railroad employees.
2000.99-1379,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,788.917,792.791,--railroad employees engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,792.791,794.002,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,794.002,801.883,"But I take it what you're suggesting, you have to give some content to other class of workers engaged in commerce."
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,805.918,806.699,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,810.025,816.59,"You see, if we accept your view we have to have a jurisprudence of what transportation is."
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,827.921,828.829,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,828.829,830.693,The former is not.
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,830.693,854.631,"I would acknowledge that in order to determine the meaning of the final phrase there, any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce, that we need to... that we need primarily to recognize the doctrine of ejusdem generis, and the fact that it does follow after the references to seamen and railroad employees."
2000.99-1379,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.874,901.368,"Well, I suppose their answer is, Congress has already regulated seamen, they're about to regulate railroad employees, so they want to make very sure that those are excluded, and then they go on to the limits of their Commerce power, which were vague at the time, and give everyone else the same protection that seamen and railroad workers have."
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,901.368,904.709,--I simply don't think that that conforms with the statute.
2000.99-1379,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,933.572,938.596,"Well, skipping the legislative history, Mr. Nagle, why is it so narrow?"
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,951.946,960.225,"Your Honor, I'm not aware of cases that in 1925 would have said, engaged in commerce would go beyond transportation workers."
2000.99-1379,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,988.683,992.35,"So communications workers, those were not included as engaged in commerce?"
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,992.35,995.094,They would not have been included as engaged in commerce.
2000.99-1379,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,995.094,1002.712,"You say as of 1925, the only workers engaged in commerce were those who were engaged in the moving of goods, is that--"
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,1002.712,1005.065,"In the movement of people and goods across State lines, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1005.065,1042.651,"--Well, if that's the case, then I think what we're faced with on your own interpretation is an exclusion which is as complete in relation to the coverage of employees as the inclusion at the beginning of the provision is in relation to commerce in general, and so it seems to me that your argument supports the interpretive theory that Congress was, in fact, in each instance, in the coverage and in the exclusion, legislating to the limits, and if the limits change as to the one, we ought to recognize a change in the limits as to the other."
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,1042.651,1050.387,"I would disagree, Your Honor, in... with respect to the example that Justice Ginsburg just gave, with respect to telephone, telegraph workers."
2000.99-1379,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1068.629,1078.249,"When you are talking about all workers, a lot of water has flowed over the dam or under the bridge since 1925."
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,1078.249,1079.26,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1079.26,1082.736,"I just would like to focus, you to focus for a minute on the consequences."
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,1092.068,1092.8,"Certainly, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1092.8,1096.579,So what bad would happen if we bought the Ninth Circuit?
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,1106.507,1107.207,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1107.207,1107.613,All right.
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,1138.792,1145.69,"Well, certainly the National Labor Relations Act and the Labor Management Relations Act come into play in the collective bargaining context."
2000.99-1379,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1145.69,1148.64,Who wouldn't they have power to protect?
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,1180.273,1191.787,"Your Honor, certainly the Ninth Circuit started its analysis in the Craft case, which was a collective bargaining agreement case--"
2000.99-1379,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1191.787,1195.725,"I mean, I'm interested in a practical fact."
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,1243.799,1261.156,"--The consequences, Your Honor, is that arbitration and the Federal policy favoring arbitration, which is designed to reduce litigation, will lead to a period of tremendous turmoil while the courts are trying to grapple with the application and enforcement of arbitration agreements."
2000.99-1379,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1306.504,1316.37,"Well, even if the FAA doesn't apply to employment contracts, State arbitration rules can... they can be used, can they not?"
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,1316.37,1320.772,"--There are State arbitration rules which vary dramatically from State to State, Your Honor, certainly."
2000.99-1379,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1362.999,1367.17,Why would you have removal to the Federal court unless you had diversity if it's State law that controls?
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,1367.17,1372.352,"--In... there may be cases where there is diversity, just a--"
2000.99-1379,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1372.352,1381.446,"Well, if these are employment relations, wouldn't most of them be diversity... most of them be nondiverse, that is, a worker and employer in the same State?"
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,1381.446,1384.941,"--I would disagree, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1409.603,1411.763,Wouldn't it be the place where the work is performed?
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,1411.763,1413.293,"Well, it may be, Your Honor."
2000.99-1379,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1442.646,1446.529,"Nevertheless, it would be State law that would control, some State law."
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,1446.529,1448.601,--It will be some State law.
2000.99-1379,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1474.549,1496.93,"Mr. Nagle, at the time this... the exclusion was passed, can you tell me whether it was customary to require each party to bear a portion of the cost of the arbitration, so was it... would it have been customary at that time to require employees to pay part of the up front arbitration costs?"
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,1496.93,1498.205,"Your Honor, I didn't hear the beginning."

2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,1500.251,1500.865,--would it have been customary?
2000.99-1379,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1500.865,1501.309,Yes.

2000.99-1379,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1511.65,1536.752,"Could you tell me just for the record, what are the best cases that you have to establish the proposition that at the time this legislation was enacted it was already well established that engaged in commerce was not the limit of the Congress' power over interstate commerce?"
2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,1538.505,1545.285,"Illinois Central Railroad v. Behrens, the Shanks v. Delaware, the railroad case."

2000.99-1379,0,21308,david_e_nagle,,1608.033,1623.508,"I would say that while Congress' motives are not always clear, and the very limited legislative history doesn't provide any guidance on that, what we know is that Mr. Furiceff of the Seamen's Union specifically asked that his union be carved out."
2000.99-1379,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1650.163,1650.742,"Very well, Mr. Nagle."

2000.99-1379,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.231,1694.176,"--Mr. Rubin, if your position is correct, why didn't, in section 1, Congress simply stop with, shall apply to contracts of employment, period?"
2000.99-1379,1,36566,michael_rubin,,1694.176,1709.213,"Congress could have done it that way, but it used the language that was presented to it by Secretary Hoover, who stated... whose letter was both in the 1923 committee hearing and was also reprinted in the 1924 committee hearing."
2000.99-1379,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1710.678,1712.535,When was the bill actually passed?
2000.99-1379,1,36566,michael_rubin,,1713.73,1715.794,--It was enacted into law in February 1925.

2000.99-1379,1,36566,michael_rubin,,1716.288,1746.577,"Secretary Hoover, just 2 weeks after the seamen's union expressed concerns not only about its application to seamen, but according to Mr. Furiceff to seamen, railroad men and sundry other workers in interstate and foreign commerce, wrote a letter to the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee in which he said, if there appear to be objections to the inclusion of workers' contracts, then he proposes that the following language be used."
2000.99-1379,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1754.997,1757.508,"That's very good sleuthing, but I mean, this is a letter."
2000.99-1379,1,36566,michael_rubin,,1787.148,1788.111,--There is--
2000.99-1379,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1788.111,1790.318,"I mean, that is a very difficult thing to explain."
2000.99-1379,1,36566,michael_rubin,,1790.318,1792.981,--There is a linguistic explanation for what they did.
2000.99-1379,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1808.576,1815.259,"I gather he failed, since he sent the letter in 1923 and the bill was passed in 1925."
2000.99-1379,1,36566,michael_rubin,,1816.278,1829.328,"He did... he was successful in getting the language that he proposed included in the bill immediately after he proposed it, but why is the additional language in there, what purpose does it serve, because that, I think, is the response to the Chief Justice's question."

2000.99-1379,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1863.323,1863.903,By Federal statutes.
2000.99-1379,1,36566,michael_rubin,,1863.903,1865.185,Excuse me if I misspoke.

2000.99-1379,1,36566,michael_rubin,,1865.679,1907.556,"Then... then, because the objection from labor, which Secretary Hoover at least urged Congress to overcome, however quickly or not it might have happened, referred more broadly to all classes of employees, because the underlying concern was the disparity in bargaining power, as this Court acknowledged in Prima Paint in its footnote 9, when it referred to the section 1 exclusion, because the disparity in bargaining power applies between all workers and bosses as perceived by labor at the time, and as reflected by Congress in 1932 in the Norris La Guardia Act."
