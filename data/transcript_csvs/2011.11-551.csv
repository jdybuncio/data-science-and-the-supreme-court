2011.11-551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.543,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-551, Salazar, Secretary of the Interior v. Ramah Navajo Chapter."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,8.965,12.007,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,61.051,64.049,"Excuse me, but could the Secretary have done anything else?"
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,64.049,64.673,I'm sorry.
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,65.004,67.251,Could the Secretary have done anything else?
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,77.979,78.993,Right.
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,78.993,86.242,"--so that it's in effect acting -- I don't want to use the word ""arbitrarily"" -- but acting in whatever its best interest is."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,95.16,95.628,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,99.157,100.92,Says it has a policy.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,100.92,101.517,"Yes, and--"
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,101.517,105.623,"The allegation is, is that it's not following it, that it's choosing to pay people some more than others."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,105.623,106.154,--Right.
2011.11-551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,137.251,138.718,Before you do that--
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,138.718,139.092,--Yes.
2011.11-551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,139.092,146.981,"--It was my understanding that that system, that has been described as arbitrary, was not the one that was applicable to the years in question."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,146.981,148.229,That's right.
2011.11-551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,164.283,170.873,"And all within the -- all within the dollar amount that was specified by the Congress in the ""not to exceed"" language."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,170.873,172.765,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2011.11-551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,190.538,193.084,Didn't we have similar language in Cherokee Nation?
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,206.093,207.782,"No, Your Honor."
2011.11-551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,212.278,213.951,"No, I don't mean the Appropriations Act."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,218.198,218.822,--That's right.
2011.11-551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,220.698,225.447,So why does it mean one thing there and mean something else when -- in the Appropriations Act?
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,225.447,232.614,"--Well -- I may not be understanding Your Honor's question, but I -- I think it might be helpful if I explain what was at issue in Cherokee."
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,280.594,285.577,"Well, how -- what was our reference and acceptance of the Ferris doctrine?"
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,307.633,309.255,"--No -- no, Your Honor."
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,309.255,312.285,Where they had an allotment adequate enough to cover that individual.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,312.285,312.566,No.
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,317.487,318.844,I know what the Federal Circuit said.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,324.296,329.84,--Ferris was an appropriation for -- I think it was 40-some thousand dollars for improvements to the Delaware River.
2011.11-551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,393.239,393.52,"No, but -- but there wasn't in Ferris either."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,403.016,415.105,"--Your Honor, I think Ferris is correctly understood -- particularly given this Court's subsequent decisions in Sutton, in Bradley, Leiter, and other cases, Ferris is correctly understood as saying -- and this is the proposition, incidentally, for which the Court's cited Ferris in Cherokee."
2011.11-551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,430.129,433.081,Available subject to appropriations.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,435.846,438.688,"--Well, in Ferris, there were -- in fact, the contract was not made subject to appropriations."
2011.11-551,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,460.788,462.897,"Mr. Freeman, could I try a hypothetical on you?"
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,502.443,502.989,Right.
2011.11-551,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,502.989,506.222,--do those contractors have contractual rights under Ferris?
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,506.222,509.064,"I -- Your Honor, it's going to depend on a couple of things."
2011.11-551,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,519.156,519.655,Yes.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,523.184,525.044,Right.
2011.11-551,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,537.039,555.234,"So -- so either one of these airplane manufacturers is going to not have what he contracted for, or all of them are not going to have what they contracted for, because everybody is going to -- their contract is going to be sliced."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,555.234,567.208,"--And, Your Honor, the reason why this is not a problem in real life is that there are other provisions in your ordinary procurement contracts, under the ordinary kind of contracts that this case is not, that take care of that."
2011.11-551,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,568.708,586.086,"My understanding, Mr. Freeman, is that that is what Ferris said, was that Ferris said in that situation where it turns out that there's a shortfall but where there are contractual commitments, that -- that the government is bound to live up to those contractual commitments."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,589.221,589.721,--No.
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,619.024,625.144,So do the tribes have the right to stop providing the services--
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,625.144,625.861,--Yes.
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,625.861,626.663,--that they've contracted to?
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,626.663,627.329,Yes.
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,627.329,630.365,How do they know that until they know what they're getting?
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,630.365,630.798,Well--
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,630.798,632.365,Meaning they don't know what they're getting.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,632.365,633.233,"--Well, they do know."
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,633.233,641.423,They signed a contract that says you're going to pay them for their services to their members and for their administrative costs.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,648.327,649.443,"No -- no, Your Honor."
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,703.929,713.535,"What does the system do to the 50-odd contracts that Arctic Slope, in its amici brief, points to that are similar to these?"
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,733.08,733.615,--No.
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,734.982,738.067,So how do -- how do we differentiate those 50 other contracts?
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,738.067,745.506,"--Well, I think they were citing a number of different statutes in which the statutes provide that funding is subject to the availability of appropriations."
2011.11-551,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,755.678,762.849,"Well, but that's partly why I asked you my hypothetical, Mr. Freeman, because I sort of wanted to see whether you would distinguish the hypothetical on that basis--"
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,762.849,763.368,--Right.
2011.11-551,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,763.368,763.801,--but you didn't.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,775.359,788.416,"And, Your Honor, it is -- the unique features of this statutory scheme are absolutely important, but I want to -- I took Your Honor's question to be under the general appropriations principles that we are describing, what would the result be?"
2011.11-551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,802.509,805.128,"I'm sorry, I'm not clear on what the hypothetical is."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,815.401,815.934,Right.
2011.11-551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,815.934,817.436,But the contract doesn't mention it.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,831.028,831.878,Right.
2011.11-551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,831.878,838.282,"--and in the contract it says, subject to appropriation, putting the contracting party on notice."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,838.282,839.132,That's right.
2011.11-551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,839.801,840.984,So which were you answering?
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,840.984,856.894,"--I -- with respect to Justice Kagan, I believe we had a colloquy in which I said that because in her hypothetical we were entering into the contract in advance of appropriations, they would have to be made express -- the contracts themselves would have to be subject to the availability of appropriations in the contracts."
2011.11-551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,856.894,861.731,"The words in the contract are ""subject to appropriations""."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,861.731,862.064,Yes.
2011.11-551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,864.416,864.799,Yes.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,864.799,865.049,--yes.
2011.11-551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,865.049,865.399,Okay.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,885.513,894.019,"And, Your Honor, what I was trying to answer is that, in your ordinary contractual scheme, the government solves that problem in a very straightforward way."
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,907.592,909.111,So why don't we let Congress fix it?
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,926.823,927.49,Your--
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,927.49,931.208,"--than it's being, given the interpretation that you're advancing."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,931.208,938.714,"--Your Honor, I think it's important to understand what -- and maybe it would help if I took a minute to explain this -- what Congress was trying to do in this statutory scheme."
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,938.714,948.669,"It was trying -- it was trying to tell the tribes, we are honoring our obligation by paying you the costs, but we are really not going to do it because we are going to let the government give you less?"
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,948.669,949.086,No.
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,950.021,952.271,I have to assume Congress intends what it says.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,963.163,964.413,--Not with -- yes.
2011.11-551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1032.473,1043.865,"To what extent do you rely on -- you haven't mentioned it up till now, but Congress, in these appropriations, said ""not in excess of""."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1043.865,1044.483,--Yes.
2011.11-551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1044.483,1050.035,"It wasn't just a general ""subject to appropriations""."
2011.11-551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1059.243,1061.16,I had exactly the same question.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1069.098,1069.498,Right.
2011.11-551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1072.967,1075.002,But -- but I thought that was what Judge Dyk said--
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1075.002,1075.419,Yes.
2011.11-551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1075.419,1079.638,--was the critical -- the difference between this and even the Cherokee case.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1079.638,1080.09,Right.
2011.11-551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1080.09,1084.042,And so my question is -- is the same as Justice Ginsburg's.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1093.631,1094.833,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2011.11-551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1106.473,1117.429,"When the Congressional Budget Office, or whatever agency it is that figures out whether there is a deficit and, if so, of how much, do they look at ""not to exceed"", and do they take that amount seriously?"
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1117.779,1118.948,"--Oh, oh, absolutely, Your Honor."
2011.11-551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1119.315,1122.483,--But the -- but the position of the Respondents is that it makes no difference.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1122.483,1123.233,--No difference at all.
2011.11-551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1123.233,1125.019,Congress is saying nothing at all.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1125.019,1125.952,"Yes, yes."
2011.11-551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1125.952,1126.402,It really--
2011.11-551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1126.402,1134.708,"So the consequence on the ground is that, if I'm a tribe and I want this money, and I figure out that this is going to cost me $80,000--"
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1134.708,1135.241,Yes.
2011.11-551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1135.241,1144.064,"--I sign a contract and say, this is going to cost me $100,000, because I know there isn't going to be $100,000; there is only going to be $80,000, and that's what I need, right?"
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1144.064,1158.656,"Well, in fact, it can't work that way, Your Honor, because the amounts are limited by statute to the reasonable and allowable costs that are not duplicative of the principal program funds, the funds to run the program--"
2011.11-551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1158.656,1162.042,"Well, but it's -- well, if 80,000 is reasonable, the only way to get that is to ask for 100?"
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1162.042,1162.56,--Right.
2011.11-551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1178.737,1181.439,"--Mr. Freeman, where did these caps come from?"
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1204.987,1208.105,"The caps come from Congress, Your Honor."
2011.11-551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1259.788,1261.407,"That's not really relevant here anyway, is it?"
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1261.407,1261.89,"No, it is not."
2011.11-551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1263.407,1274.731,"What I don't understand is why the language $900,000."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1288.141,1289.891,I don't think in that circumstance there would be any difference.
2011.11-551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1305.853,1312.022,"--Well, I -- I think $900,000 is pretty emphatic, if that's all you appropriate."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1312.022,1312.339,Right.
2011.11-551,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1318.976,1320.528,But that runs you right into Ferris.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1333.336,1341.692,"--Your Honor, Ferris we think is inapplicable just to this type of statutory scheme where we're required to enter into the contracts, and there's a limited sum available."
2011.11-551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1375.747,1385.571,"I take it the Respondents' position is that the contracting officer says, now, this is going to go over the not-to-exceed amount, but not to worry, just sue us under the judgment -- just sue us under the Judgment Act."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1385.571,1385.855,--Right.
2011.11-551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1406.634,1417.573,"It makes sense if you're looking at the reality of the budgeting process because in one case, that one line item appears on the Department of Interior budget; and in the other case, it appears somewhere else in the Judgment Fund budget."
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1420.692,1421.894,"--Well, I don't think so, Your Honor."
2011.11-551,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1461.318,1463.318,But that's true of every contract.
2011.11-551,0,35801,mark_r_freeman,,1471.474,1471.858,--Yes.

2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2138.621,2146.727,"Well, it's hard to make that argument because the ""not to exceed"" language, at least, that comes out of the -- that's in the appropriations provision."
2011.11-551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2151.779,2154.131,Which Ferris did not.

2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2223.624,2224.79,Well--

2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2229.076,2229.528,--Okay.
2011.11-551,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2244.37,2250.089,"--as it says in the contract, you are barred, you are barred from recovering if we don't appropriate enough money."
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2252.641,2258.428,"--Well, it would say that if you don't appropriate enough money for the specific contract, yes."

2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2312.432,2313.565,Right.
2011.11-551,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2313.565,2316.467,"And on the other hand, Congress is saying, don't pay more on them."
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2320.852,2321.186,Right.
2011.11-551,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2321.186,2327.941,Should we create a special rule for this -- why shouldn't we create a special rule for this unique situation?
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2327.941,2336.13,"Because, essentially, what you're doing is putting the backs of this problem -- putting the burden of this problem on the backs of innocent contractors who--"
2011.11-551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2336.13,2336.78,"Well, is it--"
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2336.78,2338.813,--Who entered into in good faith these agreements.
2011.11-551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2338.813,2358.627,"--Well, is it just a question of our creating a new rule; or, rather, is the proposition whether the tribes, when they entered into this, should have realized that because of the peculiarity of these contracts, that they had to be entered into, that the rule which otherwise would apply does not apply?"
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2361.995,2365.364,"Well, I would -- I would suggest a couple things about that."
2011.11-551,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2407.374,2409.44,--But you don't -- you don't have the obligation to perform.
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2419.581,2421.95,"--Well, that -- yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.11-551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2432.056,2432.489,Suppose you did know.
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2448.183,2450.634,"I mean, that is the Southern Ute case."
2011.11-551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2454.837,2456.804,Is it your argument that the answer to that is yes?
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2456.804,2461.991,"The argument is, it appears that Congress intended to require them to enter into that agreement."
2011.11-551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2472.633,2474.516,Isn't this more specific language than the general language?

2011.11-551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2486.224,2486.809,You say it's meaningless.
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2486.809,2487.476,"--No, Justice Kennedy."

2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2552.168,2553.485,No.
2011.11-551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2575.7,2583.437,Do you think it protects these -- these unsophisticated tribes who don't know enough to sue by not allowing anybody to sue?
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2583.437,2585.906,"Well, that -- yes, there is--"
2011.11-551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2585.906,2588.691,Does that make their situation better somehow?
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2588.691,2591.793,"--To be sure, that would not make our situation any better, but--"
2011.11-551,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2591.793,2594.245,My question is whether the cap was meaningless.
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2598.529,2599.648,--No.
2011.11-551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2615.575,2615.908,You just go to the judgment--
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2615.908,2616.125,I'm sorry?
2011.11-551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2616.125,2617.091,--You just go to the judgment fund--
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2617.091,2618.527,Of course.
2011.11-551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2619.26,2619.977,--which makes it meaningless.
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2619.977,2626.447,"--Well, ultimately, it means that the burden of it will not fall on the tribes."
2011.11-551,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2650.212,2659.668,"Mr. Phillips, if you look at this situation, it seems pretty clear that Congress did want to do something, which was to limit the amount of money that was going to the tribes under these contracts."
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2663.556,2664.522,"Oh, sure."
2011.11-551,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2664.522,2667.924,--consistent with this scheme that's set up by the statute?
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2674.262,2686.587,"Well, the easy way would be to impose specific limitations in -- in every one of the contracts, which -- which, frankly, if you read appropriations bills, which I hate to say I have occasionally done--"
2011.11-551,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2686.587,2687.937,"When you say specific limitations, what would that look like?"
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2687.937,2703.697,"--It would look like -- for the agreement between the United States and Ramah Navajo for -- for contract support costs in this particular -- for taking over the police department, the contract support costs shall not exceed $150,000, period."
2011.11-551,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2715.921,2718.54,"For any particular year, are they all entered into it at about the same time?"
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2718.54,2720.908,"--What's that, Justice Alito?"
2011.11-551,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2720.908,2726.193,"For any particular fiscal year, are all of these contracts entered into by a particular date?"
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2726.193,2728.328,"Yeah, nothing is all that easy, obviously."
2011.11-551,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2786.184,2791.636,"Mr. Phillips, how does Congress do this without upsetting the entire scheme?"
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2808.747,2809.364,Right.
2011.11-551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2836.784,2839.069,Do you have to solve it contract by contract?
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2856.947,2858.563,Yes.
2011.11-551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2859.047,2860.732,Or the Secretary will apportion it?
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2864.517,2864.9,--Right.
2011.11-551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2865.6,2867.719,You would prefer contract by contract for your clients.
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2867.719,2868.969,"--Well, I just think it's been noted--"
2011.11-551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2868.969,2869.336,"Oh, absolutely--"
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2869.336,2870.671,"--but, you know, I don't disagree with that."
2011.11-551,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2894.636,2897.655,"I think -- I think this may have been asked, and I'm not sure of the -- I understood the answer."
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2905.511,2906.311,Yes.
2011.11-551,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2912.498,2918.235,"Well, so doesn't it make -- I mean, doesn't the system that the government is operating under make a lot of sense?"
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2934.361,2944.219,"--And -- and, Mr. Chief Justice, if they did that on a -- on a tribe-by-tribe, contract-by-contract basis, I -- I wouldn't have any problem with that, because then you're on notice."
2011.11-551,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2983.311,2983.844,--Are you suggesting that--
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2983.844,2984.713,--that on the tribes.
2011.11-551,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2984.713,2990.515,"--Are you suggesting that Congress has to go through each of those contracts and say, this is how much we are going to appropriate, this is how much?"
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2990.515,2993.735,I think that's -- I actually think that would be the fairer way to do it.
2011.11-551,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3002.425,3007.226,"Well, the question is whether it's the staff in Congress that's going to do it or the staff at the Department of the Interior?"
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3007.226,3008.661,Well--
2011.11-551,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3008.661,3013.046,And I suppose Congress can reasonably determine that the people at Interior know better about how to do it than we do.
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3013.046,3013.463,--Right.
2011.11-551,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3048.119,3048.519,I'm sorry.
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3056.242,3056.875,--Right.
2011.11-551,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3056.875,3059.261,Where is that in the cycle of performance?
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3061.061,3062.463,That's at the beginning of performance.
2011.11-551,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3076.723,3083.21,"So the tribes -- even when the appropriation comes out, they don't know how much the Department has contracted with other tribes."
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3083.21,3083.46,Right.
2011.11-551,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3084.06,3085.995,So they're performing until they get that notice later on.
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3085.995,3086.311,--Exactly.
2011.11-551,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3102.956,3108.408,"Mr. Phillips, do you think -- and the long question here is what did Congress want."
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3127.821,3128.355,Right.
2011.11-551,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3128.355,3133.142,"Do you -- I mean, do you contest the government's view of what Congress wanted here?"
2011.11-551,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3134.775,3147.069,"Well, I think the question is it's unclear what Congress really wanted in this case, and therefore, you ought to construe the -- the scheme in a way that is most favorable to the tribes."
2011.11-551,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3190.812,3191.614,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2011.11-551,2,35801,mark_r_freeman,,3193.998,3197.05,Thank you--
2011.11-551,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3197.05,3206.691,Do you dispute Mr. Phillips' statement that the tribes don't know how much they're getting until some point further into the performance cycle?
2011.11-551,2,35801,mark_r_freeman,,3206.691,3208.924,"--In part, Your Honor."
2011.11-551,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3279.637,3286.226,"I guess what I don't understand about the government's argument, Mr. Freeman, is exactly what the contractual rights of the tribes become."
2011.11-551,2,35801,mark_r_freeman,,3294.463,3294.998,--Yes.
2011.11-551,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3294.998,3297.95,So what do they have a right to in your view?
2011.11-551,2,35801,mark_r_freeman,,3297.95,3300.902,"Well, first of all, let's make clear -- let's make sure that we're not--"
2011.11-551,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3300.902,3302.435,That was -- that was a straightforward question.
2011.11-551,2,35801,mark_r_freeman,,3304.121,3313.96,"--Well, they have a right, Your Honor, in the first instance to the principal promise that's under any ISDA contract, which is we give the amount of money that the Secretary would have provided for the program funds, for operational--"
2011.11-551,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3313.96,3319.031,"No, but what do they have a right to with respect to these additional overhead costs?"
2011.11-551,2,35801,mark_r_freeman,,3319.031,3320.097,--Contract support costs.
2011.11-551,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3326.101,3328.22,What does each individual tribe have a right to?
2011.11-551,2,35801,mark_r_freeman,,3328.22,3335.39,--A proportionate share based on the Secretary's policy for the distribution of these in light of the caps.
2011.11-551,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3336.425,3338.944,So you think they do have a right to a pro rata share?
2011.11-551,2,35801,mark_r_freeman,,3338.944,3339.627,--We think that--
2011.11-551,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3339.627,3348.65,"In other words, the Secretary could not say, oh, you know, these tribes have been doing a better job, so we'll give to them; or these tribes need it more, so we'll give it to them."
2011.11-551,2,35801,mark_r_freeman,,3351.918,3356.656,"--We think there's a contractual right to -- and, in fact, the contracts often reference these policies directly."
2011.11-551,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3366.928,3367.612,I'm sorry.
2011.11-551,2,35801,mark_r_freeman,,3383.021,3387.191,"--We think within a range of reasonable solutions after consultation with the tribes, yes."
2011.11-551,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3387.958,3388.991,You must that question--
2011.11-551,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3388.991,3389.81,The system that's in place does not--
2011.11-551,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3389.81,3391.01,"--You must answer that question ""yes""--"
2011.11-551,2,35801,mark_r_freeman,,3391.01,3391.66,--Yes.
2011.11-551,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3391.66,3394.412,--because that's exactly what the Secretary did.
2011.11-551,2,35801,mark_r_freeman,,3394.412,3395.197,Right.
2011.11-551,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3395.197,3397.281,You explained that it was pro rata.
2011.11-551,2,35801,mark_r_freeman,,3397.281,3397.747,That's right.
2011.11-551,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3398.399,3402.685,This is a very -- this is a very strange kind of contractual right.
2011.11-551,2,35801,mark_r_freeman,,3412.391,3415.575,"--Respectfully -- respectfully, Your Honor, that is an exaggeration."
2011.11-551,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3426.466,3432.887,"No, I'm not contesting -- I mean, clearly you think and the Secretary thinks that there's an obligation to distribute all that money."
2011.11-551,2,35801,mark_r_freeman,,3432.887,3433.337,Right.
2011.11-551,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3433.337,3436.524,And -- and I don't think anybody disagrees with that.
2011.11-551,2,35801,mark_r_freeman,,3441.41,3442.512,"May I answer the question, Your Honor?"
2011.11-551,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3463.425,3465.241,"Thank you counsel, counsel."
