1977.77-560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,68.299,We will hear arguments next in Gardner against Westinghouse.
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,80.38,84.951,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please enter the Court.
1977.77-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,323.307,328.977,Did the possibility remain open that persuaded Judge McCune to change his mind?
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,328.977,334.775,I do not believe we could persuade Judge McCune to change his mind.
1977.77-560,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,402.74,418.925,"What if a friend of mine and I sue for an injunction, and two other friends move to intervene and they are denied?"
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,420.013,421.792,Is that permissive intervention sir?
1977.77-560,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,421.792,424.043,"Yes, and is it appealable?"
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,424.043,429.855,"Under permissive intervention, I do not believe it is appealable."
1977.77-560,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,429.855,434.121,"Even though arguably, it certainly denies them an injunction?"
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,434.121,442.852,"Arguably it does, but they are free right there to institute their own suit and they know about it and there no problem then instituting the suit."
1977.77-560,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,576.05,597.12,"But if had I joined two or three claims in a suit against the defendant and the judge terminates my case with respect to two of my claims and have permanently reduced the kind of a judgment that I can get, I still can appeal unless he cooperates with me."
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,597.12,603.907,If you joint the suits and you have claims?
1977.77-560,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,603.907,609.025,"I have claims and every body agrees that if I prevailed on all three claims, I would have a millions dollars."
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,612.415,615.743,But I do not believe that is injunctive relief sought is it sir?
1977.77-560,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,615.743,619.031,It may not be but it certainly affects the scope of my judgment.
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,619.031,621.85,"Yes sir, but it is the scope of the judgment that is the issue."
1977.77-560,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,639.676,652.666,"So you say that you would be making the same argument if I joined three claims for an injunction, and if I won on all, I think that would be an injunction of a certain scope and if I only win on one it would would be a much narrower injunction."
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,652.666,652.996,It would narrow the injunction.
1977.77-560,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,652.996,659.363,"Then it would be a 1291 case, if the judge dismisses two of my claims?"
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,659.363,674.477,"If you have three claims joined, all asking for injunction and the claim as to injunctions is dismissed one or two of them, I think that is exactly the General Electric Marvel case where the counterclaim came in, he dismissed the counterclaim."
1977.77-560,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,678.798,679.926,Under 1291?
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,679.926,681.327,Under 1292 sir.
1977.77-560,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.327,688.631,"Yes, that requires the judge who takes up, I mean 1292a."
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,688.631,691.352,A1 does not required judge to cooperate.
1977.77-560,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,691.352,692.21,That is right.
1977.77-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,692.21,696.794,"Did you say rule 54, it is not involved at all in a 1292a rule?"
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,696.794,700.454,"No, that is correct Justice Rehnquist."
1977.77-560,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,780.011,789.188,"I know it is true that the old three judge court, you could not get a three judge court unless you ask for preliminary injunction?"
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,789.188,789.754,Yes sir.
1977.77-560,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,789.754,793.83,Which is no longer true so I guess maybe that might be the reason for it.
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,793.83,795.115,I think that is true.
1977.77-560,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,801.248,804.326,It could be but that is not true anymore.
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,804.326,811.546,But it is a good thing to point out that out I think sir that the Expediting Act says particularly preliminary injunction.
1977.77-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,814.552,830.519,"What if you have named six defendants, and you are having a hearing on a preliminary injunction before a District Judge and he grants a motion to dismiss as to one of the six defendants, is that appealable under the 1292a?"
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,830.519,833.417,Are the defendants requesting in a counterclaim injunctive relief?
1977.77-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,833.417,835.722,No.
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,835.722,854.146,"You are requesting, yes that has been held appealable in some circuit cases where they said that the dismissal of three or four defendants where you narrowed the in-scope of the injunctive relief, that would be appealable under 1292a."
1977.77-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,854.146,857.893,You say that goes for just dismissal of one out of ten defendants.
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,857.893,860.653,I am not sure an exact number but?
1977.77-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,860.653,863.752,How can it possibly make any difference as to the exact number?
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,863.752,866.144,I do not think it does conceptually.
1977.77-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,876.273,878.328,Where do you get the word substantial?
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,878.328,881.202,The substantial effect comes from all previous cases.
1977.77-560,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,887.791,896.21,Do you have the case cited that you are referring to in response to Mr. Justice Rehnquists questions?
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,897.816,901.144,"Defendants, that is a circuit case Billed of Buffalo."
1977.77-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,901.144,903.08,That is not from this court then?
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,903.08,907.47,"That particular case is not from this Court, but the substantial effect language is from this Court."
1977.77-560,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.47,909.367,Is that cited in your brief?
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,909.367,911.348,"Billed of Buffalo, yes it is sir."
1977.77-560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,911.348,918.314,"Mr. Hackett, I believe you referred to a dissent by Judge Friendly in Stewart-Warner case, I?"
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,918.314,919.723,Stewart-Warner. v. Westinghouse.
1977.77-560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,919.723,924.001,I cannot seem to find it in your main ?
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,924.001,927.093,I believe we cited Stewart-Warner.
1977.77-560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,927.093,929.483,Do not trouble yourself now.
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,934.485,939.562,"The next subject I would like to move to is the strong policy, that this Court has recognized --"
1977.77-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,939.562,942.238,"Before you move to that, let me ask you one more question."
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,966.59,976.207,There is authority that a delay for continuance in the granting of a preliminary injunction is appealable.
1977.77-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,976.644,977.83,On authority from this Court?
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,977.83,984.184,"No sir, it is not from this Court."
1977.77-560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1135.509,1138.262,"By civil rights appeals, you mean under the statue under that?"
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,1138.262,1147.437,Not just under just Title 7 but it also includes 1983 and other statutes that are civil rights related.
1977.77-560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1149.355,1153.075,It is boarder than just under the 1964 Act as amended?
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,1153.075,1158.335,"Plus, yes."
1977.77-560,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1206.055,1207.168,Is that all appeals or?
1977.77-560,0,39456,robert_n_hackett,,1207.168,1209.647,That is all appeals sir.
1977.77-560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1315.497,1318.329,Very well Mr. Hackett.
1977.77-560,1,35062,leonard_l_scheinholtz,,1320.285,1324.077,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.77-560,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1510.465,1520.262,"If they had asked for a preliminary injunction, you would be making the same argument would you not?"
1977.77-560,1,35062,leonard_l_scheinholtz,,1520.262,1525.22,We would have made the same argument and our position is the same.
1977.77-560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1576.162,1588.909,"What would you say if the complaint does ask for preliminary injunction and for class certification than if the judge denies the class certification, you would still be making the same argument?"
1977.77-560,1,35062,leonard_l_scheinholtz,,1588.909,1589.629,Absolutely.
1977.77-560,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1623.335,1629.953,Would Judge McCune's order rule out the possibility of Mrs. Gardner?s ultimately obtaining on her own an injunction?
1977.77-560,1,35062,leonard_l_scheinholtz,,1629.953,1632.183,"Not at all, not at all Justice Rehnquist."
1977.77-560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1666.548,1677.962,"What about four plaintiffs all of them ask for preliminary relief, the judge grants preliminary relief for two and refuses it for two and the two want to appeal?"
1977.77-560,1,35062,leonard_l_scheinholtz,,1681.193,1685.451,I do not believe that they would have the right appeal it under 1292 (a)(1) Your Honor.
1977.77-560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1685.451,1686.462,Because?
1977.77-560,1,35062,leonard_l_scheinholtz,,1686.462,1696.703,"Because I think that with respect to the, I am sorry, you are saying if these cases are heard on the merits --"
1977.77-560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1696.703,1703.726,"No, he just grants a preliminary injunction for two of the plaintiffs and denies if for the two of the others."
1977.77-560,1,35062,leonard_l_scheinholtz,,1703.726,1706.566,"I think that that would be appealable, yes."
1977.77-560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1713.427,1727.575,"I suppose, if on the preliminary injunction hearing, the judge with respect to two of the parties says, you just do not have any claim anyway so I am dismissing your claim?"
1977.77-560,1,35062,leonard_l_scheinholtz,,1727.575,1737.061,That would the same but the difference between that case and this case is that there the action of the Court has an immediate impact.
1977.77-560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1746.972,1754.565,But you are determining that there are a lot of unnamed plaintiffs who cannot have an injunction?
1977.77-560,1,35062,leonard_l_scheinholtz,,1754.565,1756.812,"No sir Your Honor, we are not doing that."
1977.77-560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1756.812,1759.997,Or there is a lot of unnamed plaintiffs who cannot have any relief at all?
1977.77-560,1,35062,leonard_l_scheinholtz,,1759.997,1763.83,No all we are saying is that this case cannot proceed as a Class Action.
1977.77-560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1973.908,1985.989,"I filed a complaint asking for a permanent injunction and there is a motion to dismiss it for want of jurisdiction, granted."
1977.77-560,1,35062,leonard_l_scheinholtz,,1988.555,1991.935,I would say that is appealable under 1291.
1977.77-560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1991.935,1999.995,What if I am a defendant and I file a counterclaim and ask for an injunction?
1977.77-560,1,35062,leonard_l_scheinholtz,,2001.707,2009.081,Again I think that that would be appealable before the reason as a final order with respect to the counterclaim.
1977.77-560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2009.081,2011.36,That is what this Court held.
1977.77-560,1,35062,leonard_l_scheinholtz,,2011.36,2013.82,That is what this Court held in GE vs. Marvel.
1977.77-560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2013.82,2017.846,It held it was appealable under the predecessor of 1292.
1977.77-560,1,35062,leonard_l_scheinholtz,,2017.846,2034.222,"Well, you maybe right on that Your Honor, it did but the different between the GE v. Marvel case, in this case is there when the Court dismisses the counterclaim seeking injunctive relief, it is acting now and immediately."
1977.77-560,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2132.473,2145.734,"Do think that an order granting a preliminary injunction and requiring the plaintiff to post a $50,000.00 bonds is appealable by the plaintiff as to the question of the amount of the bond?"
1977.77-560,1,35062,leonard_l_scheinholtz,,2145.734,2149.712,That is the collateral order doctrine or something like the collateral order doctrine.
1977.77-560,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2268.668,2275.605,It is not you argument in giving us those figures that those figures themselves are the result of?
1977.77-560,1,35062,leonard_l_scheinholtz,,2275.605,2278.04,"Not at all, what we are saying is that they are bad."
1977.77-560,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2291.214,2299.76,Are there some cases on the appealability of orders denying intervention in injunctive suits?
1977.77-560,1,35062,leonard_l_scheinholtz,,2307.263,2311.251,Yes there are.
1977.77-560,2,39456,robert_n_hackett,,2980.189,2986.261,Yes.
1977.77-560,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3079.814,3082.483,You say your client is never going to get an injunction?
1977.77-560,2,39456,robert_n_hackett,,3082.483,3083.907,No my client sir.
1977.77-560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3127.826,3137.394,"Assuming the final judgment is made, the Class Action has been reinstated what happens?"
1977.77-560,2,39456,robert_n_hackett,,3137.394,3139.918,That is true Mr. Justice Marshall.
1977.77-560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3145.331,3150.922,"If you had not stopped it when you did stop it, will it go on and tried it as an individual?"
1977.77-560,2,39456,robert_n_hackett,,3150.922,3151.937,Yes sir.
1977.77-560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3151.937,3157.39,"Just before the judgment, the judge says look I have decided I was wrong about that Class Action."
1977.77-560,2,39456,robert_n_hackett,,3159.534,3160.454,Yes that could be happen.
1977.77-560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3160.454,3163.595,Could he do that?
1977.77-560,2,39456,robert_n_hackett,,3163.595,3176.965,"I believe that under Mr. Justice Stewarts language in United Airlines vs. McDonald, there is some doubt that after you strip that class of its character?"
1977.77-560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3176.965,3182.178,"I thought the rule said specifically, the rule says that it can be."
