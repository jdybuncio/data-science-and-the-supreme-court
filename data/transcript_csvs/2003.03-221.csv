2003.03-221,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,37.235,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 03-221, Cheryl Pliler v. Richard Herman Ford."
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,14.389,15.992,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-221,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,65.696,70.371,Is there some peculiar virtue about the word advisements as opposed to advice?
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,70.371,73.473,"No, not in this particular situation, Your Honor."
2003.03-221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,80.505,97.598,"Before we get to that, do you agree that some kind of remedy is required here, warnings or no warnings, as a result of the fact that what the judge did tell the... the defendant in this case seems to have been just affirmatively misleading."
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,111.87,117.283,We don't believe that the advice was misleading or erroneous in this case.
2003.03-221,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,117.283,118.575,"Well, is... is there any chance--"
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,142.609,145.831,"No, we don't believe it would be."
2003.03-221,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.831,147.864,"Well, shouldn't it be?"
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,169.618,175.032,"If that were the case, perhaps that would be the situation or perhaps that would be the remedy."
2003.03-221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,186.923,188.903,But it wasn't without prejudice.
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,211.409,212.361,No.
2003.03-221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,221.89,232.248,"Do you think any person in the prisoner's position would conceivably have understood the statement as you have just defined the term, without prejudice?"
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,232.248,233.399,Yes.
2003.03-221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,233.86,243.586,"I mean, maybe somebody who... who had three law degrees could figure that out, but a defendant standing certainly isn't going to understand that."
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,243.586,249.662,"--Well, that... that has always been the procedure when courts have addressed mixed petitions."
2003.03-221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,252.844,255.608,And they have always made a statement that was affirmatively misleading?
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,255.608,259.749,"There is no statement here, we believe, that was affirmatively misleading."
2003.03-221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,259.749,262.021,"I mean, we... we may agree with you that the court does not have to give warnings."
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,269.015,270.317,"Well, the court--"
2003.03-221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,270.317,272.007,We need to... let me put it this way.
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,295.945,296.944,--Not necessarily.
2003.03-221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,316.738,323.102,May I ask you about the unexhausted claims that have to go first to the State court?
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,366.594,368.707,I think there are two responses to that.
2003.03-221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,400.179,400.559,So not added back.
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,423.439,426.791,--That procedure guts Rose v. Lundy and AEDPA.
2003.03-221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,441.682,448.406,"But coming... with the ability to come back, which was not a problem then because there was no statute of limitations."
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,448.406,454.37,"Well, even prior to the enactment of AEDPA, refiled petitions would not necessarily be considered on their merits."
2003.03-221,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,472.985,478.819,"I mean, just to elaborate on Justice Ginsburg's question, what is your answer to her point?"
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,530.335,544.907,"--Because Rose v. Lundy contemplates the unexhausted claims will be presented in State court first, and it enforces or promotes that through what this Court has referred to in Rose v. Lundy as a rigorously enforced total exhaustion requirement."
2003.03-221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.247,581.201,I guess Rose v. Lundy could have... could have said what is now being proposed if it had wanted to.
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,589.189,590.428,--Yes.
2003.03-221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,595.473,596.753,So... so you think--
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,604.53,606.109,"That's correct, but--"
2003.03-221,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,606.109,615.067,"Well, presumably Congress knew about Rose v. Lundy when it enacted AEDPA and didn't indicate any change in Rose v. Lundy."
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,615.067,615.257,--No.
2003.03-221,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,625.115,636.481,"Is... is there any indications when they passed AEDPA, that the Congress was aware of the fact that like two-thirds of all petitions are filed incorrectly in the Federal courts because they don't know where to go?"
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,649.361,659.59,--There's nothing in the congressional record to indicate that as to what individual Members of Congress had before them in terms of studies or other data at the time AEDPA was crafted.
2003.03-221,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,665.783,675.448,"Counsel, you're asking us in this case to say that the stay and abeyance procedure is... is not a valid procedure."
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,675.448,676.009,--Yes.
2003.03-221,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,676.009,679.772,"And yet, it didn't occur in this case."
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,689.979,691.321,Because it's--
2003.03-221,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,691.321,695.813,"I mean, it's just you're asking us to reach beyond the confines of this case in doing that."
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,695.813,709.283,--Because the correctness of the Ninth Circuit's advisement requirements can't be adequately addressed or intelligently addressed without understanding what it is they promote and without understanding what the practice is of the Ninth Circuit.
2003.03-221,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,709.283,709.454,I would think it would.
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,721.582,722.544,"Well, because--"
2003.03-221,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,722.544,730.121,"Six of the seven circuits allow it I know, but I don't see how we... we get into it here."
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,730.121,754.667,"--Because the Ninth Circuit majority concluded that the failure to advise in the manner in which they thought was appropriate was improper and prejudicial because they assumed that had the advisement been given with regard to the dismissal of unexhausted claims as a precondition to the consideration of a motion to stay, that Ford would have dismissed his unexhausted claims."
2003.03-221,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,769.209,780.088,"But we could rule, I suppose, that the advice was unnecessary when leaving open the question of whether the stay and abey proceeding is permissible or desirable, whatever."
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,780.279,782.259,"Yes, I believe that's true."
2003.03-221,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,782.259,785.991,And there's also a second question presented about the relation back.
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,790.906,791.046,Yes.
2003.03-221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,822.979,830.776,But the Ninth Circuit did that only because their own precedents said all you can stay is the Federal claim.
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,841.704,852.711,"Yes, but in doing so, what the Ninth Circuit majority did was have a subsequent proceeding relate back to a prior proceeding that had been dismissed and was no longer pending."
2003.03-221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,852.711,865.811,"If the Ninth Circuit decided or if we decided that equitable tolling is permissible in this case, what... what procedure should be adopted to reflect that rule?"
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,875.301,883.696,"Well, it's... it's difficult to say because equitable tolling has been applied differently in different situations."
2003.03-221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,916.698,921.062,Let... let me ask you this somewhat related question.
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,968.712,980.703,"It certainly wouldn't appear to be the case under AEDPA because AEDPA doesn't toll the limitation period during pendency of the Federal habeas proceeding, and that's very clear, we believe, from the statute itself."
2003.03-221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1008.439,1014.484,But... but in my hypothetical district judge number one rules in a week.
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,1022.19,1032.505,"Yes, because I think the petitioner has to contemplate the vagaries of any kind of judicial interpretation or ruling on his matters, and that may depend upon the particular court."
2003.03-221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1124.802,1147.107,"Well, of course, that... that would... that may well be the Ninth Circuit rule, but you could also have a stay and abey rule in which in order to... to grant the petitioner time to go back and... and litigate the State claims, he has to make a... a showing first that there is some reason to excuse his delay, in other words, a... a kind of an equitable tolling argument at the threshold."
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,1156.975,1168.455,"Well, I think the problem with that approach, first of all, with regard to the application of equitable tolling to AEDPA, is that AEDPA itself doesn't contemplate the application of such tolling."
2003.03-221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1168.455,1172.479,So you're... you're saying that... that there cannot be equitable tolling under AEDPA?
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,1172.479,1179.744,"It certainly seems foreclosed by this Court's holdings in United States v. Beggerly, United States v. Brockamp, and Lampf v. Gilbertson."
2003.03-221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1272.832,1288.593,"Leaving aside tolling, you said something I didn't quite grasp; that is, if you allowed the Federal petition to sit while you went to State court, all this is well within the 12-month period."
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,1307.292,1308.093,I'm sorry.
2003.03-221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1383.871,1391.849,Are you now questioning the propriety of... let's just stick with the Rose v. Lundy the way it was.
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,1410.385,1415.58,"--Well, this Court has never intimated that that would be appropriate procedure."
2003.03-221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1417.44,1418.782,That it would or wouldn't?
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,1418.782,1419.423,--It would not.
2003.03-221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1435.625,1446.774,"So are you saying that the Federal court would have no choice under the... we'll keep the Federal claim in Federal court, no choice but to go full steam ahead on that claim?"
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,1446.774,1470.209,"I think so because to do otherwise would be inconsistent with Rose v. Lundy, rule 9(b), but it would also be inconsistent with AEDPA because AEDPA contains a provision in section 2244(b)(1) of title 28 of the United States Code that requires claims that are dismissed from an initial petition and submitted as a second or successive application to be dismissed."
2003.03-221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1516.44,1526.687,"Am I wrong in thinking some Federal courts did that and after exhaustion was over, the case came back and... with now the State claims added in?"
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,1526.687,1528.219,"No, you're not wrong in thinking that."
2003.03-221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1533.945,1545.102,"The Third Circuit follows what I... I suggested to you might, in this post-AEDPA world, be appropriate, that is, to say we're going to stay... we're going to let the whole complaint sit here."
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,1545.102,1545.783,Yes.
2003.03-221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1545.783,1547.666,Not... we're not going to lop off the State claims.
2003.03-221,0,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,1551.059,1553.422,"Yes, that's correct."
2003.03-221,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1559.068,1560.457,"Very well, Mr. Roadarmel."
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,1565.232,1566.924,"Yes, you are, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-221,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1599.796,1612.295,"Well, isn't it reasonable to... at least one view, to think that Congress... we think Congress legislates in the light of existing law or existing rules from this Court, that that's exactly what Congress intended?"
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,1612.295,1614.158,"No, I disagree, Your Honor."
2003.03-221,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1672.726,1679.591,"Well, if... if you say there's no need for a warning, then do you think the Ninth Circuit was mistaken here to require a warning?"
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,1679.591,1682.773,"No, I don't, not under the circumstances of this case."
2003.03-221,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1737.682,1747.648,Were there... were there any potential equitable tolling arguments open to him other than based on the so-called misleading advice?
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,1747.648,1749.411,"Well, I believe that there were."
2003.03-221,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1749.411,1752.874,"In other words, was it absolutely clear at the time that he could not come back?"
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,1752.874,1753.405,Well--
2003.03-221,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1753.405,1756.596,Do you agree he had no... no basis to argue that he could come back?
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,1756.596,1767.014,"--Well, the issue is that he had a potential argument, but I don't know what Mr. Ford knew at that time in terms of the availability of equitable tolling."
2003.03-221,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1828.028,1837.044,"What should be the rule if the habeas petitioner files in... in Federal habeas on claims one, two and three, and those have already been exhausted?"
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,1850.113,1860.18,"Well, if it's filed untimely, I don't know how it would absent a stay unless the court granted a stay--"
2003.03-221,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1860.18,1866.925,So the court... so the Federal court always has to file a stay when it knows that claim four has just been filed in the State court?
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,1866.925,1867.035,--No.
2003.03-221,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1883.257,1888.609,But the... the Ninth Circuit opinion suggests that a district court really doesn't have discretion.
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,1892.092,1901.388,"Under Ninth Circuit precedent, the... the Ninth Circuit believed that a district court lacks discretion to stay a mixed petition."
2003.03-221,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1922.145,1928.677,"So if district judge had advised the petitioner of the Ninth Circuit law, the district judge would have been wrong."
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,1928.677,1930.228,I'm sorry.
2003.03-221,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1930.808,1942.176,"If the district court... based on what you say, if the district court had advised the petitioner of what the Ninth Circuit law was, the district court would have been wrong, because you say the Ninth Circuit is wrong."
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,1942.176,1953.646,"I'm not... I'm saying that the Ninth Circuit followed its own precedent, but I'm saying that the power to stay is broader than what the Ninth Circuit precedent currently allows."
2003.03-221,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1955.537,1962.702,"Well, all this... all this seems to me a good argument that the... that the district courts shouldn't have to advise clients of their rights."
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,1965.296,1971.698,--I believe that that's impossible without further information regarding the choices under Rose.
2003.03-221,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1997.917,2006.663,But it's... it can be a very complicated question to know what time is left to make a State claim.
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2014.967,2020.893,"--Justice O'Connor, I agree with you, but I'm not advocating that the court calculate the limitations period."
2003.03-221,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2023.685,2027.947,"Well, the... the Ninth Circuit ruling seems very broad."
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2034.562,2042.779,"--I'm... I'm requesting a specific notification, not an advisement, but a warning, and I believe that there is a distinction."
2003.03-221,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2107.455,2107.986,If that's so--
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2133.884,2135.676,"Well, I agree with Your Honor completely."
2003.03-221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2182.12,2190.444,"Before... before we... we launch into the... into the stay alternative, I... I'd like to finish up the... the advisement alternative."
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2221.597,2226.429,--Because of the right of Federal habeas corpus review.
2003.03-221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.255,2260.842,"Well, there are a lot of other significant rights that... that pro se litigants bring before courts, and... and I'm... I'm just resistant to the idea that, in addition to the requirements that the Constitution imposes to give counsel to... to litigants, we're... we're going to add on that a... a requirement in some situations that the court act as counsel for the litigants."
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2260.842,2262.044,I understand.
2003.03-221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.051,2273.042,"Well, what is that?"
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2280.987,2283.13,"That's true, but this Court--"
2003.03-221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2283.13,2289.656,"But that's... that's not a matter of, you know, legal advice as to how you should proceed with your litigation."
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2289.656,2294.23,"--That's true, and that constitutes an advisement as distinguished from a warning."
2003.03-221,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2302.966,2306.128,But that was... that was when the court was doing something on its own.
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2306.128,2315.744,"True, and this is... this... the advisement or the warning that I'm requesting is done in order to effectuate the choices under Rose."
2003.03-221,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2315.744,2316.324,"Well, I think it--"
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2338.571,2343.864,"Well, in light of Rose v. Lundy, I believe that the options afforded are misleading."
2003.03-221,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2354.493,2359.234,"How do you know what the Court intended in Rose v. Lundy, other than reading the opinion?"
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2359.234,2365.849,"Well, it appears that... that beginning with the line of cases, Rose starts a line of cases."
2003.03-221,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2382.269,2384.903,But that was an... was an interpretation of AEDPA.
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2384.903,2386.452,"--Yes, exactly."
2003.03-221,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2410.067,2413.981,"Well, but it... it certainly makes it more difficult for the defendant."
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2419.604,2428.38,"That's true, but Congress also never prohibited the choices that have been afforded under Rose."
2003.03-221,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2460.032,2464.566,But there wasn't a second petition there to which it could relate back.
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2467.581,2468.659,--That's true.
2003.03-221,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2468.659,2470.121,--order of the Ninth Circuit.
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2475.947,2490.937,"Unless, of course, one follows the rationale of the opinion, which is that the petitions should have been stayed not dismissed, and therefore to restore Mr. Ford to the position he was in previously--"
2003.03-221,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2490.937,2492.639,But there wasn't a stay order.
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2499.595,2515.226,"--That's true, and other cases faced with that kind of situation have either used their equitable authority to reinstate the improperly dismissed petitions or have used the doctrine of nunc pro tunc, either of which would be available."
2003.03-221,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2517.947,2526.362,"Well, why would... I mean, have we sanctioned the use of, quote, nunc pro tunc, closed quote, in similar situations to this?"
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2526.362,2530.125,"--In Anthony v. Cambra, that's what the Ninth Circuit used."
2003.03-221,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2530.125,2531.347,I said have we.
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2531.347,2541.503,"No, I don't believe it has, Your Honor, and I believe the reason for that is because this is a relatively... this case... this is the first case to have gone this far."
2003.03-221,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2541.503,2571.243,"But in any case, your client would be in exactly the same position that the Ninth Circuit tried to put your client in if the Ninth Circuit had simply said a... a mistake was made, either because there was misleading advice or because there was a failure to give the advice that we say should have been given, and we're simply going to put him back in the position that he would have been in had there not been that mistake, i.e., put him back with a petition before the district court just as there was within the... the 1-year period."
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2571.243,2572.354,"Yes, taking--"
2003.03-221,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2572.354,2582.342,"So... so the relation back is simply... well, it's... I guess it's one way of explaining something that the court, on your view simply under its power to correct an error, could have done."
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2582.342,2583.213,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
2003.03-221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.213,2601.164,"On your view, Ms. Bassis, would there be any disincentive for a litigant to bring a mixed petition, to come to the Federal court first rather than to go to the State courts, which is certainly what... what AEDPA contemplates?"
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2602.987,2603.357,Well--
2003.03-221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2603.357,2608.191,What does he... what does he have to lose by just marching off to Federal court with all his claims?
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2608.191,2611.414,"--Well, first of all, he loses precious time."
2003.03-221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2641.504,2643.514,"Well, it isn't they're in their interest, but they're not lawyers."
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2643.514,2643.715,That's--
2003.03-221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2643.715,2647.167,"And they say, you know, I don't know which ones need exhaustion and which ones don't."
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2655.464,2666.75,"--I don't think AEDPA contemplated that... well, in fact, I believe AEDPA recognized the possibility that mixed petitions would be filed."
2003.03-221,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2701.453,2706.217,Would... would you have a reason to object to a... a modification of what the Ninth Circuit was talking about?
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2761.925,2762.296,--No.
2003.03-221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2777.448,2782.102,Justice Souter is suggesting that it must take into account that factor.
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2782.102,2784.944,"--I believe it already does, but I... I would have no problem with that."
2003.03-221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2784.944,2786.404,What... what would be a good excuse?
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2788.708,2789.566,No.
2003.03-221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2789.566,2793.329,Would it... would it be an excuse that I'm not a lawyer and I didn't realize I had to exhaust?
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2793.329,2794.4,No.
2003.03-221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2808.63,2810.653,He's bringing the claim in Federal court.
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2810.653,2811.351,--Yes.
2003.03-221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2811.351,2812.453,How could he not know the claim?
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2827.9,2840.82,"Well, for example, a defendant may have had a direct appeal, but it doesn't mean that other claims such as ineffective assistance of counsel claims, which normally must be raised in a writ, have been pursued at all."
2003.03-221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2881.512,2893.841,"Well, I don't... I don't certainly see that condition in... in the procedure that the Ninth Circuit has adopted, that it... there has to be some justification for not having exhausted."
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2898.736,2899.956,"--No, it isn't, but Your Honor--"
2003.03-221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2899.956,2900.226,That's new to me.
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2900.226,2919.86,"--a stay is discretionary, and in deciding whether or not a stay is appropriate, the court takes into factors such as a petitioner's dilatoriness, whether or not they're attempting to evade a time limitation, whether or not their efforts are in good faith."
2003.03-221,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2925.925,2933.671,"But you... and you disagree then with the Ninth Circuit which said, in effect, that it is... the district courts don't have discretion."
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2934.853,2935.724,No.
2003.03-221,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2955.739,2970.42,But perhaps you and I don't read the Ninth Circuit's opinion the same way insofar as the... the authority of a district court to... in its discretion to turn down a stay application.
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,2973.851,2973.981,No.
2003.03-221,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3025.067,3041.048,"Can you give us any idea, perhaps anecdotally, about the number of... of times we have mixed petition arguments or questions about mixed petitions?"
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,3060.594,3067.509,"Well, AEDPA was supposed to simplify things, but it was adopted 8 years ago and we're still litigating nearly every sentence of AEDPA."
2003.03-221,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3073.423,3080.819,Do... do you have any idea of the... the number of instances in which there's an allegation of a mixed petition?
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,3080.819,3089.333,I know that 57 percent of the... of cases are dismissed for failure to exhaust.
2003.03-221,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3089.333,3090.344,About 57?
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,3090.344,3091.105,57.
2003.03-221,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3091.105,3095.91,And is this in the Central District or the California or all over?
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,3095.91,3106.178,"I think it's all over, and in fact, the statistics comes from this Court's opinion in Duncan, and I believe it's Justice Breyer's opinion where he cites to the statistics."
2003.03-221,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3106.178,3113.333,"I think it was something like... I got it from some official source... said there were about two-thirds were actually filed in the wrong court, namely the Federal court."
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,3116.904,3118.897,"Right, for failure to exhaust."
2003.03-221,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3118.897,3119.208,That's where it came from.
2003.03-221,1,34179,lisa_m_bassis,,3119.548,3150.106,"So what I am proposing is that the Court permit... approve a stay of mixed petitions, but if not, that it gives a warning to pro se litigants about how the Rose choices are effectuated, that it gives the Rose choices and then it continues to apprise the defendant about the running of the 1-year limitations period, and that they essentially must calculate the limitations period on their own."
2003.03-221,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3153.319,3154.511,"--Thank you, Ms. Bassis."
2003.03-221,2,38263,paul_monroe_roadarmel_jr,,3156.711,3167.06,"With the Court's permission, I'd like to make four brief points."
2003.03-221,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3406.469,3408.439,"Thank you, Mr. Roadarmel."
