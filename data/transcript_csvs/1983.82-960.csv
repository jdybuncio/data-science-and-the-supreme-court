1983.82-960,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,3.502,We'll hear arguments next in National Labor Relations board against City Disposal Systems.
1983.82-960,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,366.601,368.712,Does the record show why?
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,368.712,387.105,"The record indicates, in Respondent's Exhibit 10, which is not printed in the Joint Appendix, but which is in the record, that they found no merit to the grievance."
1983.82-960,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,394.268,417.763,"Mr. Come, if then the employee had filed a 301 suit against the employer for an illegal discharge, in order to win that, he would have had to prove a breach of the fiduciary duty that the Union owed him, wouldn't he?"
1983.82-960,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,424.969,430.082,"Under fact cites that is right, Your Honor."
1983.82-960,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,430.082,436.677,"So that... But, instead of doing that, he now files with the Board, is that it?"
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,436.677,439.529,He filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Board.
1983.82-960,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,452.856,454.709,Mr. Come?
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,454.709,455.858,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-960,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,455.858,470.378,I read the Administrative Law Judge's findings fairly carefully and I am interested to know what is the Board's position as to the reason that the Administrative Law Judge assigned that the company used to discharge Brown?
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,482.765,527.916,The Administrative Law Judge found that Brown had been discharged for asserting his contract rights not to drive an unsafe truck; that he had a good faith and a reasonable belief at least that the truck was unsafe and that under the Board's Interboro Doctrine the assertion of a reasonable and good faith contract claim is concerted activity protected by Section 7 of the Act.
1983.82-960,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,527.916,537.413,"--What if the company contend that Brown was discharged for failing to obey an order, an order to get back and drive 244?"
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,540.585,571.546,"I think it would, Your Honor, because the... If, in fact, Brown was engaging in concerted activity protected by Section 7, the mere fact that the company classified as as insubordination would not remove the protection of Section 7."
1983.82-960,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.654,612.062,You are saying Brown is purported to exercise the rights given him by a promise in the contract?
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,612.062,613.043,That is correct.
1983.82-960,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,613.043,615.044,A promise that the employer made.
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,615.044,616.426,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-960,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,616.426,629.894,"Now, suppose there weren't any specific promises about equipment, but the employer promised never to discharge anyone without proper cause."
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,693.905,717.38,"Well, I think that you may have to separate out a couple of problems in your hypothetical example."
1983.82-960,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,717.38,719.413,"It has them there, I know that."
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,719.413,746.76,The Board's basic position is that the right of an individual to assert a contract right in good faith and in reason--
1983.82-960,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.76,750.853,Such as the right not to be fired without good cause even.
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,750.853,763.582,--is protected by Section 7 against reprisal for asserting that right.
1983.82-960,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,858.635,859.984,And that is the Interboro Doctrine?
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,859.984,861.504,That is the Interboro Doctrine.
1983.82-960,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,861.504,862.114,Okay.
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,892.144,913.49,"I don't think it would in that circumstance, Your Honor, because the contract there specifically made it clear, as I understand the example, that--"
1983.82-960,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,913.49,930.23,"Well then don't you have a problem with the Board's treatment of the contract here, because, as I understand the contract provision that he was working under, it didn't provide that his refusal to work on the basis of safety would need only be honestly and reasonably held."
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,939.276,982.863,"--No, Your Honor, that is not the position that we are urging here on our reading of the Administrative Law Judge's findings which the Board adopted, although to be sure, in some Board decisions, there is some confusion as to whether the Board is applying a purely subjective standard or whether it requires that the refusal not only be in good faith, but reasonable."
1983.82-960,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1018.137,1026.464,"Well, is it slightly reasonable to protect the people in Detroit from hugh sludge trucks running around without brakes?"
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1026.464,1055.672,"I believe it is, Your Honor, and for that reason I believe that is why the parties negotiated the kind of contract clause that you have here which guarantees the employee not only a safe truck, but it provides that it shall not be a violation of this agreement where employees refuse to operate such equipment unless such refusal is unjustified."
1983.82-960,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1133.922,1138.787,Would he have had to have protested at all to invoke the Interboro Doctrine?
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1138.787,1152.375,"Well, I think he has to give the employer some indication that it is a contract right that he is claiming."
1983.82-960,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1152.375,1168.697,"Well, suppose he does exactly what he is told up to a point, then just refuses, walks off, gets fired, just the way it happened here, except he doesn't make any statement at all at the time and the next day he files a grievance, as I believe he did here."
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1175.441,1220.96,"I think that it would be because, as a matter of fact, even the courts that have disapproved or rejected the Interboro Doctrine and there is a conflict in the circumstance, feel that to discharge an employee for filing a grievance is a violation of 8(a)(1) because filing a grievance is, though it is filed by an individual employee, concerted activity."
1983.82-960,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1220.96,1232.948,Would the Board recognize any distinction between firing this person... firing him because he filed a grievance as opposed to firing him because he refused to carry out a lawful order?
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1232.948,1263.659,"Well, in some cases, it would, but as I tried to explain, in many cases where it would be a breach of a no-strike clause to refuse to work the activity would forfeit the protection of Section 7."
1983.82-960,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1299.413,1303.204,"But, the Interboro Doctrine isn't limited to safety at all, is it?"
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1303.204,1331.974,"No, it is not limited to safety, but the point I am trying to make is that the Interboro Doctrine deals essentially with the issue that is here; namely, whether or not an individual's assertion of a contract right in good faith and reasonably based is concerted activity for purposes of Section 7."
1983.82-960,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1331.974,1344.57,"Of course, if the answer is yes, as you say it is, and the Board thinks it is, then the Board immediately proceeds to determine whether this contract right, which is a protected right, has been violated."
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1374.02,1380.234,Then you get into the further question--
1983.82-960,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1380.234,1380.945,Yes.
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1380.945,1387.31,--as to the circumstances under which the Board will defer to the arbitrators.
1983.82-960,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1387.31,1398.636,Suppose the employee had never asked the Union to... anything and suppose no grievance had been filed.
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1421.671,1424.723,He could.
1983.82-960,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1424.723,1434.911,"So, the employee never needs to exercise the machinery."
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1439.633,1447.24,"No, it would not."
1983.82-960,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1467.573,1483.652,"Well, Mr. Come, does the Board make it a practice, when the employee, in fact, initiates a grievance procedure, does the Board make it a practice to pursue a complaint in cases like this?"
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1493.6,1519.786,For a time under the Collier Doctrine the Board would defer in these situations where there was available a grievance arbitration.
1983.82-960,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1519.786,1523.85,And tell the employee go that route even if he hadn't started?
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1523.85,1527.32,If that were available.
1983.82-960,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1550.985,1553.169,By an arbitrator.
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1553.169,1554.528,By an arbitrator.
1983.82-960,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1554.528,1563.034,"You mean if initiated when the complaint is filed, but not completed, that is the arbitration proceeding, the Board then proceeds?"
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1563.034,1565.227,"Well, if it has been initiated, they will wait."
1983.82-960,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1565.227,1566.616,They will wait.
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1568.519,1573.091,"Well, it wasn't completed in any formal--"
1983.82-960,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1573.091,1574.601,They filed a grievance.
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1581.495,1599.117,"--Well, the Union has, as Your Honor pointed out, I believe, a lot of reason why they do not proceed with the grievance."
1983.82-960,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1599.117,1606.584,"But, their regular policy now is that not to defer in circumstances like... in this case."
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1606.584,1608.043,That is correct.
1983.82-960,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1608.043,1617.741,"Even if a grievance has been filed, it has been rejected by the employer, and then the Union refuses to carry it any further, the Board regularly does not defer."
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1638.454,1665.111,"Well, the Board will look to see whether that complies with the Spielberg criteria, whether or not the procedure was fair and regular, whether the determination is consistent with the polices of the Act and whether the arbitrator, in fact, decided the statutory issue."
1983.82-960,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1665.111,1668.373,"So, they sort of sit in review of the arbitrator?"
1983.82-960,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1668.373,1678.679,"Well, not to determine his fact findings, redetermine his fact findings."
1983.82-960,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1775.733,1784.289,Mr. Ufer?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,1784.289,1787.42,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-960,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1818.522,1820.402,I thought he was told to go home.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,1820.402,1824.074,His final instruction by both supervisors--
1983.82-960,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1824.074,1826.165,"His preliminary instruction, he was told to go home."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,1826.165,1829.958,"--There was some confusion in the record as to that point, Justice Blackmun."
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.424,1854.134,"Well, we don't have to decide here, do we?"
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,1854.134,1856.906,"No, that is not an issue before the Court at this time."
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1917.256,1939.091,"Well, would you... I take it you wouldn't be here if Brown had said I won't drive the truck because of the brakes and because I have a right under the contract not to drive a truck with bad brakes."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,1947.246,1954.242,"If he articulated... If the reason for his dismissal was the articulation of the grievance, that is correct."
1983.82-960,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1965.837,1974.723,--Are you on firm ground so far as the findings by the Administrative Law Judge and the Board are concerned?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,1980.626,1988.202,--The indication... The Administrative Law Judge's opinion is that Brown was discharged for refusing to follow a company order.
1983.82-960,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1994.517,1997.98,I read it over and I frankly was confused as to which of those it was.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,1997.98,1999.259,I think--
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1999.259,2019.943,Wasn't he... Isn't it clear though that he refused to work... He refused to work because of his concern about the brakes and that the Board and the Administrative Law Judge found that he was exercising a contract right in refusing to do so?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2019.943,2036.385,"--The Board... It is our position that the Board does not... The arbitrator has provided for... Under the collective bargaining agreement, the arbitrator is to make a decision as to whether or not Brown's conduct was justified when he refused to drive the truck under Section XXI of the collective bargaining agreement."
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.905,2081.142,"But, the point you just made wouldn't be foreclosed even if it were found that what he was exercising was a collective right."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2081.142,2082.314,That is correct.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.314,2092.021,"You can still argue that it would be a collective right, but the Board is just misapplying the Act unless it wait for the arbitrator."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2092.021,2093.183,That is correct.
1983.82-960,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2093.183,2095.651,Or it still has to be corrected to be--
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2095.651,2099.604,Both issues are raised in this case.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.92,2142.942,--You are defending the decision below that this was not an exercise of a collective right?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2142.942,2143.974,That is correct.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2143.974,2146.105,"But, you are defending that position."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2146.105,2147.297,We are defining that position.
1983.82-960,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2170.812,2172.732,Let me get back to the facts again.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2180.408,2182.008,It was two days before.
1983.82-960,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2182.008,2183.821,Because of its brakes?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2183.821,2199.32,"Justice Marshall, two days before there was almost an accident at the landfill, but the driver of the truck at that time continued to drive the subject truck and when he took it back to the mechanics, the mechanics told him they would fix it over the weekend or first thing Monday morning."
1983.82-960,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2207.985,2211.298,Is all of your answer yes to my question?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2211.298,2213.231,All of my answer--
1983.82-960,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2213.231,2220.243,The question is is that the same truck that almost had an accident with him two days before?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2220.243,2221.625,--It was the same truck.
1983.82-960,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2221.625,2222.306,Your answer is yes.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2222.306,2223.926,That is correct.
1983.82-960,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2223.926,2227.339,May I ask you a question while we have got you interrupted?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2246.841,2249.132,"If that was the motivation for his discharge, that is correct."
1983.82-960,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2249.132,2257.479,How is that... Why is that any more concerted than what was involved here just looking at the requirement of joint action?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2257.479,2261.55,I don't believe this Court has spoken to that issue.
1983.82-960,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2280.604,2288.569,"But, you are prepared to assume for purposes of your argument that that individual action is ""concerted"" within the meaning of the Act?"
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2288.569,2307.622,"A formal assertion of a contract violation and the formal grievance, if the motivation... and we would, under the analysis this Court set forth in Bernhart and Sims, if the motivation is the submittal of that grievance and not the underlying--"
1983.82-960,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.622,2311.294,Now you are focusing on the employer's motivation--
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2311.294,2312.054,--That is correct.
1983.82-960,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2312.054,2316.458,--in order to decide whether the employee's action was concerted.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2316.458,2321.911,That is correct.
1983.82-960,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2325.993,2328.536,"I understand that, but I am just interested in the word ""concerted"" at this point."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2328.536,2329.315,--Fine.
1983.82-960,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2335.098,2340.821,So once you make that concession... I find it hard to accept your plain language argument.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2343.485,2348.237,We think there is some kind of contradiction in that regard.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2386.672,2389.614,"There was a grievance filed here, wasn't there?"
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2389.614,2392.446,--There was not a grievance at the time of the discharge.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.041,2409.176,"So, again, why would his assertion be any less concerted than an actual grievance?"
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2409.176,2414.899,"--We believe that in that situation, if the Court is going to find--"
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2414.899,2417.781,"In these facts, when he was fired, there was no grievance?"
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2417.781,2418.722,--That is correct.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2418.722,2422.185,"But, he was asserting the very right that they filed a grievance over."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2422.185,2427.919,The record is clear that there is no reference whatsoever to the collective bargaining agreement by Mr. Brown.
1983.82-960,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2460.911,2462.831,When did he refuse to drive the truck?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2462.831,2464.223,On the morning--
1983.82-960,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2464.223,2479.354,"When he refused in the evening, why didn't that give rise to a grievance right then and there even without waiting until the following morning when he could contact the business agent or the shop steward?"
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2479.354,2484.617,"--I believe, in fact, he made contact with his shop steward and came in that afternoon."
1983.82-960,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2494.512,2497.015,Should he drive the truck in the meantime?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2497.015,2499.066,--He should drive the truck in the meantime.
1983.82-960,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2542.196,2551.892,"The only way that I could be protected, because I drive an automobile, from a truck with no brakes is for a man to go on and drive it."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2551.892,2558.325,I believe what he would have to do is make a showing--
1983.82-960,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2558.325,2564.999,I think you said a minute ago that his only way was he would have to drive the truck and I am sure you didn't mean that.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2564.999,2576.597,"--What I meant to say, Justice Marshall, is that if he does not drive the truck, if he makes that determination, then he does so at his peril and he must be vindicated by the arbitrator."
1983.82-960,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2577.999,2582.581,"If he knows the truck has no brakes, he has to drive it?"
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2582.581,2585.303,--He has to... There has to be--
1983.82-960,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2585.303,2586.835,On the road with me?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2587.684,2588.776,--He has to make--
1983.82-960,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2588.776,2592.419,"If you want me to make that ruling, I am not going to make it."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2592.419,2604.226,"--Justice Marshall, what I would want in this case would be consistent with company policy that if he is going to refuse to drive the truck at a minimum he inspect the truck to ascertain whether or not it has been fixed."
1983.82-960,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2625.992,2629.253,I take it the company is lucky.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2634.865,2639.98,"The record is silent, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-960,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2639.98,2652.748,"Then what should the Administrative Law Judge do, treat that as a presumption that the condition had remained unchanged from Friday night until Monday morning?"
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2652.748,2680.746,"I think, consistent with the Union determination that the grievance didn't have merit, that the substantial evidence in this case would indicate that where he does not inspect the truck, contrary to company policy, and where the truck is that same morning driven by another employee without incident, I think in that situation that the logical inference and reasonable inference is that the truck had been repaired, but the record is silent as to that point."
1983.82-960,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2680.746,2689.391,Then the case comes down to whether or not this was a contumacious refusal even to determine the facts.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2697.015,2698.588,That is correct.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2891.995,2908.985,"As I understand the Court of Appeals, it said that even if Brown was exercising a right under the contract, he wasn't exercising a right protected by Section 7, because he was doing it just for his own account."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2908.985,2910.376,--That is correct.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.376,2911.477,Only for himself.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2911.477,2912.238,That is correct.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.238,2913.338,"Now, do you defend that?"
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2913.338,2914.059,We do.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2915.08,2917.12,Suppose you are wrong on that.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2926.277,2939.384,"--We believe in this case it is established in the record that his action, if it were found to be concerted, it is nevertheless not protected in that it is a violation of the no-strike clause also."
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2939.384,2945.378,"That may be, but you are now defending the decision on an alternate ground."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2945.378,2946.309,That is correct.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2946.309,2951.492,"Which you have a perfect right to present, but we certainly don't have to rule on it."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2951.492,2952.704,That is correct.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.704,2958.738,I suppose that issue was before the Court of Appeals.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2958.738,2974.238,"We believe it was and the Court of Appeals, when it expressed its complete agreement with the Kohls decision of the D.C. Circuit, we believe that that incorporated the protection argument and I think the Board has acknowledged that in their reply brief."
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2979.091,2988.347,"So, you could lose on the very narrow ground that the Court of Appeals used and still win the case in the long run on two or three other grounds that you have already argued."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,2988.347,2988.918,--That is correct.
1983.82-960,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3181.003,3183.865,"Do you cite that in your brief, Mr. Ufer, American Freight?"
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3183.865,3184.596,We do.
1983.82-960,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3184.596,3186.386,Was it NLRB versus American Freight?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3186.386,3187.578,That is correct.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3378.553,3389.899,"Well, it is an old story though that the Board will or will not find something an unfair labor practice even though it may or may not violate the contract."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3389.899,3390.861,That is correct.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3390.861,3392.03,Isn't that right?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3392.03,3392.691,That is correct.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3393.553,3403.41,"And also, even if some arbitrator has held that it is not a violation of the contract, the Board isn't necessarily foreclosed."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3403.41,3404.82,--That is correct.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3404.82,3405.861,You acknowledge that?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3405.861,3406.7,We acknowledge that.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3416.648,3418.569,How would you sort them out?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3418.569,3432.588,"I would return to an actual plain meaning interpretation of concerted is our position, and, if, in fact, there are two or more employees undertaking an action or agreeing upon a course of action--"
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3432.588,3444.196,"So, you would say the Board could never second guess an arbitrator if all the employee ever was doing was asserting his own right."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3444.196,3453.523,--The Board... I think the correct standard for the Board's intervention in that case would be the Spielberg Doctrine of fairness and reasonable.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3453.523,3456.114,"Well, why... He doesn't mention another employee or anything else."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3462.238,3465.688,It is our position that would not be concerted.
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3465.688,3468.86,Even if the arbitrator... Even if it had gone to arbitration.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3468.86,3480.811,"I think the clarification in that regard... The first position is that the action would not be concerted by the individual, and the second position would be it would be appropriate for deferral to the arbitrator."
1983.82-960,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3484.412,3492.877,But then why did you concede at the beginning that a grievance filed by a single employee is concerted?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3492.877,3510.368,"We don't... In light of the Circuit Court decision on that point, we believe that there is an argument to be made to that effect, but again--"
1983.82-960,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3510.368,3514.722,That just flies in the face of your plain meaning.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3514.722,3525.418,"--That is correct and if I made that concession, then very possibly I ought to retreat from that, because I think a plain meaning interpretation offers certainty into this situation and that it is--"
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3525.418,3535.085,You should retreat from your suggestion that Spielberg is enough protection for your provision is an individual grievance has gone to arbitration.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3535.085,3549.053,"--I believe that is a separate issue and those standards, as they have more recently evolved in Board decisions, I think there has been a distortion and a perversion of the Spielberg Doctrine."
1983.82-960,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3628.454,3629.846,Let me interrupt you for a minute.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3651.75,3653.943,The act of filing a grievance?
1983.82-960,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3653.943,3659.417,"This man had not been fired because he wouldn't drive the truck, he was fired two days later for filing the grievance."
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3659.417,3660.747,For filing a grievance.
1983.82-960,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3660.747,3662.549,What is your position on it?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3662.549,3671.134,We would contend that the act of filing a grievance is actual concerted activity between the employee--
1983.82-960,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3671.134,3673.655,You say that would be an unfair labor practice?
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3673.655,3674.797,--That would be--
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3674.797,3678.73,Is that... Now that is three times.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3693.798,3696.109,"--Again, I would say--"
1983.82-960,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3696.109,3697.331,--You would say that is concerted activity.
1983.82-960,1,40660,robert_p_ufer,,3697.331,3711.559,--I believe the analysis should be an actual concerted analysis and if it is found that the conduct between the individual and his Union steward in the filing of that grievance could constitute actual concerted activity.
1983.82-960,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3713.131,3716.103,"Mr. Come, do you have anything more?"
1983.82-960,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3719.456,3722.298,"Yes, I would just like to make two points."
1983.82-960,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3752.906,3754.609,Any contract right?
1983.82-960,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3754.609,3755.858,--Yes.
1983.82-960,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3755.858,3757.14,Any contract right.
1983.82-960,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3757.14,3764.264,Here the right asserted is to refuse to carry out the employer's order.
1983.82-960,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3796.434,3807.754,"It is your position here though that any assertion by an employee, whether on his own behalf literally or on somebody else, is concerted activity."
1983.82-960,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3807.754,3809.333,--That is correct.
1983.82-960,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3816.81,3829.958,"Well, if the General Counsel filed... Finds reason to file a complaint, why there is... It is concerted activity I suppose."
1983.82-960,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3829.958,3835.891,"--But, nonetheless, the mere issuance of a complaint does not--"
1983.82-960,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3835.891,3837.333,Doesn't bind the Board.
1983.82-960,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3837.333,3842.686,--That is correct because it must be established by a preponderance of the evidence and--
1983.82-960,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3842.686,3846.708,"Well, yes, but it is concerted activity if it is in good faith--"
1983.82-960,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3846.708,3849.061,--And reasonably based.
1983.82-960,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3852.263,3854.845,"Your time has expired, Mr. Come."
