1968.238,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,28.291,"Number 238, David I. Wells, appellant, versus Nelson A. Rockefeller."
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,30.497,34.358,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.238,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,352.454,369.647,"I'm not sure I understood your second criteria, i.e., as I heard you say it, that smaller deviations are required in congressional districting than might be permitted in a state legislative apportionment."
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,370.565,371.301,"Yes, sir."
1968.238,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,388.462,390.235,I think that worked the other way.
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,390.235,403.925,"No, I think not because the necessity of the opportunity to draw so many different districts, there is more opportunity to play with the population figures of this point, in a sense that Mr. Achtenberg made in connection with Missouri."
1968.238,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,403.925,405.204,Smaller building blocks.
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,405.204,409.825,"Smaller building blocks and more of them, yes, sir."
1968.238,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,410.755,410.861,"So, it-- your--"
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,410.861,411.262,Excuse me.
1968.238,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,411.262,425.514,"So, it follows, in your submission, that a lower magnitude of deviation is constitutionally permissible in congressional districts than might be constitutionally tolerable in--"
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,425.514,426.631,It's constitutionally required is the way I would state it.
1968.238,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,426.631,428.259,In the state legislative apportionment.
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,428.259,430.292,"Yes, sir."
1968.238,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,430.292,433.798,And you say there's something in Reynolds against -- in the opinion of Reynolds against Sims?
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,433.798,433.982,Yes.
1968.238,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,433.982,434.617,Is that so?
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,434.617,435.763,"Yes, there is."
1968.238,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,436.558,437.591,"Well, it's probably in the briefs."
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,437.591,438.136,"It is in the brief, sir."
1968.238,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,438.136,440.989,"Alright, thank you."
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,440.989,458.317,"The immerging principles, as we see them, are that, when there are deviations from compactness, that there must be -- this also must be explained by the state because it is impossible to have equality without being tested in a sense, at least by the measure of compactness, a point I shall return to."
1968.238,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,616.737,620.258,What do you think the deviation was before?
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,620.258,622.64,"The legislation thought it was 8,000-plus."
1968.238,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,628.693,632.481,"Well, was that in the Court -- was that a Court scene?"
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,632.481,634.071,"Yes, that's correct, sir."
1968.238,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,634.071,639.299,The Court was only a deviation of -- total deviation or something like that in the stand?
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,639.299,640.431,That's correct.
1968.238,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,640.431,643.863,And you say you think it could be available and --
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,643.863,645.475,"It turned out to be something like 48,000."
1968.238,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,645.475,652.728,"In the Court at that time, did it have the figures then?"
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,652.728,653.597,I have assumed --
1968.238,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.597,654.043,You didn't have --
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,654.043,655.571,I'm not sure of this.
1968.238,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,655.571,657.411,Have in the District Court then?
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,657.411,661.878,"I think this Court, at the time of affirmance, had the figures of 48,000, but I would have to verify that."
1968.238,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,664.536,667.878,You made a total deviations are like 12%.
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,667.878,670.729,"Yes, yes sir, from the smallest to the largest."
1968.238,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,670.729,673.064,"Yes, but the total deviation would be?"
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,673.064,675.671,Over 14%.
1968.238,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,675.671,684.301,"Was -- what do you think is the right approach, from the smallest to the largest or deviation from the ideal whether plus or minus?"
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,684.301,685.456,Both are available.
1968.238,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,685.456,685.664,"No, if --"
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,685.664,694.482,"If you want the deviations from the ideal, the figure in this case would be 6.6 in one direction and 6.5 in the other direction."
1968.238,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,696.678,700.57,Well that doesn't matter because I wonder which is the more helpful.
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,700.57,708.081,"I think they are both relevant and I would be glad to stand on either of them as showing a very substantial and, we think, impermissible deviation in this case."
1968.238,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.371,810.004,You say that in dividing the cities is permissible or not -- is it permissible to the election?
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,810.004,811.006,"Yes, sir."
1968.238,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,812.202,821.016,You just say that really -- that suggested a -- it's not true in this case because it -- at least the inconsistently invited.
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,821.016,823.95,That's part right.
1968.238,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1115.057,1120.135,This was done when one House was -- had a majority of Democrats and the other House had a majority
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,1120.135,1120.229,"Yes, sir."
1968.238,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1120.229,1121.832,"Of Republicans, wasn't it?"
1968.238,0,39861,robert_b_mckay,,1121.832,1140.572,"Thus, distinguishing it from what had been the previous situation in New York and in most states where both Houses are of a single party where the plan is worked out by that party and presented the legislature, and then that seems to have been the case indeed in Missouri, but the dissent, the dispute of the minority is unavailable in those cases"
1968.238,1,26357,george_d_zuckerman,,1492.755,1495.726,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.238,2,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3342.973,3344.164,May it please the Court.
1968.238,2,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3366.758,3369.702,"Now, whether there is something else was developed between the time of the --"
1968.238,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3369.702,3370.449,There was.
1968.238,2,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3393.424,3394.927,"Yes, sir, I would."
1968.238,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3402.989,3403.299,And --
1968.238,2,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3403.299,3407.826,Which makes the districting suspect and then there is also affirmative evidence in this case.
1968.238,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3407.826,3419.261,"Well, is it also your claim here thought that the population disparities themselves are -- were energized by a gerrymandering motive?"
1968.238,2,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3419.261,3421.558,"Yes, sir, at least in part."
1968.238,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3460.742,3462.791,Or urban district.
1968.238,2,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3462.791,3464.125,Or urban district.
1968.238,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3486.525,3488.42,They should be what?
1968.238,3,26357,george_d_zuckerman,,3488.42,3494.124,"They should be adhered to, to the extent possible, to protect against the gerrymander."
1968.238,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3497.248,3505.533,Do your attack -- challenge rest on gerrymandering as one independent ground of yours that there is gerrymander?
1968.238,3,26357,george_d_zuckerman,,3505.533,3506.358,"Yes, sir."
1968.238,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3506.358,3512.532,It does not depend at all on one with the disparity of the voters in the one man-one vote.
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3512.532,3514.311,"We make both arguments, Your Honor."
1968.238,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3514.311,3514.904,You what?
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3514.904,3524.315,"We make both arguments, but there are substantial population inequalities that are not explained by any rationally permissible ground and that there is a gerrymander."
1968.238,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3524.531,3531.064,"Well now, which constitutional provision do you allow as to the gerrymander?"
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3531.064,3536.112,On both the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 1 Section 2.
1968.238,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3550.528,3560.863,"Well, being a candidate, you express those constitutional question that in addition to substantial population equality."
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3563.872,3564.951,"Yes, sir."
1968.238,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3564.951,3573.912,"And that's the way you handle -- express that gerrymandering can't be done whether it's for consummations, religious, political, or otherwise --"
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3573.912,3574.423,Quite correct.
1968.238,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3574.423,3577.084,Because you didn't produce the element of compactness as in our constitution.
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3577.084,3578.725,Yes sir.
1968.238,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3578.725,3589.392,"Now, I forgot some while now, but did the old 1912 statute, the federal statute, as I recall, it used to have the criteria of compactness, contiguity --"
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3589.392,3591.215,Compactness and contiguity.
1968.238,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3591.215,3593.75,Was there also population criterion?
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3593.75,3594.852,"No, there was not."
1968.238,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3594.852,3596.971,"Now, that, of course, was repealed."
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3596.971,3597.194,"Yes, sir."
1968.238,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3597.194,3606.984,"But then the old Broom case, Broom -- in Wood versus Broom, wasn't there some consideration of compactness as a constitutional criterion or not?"
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3606.984,3608.511,No decision at that point.
1968.238,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3608.511,3610.599,Was it raised or suggested?
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3610.599,3613.899,"Whether it was raised, I'm not sure, but there was no decision on that point."
1968.238,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3613.899,3621.201,"But, in any event, you would ask us to add to substantial population quality a constitutional requirement of compactness."
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3621.201,3621.615,"That's correct, sir."
1968.238,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3621.615,3623.148,"Now, what about contiguity?"
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3623.148,3624.957,"And Contiguity, I think, quite clearly that --"
1968.238,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3624.957,3625.705,"Well, then what --"
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3625.705,3627.893,There isn't a contiguity problem in this case.
1968.238,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3627.893,3638.648,"No, but what you would really have us do then, ultimately, I take it, is to convert that stat -- those statutory criterion getting the population equality --"
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3638.648,3639.228,"Yes, sir."
1968.238,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3639.228,3643.168,"As we've now defined it, into constitutional criterion."
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3643.168,3643.818,"Yes, sir."
1968.238,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3643.818,3652.238,"Well, being there, may I ask you along the same lines that my brother Brennan has been asking questions."
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3676.91,3677.208,It's --
1968.238,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3677.208,3684.829,One constitutional principle has been popularly called the one man-one vote principle.
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3693.105,3696.288,I believe it's a function of the equality argument.
1968.238,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3747.325,3760.47,"Well, if I live in the northeast section of a state and the legislature gerrymanders a state take an extreme and, therefore, absurd example to illustrate the point."
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3781.879,3782.195,"Yes, sir."
1968.238,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3782.195,3788.821,And that that does bear upon the principle of equal effect to my vote.
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3788.821,3788.916,Quite --
1968.238,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3788.916,3799.856,"And it's from that principle, I take it, that you would derive the constitutional basis for your insistence upon an absence of gerrymandering."
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3799.856,3801.071,Quite clearly so.
1968.238,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3821.654,3823.805,"Yes, I understood him."
1968.238,4,39861,robert_b_mckay,,3830.744,3833.103,"That is correct, sir."
