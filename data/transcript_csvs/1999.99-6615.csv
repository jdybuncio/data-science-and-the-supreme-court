1999.99-6615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.092,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-6615, Michael Wayne Williams v. John Taylor."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,9.762,16.666,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1999.99-6615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,113.532,124.856,"As I understand it, Mr. Blume, you agree that your client could not meet the very last of those specifications in the event that the Court found that that was necessary for you to prevail."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,124.856,125.762,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-6615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,146.425,152.782,"Well, who else would develop the facts, other than the applicant, in a State collateral proceeding?"
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,152.782,159.248,"Well, I mean, facts conceivably could be developed by either side, depending on the nature of the claim, or whether there's an evidentiary--"
1999.99-6615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,159.248,168.651,"Yes, but typically if you're the petitioner in a State collateral review, you're seeking to develop the facts, are you not?"
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,168.651,169.167,--Yes.
1999.99-6615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,183.738,193.0,"I don't know that the word fail... I concede that that's certainly a plausible argument, but you know, you say that someone in a golf tournament failed to make the cut."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,201.559,204.948,"--Well, I mean, in some situations it is."
1999.99-6615,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,236.514,253.023,"If you're correct in your interpretation, what function, other than surplusage, does (2)(A)(ii) have, which says that a factual predicate could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence?"
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,253.023,256.147,"I... Justice Kennedy, that really--"
1999.99-6615,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,256.147,258.349,Do we just kind of write that out of the statute as surplusage?
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,258.349,260.301,"--No, I don't think so at all."
1999.99-6615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,300.582,314.935,"Why do you put the choices between a strict liability matter and the word fail, connoting fault?"
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,380.799,384.423,"Well, I think it is, because... for several reasons."
1999.99-6615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,397.559,422.096,"Well, that itself I thought, and read in other briefs in earlier cases, presents quite a difficult question of interpretation, and that's why I was rather sorry to hear you concede that point, since I think lots of interpretation can go into that particular provision as to just what it means, and that is an issue that I don't think this Court has considered."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,422.096,432.561,"But I think logically to fail to develop would envision, both in its language and in its usage... I mean, Keeney v. Tamayas-Reyes is where this came from, I think most logically."
1999.99-6615,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,454.239,476.23,"Well, Mr. Blume, I wondered if the language directs us to some kind of an exhaustion requirement, trying to make sure that State... people convicted in State proceedings try to raise their claims first in State court and get the facts developed."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,489.772,491.006,--No.
1999.99-6615,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,494.864,495.941,Do we know that?
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,501.72,510.873,"--Virginia has a strictly applied harsh 21-day rule, that any newly discovered evidence not presented within 21 days of conviction is not cognizable."
1999.99-6615,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,510.873,515.371,Even if it's discovered after that time?
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,515.371,516.121,That's correct.
1999.99-6615,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,533.911,534.146,Yes.
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,556.23,577.628,"--Well, not only will they not permit, but if you look at the character and the nature of the claims in this case, they are withholding claims, evidence where the petitioner alleges the facts were within the possession and control of the State and were not disclosed, despite a pretrial motion which requested this type of information."
1999.99-6615,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,584.173,589.514,"Are you talking about the juror now, and the relationship with the deputy sheriff?"
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,589.514,593.138,"There are actually three claims, Justice O'Connor."
1999.99-6615,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,602.602,606.288,But presumably that report was in the file some place.
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,606.288,608.974,--It was in a file some place.
1999.99-6615,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,615.519,623.734,"I frankly was more concerned with evidence that was newly discovered, and no basis for discovery before."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,623.734,627.592,"Well, I mean... okay, no basis for discovery before."
1999.99-6615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,649.18,668.047,"Well, on the question of just, with respect to her ex-husband, you know, if she had been asked, do you know any of these people, obviously had she said no with respect to him it would have been a misstatement, but it seems to me that the question asked was a fairly limited one."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,678.403,685.93,"Well, I mean, first of all, to answer the... to go back, there were requests for more specific questions which were denied."
1999.99-6615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,719.026,728.805,"Well, I... you know, you can say the witness should have been more forthcoming, but you're alleging a constitutional violation here, and it seems to me it's just very blurry."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,728.805,732.756,"Well, part of that, of course, Your Honor, is because we've never had a hearing."
1999.99-6615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,743.455,749.062,"Even on your allegations, though, it's a very weak claim, it seems to me, even assuming you can prove it."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,749.062,767.946,"Well, assuming that we can not only prove that, but as I understand this Court's decisions dealing with juror bias, actual juror bias and implied bias, the remedy has always been a hearing, and a hearing at which a judge makes a determination of whether this juror is biased or not, looking at the witness' credibility, what they say--"
1999.99-6615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,767.946,768.821,"Well, what are you going to have the hearing about there?"
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,768.821,771.163,"--It would be on these answers, on whether--"
1999.99-6615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,771.163,775.66,"No, the specific question was, are you related to any of the witnesses?"
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,789.374,795.341,--There... presumably I would think on cross-examination both of the prosecutor and the--
1999.99-6615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,795.341,797.027,What are you going to cross-examine him about?
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,797.027,800.557,"--You would ask questions about, you know, what was your relationship, what did you know--"
1999.99-6615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,800.557,801.792,We know what the relationship was.
1999.99-6615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,805.821,810.007,"And the question wasn't, what was your relationship with, it's are you related to."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,810.007,813.583,"--And... well, the question is one ultimately of bias."
1999.99-6615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,813.583,814.473,"No, it isn't of bias."
1999.99-6615,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,839.823,842.337,--Wasn't she also asked whether she'd been represented by anybody?
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,842.337,842.728,Yes.
1999.99-6615,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,844.961,846.071,"And the prosecutor represented her in the divorce, didn't he?"
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,846.071,851.131,"--And she had been represented in the divorce by the prosecutor, and the questions of relationship."
1999.99-6615,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,856.769,867.78,"Mr. Blume, can we just back up a bit before we get to the specifics of the prosecutor and the witness?"
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,922.024,926.069,I think it would depend on the particular case.
1999.99-6615,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,942.016,942.766,"Yes, but you never would have--"
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,942.766,944.172,And that makes this different.
1999.99-6615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,944.172,949.091,--You're simply wrong in saying that the answer wasn't true about related to.
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,955.791,961.009,"Well, it certainly is true that she had been represented by the prosecutor."
1999.99-6615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,965.663,968.693,How long ago had that been at the time of trial?
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,968.693,973.114,"It had been about 10 years, I think, before the trial, that she was married to this man--"
1999.99-6615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,973.114,974.973,And it was an uncontested divorce?
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,974.973,981.533,"--Yes, but I don't see how, under... anyone could say that he had not represented her."
1999.99-6615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,981.533,982.018,Well--
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,982.018,984.079,He had been the lawyer in the divorce.
1999.99-6615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,984.079,987.468,--And her... wasn't her answer she simply didn't recall it?
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,987.468,987.937,No.
1999.99-6615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1010.631,1013.63,"Mr. Blume, can I come back to the text of the statute we were talking about?"
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1013.63,1013.864,Yes.
1999.99-6615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1013.864,1020.596,I don't... I'm not sure what your answer is to the hypothetical that Justice Breyer posed.
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1035.481,1038.665,I think it depends on what State court proceeding means.
1999.99-6615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1045.273,1045.57,No.
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1045.57,1050.991,"--State court proceedings... if a State does not have, for example, post conviction, if they do away with post conviction--"
1999.99-6615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1050.991,1051.381,That's right.
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1051.381,1052.551,--then I would think this wouldn't apply.
1999.99-6615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1052.551,1054.301,Then this wouldn't apply?
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1054.301,1057.629,Unless you just say... you could.
1999.99-6615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1071.107,1084.664,"I thought anther possibility would be if the... they had a full hearing, and there's a finding, but the finding is clearly not supported by the evidence."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1112.512,1116.167,"Well, (e)(1) might conceivably cover that situation."
1999.99-6615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1116.839,1117.354,Yeah.
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1117.354,1134.129,"--It just seems if you read the language, fail to develop, it doesn't make sense, I don't think, in the context as a whole to say that this applies even where the petitioner did absolutely nothing wrong, even where the petitioner tried to develop the facts, took advantage of every opportunity, and it would also lead to absurd results."
1999.99-6615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1149.686,1150.014,Why?
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1150.014,1160.37,"Because under the successor provision you only have to show either a new rule of law to have your claim heard, or you have to show due diligence and innocence in a case."
1999.99-6615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.941,1213.754,What is wrong with that?
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1247.287,1252.644,"Well, it would mean, Justice Scalia, that in many cases claims would be properly before the court on the merits--"
1999.99-6615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1252.644,1253.112,Right.
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1253.112,1267.748,"--and the court could not obtain the facts necessary to decide it, but this Court has always said that if you look at a State's comity and federalism interests, they are much more potentially damaged or in play by a court entertaining the merits of the claim."
1999.99-6615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1292.065,1309.464,"I agree with you that... maybe I'm being repetitive here, but I... you've now... I agree with you that these words, if the appellant has failed to develop a factual record, don't simply mean there are no facts somewhere in the State."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1321.006,1321.678,Yes.
1999.99-6615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1321.678,1322.084,All right.
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1341.764,1342.545,I think it--
1999.99-6615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1342.545,1345.216,"Can you give me an example, because that's what would be very helpful."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1345.216,1357.618,"--It would still be a very... well, a situation, for example, in this case, in which there is a report, a psychiatric report, it contradicts a witness, they filed a Brady motion, they've asked for it--"
1999.99-6615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1357.618,1360.398,"Well, I don't see why you're not entitled to a hearing on that one."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1360.398,1361.179,--They didn't get it.
1999.99-6615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1362.633,1364.412,"But, so how does it produce an odd result there?"
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1364.412,1364.912,"--Well, I don't see--"
1999.99-6615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1364.912,1372.923,"If you've really showed, you know, if there's a factual issue as to whether that report was in the record or not in the record, I guess you'd get a hearing on that."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1372.923,1374.142,"--Well, I guess it's--"
1999.99-6615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1374.142,1381.436,"If it's not in the record it's not the fault of the plaintiff, and if it is in the record, it is the fault of the plaintiff... of the defendant."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1381.436,1387.731,"--Well, I think the problem with the hypothetical that I have, Justice Breyer, is, I'm still unclear what you mean by failed to develop."
1999.99-6615,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1420.468,1432.401,"Mr. Blume, just go back to the... you're now focusing on the psychiatric report, but if I remember correctly Judge Merhige turned that one... ruled against you on that one, didn't he?"
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1432.401,1432.979,--Yes.
1999.99-6615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1503.655,1505.53,"Why couldn't he just say, it was not there?"
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1514.041,1516.119,"Of course... well, nobody can ever say that--"
1999.99-6615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1516.119,1517.181,"Well, sure you can."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1517.181,1517.649,"--definitively, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-6615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1517.649,1518.821,"You say, I looked it in and it was not there."
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1519.649,1524.818,"Well, I... I mean, maybe it is sort of lawyer talk and all that."
1999.99-6615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1538.876,1545.046,"But did he also say, I am confident that I would remember having seen it?"
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1545.046,1548.511,"Well, rather than me--"
1999.99-6615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1548.511,1552.073,"I mean, in order to get to your ultimate conclusion you have to--"
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1552.073,1553.307,--Yes.
1999.99-6615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1554.448,1556.182,--I would remember it?
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1556.182,1564.976,"It's on... it's J.A. 625-626, when he says, I have no recollection of seeing this report in Mr. Cruse's court file when I examined the file."
1999.99-6615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1569.162,1570.302,That I would remember it.
1999.99-6615,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1570.302,1573.441,"And that... I mean, that certainly seems supported by everything."
1999.99-6615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1628.387,1629.871,"Very well, Mr. Blume."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1632.041,1638.602,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-6615,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1724.022,1749.729,"Could I ask about Virginia law, whether if there is newly discovered evidence that could potentially be exculpatory, that is discovered more than 21 days after the conviction, does Virginia bar any proceeding in Virginia courts to determine the fact?"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1749.729,1756.133,--Not if it is raised in a State collateral proceeding as evidence in support of a claim.
1999.99-6615,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1763.116,1767.083,What was the 21-day point that counsel was making?
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1767.083,1778.891,"21 days has... the 21-day rule in Virginia has nothing to do with this case, but the 21-day rule in Virginia is that you have to file a motion for a new trial in the jurisdiction of the trial court based on newly discovered evidence within 21 days."
1999.99-6615,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1778.891,1791.698,"But if there is newly discovered evidence that comes... is discovered after that initial 21-day period, are State collateral proceedings available to establish the facts?"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1791.698,1794.275,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, if it's in connection with a claim."
1999.99-6615,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1803.053,1804.256,"Well, what do you mean, a claim?"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1811.424,1812.674,--Right.
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1822.311,1822.749,So he--
1999.99-6615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1822.749,1826.841,"--The trial procedure was unconstitutional, in other words, in the context of a claim--"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1826.841,1827.169,--Yes.
1999.99-6615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.169,1828.701,--Which is what the claim is here.
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1828.701,1831.121,"Yes, just like any other of his habeas claims."
1999.99-6615,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1831.121,1840.133,"Okay, but he claims the conviction was obtained unconstitutionally because of juror bias."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1840.133,1840.555,That's right.
1999.99-6615,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1840.899,1842.57,"Now, can he establish that in Virginia--"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1842.57,1843.726,--He--
1999.99-6615,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1843.726,1845.302,--after the 21 days?
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1845.302,1845.881,"--Oh, certainly."
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1858.61,1860.5,"And it's filed with the Virginia supreme court, is it?"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1861.203,1861.922,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1861.922,1864.749,"And then they're the ones who order discovery, if it's appropriate?"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1864.749,1865.265,That's right.
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1865.265,1866.42,Is there--
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1866.42,1868.779,And they're the ones who decide whether it goes back for a hearing.
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1868.779,1873.995,--Is there a 60-day rule on cut-off for filing constitutional claims?
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1873.995,1877.713,A 60-day--
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1877.713,1882.054,You just... you mentioned that he does not have to file his claim for 60 days.
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1885.678,1885.974,--Yes.
1999.99-6615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1892.066,1892.613,Excuse me.
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1894.612,1895.018,That's right.
1999.99-6615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1895.018,1895.33,--Yes.
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1895.33,1899.063,60 days after denial of cert he has to file his State habeas petition.
1999.99-6615,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1901.609,1913.088,"Right, but in this particular case there's no rule of Virginia law that barred him from producing that psychiatric report within 60 days."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1913.088,1913.682,Absolutely.
1999.99-6615,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1913.682,1914.479,But he failed to do it.
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1914.479,1915.198,Absolutely.
1999.99-6615,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1915.198,1915.588,All right.
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1960.319,1962.819,Because that's not what Congress intended.
1999.99-6615,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1968.115,1968.599,"No, no, wait."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2006.411,2011.706,"--Well, I would certainly have to defer to the Court as to the reasons it granted cert, but this case is--"
1999.99-6615,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2011.706,2013.486,I'm just reading the question presented.
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2025.215,2035.025,"--Justice Breyer, the one thing we know about this statute is that Congress linked the due diligence requirement and the innocence requirement."
1999.99-6615,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2041.085,2054.002,"We received in the case that Justice Souter wrote many briefs, and in those briefs I found considerable disagreement as to the meaning of this last phrase."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2057.5,2060.998,I see the petitioner has taken that issue away from the Court.
1999.99-6615,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2060.998,2061.733,Yes.
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2061.733,2064.449,"He concedes he can't meet it, and the statute clearly requires both."
1999.99-6615,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2064.449,2072.822,"If you get to the due diligence part of the section, then surely you can get to the same part that's joined by and."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2072.822,2073.696,That's right.
1999.99-6615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2073.696,2074.585,"Mr. Curry, as I read--"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2074.585,2075.414,You have to get to both.
1999.99-6615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2075.414,2084.318,"--As I the question, it's whether 2254(e)(2) governs petitioner's claims."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2084.318,2084.786,That's right.
1999.99-6615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2087.004,2095.719,"And it doesn't govern petitioner's claims, the claims made here, if, indeed, that last portion of (e)(2) requires that he show a probability of innocence."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2095.719,2096.438,That's right.
1999.99-6615,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2122.099,2122.756,"Well... well, look--"
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2122.756,2139.325,"--He also has another way of getting out from under it, and that is to say that the word fail is importing a fault requirement as against, as he characterizes it, your position, a kind of strict liability requirement."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2139.325,2139.638,--Right.
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2139.638,2145.058,What is... to what extent are you advancing a strict liability requirement?
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2145.058,2148.588,"That's his term, and I don't know what he means by strict liability."
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2153.274,2164.066,"Well, let me ask you this, and I'm not... and I am, in fact, not suggesting that we've got this case before us, but I want to take an extreme case for the sake of argument."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2209.346,2210.204,Absolutely.
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2213.531,2214.703,Then what you are saying--
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2214.703,2215.203,--for the failure.
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2215.203,2259.714,"--it seems to me is that in any State... the way you want us to read the statute means that in any State post conviction case if the prosecution, let's say with bad faith succeeds in opposing discovery and therefore thwarts the development of the record, there never can be Federal relief even when it's appropriate on Federal law, except for a prisoner who can prove the innocence that is required under the last subsection, which as a practical matter means we would be construing AEDPA to read Federal habeas right out of the law in any bad faith case except for an innocent prisoner."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2259.714,2264.963,"Well, I certainly think that's what Congress intended."
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2264.963,2268.806,You think Congress intended what I just laid out?
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2268.806,2270.367,Because of what they said in--
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2270.367,2282.097,"In other words, no Federal habeas, even when Federal law would grant relief and even when the State is at fault for thwarting discovery, unless the prisoner is innocent?"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2282.097,2293.389,"--All of the concerns that you're talking about, Justice Souter, are the concerns which this Court, when it was up to this Court in making the policy judgments, channeled into the cause requirement."
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2300.792,2319.846,"You're in effect assuming that our cause requirement for the override of a default was a cause requirement which would ignore the fact that a prisoner in this case, in my hypothetical, was wrongfully denied an opportunity to make a factual record."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2319.846,2320.534,Well--
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2320.534,2325.485,"You're saying that wouldn't have been cause, and you're saying it's not cause... it's not fault here."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2325.485,2326.063,--No.
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2335.247,2341.76,"No, but this is a case in which it could have been satisfied with the exercise of due diligence, and due diligence in fact was expended."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2352.225,2361.316,"--Justice Souter, I hope I have the time to get to that, because we certainly dispute that these claims could have been raised... could not have been raised with due diligence in State court."
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2397.067,2400.769,"Well, but... you know, I recognize that fault can be read either way."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2406.172,2406.952,--Well--
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2406.952,2428.741,"One of my concerns, though, is that if we read fault your way, we are in fact going to be providing that in a class of cases there can be no Federal habeas, despite entitlement under Federal constitutional law, except for innocent prisoners, and that is... that would be a good reason for reading it the petitioner's way."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2428.741,2442.735,"--Well, I do think that that was Congress' intent, that they did not intend to unleash the power of the Federal judiciary in the form of a Federal evidentiary hearing in the case of a State prisoner absent a strong showing of innocence."
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2442.735,2447.577,Then why didn't they simply provide that there would be no Federal habeas except for innocent prisoners?
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2447.577,2451.169,Because they also want the prisoner to be diligent.
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2452.638,2455.73,"What difference does it make, if only innocent prisoners get habeas?"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2457.666,2459.869,--Well--
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2459.869,2463.04,"If they're innocent, fine."
1999.99-6615,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2465.399,2471.943,"--I take it we're talking here not about whether they get ultimate habeas relief, but whether they get discovery or not."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2485.249,2488.747,"--Sure, absolutely, and you know, it seems to me--"
1999.99-6615,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2488.747,2505.881,"Well, but now, Mr. Curry, I thought that a majority of the Federal circuits to have interpreted this very section, (e)(2), have articulated some kind of a fault requirement, if you will, on the part of the defendant."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2505.881,2507.974,"--Oh, there's no question they have, and I think they're dead wrong."
1999.99-6615,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2509.849,2529.856,"Well, let me ask you, if we think they're right, and if we were to opt for what the majority of the courts of appeals have held, then could this applicant have developed a factual basis in State proceedings in Virginia?"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2529.856,2533.917,"--Absolutely, and I'll go to the individual claims if the Court likes at this point."
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2587.068,2593.972,"No, but it isn't interviewing the juror, it's interviewing the prosecutor, who was the trial... who was counsel for this woman during the divorce."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2594.847,2597.454,"Well, they could have interviewed the prosecutor, too, but the claim wouldn't--"
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2597.454,2612.792,"And asked him... when in an open court there's a question raised as to whether anybody on the jury has been represented by one of the lawyers and there's no answer, they are supposed to go ask the prosecutor, did you or did you not represent any juror?"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2612.792,2613.448,--No.
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2613.448,2615.963,Is that what you say they had a duty to do?
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2615.963,2618.01,"No, I'm not."
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2622.881,2627.535,"Well, what was the failure on their part to find out about this representation before?"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2627.988,2633.517,"Because they... Justice Stevens, they told the Virginia supreme court that they wanted an investigator to go interview the jurors."
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2633.517,2634.455,"--No, no, no."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2641.733,2642.67,But Justice Stevens--
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2642.67,2643.405,Doesn't that trouble you at all?
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2643.405,2646.529,"--Justice Stevens, the claim doesn't arise without talking to the jurors."
1999.99-6615,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2646.529,2660.319,But I thought here it was alleged this morning that the juror in question was asked if anyone had represented her and she said no.
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2660.319,2660.585,Right.
1999.99-6615,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2660.585,2665.443,"And she was under oath at that time, I assume, to tell the truth."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2665.443,2675.392,"She was asked, have you been represented by any parties, and she didn't respond to the question because she didn't think... look, this was an uncontested divorce, and hopefully some other--"
1999.99-6615,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2675.392,2681.218,"Well, in any event it looks like there might be some factual concern here."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2692.136,2692.76,--Absolutely.
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2698.445,2742.786,"Okay, but the question... I mean, I think what started all of this line of questioning off was the assumption that fault in the statute does refer to some failing rather than kind of a strict... a failure of diligence rather than a strict, mere failing, and the question that I think Justice Stevens raised is, given the fact that the voir dire question was raised in open court, the juror did not respond, and the prosecutor did not respond, could defense counsel have been at fault for failing to investigate further into the counsel relationship?"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2744.896,2747.317,"--Defense counsel, or State habeas counsel?"
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2747.317,2751.784,"Well, at this stage we can say State habeas counsel."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2751.784,2752.065,Absolutely.
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2752.065,2755.829,Was State habeas counsel entitled to rely on that statement in the record?
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2755.829,2756.97,Absolutely not.
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2761.499,2764.17,"No, they may have asked for investigators--"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2764.17,2764.436,--No.
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2764.436,2765.967,--because they wanted to go further--
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2765.967,2766.998,"No, Justice Souter--"
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2766.998,2771.121,--But are you saying that they were not entitled to rely upon the silence of the record--
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2771.121,2772.746,"--No, they weren't."
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2772.746,2773.947,--for purposes of... okay.
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2773.947,2780.335,"They alleged in the Virginia supreme court that there were irregularities with respect to the jury, and that's why they wanted to go interview them."
1999.99-6615,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2780.335,2793.237,"But they didn't have a clue what they were until the Federal habeas, when an investigator quizzed five jurors and a couple of them said, oh yeah, she was married to--"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2793.237,2797.438,There's absolutely no reason why State habeas counsel could not have done that.
1999.99-6615,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2797.438,2804.357,"--Counsel, I looked at... this case arose in what, Cumberland County, Virginia?"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2804.357,2805.186,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-6615,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2805.186,2809.574,"And I saw from the atlas Cumberland County has a population of 7,500."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2809.574,2812.168,"I'm not sure of the exact number, but it is small."
1999.99-6615,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2812.168,2818.226,Is that the right order of... and are jurors for a trial like this drawn from anywhere outside of Cumberland County?
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2818.226,2818.929,"No, Your Honor."
1999.99-6615,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2818.929,2821.6,What about the other one?
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2821.6,2823.506,The other what?
1999.99-6615,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2823.506,2825.583,"Well, I mean, I understand your point."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2844.686,2846.467,Let me tell you two reasons why it doesn't matter.
1999.99-6615,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2904.85,2913.252,"Is he supposed to look at the... I don't know, is he familiar with the different persons, who's a codefendant, sentencing, transcript... I mean--"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2913.252,2916.423,He made it an exhibit with his State habeas petition.
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2944.225,2954.596,"--Well, it may... you know, it may or may not ultimately be helpful on Brady if he gets to it, but I just wanted to follow Justice Breyer's question with this, and I may be wrong on this."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2986.192,2989.8,"I'm not sure I understand the question, but I--"
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2989.8,2992.784,"The question is, I thought the State's response was--"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2992.784,2994.798,--When he asked about a psychiatric--
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2994.798,2997.656,"--ultimately to the Brady request, it was in the file--"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2997.656,2998.016,--No.
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2998.016,3001.996,--so that the Brady issue turned down to a dispute as to whether it was or was not in the file.
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3001.996,3002.278,No.
1999.99-6615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3002.278,3002.918,Is that wrong?
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3002.918,3003.778,"No, that's not right."
1999.99-6615,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3070.954,3084.48,"Can you... let me tell you exactly what's bothering me about the third part, the part about the standard of clear and convincing evidence, et cetera, and that I take it is what's putting the pressure on the word fail, on his side of it."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3113.235,3113.342,"Well, I--"
1999.99-6615,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3113.342,3127.852,"--Is... because now, you read the literal words of that third part, and those literal words seem to say that the defendant loses in that circumstance, and that's why I say I'm not sure they mean what they say."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3127.852,3128.555,--I--
1999.99-6615,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3128.555,3133.82,"Would there be a constitutional problem, and that same problem I guess is here, but with the word failure."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3133.82,3140.207,"--With all due respect, Justice Breyer, I don't think it's permissible to say that Congress didn't mean what it said."
1999.99-6615,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3146.378,3149.36,"Well, is there a constitutional problem in the case I put?"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3149.36,3150.688,--I don't think so.
1999.99-6615,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3158.716,3170.213,"Mr. Curry, we're now moving from the argument... there was a concession that if you get to (e)(2) the petitioner loses, and they're talking about only whether fault is required in that first part."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3170.213,3171.04,Right.
1999.99-6615,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3171.04,3176.491,"And you address the jury, and you address the claimant, where Merhige held in your favor."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3176.491,3177.069,That's right.
1999.99-6615,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3177.069,3185.019,"But not one word has been said about the claim where Merhige ruled against you, and so could you address that?"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3185.019,3186.58,He ruled against me on what point?
1999.99-6615,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3186.58,3189.86,On the third objection that was made.
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3189.86,3191.297,About this alleged secret deal?
1999.99-6615,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3191.297,3194.701,On the deal between the prosecutor and Cruse.
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3194.701,3198.607,"Well, this to me is the weakest of all claims."
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3219.052,3220.146,But there would be evidence--
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3220.146,3221.393,There was no evidence in Federal court.
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3221.393,3226.61,"--There would be evidence to support it if the psychiatric report had been available, would there not?"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3226.61,3228.72,It's two different claims.
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3228.72,3242.636,"Well, I know, but if it were clear from that report that the... Cruse could not have intelligently given the testimony he did based on his own recollection, it would raise a strong inference that he did so pursuant to an agreement with the prosecutor."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3242.636,3244.011,I don't see that at all.
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3244.011,3244.479,You don't?
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3244.479,3247.135,"I don't see the inference, the connection between those two things."
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3248.508,3254.615,"Well, as I understand the psychiatric report, it was that he was not in condition to have remembered everything he testified to."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3257.066,3257.41,--Right.
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3261.691,3265.563,--Which is flatly inconsistent with the clear recollection he displayed at the trial.
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3265.563,3266.548,"--Justice Stevens, I don't think--"
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3266.548,3266.923,Is it not?
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3266.923,3271.0,--I don't think defense counsel would have even used that if they'd known about it.
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3271.0,3274.591,"Well, don't you think there's some tensions between the two, between the--"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3274.591,3277.043,I don't think it has any connection to whether or not he has a deal.
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3279.371,3279.964,"--No, no, no."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3285.79,3286.555,"--Oh, certainly."
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3286.555,3292.49,And does that then not give rise to an inference that perhaps there was some understanding with the prosecutor?
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3292.49,3293.615,Absolutely not.
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3332.958,3336.925,Just one other question about your opening remarks.
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3350.92,3353.232,Was not fatal?
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3353.232,3356.059,"Yes, if that one shot did not cause the death."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3356.059,3361.056,"Well, this shot did cause the death, but no--"
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3361.056,3361.369,"Well, no--"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3361.369,3361.79,--No.
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3369.989,3372.442,"--No, I'm not sure you've answered me directly."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3382.798,3390.966,"The jury would have to find that they were what we call joint participants, that they each played a part, an active part in inflicting the fatal injuries."
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3403.399,3408.022,"The thing that troubles me, if that's right, the whole case is a tempest in a teapot, because no matter what happens, you win, if that's right."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3408.022,3409.287,"Well, that's right."
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3411.738,3427.529,"It's amazing, because the understanding I had of the Virginia law aspect of the case through all the judges that reviewed it up to now was that if he's right that he just fired one shot and that shot was not fatal, he's not eligible for the death penalty."
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3427.529,3428.248,You can look at--
1999.99-6615,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3428.248,3430.559,"And if that predicate is wrong, you certainly--"
1999.99-6615,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,3430.559,3438.291,"--You can look at Judge Merhige's statement at page 645, that they all three definitely contributed to Mr. Keller's death, all three of the head shots."
1999.99-6615,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3438.291,3439.837,"--Thank you, Mr. Curry."
1999.99-6615,2,29334,john_h_blume,,3442.648,3444.007,A lot of ground.
1999.99-6615,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3461.125,3461.703,Wait a minute.
1999.99-6615,2,29334,john_h_blume,,3477.166,3484.6,"That's my understanding of the law, and in this case the shot that most recently Mr. Williams fired was not... the medical examiner could not say--"
1999.99-6615,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3484.6,3486.178,"You should always go in with a cohort, then."
1999.99-6615,2,29334,john_h_blume,,3486.178,3487.13,--Could not say--
1999.99-6615,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3495.439,3498.407,Is the legal point of Virginia law covered in the briefs?
1999.99-6615,2,29334,john_h_blume,,3498.407,3498.828,Yes.
1999.99-6615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3500.11,3513.525,"According to what he just read, it says according to medical evidence presented, any of the three gunshot wounds... any... could have been potentially lethal, and all three definitely contributed to his death, with a lot of citations, so what is the issue?"
1999.99-6615,2,29334,john_h_blume,,3513.525,3519.523,"--Well, the answer is, the medical examiner had sort of an unusual view of contributory, and she said any wound is contributory."
1999.99-6615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3617.482,3618.748,"No, no--"
1999.99-6615,2,29334,john_h_blume,,3618.748,3622.014,"The medical evidence didn't answer it, the ballistics evidence didn't answer it, and that was why this was--"
1999.99-6615,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3622.014,3622.903,"Thank you, Mr. Blume."
