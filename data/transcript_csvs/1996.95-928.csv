1996.95-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.272,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-928, John W. Atherton, Jr. v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,10.572,14.926,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,80.202,99.08,"Mr. Stevens, I think, if I remember correctly, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals assumed there was a Federal common law standard here, and left it open on remand to the district court to determine the scope of the standard, is that right?"
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,99.08,100.949,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, they did... they--"
1996.95-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,100.949,108.935,Did the petitioners here concede in the court of appeals that a Federal common law standard applied?
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,108.935,109.737,"--No, we did not."
1996.95-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,125.064,132.318,And do you think that the question whether there exists a Federal common law rule was preserved--
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,132.318,133.503,"Yes, I do."
1996.95-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,133.503,134.053,--here?
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,134.053,134.503,Yes.
1996.95-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,134.503,139.241,It wasn't... it wasn't set out that clearly in your original cert petition.
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,139.241,170.426,"Well, in the... the second of the two questions presented in the cert petition is as follows, quote, Whether the court of appeals erred in concluding that section 1821(k)... and I'm leaving out some descriptive language of that now... has no application whatsoever to RTC actions against officers and directors of failed federally chartered FDIC insured institutions, and that the liability of officers and directors of such institutions is instead governed exclusively by Federal common law."
1996.95-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,208.051,211.437,And what State law do you say applies in this case?
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,211.437,219.443,It's our contention that the State law that would apply in cases such as this would be the law of the place of the location of the principal place of business of the association.
1996.95-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,219.443,220.359,Which is?
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,220.359,221.728,New Jersey.
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,226.529,230.85,"But that was in response to the district court's ruling, wasn't it?"
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,230.85,231.966,"No, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,253.097,265.488,"But do I understand correctly that the district court's opinion said that 1821(k) was the exclusive law applicable to a Federal, federally chartered institution?"
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,265.488,266.106,That's correct.
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,266.106,268.625,And you are not defending that position.
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,268.625,269.525,"No, Your Honor, we are not."
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,270.175,276.545,"So no one is supporting the district court, who said that 1821(k) is just it, there's nothing else?"
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,276.545,277.481,"--Well, let me be clear."
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,299.228,305.149,"Yes, so to that extent you agree that the district court was wrong."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,305.149,305.849,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,305.849,307.166,May I ask--
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,311.552,316.689,"Well, to be candid, Your Honor, I think that's why the FDIC waived its State law claim."
1996.95-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,323.426,324.962,"So it really doesn't matter, then, if there's a--"
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,324.962,326.128,I don't think it does.
1996.95-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,332.116,332.749,"--Well, it might not be."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,355.064,355.581,Correct.
1996.95-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,355.581,356.131,Okay.
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,356.131,357.349,We would take the position there's no difference.
1996.95-928,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,357.349,357.816,Do you--
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,365.853,366.289,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,366.289,366.755,Yes.
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,366.755,367.272,Absolutely.
1996.95-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,367.272,370.474,Do you say that Federal law governs--
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,370.474,371.09,"Well, it--"
1996.95-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,371.09,372.107,--federally chartered--
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,372.107,375.676,--Institutions?
1996.95-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,375.676,376.128,--savings and loans?
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,376.128,385.817,"No, and the reason for that is that this Court has made it clear that for Federal common law to apply, two tests have to be met."
1996.95-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,385.817,386.6,"Well now, wait a minute."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,393.07,418.705,"Well, that would be predicated upon a finding that the criteria for the application of Federal law, Federal common law is present, but that there is no conflict, and that there's no conflict between the application of State law and Federal law as in Kimbell Foods, where this Court held that the issue there was governed by Federal law, but that there was no reason not to use State law as the rule of Federal decision."
1996.95-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,480.628,502.375,"The only thing to be said on the other side, however, is what... it's... other corporations that are established under Delaware law, New Jersey law, or whatever, they have a clear law to apply when there is a suit by shareholders as far as internal management is concerned."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,512.416,514.716,"It's not only likely, it's what they did."
1996.95-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,533.246,534.013,When was that adopted?
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,534.013,538.65,"1933, and it... and we have had 63 years when Congress--"
1996.95-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,538.65,540.234,"It was before Erie, wasn't it?"
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,540.234,546.054,"--It was before Erie, but Congress has had every opportunity to amend the statute numerous times after Erie and it hasn't done so, and--"
1996.95-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.054,554.509,So I guess what Congress was thinking at the time was that there is up in the sky there a common law concerning directors' liability.
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,554.509,561.73,"--Well, it might have thought that there was a State common law, but it would have been hard to think that there was a Federal common law."
1996.95-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,561.73,562.099,"No, it didn't."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,565.384,566.384,"I agree, but--"
1996.95-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.384,567.601,We made that up after Erie.
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,567.601,588.667,"--Correct, Your Honor, but in this Court's decision in Herrmann v. Edwards and Whittemore v. Amoskeag Bank, the Court made it clear that the mere fact that there was an assertion by shareholders of a national bank against its directors and officers for mismanagement was not sufficient to give rise to a Federal cause of action where the assertion was made under common law."
1996.95-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,598.955,604.676,"What you're saying is, we... in light of what happened after Erie we should treat corporate law the same way we treat contract law."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,610.496,616.567,"Well, assuming for the sake of argument that there was a Federal common law pre-Erie in this area, yes, Erie demolishes it."
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,616.567,640.032,"But Mr. Stevens, one problem is that there is no entity, no State that has chartered the Federal institution, so let's assume for the minute that we don't have any 1821(k), and the question is simply, what law governs the internal operations of a federally chartered institution?"
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,643.567,656.459,"No, it would be State law where the principal place of business was located, and I would point Your Honor to the recent regulation promulgated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates all nationally chartered banks."
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,660.346,661.629,You cited that in your brief.
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,661.629,662.163,--Yes.
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,662.163,669.885,"But you have to get to the principal place of business by some Federal law, and you at least have a Federal choice of law rule, right?"
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,669.885,670.819,I don't think you do.
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,671.42,676.022,"Well then, where did the identification of the principal place of business come from?"
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,676.022,676.405,--I--
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,676.405,677.224,Not the sky.
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,677.224,677.69,--No.
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,682.342,688.18,But under State law the State of incorporation would govern internal operations.
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,688.18,697.536,"--I understand that, but in 1821(k) Congress itself said, define gross negligence under applicable State law."
1996.95-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,717.282,734.977,"That may be, but I think you still have to overcome Justice Ginsburg's assertion that if there is no Federal substantive law there is also no Federal choice of law, so you really can't say for sure that the law which governs is the law of principal place of business."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,737.596,738.563,--Correct.
1996.95-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,738.563,741.065,So you really don't know what law governs.
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,741.065,743.0,It's... it's my... I--
1996.95-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,743.0,745.067,In most forums it would probably be the State of the--
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,745.067,749.904,"--I can't say definitively, but that's not the issue that's in front of the Court, and it could be resolved below."
1996.95-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.904,758.926,"--In a way it is, because we hate to have these corporations floating out there with no accepted law governing their internal operations."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,769.984,783.058,"Well, if it's necessary to establish a uniform Federal rule that says it's the principal place of business, I suppose the Court could do that, although it strikes me that that's antithetical to the--"
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,783.058,788.546,You have identified the principal place of business as the State law that would control.
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,793.782,802.205,"--Well, I guess I get it from the fact that the rule in most States is that, that that's the rule in the Model Business Code, that that's the rule that--"
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,802.205,803.138,But I thought the rule--
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,803.138,804.573,--the OCC has indicated--
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,804.573,805.107,"--No, but--"
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,806.657,809.875,"--It is, but that rule wouldn't be applicable here."
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,809.875,811.694,"No, but you're--"
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,820.683,830.373,"That's correct, but I think you have to keep in mind that historically the reason they looked to the State law of incorporation was because that was where the principal place of business was."
1996.95-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,853.738,854.923,"No, but you--"
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,874.468,875.586,"I think that's right, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,875.586,895.565,"Yes, but even on Justice Scalia's analysis, you've still got to have a basis for looking to some State law somewhere, and it seems to me that your answer to Justice Ginsburg boils down to this, that in addition to the O'Melveny standard, there's another source of Federal common law here, and the source is something like necessity."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,920.282,923.234,"I would... I would agree with that as well, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,923.234,924.067,--Okay.
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,933.523,934.292,"No, you don't."
1996.95-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,934.292,936.075,--in order to answer the questions before us?
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,936.075,937.91,"No, you do not, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,937.91,943.314,What about applying the gross negligence standard in accordance with State law and so forth?
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,946.933,950.052,"Well, I think you'd look to State conflicts laws."
1996.95-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,958.59,961.775,"But on your view of the case, that's what has to be done in this case."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,961.775,962.409,--Yes.
1996.95-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,962.409,967.013,It's the gross negligence standard specified in 1821(k) in conformity with State law.
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,967.013,967.779,"Right, in my--"
1996.95-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.779,969.548,And what State law are we talking about in this--
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,969.548,970.231,--New Jersey in my--
1996.95-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.231,971.115,--Everybody agrees to that.
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,971.115,971.731,--New Jersey--
1996.95-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.731,973.933,And is that because that's the principal place of business?
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,973.933,974.517,--Yes.
1996.95-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,974.517,983.606,"And I take it that if the State of New Jersey allowed an action for simple negligence, that would be permissible under the Reserve Clause?"
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,983.606,984.808,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,984.808,995.414,"So they have to allow at least gross negligence, but if they have a more proplaintiff standard of liability than that, that, too, is incorporated."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,995.414,1001.834,"That's correct, which I think is entirely consistent with the policy behind FIRREA and the legislative history of the act."
1996.95-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1001.834,1003.52,Could all this be solved by regulation?
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1014.577,1023.183,"Well, this Court, in de la questa, said that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which has been succeeded by the OTS, has plenary authority over federally chartered thrifts."
1996.95-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1023.183,1023.849,--Mm-hmm.
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1023.849,1036.906,"I think that the OTS would have authority to promulgate regulations, all kinds of regulations related to the internal operations by saying you can only make loans that have this loan-to-value ratio, or you have to have this kind of collateral."
1996.95-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1104.651,1106.503,"Well, this is only after takeover, though, isn't it?"
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1106.503,1107.303,No.
1996.95-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1107.303,1107.853,No?
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1107.853,1114.174,That administrative remedy is available to the agencies when the institution is solvent at any time.
1996.95-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1114.174,1120.078,"What about the savings clause in this Federal statute, 18--"
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1120.078,1121.18,21(k)?
1996.95-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1121.18,1122.23,--21(k)?
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1122.23,1127.833,The savings clause in this statute doesn't help the Government here for several reasons.
1996.95-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1146.145,1164.876,"Well, it isn't inoperative if you look at it from the point of view that at least faced with State law that says you need intentional misconduct, that the Federal law says no gross negligence will suffice, so of course it isn't inoperable."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1164.876,1169.677,It isn't... it doesn't render the language inoperable with respect to State-chartered institutions.
1996.95-928,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1177.116,1180.235,"Yes, but it doesn't if what you just said is the case."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1199.43,1200.113,Absolutely correct.
1996.95-928,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1208.036,1220.962,"And also that would be true if, as you've just said, the Federal law is that we look to the law of the State where the principal place of business of the federally incorporated bank exists."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1220.962,1222.378,"No, I wouldn't agree with that for this--"
1996.95-928,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1222.378,1222.812,Why not?
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1222.812,1223.578,--For this reason.
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1314.238,1324.28,"Mr. Stevens, I thought your position was that there was in effect nothing to save, because there never was any governing Federal common law."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1324.28,1325.196,That is our position.
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1325.196,1336.087,Which is quite different from... your answer to Justice Breyer seemed to imply there was Federal common law but there is no longer by virtue of the first sentence of 1821(k).
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1336.087,1336.987,"I didn't mean to say that, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1366.503,1374.459,"But your position is that there is no substantive Federal common law, no common law governing the substantive standard of liability."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1382.965,1383.598,Yes.
1996.95-928,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1383.598,1390.052,"And that's what Justice Breyer's question was assuming, and I would have supposed that the Milwaukee case did not deal with that."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1390.052,1390.754,I think that's--
1996.95-928,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1390.754,1392.788,--because the Milwaukee case was dealing with substantive law.
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1392.788,1394.606,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1394.606,1397.142,So I would... then would you change your answer to--
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1397.142,1397.608,Yes.
1996.95-928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1405.58,1418.988,--Does the State of New Jersey under your view of the case have certain obligations that it imposes on directors by which we measure whether or not there has been gross negligence?
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1434.331,1435.85,--I don't believe so.
1996.95-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1456.363,1456.746,"Well, I have one last question."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1469.571,1470.44,Your Honor--
1996.95-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1470.44,1471.59,So was that an error?
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1471.59,1472.19,--Yes.
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1518.219,1535.78,"Mr. Stevens, I don't follow how you suddenly saw a light from O'Melveny which involved a State chartered institution, so this question of what law governs the internal operations of a federally chartered institution wasn't touched by O'Melveny."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1535.78,1543.869,"Well, Your Honor, it's true that that case involved a State-chartered institution, but the proposition that there is no general Federal common law, the--"
1996.95-928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1543.869,1550.356,To govern a State-chartered institution that has internal operations controlled by the State of incorporation.
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1550.356,1565.133,"--Well, as I said, it's true that the facts of that case involved a State-chartered institution, but the propositions articulated by the Court at the beginning of that opinion I don't believe are limited by the fact that the institution in that case was State-chartered."
1996.95-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1581.494,1582.744,"Thank you, Mr. Stevens."
1996.95-928,0,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,1585.963,1587.315,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1587.315,1592.767,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.254,1626.106,They haven't argued to the contrary.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1633.176,1635.295,"--Your Honor, that is certainly their primary argument."
1996.95-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1640.514,1642.716,"--Is that what you're going to address now, or the primary?"
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1642.716,1648.084,"Well, the arguments have sort of switched place in terms of what's primary and what's not from the briefing schedule."
1996.95-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1667.997,1670.033,I think that's generally agreed.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1670.033,1678.805,"All right, and I'd like to note one extra thing at this point which is, to the degree that there's an argument here that the FDIC has waived its State law claims, there has been no waiver here."
1996.95-928,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1686.143,1690.863,"Well, do you agree we don't have to decide what the applicable State law is here?"
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1690.863,1695.851,"Oh, I agree, Your Honor, primarily because we don't believe that there is applicable State law here."
1996.95-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1697.483,1703.52,"May I... I think this is what you're going to address, but you contend there is a Federal common law that is applicable."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1703.52,1704.604,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1704.604,1709.074,And is the Federal common law rule one that is the same in all States in the country?
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1709.074,1709.991,Yes.
1996.95-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1709.991,1716.597,"And why, then, is the Federal statutory gross negligence law... rule somewhat different in different States?"
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1716.597,1724.101,"Your Honor, that can be explained by what the state of the law was at the time that Congress acted, and what Congress' purposes here were."
1996.95-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1777.136,1781.02,"That's by no means the only reading of that statute, certainly."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1786.424,1790.562,"No, Your Honor, but we believe it's the one that makes the most sense out of the language in the following sense."
1996.95-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.659,1818.963,"You're saying there's no reference to State law, that that provision does not refer to State law at all?"
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1818.963,1819.997,"Oh, no, no, no."
1996.95-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1826.401,1827.051,But--
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1827.051,1828.853,--in terms of civil suits would be Federal common law.
1996.95-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1828.853,1829.487,--Right.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1836.257,1838.393,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1838.393,1839.509,That's the City of Milwaukee.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1839.509,1857.338,"Your Honor, when the statute speaks to the matter at issue this Court has said that that's what... but in order to determine what the statute says when it speaks we've got to look at the words of the statute, and what this statute says is, the FDIC can always sue for gross negligence, but the FDIC can also assert whatever it could have asserted otherwise under other applicable law."
1996.95-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1857.338,1864.193,"Well, but when you say other applicable law, do you think that... you say that meant they meant to preserve Federal common law, too?"
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1864.193,1864.843,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1870.68,1873.382,"Yes, but no... there were no decisions from this Court on point."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1873.382,1877.918,"No, but there were decisions from courts of appeals in district courts, and Congress is presumed to know those."
1996.95-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1877.918,1881.636,So Congress is supposed to sort out the various Federal rules and the State rules?
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1881.636,1885.607,"Your Honor, we're not contending that Congress sorted out and decided what was correct and what was incorrect."
1996.95-928,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1895.23,1910.472,"But some weren't, and to say in the statute that nothing in this paragraph shall affect any right of the FDIC under other applicable law reads to me as though they are also saving State law where it applies."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1910.472,1911.757,"Oh, there's no doubt about that."
1996.95-928,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1911.757,1919.911,And quite possibly the Federal common law directs us to State common law for the standard.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1919.911,1920.161,All right.
1996.95-928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1950.68,1957.834,"But Mr. Bress, that depends on assuming that there is Federal common law that would govern the internal operation, something that this Court has never decided."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1957.834,1960.036,"That's right, Your Honor, and let me now address that."
1996.95-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.657,1993.257,Of sovereignty?
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1993.257,1994.375,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1994.375,2014.021,"You think it would be unconstitutional for a State, for example, to impose upon directors for certain activities a liability higher... to that State's citizens a liability higher than what the corporate State of incorporation would provide?"
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2014.021,2016.956,"Your Honor, it flows from principles of sovereignty."
1996.95-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2044.142,2045.142,In contracts--
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2046.008,2046.542,What's that?
1996.95-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2046.542,2047.094,"--In contracts, too."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2047.094,2048.677,And in contracts as well.
1996.95-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.677,2049.476,No.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2075.893,2078.196,"Not at all, Your Honor, in this sense."
1996.95-928,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2099.979,2120.725,"But that's exactly my question, to be less elliptical, is what is the practical Federal interest here that requires a Federal common law that could not be served as well by a Federal common law pointer rule that said, simply apply the law of the State, a principal place of business, or the Model Business Code?"
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2122.692,2132.7,"Your Honor, it's certainly true that in many areas this Court as a pointer rule will look to a State's law really as a convenient point of reference, and we think that that's a propriate in many instances."
1996.95-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2162.902,2164.219,But your argument goes well beyond that.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2193.038,2200.594,"Well, Your Honor, if we were talking about inventing all of corporate law for financial institutions I would be constrained to agree with you."
1996.95-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2237.617,2239.883,"Are you talking about preinsolvency, or postinsolvency?"
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2239.883,2252.793,"--I'm talking about preinsolvency, and similarly, if a State were to enact strict liability as the standard, should that mean that the Federal chartering authority should have no ability to make sure that their institutions could attract officers and directors--"
1996.95-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2252.793,2261.998,"But it's one thing to say the Federal chartering authority has no right to do that, but it's another thing to say that the Federal courts should step in on their own and develop a body of law."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2261.998,2263.865,"--Well, Your Honor, I'm glad you've mentioned that."
1996.95-928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2290.566,2296.12,"Mr. Bress, those duties govern the relationship between the regulator and the bank, is that correct?"
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2296.12,2297.572,Those duties are--
1996.95-928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2297.572,2303.809,Does OTS purport to be governing the relationship between the bank and its shareholders?
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2303.809,2314.967,--The OTS has spoken in agency adjudication and said that the duties that are enforced should be the duties that the Federal regulator enforces as a matter of Federal law and should not depend on the courts of State law.
1996.95-928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2314.967,2315.383,All right.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2315.383,2316.65,It said that in agency adjudication.
1996.95-928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2316.65,2335.031,"Well, it says it shouldn't depend on the quirks of State law, and yet under O'Melveny don't we have to see whether there is a conflict between the Federal interest and the State law, and it has been virtually conceded here that the law of every State on this point is ordinary negligence."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2338.899,2339.333,Okay.
1996.95-928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2360.329,2367.502,And you're displacing that law presumably in favor of a standard substantively which is different from the State law.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2367.502,2367.802,--That's right.
1996.95-928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2368.468,2369.418,That's not the case here.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2369.418,2372.47,"Well, let me... I will address that, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2372.837,2373.656,"Mr. Bress, I think you ought to clarify one thing."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2378.708,2379.31,--I--
1996.95-928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2379.31,2382.06,I thought... if that were the case there would never have been any need for this statute.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2382.06,2388.832,"--Your Honor, most States as a matter of common law and a matter of statutory law, they don't speak in terms of ordinary negligence."
1996.95-928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2406.043,2406.56,But--
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2416.999,2417.533,--Okay--
1996.95-928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2417.533,2419.868,--so Congress wanted to say at least gross negligence.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2419.868,2431.259,"--Your Honor, there are several States, and there was a trend during the late 1980's of States that were, as a matter of statutory law, restricting liability of officers and directors to gross negligence or worse."
1996.95-928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2434.461,2441.3,"Yes, I think where we got confused is that the State common law was ordinary negligence, but the State insulating statutes supplanted common law and that's why we got--"
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2441.3,2455.291,"That's correct, Your Honor, and in terms of negligence and ordinary negligence this... it's somewhat helpful, I think, even now to look back at the... at this Court's formulation in Briggs where it said what you're really talking about is ordinary care is the standard, and in some circumstances perhaps slight care is required."
1996.95-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2468.034,2468.518,--May I--
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2468.518,2470.634,But if I might continue as to why we use a Federal standard--
1996.95-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2470.634,2472.07,--May I interrupt with one question?
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2481.508,2484.643,"--They are, Your Honor, and in those instances you do have--"
1996.95-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2484.643,2485.077,Well--
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2485.077,2491.031,"--Well, in those instances you have two separate standards that are going to apply to the officers and directors, because you have two separate sovereigns that have an interest."
1996.95-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2507.909,2514.83,"--Yes, but if you're right that those sections dictate ordinary care across the board, Congress didn't have to enact this statute."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2514.83,2530.608,"--No, Your Honor, and I think Congress did, because there's no question that ordinary care is the standard for purposes of Federal regulatory enforcement as a Federal standard, because the statute was enacted to protect the Federal interest in the safety and soundness of all banks."
1996.95-928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2559.544,2560.428,But then in--
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2584.826,2587.611,"If I... if that's how I came across, Your Honor, I'm sorry."
1996.95-928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2606.406,2608.358,"But that's not common law, then."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2610.576,2611.876,"--No, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2611.876,2616.464,"If you're saying its right in the statute and that's all that OTS is doing, then aren't you saying there's a preemption?"
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2616.464,2617.897,"Well, not quite, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2618.832,2619.566,"Well, how close do you--"
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2619.566,2621.166,"--All right... well, fairly close, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2639.413,2643.298,"--Well, that would be a much stronger argument, I would suppose, if this statute had never been passed."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2694.797,2718.246,"Your Honor, I think what the statute's telling you, and I think that what's actually the case here, is that there is a Federal interest, for instance, with regard to all banks whether they're State or Federal, that's clear, and in 1821(k) that interest was the Federal interest as in Shaw, and what Congress did is said... the first draft, in fact, of the Senate bill would have allowed the FDIC to proceed as receiver under any common law action, including ordinary negligence."
1996.95-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2740.695,2750.734,"But that suggests neither uniformity, nor does it suggest, as I thought you said earlier, that 1821(k) adopts some sort of standard of ordinary negligence."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2750.734,2755.455,"--No, Your Honor, I... I'm sorry if that point has become confused."
1996.95-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2755.455,2756.205,I'm not sure I correctly understood you.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2756.205,2759.423,We don't say that 1821(k) as a standard of ordinary negligence.
1996.95-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2760.775,2763.894,"It has... to the extent it has a standard, its standard is gross negligence."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2763.894,2766.178,"--Your Honor, there's no question about that, and that's not where our argument's going."
1996.95-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2778.32,2779.42,Preinsolvency.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2779.42,2785.89,--that breach of fiduciary duties included... preinsolvency that breach of fiduciary duties included the breach of the duty of ordinary care.
1996.95-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2803.452,2806.804,I think your argument's just extremely opaque on that point.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2816.861,2819.313,"--We're not saying that Federal law points to State law, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2831.288,2835.507,"At a different stage of the proceeding, preinsolvency."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2835.507,2840.311,"Well, but again, all the FDIC's taking here are the rights that the institution had preinsolvency."
1996.95-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2840.311,2848.231,"Well then, we are just... if you're saying 1821(k) addresses this, we're talking about gross negligence, not simple negligence."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2848.231,2857.938,"Your Honor, 1821(k) says that if the other applicable law doesn't give you a gross negligence standard, you can still sue for gross negligence."
1996.95-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2885.006,2885.89,Mr. Bress--
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2885.89,2899.015,"--Federal Government has said ought to be enforced as the duty, and we're just saying, given the interest in uniformity demonstrated in the Homeowners Loan Act that savings and loans should be subject to uniform standards, one should look to what Congress has said and apply a uniform standard, otherwise--"
1996.95-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2899.015,2902.467,"--What Congress has said where, in (i)?"
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2902.467,2917.644,--In section 1818(i)(b)(2) Congress has said that officers and directors can be subject to civil money penalties for breach of fiduciary duties that cause or are likely to cause more than minimum damage to the institution.
1996.95-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2953.15,2954.55,"Well, they do under the gross negligence standard anyway."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2959.185,2961.47,--Officers and directors of federally chartered associations--
1996.95-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2961.47,2961.954,Oh.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2962.387,2964.672,"--That's all I'm talking about, is officers and directors of Federals."
1996.95-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2964.672,2970.743,--Am I correct that... you're familiar with the Seventh Circuit case where Judge Easterbrook took part of your position and Judge--
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2970.743,2971.31,That's right.
1996.95-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2971.31,2972.695,--Posner took another part.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2975.379,2976.213,"That's right, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2976.213,2976.646,Yes.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2976.646,2979.081,We think that Judge Easterbrook correctly recognized that--
1996.95-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2979.081,2979.548,He went the first step.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2979.548,2980.665,--throughout the chartering authority--
1996.95-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2980.665,2981.2,Yes.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2981.2,2986.252,--but he was incorrect in believing that it was displaced when you've got an express savings clause.
1996.95-928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2986.252,2999.495,"Then you are taking the position, Mr. Bress, that the first sentence has no application to a federally chartered institution because you will have under the Federal common law this ordinary negligence standard."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2999.495,3002.197,"Your Honor, our position is that it really has no practical application."
1996.95-928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3010.185,3014.421,"You were saying that Congress said we don't know what it is, but whatever it is, we're not leaving... we're leaving it alone."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,3014.421,3016.623,"--Whenever the law is out there, we're leaving it alone."
1996.95-928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3024.044,3035.835,"But you are saying, if your reading is correct that there is an ordinary negligence, Federal common law standard, then there would be no occasion ever to resort to the gross negligence part--"
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,3035.835,3036.868,There would be no... there would... no--
1996.95-928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3036.868,3037.887,--for any federally chartered institution.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,3037.887,3044.024,"--By virtue of this Court's decision, if the Court were to rule that way, there would be no need to resort to the first sentence."
1996.95-928,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3073.627,3074.193,Well--
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,3074.193,3079.797,"--a subsequent decision of that sort would render the first sentence of no practical effect with regard to Federal charters, that's true."
1996.95-928,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3079.797,3080.813,--It's that last part.
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,3128.628,3130.146,"All right, Your Honor, let me address that."
1996.95-928,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3150.124,3151.309,"We, this Court had not."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,3152.242,3156.796,"This Court had not, but Congress doesn't... it doesn't just enact laws in recognition of what this Court's decisions are."
1996.95-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3159.831,3161.098,"Well, but you just told us the opposite."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,3173.823,3174.425,--No--
1996.95-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3174.425,3176.658,"It might be applying State law, they might be applying Federal law."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,3177.71,3178.11,--Your Honor--
1996.95-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3178.11,3185.964,"Now in response to this question you say Congress must have assumed that they... you know, since the vast majority of lower courts were applying Federal law, that this was a Federal law at issue."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,3185.964,3186.983,"--Your Honor, there's no contradiction whatever."
1996.95-928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3186.983,3187.499,"Okay, well--"
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,3187.499,3190.185,What we're saying is that Congress had no view as to what the correct answer was.
1996.95-928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3206.176,3209.045,--Then how do you get a congressional policy for uniformity?
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,3214.532,3215.599,"That's right, Your Honor."
1996.95-928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3215.599,3227.089,"If that's correct, how do you conclude in answer to Justice Breyer's question and other questions that somehow there is a congressional indication somewhere, (e), (i), or anyway, that there is a need for a uniform standard?"
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,3227.089,3228.456,"Your Honor, if that's gotten lost, I'm sorry."
1996.95-928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3233.493,3234.093,"Well, that's Congress."
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,3234.093,3234.66,--What's that?
1996.95-928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3234.66,3235.395,"Oh, you're--"
1996.95-928,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,3235.395,3235.779,Right.
1996.95-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3261.228,3263.68,"--You've answered the question, Mr. Bress."
1996.95-928,2,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,3267.564,3268.833,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-928,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3300.203,3301.971,"Of course, they're entitled to change their position."
1996.95-928,2,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,3304.14,3305.807,--We changed our position on the basis of a change in the law.
1996.95-928,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3307.208,3311.51,"Well, but basically you do... you agree with Judge Posner's analysis, as I understand it."
1996.95-928,2,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,3311.51,3312.612,No.
1996.95-928,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3315.445,3315.914,"No, he rejected that."
1996.95-928,2,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,3315.914,3317.164,--doctrine.
1996.95-928,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3317.164,3317.697,"Well, that--"
1996.95-928,2,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,3317.697,3322.984,"Well, that's... he still used it, but he's... I believe... to the extent that he indicated it's not applicable, I agree with him."
1996.95-928,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3371.734,3373.734,--And what section are you referring to?
1996.95-928,2,40459,ronald_w_stevens,,3373.734,3376.103,1818(b)(6)(a).
1996.95-928,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3376.103,3377.603,"Thank you, Mr. Stevens."
