1979.78-1006,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,61.328,Will hear arguments next in Brown againts Glines.
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,65.942,69.948,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1006,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,212.471,218.487,There isn't an order outstanding enjoining the enforcement of these regulations?
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,218.487,220.966,Not precisely in this case.
1979.78-1006,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,255.512,264.339,You don't challenge the right of the particular Respondent in this case to make the petitioning that he did do?
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,264.339,267.731,"No, we don't."
1979.78-1006,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,267.731,271.151,Do you challenge his right to be reinstated?
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,271.151,273.653,"Well, we haven't sought review of that issue."
1979.78-1006,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,286.786,294.616,"I may have the two cases confused, but the Government had in effect conceded that the regulations were improperly applied to the particular litigants in the case."
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,294.616,296.204,"No, that is the other case."
1979.78-1006,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,296.204,297.332,That is the other; not this case.
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,298.158,307.546,In this case he directly violated the prior approval requirement by distributing without seeking approval.
1979.78-1006,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,307.546,309.852,The distribution was on the base.
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,309.852,311.465,It was on the base.
1979.78-1006,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,311.465,316.057,In violation of the statutes -- the provision of the Air Force.
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,316.057,317.38,"Yes, it was."
1979.78-1006,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,317.38,322.649,The only question remaining is whether that violates the Constitution?
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,322.649,325.544,Or U.S.C. 1034.
1979.78-1006,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,325.544,329.007,The distribution as well by Sergeant Wolf as well as Captain Glines.
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,329.007,352.137,"Well, the District Court found that the -- that Captain Glines violated the regulation and I think if you look at the affidavit that was filed by the serviceman in connection with the complaint, attached to the complaint you will see that what he said happened is that Captain Glines approached him in a service bay area, gave him a copy of the petition --"
1979.78-1006,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,352.137,353.863,"That is him, Sergeant Wolf?"
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,353.863,355.719,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1006,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,378.361,383.549,"Well, again, his violation was handing the piece of paper, not the oral statements; is that right?"
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,383.549,385.627,That is correct.
1979.78-1006,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,385.627,390.269,He can make the oral statements.
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,399.102,400.184,Yes.
1979.78-1006,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,404.093,411.351,And is the reason there is no question about it that it is not prohibited by the regulation or that it is protected by the Constitution or the statute?
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,412.262,421.292,"Well, I think the reasons come very close together and I think that that will be more evident as I get into my argument."
1979.78-1006,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,743.974,758.27,"Before you leave entirely your first submission, do I correctly understand your first submission is that the First Amendment simply has no application to military bases and therefore even oral statements back and forth between servicemen may be prohibited?"
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,758.27,767.063,"No, our submission is that the First Amendment doesn't create a right of use of public speech on military bases."
1979.78-1006,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,775.596,785.81,"But if it is speech that does not create any clear and present danger or interference of discipline or anything else, it would be constitutionally protected on the base?"
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,785.81,799.727,Private individual communications between servicemen would certainly we think be constitutionally protected except to the extent that Parker v. Levy allowed the military a broader scope to regulate --
1979.78-1006,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,799.727,810.093,You don't have anything as in Parker v. Levy where it is in effect you might say almost treasonable or at least advocating a course of action.
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,815.765,821.067,I think it would be; yes.
1979.78-1006,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,916.303,937.673,"Again, before you leave your second submission if I may to be sure I understand it, why would you concede that you can say orally that the food is lousy and we ought to do something about it, and disagree with the motion ""Let's all sign a petition to the commanding officer asking him to give better food""?"
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,942.976,945.508,"Well, you are referring just to the second part of our submission."
1979.78-1006,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,945.508,949.792,Yes.
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,949.792,956.15,I am not sure that we would take the position that that petition should be prohibited under the regulation.
1979.78-1006,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,961.865,968.856,"Well, why does he have to ask permission to do something in writing he need not ask permission to do orally?"
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,968.856,995.687,"Well, you are referring to what is the inherent distinction then between petitioning and simply private communication and the distinction is obviously we think that the petition has an immediate capacity to reach a far broader audience, to create a far more disruptive effect within the military and more directly impact upon the military's interest in discipline and morale and achieving its missions."
1979.78-1006,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1000.16,1008.701,What if he gave this appraisal of the quality of the food to an entire platoon; is that a private communication?
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1008.701,1016.957,"Well, if you did it, they were all standing together in a public area of the base, I suppose that would be a public communication."
1979.78-1006,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1017.501,1026.81,"By a private communication, you meant a couple of G.I.'s grousing in the barracks?"
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1026.81,1033.367,That would be a typical example of that.
1979.78-1006,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1064.708,1068.706,"I may be dense here, but I still am still a little unclear on the distinction."
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1097.437,1099.506,Our distinction is a practical one.
1979.78-1006,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.585,1120.843,"Well, the word ""private"" is a little misleading because both communications are equally either private or public, whichever way you characterize it."
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1123.104,1128.659,"Well, I think the petition is inherently public because it is designed to be sent somewhere."
1979.78-1006,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1136.574,1142.133,The petition is designed to get somebody else other than those 35 to do something about the lousy food.
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1142.133,1146.075,That is certainly one characteristic that makes the petition inherently more public.
1979.78-1006,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1146.075,1155.636,"Well, also the petition serves to put in some sort of distributable form the opinion of those 35 people if they all sign it."
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1155.636,1157.785,That is right and --
1979.78-1006,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1157.785,1167.013,"You may orally be able to walk away and say all 35 agreed with me but if they have signed a piece of paper, it is something else again."
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1167.013,1170.813,I think those are the distinctions that are involved.
1979.78-1006,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1191.165,1196.226,I can understand petitioning is more likely to be effective for the reasons that my Brother White identifies.
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1202.186,1206.688,We certainly think the petitioning is more disruptive.
1979.78-1006,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1225.956,1227.646,I just wonder if that is universally true.
1979.78-1006,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1237.382,1252.682,"Well, the military is drawing a distinction based on the evil that it has designed its regulation to prevent and I think as a practical matter on an aggregate basis its distinction is defensible."
1979.78-1006,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1623.672,1627.444,"Very well, Mr. Jones."
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,1635.235,1639.266,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1676.142,1683.131,How capable are judges deciding that as opposed to base commanders?
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,1683.131,1689.874,"Well, Your Honor, I think that judges are in many ways in a better position to decide on a constitutional basis."
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1689.874,1696.44,"They are more neutral, certainly but as a factual matter how capable are they?"
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,1696.44,1719.334,"I believe, Your Honor, that if the military commanders could separate themselves from their positions, desiring only that activities they desire to take place continue, if they do not have the respect for the right to petition as the commanders involved in these cases have, then they would be in a good position, Your Honor."
1979.78-1006,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1722.81,1732.008,"In any event, necessarily the Congress when it put in those conditions required the Judiciary to apply them, didn't they?"
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,1734.413,1735.897,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1006,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1735.897,1753.143,Did Congress really make a declaration -- if I understood your language correctly -- that these episodes lead to or -- or that on the basis they have a tendency to lead to --
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,1753.143,1754.805,You mean --
1979.78-1006,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1754.805,1763.739,Congress didn't say that every action in violation of this statute leads to breakdown in morale and loyalty in a military organization.
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,1763.739,1767.647,"Mr. Chief Justice, you used the term ""Congress."""
1979.78-1006,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1776.897,1778.965,The regulation that separates.
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,1826.416,1834.033,They are directed specifically -- the Air Force regulation of course is directed specifically at the circulation of petitions.
1979.78-1006,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1834.033,1836.133,That is quite different from sitting down with your pencil.
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,1843.436,1852.65,"In terms of the acts involved it is certainly different, but in terms of the effect it has on military security I believe that is not true."
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1954.425,1981.438,"Well, don't you think there is a tendency in a case like that for the military complement on the ship to be less willing to obey orders if they just had a petition circulated to them saying let's cut out this business of sailing?"
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,1981.438,1983.951,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1994.196,2021.906,"What if the petition had simply been not to Congress but to other servicemen into the base or to the commanding officer of the ship saying, We think it is a terrible idea to sail tonight and we want you to call the thing off?"
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2021.906,2028.804,The question is whether that would have a tendency to make the members of the ship less mindful of orders?
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2028.804,2034.524,To participate in the maneuver which had been ordered.
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2034.524,2038.383,I would suggest that the trained members of the service would not have that tendency.
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2058.498,2059.654,How?
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2062.368,2064.272,Trial after the initiation of circulation.
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2064.272,2068.186,"Well, so if the military mission would still be interfered with."
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2068.186,2071.4,"No, Your Honor, I do not believe that is true."
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2082.85,2104.921,"Well, but you just said that under the Uniform Code of Military Justice all that can be done is to punish after the petition is circulated and you conceded that that is all that can be done, as I understand, even with an inflammatory petition that could impair the willingness to obey orders."
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2104.921,2114.49,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, Article 134 authorizes punishment and I am quoting, of ""all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline."""
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2145.06,2152.76,Wouldn't it be better assurance of the security of the Nation in its performance to require advance clearance?
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2152.76,2165.967,"No, Your Honor, and that is because the -- since grievances do not go away the person who would circulate a petition peacefully may choose some other means of expressing the grievance."
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2186.587,2194.128,You say this is kind of an outlet for throwing monkey wrenches into the machinery?
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2194.128,2206.857,It is the outlet that was selected by history and by the Constitution and remains to be the legitimate outlet for the expression of grievances.
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2277.701,2285.726,"Well, no one really doubts that orderly expression serves those purposes in a public place by civilians."
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2288.528,2299.643,"But Mr. Chief Justice, for a serviceman the place where the serviceman lives and works and does day to day activities is on a military base."
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2440.806,2444.725,What does Judge Peckham know about an aircraft carrier?
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2444.725,2449.454,"Well, Judge Peckham toured the USS RANGER to assist him in making that determination, Your Honor."
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2449.454,2453.692,"Well, does he know as much as a commanding officer of an aircraft carrier?"
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2453.692,2456.43,"No, Your Honor, I am sure that he does not."
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2460.926,2464.521,Even though Judge Peckham knows a little bit more about constitutional law.
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2464.521,2467.246,"Yes, sir, a good deal more about constitutional law."
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2479.691,2498.372,We are talking about two different things and I certainly agree with my Brother Stewart that Judge Peckham undoubtedly knows more about constitutional law than the commanding officer of the ship and I take it that my Brother Stewart probably agrees with me that the commanding officer of the ship knows more about the ship than Judge Peckham does.
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2506.294,2515.41,"Yes, Your Honor and I believe that the regulations would be effected by the commanding officers of the ship."
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2515.41,2517.217,Didn't Judge Orrick decide this case?
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2517.217,2517.431,Yes.
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2521.885,2528.186,"Judge Orrick I think does know something about the Navy, if I am not mistaken."
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2528.186,2543.439,"Your Honor, one of the -- the basic problem with the regulations as urged by Respondent is that they enable a prior restraint to take place."
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2575.479,2589.341,"Mr. Cobin, do you think there is a material distinction between circulating a petition in a peaceful manner and orally soliciting support for a position and suggesting that others write letters in a form that you hand out or something like that?"
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2589.341,2596.25,"Yes, Your Honor, that the circulation of a written petition is more effective."
1979.78-1006,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2596.25,2599.859,How about in terms of potential disruption to discipline?
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2599.859,2601.578,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1979.78-1006,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2601.578,2605.504,You think the only difference is that one is more effective than the other.
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2605.504,2607.388,"As a general basis, that is true."
1979.78-1006,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2626.172,2637.32,"Are you suggesting that maybe the right test should be based on the content of the communication rather than the form in which the time, place and manner kind of -- which the appeal takes?"
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2637.32,2655.226,"I believe that the proper standard would be a time, place and manner -- a reasonable time, place and manner restriction being allowed and the provisions in the Uniform Code of Military Justice enable a commanding officer to stop petitioning and to punish disruption if it occurs."
1979.78-1006,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2655.226,2666.791,"You think for example a petition by say a member of the Ku Klux Klan who happens to be in the Navy saying that no white should serve under black officers, or something like that, might be disruptive?"
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2666.791,2671.206,"No more than a speech to the same effect, Your Honor."
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2717.357,2738.69,And yet is there any doubt in mind -- I am reminded simply because of the play Julius Caesar was on television I think Sunday night and first Brutus speaks to the crowd and the crowd is very sympathetic to Brutus in justifying his slaying of Caesar.
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2755.793,2757.448,"No, I have no doubt of it, Your Honor."
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2765.27,2765.509,Right.
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2765.509,2774.614,"And also that the limitations of the numbers of the persons gathering is a part of a reasonable time, place and manner restriction."
1979.78-1006,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2833.837,2837.063,Do they need a petition to do that?
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2837.063,2837.237,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1006,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2837.237,2843.587,"All they have got to do is ask for leave to speak to the commanding officer, don't they?"
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2843.587,2847.28,"That would depend on the grievance, Your Honor."
1979.78-1006,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2861.161,2883.036,"Isn't this as someone suggested, perhaps in briefs or argument that preceded, that this is a matter of line drawing and this Court has said and many courts have said whenever you draw the line you can always have a hypothetical case which is on one side of the line when it really ought to be on the other."
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2884.144,2894.056,"The line the Respondent is seeking to have this Court draw is a line between a prior restraint and time, place and manner regulations with a power of punishment."
1979.78-1006,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2894.056,2904.149,"But if you are against prior restraint, then it wouldn't make any difference how inflammatory an utterance was."
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2908.863,2919.546,The Uniform Code of Military Justice permits the commanding officer to intervene whenever there appears to the commanding officer a danger to military order.
1979.78-1006,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2930.044,2935.116,"Mr. Cobin, you have talked about several decisions, particularly Parker v. Levy."
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2945.867,2947.837,I have not.
1979.78-1006,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2947.837,2951.702,And that is the prime reliance of the Government.
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,2951.702,2969.991,"Respondent's position is that that case obviously does not apply to this case because it involves -- both the speech interest involved and the policies involved were entirely different, that that decision permitted a commanding officer to keep civilians off of a military base."
1979.78-1006,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2996.844,3015.358,"When Greer v. Spock was argued, and I think the briefs reflect that during the Civil War -- toward the end of the Civil War when an election was coming up there was great activity on the part of officers and others -- junior officers -- lining up votes for Mr. Lincoln."
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3023.84,3045.158,I think that the problem of -- I believe that is not so much the problem that that would be different but the ability of the commanding officer to take charge without a prior restraint that is different.
1979.78-1006,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3055.393,3061.595,"Well, if he leaves, then that is prior restraint, isn't it, if he forces the civilian to leave?"
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3061.595,3069.039,Not if the basis for ordering the civilian to leave is the improper activities commenced on the base.
1979.78-1006,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3079.492,3086.428,Does he have the same right to circulate petitions an enlisted man would have?
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3086.428,3087.7,"I would hope so, Your Honor."
1979.78-1006,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3087.7,3093.474,"The gentleman could have circulated petitions saying, ""Please nominate me for President."""
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3093.474,3097.702,I think there may well be other provisions that restrict --
1979.78-1006,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3097.702,3102.597,We have a constitutional right to do that?
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3102.597,3106.462,I would believe that you would have the constitutional right to circulate a petition.
1979.78-1006,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3111.172,3113.63,He wants to be President.
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3116.669,3118.417,"I understand the example, Your Honor."
1979.78-1006,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3121.006,3125.467,"Well, that is part of the difficulty with this case."
1979.78-1006,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3141.815,3155.985,"The colonels and majors and captains that were lining up votes for President Lincoln among the Union soldiers were certainly more effective than Dr. Spock coming on the base, wouldn't you think?"
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3155.985,3169.902,"Yes, Your Honor, I think a specific limitation upon commanding officers might be appropriate because of a particular problem that their circulation of petitions might --"
1979.78-1006,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3169.902,3172.752,How about top sergeants?
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3172.752,3174.834,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1006,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3174.834,3177.199,They wouldn't be effective at all?
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3177.199,3188.612,"I don't see that top sergeants circulating petitions peacefully, that by their nature do not cause a problem -- present any constitutional problem as suggested by the example."
1979.78-1006,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3188.612,3193.175,You don't suggest that rights are based on rank?
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3193.175,3205.747,"No, Your Honor, what I am saying is I certainly haven't thought out the problem of a commanding officer seeking to be President and using his authority to do so through the use of a petition."
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3205.747,3213.879,An enlisted man is much more in fear of the top sergeant than he is of the commander.
1979.78-1006,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3217.854,3219.737,I take it you read Beatle Bailey?
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3219.737,3220.624,Pardon me?
1979.78-1006,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3220.624,3222.962,I take it you read Beatle Bailey?
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3222.962,3227.651,Only on occasion.
1979.78-1006,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3241.801,3259.56,We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock.
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3265.636,3268.659,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3321.589,3329.235,The regulation on page 3-A of the Government's petition says members of the Air Force.
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3336.669,3344.147,The regulation says that solicitation of signatures shall not take place on an Air Force facility without the approval of the base commander.
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3344.147,3356.48,"But isn't the base commander the chief executive officer and all the privates and sergeants all within the definition of the words ""members of the Air Force"" as used in that regulation?"
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3356.48,3360.187,But a base commander has a commander himself.
1979.78-1006,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3381.901,3385.232,Who was not a member of the Armed Forces.
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3385.232,3387.763,"However, who is Chief Executive."
1979.78-1006,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3404.129,3414.287,"Yes, but depending upon the nature of that alleged conduct might not they have First Amendment defenses?"
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3414.287,3419.774,Not that would be altered by the decision of this Court as Respondent requests.
1979.78-1006,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3419.774,3421.433,I am not sure that is right.
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3447.766,3450.634,"There may be other issues that were involved, Your Honor."
1979.78-1006,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3451.476,3453.112,Maybe another justification there --
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3453.112,3453.886,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1006,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3453.886,3456.666,-- that would justify a prior restraint?
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3456.666,3460.791,"It is possible, Your Honor."
1979.78-1006,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3460.791,3473.175,Mr. Justice Brennan in dissenting in Greer v. Spock said there is no longer room under any circumstance for the unapproved exercise of public expression on a military base.
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3482.194,3485.871,"That would be ""yes,"" except, Your Honor, that that could not be taken literally."
1979.78-1006,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3485.871,3488.281,"Well, he wrote it literally, I suppose."
1979.78-1006,1,20651,david_m_cobin,,3503.471,3508.579,"Your Honor, I think that would depend upon the definition of ""public expression."""
1979.78-1006,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3508.579,3511.987,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Jones?"
