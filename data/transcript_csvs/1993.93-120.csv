1993.93-120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.68,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 93-120, Thomas Jefferson University v. Donna E. Shalala."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,12.839,16.593,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,57.279,63.662,"Before you go any further, may I ask why you say that there is no doubt that they would normally be allowable costs?"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,63.662,64.473,Because the--
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,64.473,75.941,"What... perhaps under the regulation, as you interpret it, but what provision of the statute allows these costs to be charged... to be reimbursed?"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,75.941,80.183,--The statute requires the reimbursement of reasonable cost--
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,80.183,80.874,Right.
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,80.874,87.578,--and it requires... this will be found in the Ohio State amicus brief at pages 1 and 2.
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,92.762,96.335,"Costs of services provided to the patients, isn't that right?"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,96.335,103.608,Costs that are necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services.
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,109.204,129.098,Section 1395x(v) defines inpatient hospital services to include services... services provided in a hospital by an intern or a resident in training.
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,129.098,129.649,Right.
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,129.649,135.252,Or by a physician where the hospital has a teaching program approved as specified.
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,135.252,135.771,Right.
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,135.771,145.21,"But what you are trying to charge here, as I understand it, unless I mistake the case, are not services provided, but rather the costs of training these people."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,145.21,167.677,"Well, it is the cost of services, too, Justice Scalia, because interns and residents are actually providing care in the hospital, and what we are talking about is the stipends that are paid to them, the compensation paid to the teaching physicians, and the related support costs, and--"
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,167.677,179.513,"Well, are they providing care... I thought what you were talking about is, you know, we've all of us been sick in a hospital and the doctor comes in and he has three young doctors with him, you know, and they are all saying, oh, wow, ooh, and aah, but they are not providing any services."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,181.773,184.655,--Sometimes they provide services.
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,184.655,190.681,"Well, sometimes, but in order to recover under the statute, you must provide services, as I see it."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,190.681,192.591,A lot of times they are providing services.
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,197.434,200.065,"Whenever they are, it seems to me you're entitled to it under the statute."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,205.529,214.265,We claim that they are entitled to reimbursement for all the reasonable costs in connection with the training.
1993.93-120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,214.265,215.717,"Well, that doesn't answer my question."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,218.358,219.049,"Oh, sure."
1993.93-120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,219.63,226.181,"So you do claim that they're... you're entitled to recover for costs expended on them, even when they're not providing service?"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,226.181,228.565,When they're learning?
1993.93-120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,228.565,229.484,Yes.
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,229.484,230.084,Yes.
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,232.606,233.147,"Well, I understand--"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,233.147,234.349,This is not a classroom instruction.
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,234.349,242.253,"--Your basis for that, as I understand it, is a committee report which the Secretary has chosen to follow in his regulation."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,261.485,263.038,"No, I don't think that's correct."
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,264.52,273.302,"Mr. Sutter, is your position essentially that the Secretary has interpreted a regulation one way and arbitrarily not applying that same way to you?"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,275.726,276.654,--Certainly.
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,276.654,279.837,"That because you're making this claim late, you're being treated differently?"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,279.837,280.789,"Certainly, yes."
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,280.789,292.757,"And that your opening point was to the extent that these particular costs, as being properly reimbursable if you had made your claim on time--"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,292.757,293.237,These--
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,293.237,295.328,--are not contested by the Secretary?
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,295.328,296.49,"--That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,296.79,299.712,May I ask you a question about the continuing significance of this?
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,299.712,300.562,--Certainly.
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,300.562,307.517,"As I understand it, after 1986, this is no longer a problem because the system is different, is that so?"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,307.517,309.697,That is correct.
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,320.095,325.117,So the impact of the issue before us is for how many years?
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,325.117,346.253,"Well, it will have a carryover impact because this is the base year, and under the new system you look at the cost per resident trended forward, so the monetary impact for this year itself, for '85, would be roughly $600,000 to $700,000, but it would also have some carryover effect."
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,346.253,348.774,Is there a point where it will make no difference?
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,354.356,358.089,Specifically we're dealing with 1985.
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,359.519,365.934,--But how long will this matter that you're complaining about have an impact on hospitals situated as you are?
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,365.934,374.279,"It could have an indefinite impact, until Congress changes the current law, which still looks back at a base year and trends it forward."
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,374.279,387.709,"When you say it has a carryover effect, I take it what you mean is that if it's allowed for the base year, you go on charging the same amount every successive year adjusted for inflation so long as you do not pull back on the service?"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,387.709,399.676,"Well, actually, it's... you get a base year amount per resident, and then you would multiply that by your current number of residents, so if the number of residents declines--"
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,399.676,401.499,"So it gives you a rate, in effect."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,401.499,401.969,--It gives... it's a rate.
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,401.969,402.37,"Yes, okay."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,402.37,404.391,"It's a rate per resident, that's correct."
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,421.03,424.874,"Well, I don't know that we have authority to compel the Secretary to be consistent."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,435.141,438.301,I don't think it contravenes the words of the statute.
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,445.938,455.993,"It explicitly defines services to include the services provided by trainees, but not to include the training of the trainees."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,457.375,457.916,But it does--
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.916,463.669,"--If the Secretary wants to be more generous in some instances to avoid controversy with a committee, that's fine."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,463.669,473.684,"--Well, Justice Scalia, Congress has never expressed any dissatisfaction with the inclusion of these costs."
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,489.345,491.338,Didn't you get in 1 year--
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,491.338,492.167,"I'm sorry, not--"
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,492.167,494.579,--You charged--
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,494.579,494.909,--Excuse me... (Q).
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,495.971,497.271,--You charged some indirect costs.
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,508.278,518.895,The chronology is that in '74 for the first time the hospital began claiming the costs of the related medical school and claimed costs for physician compensation.
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,525.529,530.162,But you were allowed... you were allowed the addition that you sought in '84.
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,530.162,530.943,That is correct.
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,530.943,532.085,But in '85 you weren't.
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,532.085,533.885,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.93-120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,595.404,601.678,"Well, do you say, Mr. Sutter, that you could prevail simply under the statute without regard to the regulation?"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,601.678,603.549,"We say both, but we do say--"
1993.93-120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,603.549,603.97,"Well, I--"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,603.97,604.741,--Yes.
1993.93-120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,608.404,614.248,"--Does that mean that the Secretary could not, under a properly drawn regulation, deny these costs?"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,614.248,623.525,"--That would be our contention, that they are part of the necessary delivery of needed health services, that's correct, and they have been from the beginning."
1993.93-120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,699.296,700.525,Is it quoted in your brief?
1993.93-120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,700.525,702.157,"--Well, that is my brief."
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,702.157,703.009,"Oh, I'm--"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,703.009,704.548,The AHA AAMC amicus brief.
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,828.011,831.521,"--Well, were they being billed to the hospital by the school?"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,831.521,836.566,"No, they weren't, but that's not necessary under the related organization regulation."
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,838.146,866.546,"Well, if it's... if... but... it may not be necessary, but isn't it relevant, because if we don't look to the billing practice, then I'm not sure how the redistribution provision is ever going to be applied in any consistent fashion when related organizations are involved, because your argument in effect would be, because it's a related organization, it doesn't have to bill, and therefore nothing in effect is ever redistributed because we just looked to the total entity."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,866.546,867.675,--That's not my argument.
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,895.897,899.36,"So you say they can't bill for first-year medical education, for example."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,901.971,902.562,Absolutely.
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,902.562,904.493,It would also be clearly forbidden by the statute.
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,917.553,918.231,There could be.
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,918.231,919.543,Can you give me an example?
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,919.543,920.372,Sure.
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,949.911,951.003,Why?
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,952.515,966.593,"No, because the nursing school was not providing those services in the past as part of the hospital's educational program."
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1021.558,1040.962,"All right, as between simply the hospital and the medical school, those two related entities, assuming that we again are talking about a charge which is at least indirectly related to education, can there ever be a redistribution and hence an application of this limit?"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1040.962,1057.512,I think only if you had some activity that the medical school was conducting in the past that was its own program.
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1059.963,1095.106,"But if it was strictly... I guess my problem I'm having is, if it were its own program in the sense that I think you're using that term, then it would not in fact be related to the teaching function of the hospital, so once we get within the sphere of what is related directly or indirectly to the hospital's teaching function, I think the implication of what you're saying is that the redistribution provision will never apply when we're doing cost accounting within a series of related entities."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1095.106,1097.199,--That's right if--
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1097.199,1097.577,Okay.
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1097.577,1102.292,"--if it is the program, and I think there are two policy issuances that are essentially on point there."
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1102.292,1106.753,Well then in effect aren't you reading the redistribution sentence out of the regulation?
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1106.753,1107.084,I--
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1107.084,1113.479,"Because you're saying if it's covered by the statute and if you could claim it, you can claim it later."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1113.479,1115.629,--I'm not reading it out.
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1129.38,1132.462,It would be so helpful if you would give an example--
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1132.462,1133.32,--I will give you an example.
1993.93-120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1133.32,1139.034,"--of something that fits within the statute as a legitimate cost, but couldn't be redistributed."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1139.034,1141.368,"Well, legitimate costs is nursing education."
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1198.163,1208.28,"Yes, but the illegitimate shift that you posit is illegitimate because it really is not related indirectly to the provision of medical education by the hospital."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1228.443,1228.964,--That's not correct.
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1228.964,1231.296,"Then I don't understand the hypo, I guess."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1231.296,1240.232,"Nursing education is reimbursable under Medicare if it's provided by the provider, but you have situations, Justice Souter--"
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1240.232,1248.125,"No, but in this case it's provided by a related entity, and it seems to me it's in the same boat as whatever education is provided by the medical school."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1248.125,1249.276,"--Well, it depends who is the legal operator."
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1251.468,1256.022,"But I thought you were telling us that if the entities are related, that distinction is one which does not matter."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1256.022,1267.749,"--Under the related organization, the governing principle is (a), and that is, you have services furnished by the related organization for the provider on behalf of the provider."
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1281.96,1282.21,Okay.
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1282.471,1286.253,--and it was a related organization's nursing school you couldn't shift that back.
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1289.195,1296.709,"--In fact, you could only, as it were, as a matter of accounting you could only shift that to the medical school, and shifting it to the medical school doesn't get it to the provider, which is the hospital."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1297.3,1298.111,--That's correct.
1993.93-120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1298.111,1299.481,"Yes, okay."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1299.481,1299.801,Yes.
1993.93-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1336.798,1338.397,May I ask you--
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1338.397,1338.948,--Certainly.
1993.93-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1338.948,1347.423,"--Are you saying that the words ""redistribution of costs"" in the last sentence of the regulation really should be read to mean ""redistribution of services or activities""?"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1354.228,1354.818,No.
1993.93-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1397.708,1407.013,"But if I understand you correctly, your example of something that would fit within the regulation would have involved a reorganization of the provision of services and the activities."
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1416.519,1441.968,"Not as long as those are for costs that would consider to be customarily or traditionally carried on by the hospital, and on this point, intermediary letter 78-7 specifically applies to the related organization principle in the context of medical school and the hospital and says they are allowable under the related organization principle."
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1441.968,1465.011,"Mr. Sutter, if you could answer... I don't want to take... you have very little time left, but you raised section... do I understand the effect of subsection (2), which is a definition of physicians' services, is to exclude for the future services provided by physicians who are employed in the educational institution, even if they are direct services provided to the patient?"
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1465.011,1467.024,"When you say subsection (2), I'm not sure--"
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1467.024,1467.815,(Q).
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1467.815,1469.145,"--Oh, (Q)."
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.968,1471.976,That defines physicians' services and--
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1471.976,1475.489,"--No, no, 1395x(v)(1)(Q)."
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1475.489,1477.371,--(v)(1)(Q).
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1477.371,1491.71,"V as in very, (v)(1)(Q), and what that did is, it precluded the Secretary from doing anything that would reduce Medicare reimbursement for graduate medical education."
1993.93-120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1491.71,1493.28,I had the wrong section.
1993.93-120,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1493.831,1496.184,"Mr. Chief Justice, I will reserve my remaining time."
1993.93-120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1496.184,1496.823,"Very well, Mr. Sutter."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1498.816,1507.722,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1554.352,1558.413,"May I ask you a couple of questions to be sure, because it does seem to get complicated."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1568.891,1574.755,It would depend on whether that institution was an affiliated institution.
1993.93-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1574.755,1582.269,"Say it's exactly like this in all... it's exactly like this institution in all respects, except that it had always claimed the same costs."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1582.269,1584.082,"Oh, I see what you're saying."
1993.93-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1585.431,1585.752,Yes.
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1585.752,1586.393,--of a different institution.
1993.93-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1613.7,1621.425,"And if this institution had claimed these very costs 5 years earlier and done it each year, would it get them this year?"
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1621.425,1621.926,Yes.
1993.93-120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1635.914,1636.715,That's my problem.
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1644.45,1654.597,"We rely upon the definition, which is a very broad definition, of reasonable costs, or the phrase, reasonable costs of medical care to patients."
1993.93-120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1659.299,1661.272,That medical care includes medical education.
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1661.272,1663.263,That medical education--
1993.93-120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1663.263,1665.153,Medical care to me includes medical education for somebody who never treats me?
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1665.153,1667.895,"--Well, let me put it this way."
1993.93-120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1727.534,1734.56,"It's like having an intern or a resident there during the night, when maybe simply a for-pay hospital wouldn't."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1734.56,1741.643,"Well, it's the effect of having a teaching program with the scholarly atmosphere, the extra scrutiny, the extra oversight."
1993.93-120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1776.647,1788.894,"But it seems to me, Ms. Wax, that Congress did advert to this airy benefit that you're referring to and didn't include it."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1800.632,1802.735,Right.
1993.93-120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1862.301,1869.537,For how many years has that been the Secretary's interpretation... it includes these training courses?
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1869.537,1874.159,"Well, the regulation has been on the books since 1966, Your Honor."
1993.93-120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1874.159,1878.923,And at what point did the regulation start to get interpreted the way it is now?
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1888.2,1891.844,"Well, Your Honor, it's difficult to answer that question for the following reason."
1993.93-120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1927.415,1928.817,Is that what happened in 1984 in this case?
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1937.902,1940.413,"Well, that seems to be what happened in '84."
1993.93-120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1959.227,1962.858,"Although the PRR, or whatever it is, thought that the Administrator was wrong in this case."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1962.858,1963.148,Right.
1993.93-120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2043.952,2053.98,"Well, is the Johnny-come-lately rule an attempt, at least in part, to apply the redistribution rule?"
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2053.98,2057.702,It is... it is... let me put it this way.
1993.93-120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2076.853,2079.335,"Well, may I interrupt you with one question."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2112.707,2121.523,"Well, if you're asking me why that position wasn't taken initially for this medical school, that we didn't allow a shift in costs--"
1993.93-120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2121.523,2123.494,"Well, I think I'm really asking why shouldn't it have been taken?"
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2139.465,2148.331,"--Well, first of all, it was applied from day 1 for the particular costs being claimed that are the subject of this case, okay... it is."
1993.93-120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2148.331,2162.22,"Had the costs... had the costs that you admit are allowable been the subject of some kind of billing or accounting notation, at least, as between the school and the hospital, prior to Medicare?"
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2162.22,2174.218,"Okay... well, the costs that we say are allowable and that were found to be allowable were costs that provider had been claiming all along, even though they were incurred by the medical school."
1993.93-120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2174.218,2175.169,But not all along.
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2179.771,2180.362,"Okay, that--"
1993.93-120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2180.362,2181.974,They didn't start when Medicare first came in.
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2181.974,2192.51,"--That's a different issue, and there the question is, was what happened in 1974, was it consistent with this antiredistribution and community support principle?"
1993.93-120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2195.241,2196.263,"Well, let's just stick to redistribution for a moment."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2196.263,2196.823,--Redistribution--
1993.93-120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2196.823,2201.616,"Why, if... why wasn't it inconsistent with redistribution the first year they claimed it in '74?"
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2201.616,2209.09,"--Because we don't know, because we don't have it in the record, what exactly the costs were that they were claiming in '74, and let me give you an example."
1993.93-120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2209.09,2213.915,"Well, let's assume they were all of the costs that were being claimed prior to '85."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2226.032,2229.425,We don't know whether they claimed them prior to '74.
1993.93-120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2234.007,2244.633,"If they incurred them prior to '74, and had not claimed them before '74, would it have been an attempted redistribution within the meaning of (c)?"
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2244.633,2246.986,"Yes, if they had been costs of the medical school."
1993.93-120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2252.179,2269.75,"So your argument is that you can't tax the... that the other side cannot tax the Government with inconsistency because at least so far as this record is concerned, neither it nor the Government knows what was happening before '74, and the only thing that you know for sure is what is happening as to 1985."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2269.75,2271.871,"That's essentially our answer, Your Honor."
1993.93-120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2272.822,2280.086,"But why isn't your answer the same as the one you gave me with respect to '84, and that is, the initial... what--"
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2280.086,2281.908,--Intermediary.
1993.93-120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2281.908,2284.541,"--The intermediary let it through, so it never came to your attention."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2284.541,2287.442,"That could be the answer, too, for all we know."
1993.93-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2341.609,2344.369,"May I ask another sort of elementary question, I suppose."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2360.69,2370.447,"They are each independently sufficient, Your Honor, so that this Court could agree with us, and we think they should, on our reading of the very explicit language of the redistribution clause."
1993.93-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2370.447,2373.469,You mean the last sentence of the regulation.
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2373.469,2375.379,"Right, the last sentence of the regulation, which says--"
1993.93-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2375.379,2377.212,"The first part of the regulation isn't at all that clear, though."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2377.212,2390.929,"--Well, no, we think that's clear as well, but the point about the redistribution provision is that it's a narrower provision that specifically applies to this case, and this circumstance of a medical school, an educational unit taking over costs."
1993.93-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2441.813,2454.41,"The thing I find most hard to sort of sort out in my mind about this case is, I can envision half-a-dozen different institutions providing precisely the same services with precisely the same costs to do it, the same salaries and everything else."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2467.028,2471.113,"Well, they're not... we don't think that they're arbitrary factors, or that they're irrelevant."
1993.93-120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2488.984,2500.292,"Ms. Wax, maybe you would focus on the AHA brief on page 22, where they give specific examples of the kind of arbitrariness that Justice Stevens brought up to you."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2530.662,2531.381,--Right.
1993.93-120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2559.029,2562.602,"Yes, but you can say that about every hospital and every charge prior to Medicare."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2563.742,2572.628,"Correct, Your Honor, but what we are saying... we're not saying that we could have the same rule for blood transfusions or for antibiotic therapy."
1993.93-120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2607.262,2612.485,"You say that here she can draw a line and tell people, that's the way the cookie crumbles, in effect."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2612.485,2622.052,"--For this kind of expense, yes, because of the kind of expense it is, for the very reasons that Justice Scalia pointed out at the beginning of the argument."
1993.93-120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2637.31,2653.271,"But what gives the Secretary the authority to decide whether to include it in or out on the basis of her notion of, there should be community support, or there should be no declining in the amount of community support?"
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2657.015,2659.245,"First of all, the Secretary--"
1993.93-120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2659.245,2663.609,What word in the statute is she interpreting by this regulation?
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2663.609,2668.251,"--Well, first of all she's interpreting the words of 1395x(v)(1)(A)."
1993.93-120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2668.251,2669.142,x(v)(1)(A).
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2669.142,2671.623,"Right, page 61a of the pet app.--"
1993.93-120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2671.623,2673.113,Of the what?
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2673.113,2675.574,--Of the appendix to the petition.
1993.93-120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2683.3,2683.741,Yes.
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2684.37,2684.921,Right.
1993.93-120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2684.921,2685.402,I have it.
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2685.402,2705.678,"And there, the Secretary... it says the reasonable costs of services shall be the costs incurred, and shall be determined in accordance with regulations establishing the method or methods to be used and the items to be included in determining such costs for various institutions and services."
1993.93-120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2720.286,2721.085,Okay.
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2721.085,2723.378,--the authority under this section.
1993.93-120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2723.378,2727.2,"So it's cost of services, is the language essentially that she's interpreting."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2727.2,2727.771,"Right, and the--"
1993.93-120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2727.771,2729.072,And she says that it constitutes--
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2729.072,2729.811,--What is a reasonable--
1993.93-120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2729.811,2744.003,"--Right, and it constitutes a service which you have to pay for if it's been charged before, but if it hasn't been charged before, it doesn't cons... how does that have anything to do with whether it... it either is a service, or it isn't a service."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2755.589,2759.691,"--Well, it's not irrelevant to whether it's reasonable to pay it, for the following reason."
1993.93-120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2777.372,2788.242,"Can we skip the community, because you told Justice Stevens that the redistribution clause in and of itself would do it, so I'd like to hear your rationale for this, forgetting about the community."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2795.214,2803.829,"With all due respect, Justice Ginsburg, we can't forget about the community, because the point of the redistribution clause is that the medical school and its donors is part of the community."
1993.93-120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2813.226,2817.2,"But the community support constitutes everything except Medicare, is that right?"
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2823.494,2825.485,--That's not entirely correct.
1993.93-120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2825.485,2826.637,What else is left out?
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2826.637,2840.664,"Well, hospital fees, the amounts that patients pay out of pocket to the institution, the Secretary has taken the position, or at least currently takes the position that that would not be community support, so you could rebut the presumption of community support."
1993.93-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2895.749,2913.57,"The statutory language that you called our attention to talks about costs for various types or classes of institutions, agencies, and services, which conveys to me a message that there are groups of institutions that should be treated like, and you read that as sort of saying we can do it on a community support."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2916.914,2917.625,Your Honor--
1993.93-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2917.625,2918.877,"You don't... Well, I'm sorry."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2919.404,2920.877,--We would not read the language that way.
1993.93-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2928.761,2933.145,"The classes of institution could be, if you've got 100 hospitals, each one is in a different class."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2933.145,2936.058,"Well, there's teaching hospitals, there's nonteaching hospitals."
1993.93-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2936.736,2941.01,"Yes, those are classes, but we're talking about discrimination among... within the class of teaching hospitals."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2941.01,2944.142,"--Well, we still think this language accommodates."
1993.93-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2946.333,2953.56,"You're saying it's a separate class of hospital if it gets a lot of money from charity, or doctors pay high tuition, or something like that."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2958.911,2959.402,"--Well, no."
1993.93-120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2972.66,2987.59,"Ms. Wax, would it matter if the hospital... this hospital were able to show that its sources were no different from the sources of a hospital who started to make these costs... pay these costs from day 1?"
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3009.716,3016.578,"--Well, the one that started charging earlier charged under our rules for a new program which entailed new financial--"
1993.93-120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3016.578,3022.325,"But not because it had a richer endowment, or got more money from the State in which it operated."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3022.325,3023.544,"--Well, that's not necessarily so."
1993.93-120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3036.212,3041.595,"Suppose the institution proves that it wasn't in any of these fortunate situations, it just had a sleepy accountant?"
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3041.595,3049.13,"--Once again, Your Honor, somebody paid for this, and the Secretary finds it significant that somebody paid for it."
1993.93-120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3052.692,3075.386,"Well, I presume the Secretary is entitled to act in gross, and to make some assumptions that are generally true, even if they're not true in every instance, and I guess he's assuming that if you haven't charged them before, they were not incurred before, or there was funding from elsewhere to take care of them before, and he can apply that--"
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3075.386,3076.097,"Well, how could the Secretary assume anything else?"
1993.93-120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3076.097,3076.828,"--I'm trying to help you, Ms. Wax."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3082.843,3085.715,"I agree absolutely, Your Honor."
1993.93-120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3085.715,3087.134,Or she.
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3107.109,3108.001,Well--
1993.93-120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3108.001,3114.954,"I mean, suppose you lose on this particular theory of yours, there is another mechanism in place, is there not?"
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3114.954,3127.402,"--It's rather anemic, because we still have for the base year, and the base year carries forward to the future forever, we still have a reasonable cost regime, which will--"
1993.93-120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3127.402,3139.299,"But there is a provision that says, whatever costs xx allow a hospital, it can't be more than that which could be purchased elsewhere, so she has an overall cap in effect."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3139.299,3153.068,"--Yes, well, it's not a very effective cap, because reasonable cost means that the institution gives you a bill for what it actually spent, and unless the Secretary can show that that's vastly inflated, the Secretary has to pay that."
1993.93-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3172.782,3181.168,"No, but you do agree, if I understand your position correctly, that a teaching hospital can get paid more for precisely the same services than a nonteaching hospital."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3181.168,3184.538,It depends on what services you're talking about.
1993.93-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3184.538,3187.981,"Well, just the cost of having the interns participate in the training, and the education, the whole thing."
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3197.817,3203.872,"There's a separate line... there's a separate provision for the reimbursement of education costs, on the theory that that enhances care."
1993.93-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3203.872,3208.383,But that's a response really to Justice O'Connor's suggestion that there's an overall cap.
1993.93-120,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3210.526,3212.116,Yes.
1993.93-120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3212.116,3213.789,"Thank you, Ms. Wax."
1993.93-120,2,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,3215.91,3217.92,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-120,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3258.238,3261.901,"What do you mean when you say, Congress encouraged the Secretary not to?"
1993.93-120,2,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,3261.901,3293.521,"The... in paragraph 3 of that legislation, which is on page 1 of the reply brief, Congress authorized the Secretary to not offset restricted grants, and that is an encouragement which the Secretary responded to in the 1983 Federal Register, so that now you could have someone actually in the community donate $10 million directly to the hospital, say this is for GME, and that could not be offset."
1993.93-120,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3293.521,3297.852,"Well, Congress authorized the Secretary to but didn't require her to."
1993.93-120,2,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,3297.852,3298.834,But she did.
1993.93-120,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3298.834,3300.226,But she did.
1993.93-120,2,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,3300.226,3314.706,"She did, in 1983, so are we going to say a $10 million contribution from someone in the community is not community support, but somehow you're getting services from a related medical school, and that is community support?"
1993.93-120,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3365.866,3375.785,"Mr. Sutter, is the same charge that you're contesting or claiming to make here also being made against insurance payers and self-payers?"
1993.93-120,2,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,3375.785,3378.285,"Well, insurance payers don't usually pay on a cost basis."
1993.93-120,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3387.342,3387.893,The answer is yes?
1993.93-120,2,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,3387.893,3388.994,"Yes, that's correct."
1993.93-120,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3390.844,3391.16,"Thank you, Mr. Sutter."
