2003.03-6821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,34.137,"We'll hear argument next in No. 03-6821, David Nelson v. Donal Campbell."
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,68.462,71.664,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-6821,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,108.003,119.577,"Well, presumably at a much earlier date, the prisoner did know that he... he was... he would be scheduled to be executed by lethal injection."
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,119.577,121.177,"Absolutely, Your... Your Honor."
2003.03-6821,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,121.177,123.596,And he did know his veins were compromised.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,123.596,125.548,"Absolutely, and as soon as he--"
2003.03-6821,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,125.548,131.885,So... so presumably in... well in advance he could anticipate a problem.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,131.885,133.404,"--Yes, Your Honor, and he did."
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,226.264,227.714,"Well, they're... they're not saying that."
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,253.147,254.599,"Yes, and... and I... I guess that's our--"
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,254.599,257.468,It has... has to be under habeas rather than under 1983.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,257.468,257.951,--Yes.
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,269.543,275.097,"Well, but it's unlike these other actions in this one crucial respect: its effect is to prevent the execution."
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,275.097,275.697,No.
2003.03-6821,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,341.538,343.105,May... may I get clear on one thing?
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,343.105,343.907,"Yes, sir."
2003.03-6821,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,343.907,370.224,"Did he... did his counsel say to the court, the district court, we want under 1983 an order that says admit this man's doctor to the place of execution at the time the State chooses so he can find a way then and there to allow the State to carry out the execution when it wants to do it?"
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,371.224,384.632,"Well, what he asked for... what... what he... what he put in his complaint was that he had made that offer to the State, and that was in his complaint, that... that the defendant's counsel had authorized or requested the opportunity to bring in a physician to facilitate a review--"
2003.03-6821,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,384.632,387.0,Is that what he was asking for when he went into court?
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,387.0,393.922,"--Well, what he was asking for is an injunction barring them from doing this kind of 2-inch incision, but yes, he made it very clear in the complaint--"
2003.03-6821,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,393.922,400.076,Was it made clear to the district court that he would be satisfied with the order I have just described?
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,400.076,409.182,"--Only to the extent... yes, I believe so, Your Honor, because when the district court said, can't you work this out, Mr. Nelson's counsel said, yes, I think we can."
2003.03-6821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.182,411.801,Did... did he ask for a postponement of the execution?
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,411.801,412.884,"He did, Your Honor."
2003.03-6821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,423.942,426.894,What would have been the terms of the postponement that you were asking for?
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,426.894,430.428,I... I think the district court could have basically issued a cease and desist order.
2003.03-6821,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,436.582,444.272,"Would it have been sufficient to say, don't... postpone it until you admit the doctor to be present and get the catheter in?"
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,444.272,450.092,I... I think it could have been sufficient to say I'm going to order that his physician be admitted into the facility.
2003.03-6821,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,463.25,476.291,"Was it that... before, Mr. Stevenson, you said that nothing that the prisoner requests, once the date of execution is set, is actionable in 1983."
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,497.49,512.499,"And I guess here, Your Honor, what we think is that when the prison waits until 6 days before the scheduled execution... a complaint can only be filed 3 days before the scheduled execution... a determination of whether what the prison is proposing is unconstitutional or not cannot ordinarily--"
2003.03-6821,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,512.499,514.951,He... he didn't... he didn't know before that that... that this was--
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,514.951,515.984,"--No, Your Honor."
2003.03-6821,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,515.984,516.868,--the procedure they were going to use?
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,516.868,520.42,"No, Your... he had been told before that they were going to do something 24 hours in advance."
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,522.955,525.307,When they're going to do it is not the issue.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,526.474,533.93,"--Well, yes, that's... he was told for the first time on that Friday, 2-inch incision in the arm, not necessarily done by someone medically trained."
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,535.698,540.983,But he... he knew that... that something special had to be done with respect to him because he had these compromised veins.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,541.149,541.783,--Absolutely.
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,548.22,553.541,How... how long ago was the conviction for which he was condemned to... to death?
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,553.541,555.826,The conviction was 1978.
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.246,564.598,The crime was committed when?
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,564.598,566.181,In 1978.
2003.03-6821,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,580.508,588.214,"Did... did you at any point shape your claim for relief in the alternative, saying we want either habeas corpus or 1983?"
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,593.766,603.406,"--Well, no, it was not styled as a habeas action, in part because the Eleventh Circuit rules would have prevented us from ever getting review in this Court or any other court if it had been framed in that way."
2003.03-6821,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,603.406,604.739,Is that... is that correct?
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,615.531,615.897,"Well, yes."
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,633.759,635.143,"Well, what does the statute say?"
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,643.781,644.55,Yes.
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,645.466,647.585,So why isn't that conclusive here?
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,649.835,650.537,"--Well, absolutely."
2003.03-6821,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,652.904,654.072,"Well, of course, that's assuming it's successive."
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,654.072,654.639,--That's right.
2003.03-6821,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,668.747,671.232,"But you don't have to go that far, do you?"
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,671.232,671.682,We do not.
2003.03-6821,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,671.682,678.104,"Because ripeness could be a merely evidentiary matter, whereas in this case, you did not have a claim that you could bring--"
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,678.104,678.421,Absolutely.
2003.03-6821,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,678.421,678.921,--at the time.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,680.671,681.056,Absolutely.
2003.03-6821,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,701.637,713.945,Would you say... would you be making the same argument if his complaint was not this inch cut but the combination of chemicals?
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,713.945,715.228,"No, Your Honor."
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.178,750.034,"Well, I mean, you know, as you know, we've... we've turned down certiorari in... in these cases challenging the type of drug used."
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,760.29,763.793,"--I think the primary difference, Justice Scalia, is that those are a method of execution cases."
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,769.245,769.947,"--Well, but--"
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,769.947,770.897,Venous access can--
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,770.897,772.816,--they're... they're not challenging the method of execution.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,777.768,778.387,"--Well, it's... it's--"
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,778.387,784.957,"And just as here, you're saying if you want to execute me by lethal injection, that's fine, just don't use a manner of lethal injection that hurts me."
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,786.924,787.493,"--Well, I guess--"
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,787.493,788.476,--categories of case.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,788.476,793.397,"--It's not clear, Your Honor, that in all of those cases that they are saying if you want to use a different drug, that's okay."
2003.03-6821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,824.432,831.07,"Well, was it... was it any more than the presence of his own doctor to make the cut that he... he was asking for?"
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,831.07,834.557,"No, Your Honor, and it wasn't even... he wasn't even insisting on that."
2003.03-6821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,843.078,845.079,"Well, but this isn't a contract action."
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,845.079,845.712,"No, no, Your Honor."
2003.03-6821,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,858.855,861.041,But he did... he did want more than a doctor.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,868.611,869.111,Yes.
2003.03-6821,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,888.841,890.976,Doesn't that require a cut as well?
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,890.976,891.793,"--No, ma'am."
2003.03-6821,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,905.051,911.122,But that sounds to me more like the mode of execution with the... with the drugs that you said was distinguishable.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,911.122,911.924,No.
2003.03-6821,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,936.855,945.045,"If a challenge is brought to the use of lethal injection as a method of execution, how must that be brought?"
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,945.878,946.328,Yes.
2003.03-6821,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,962.155,971.778,This comes close because you say it's unconstitutional to proceed with lethal injection under these circumstances.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,971.778,972.112,No.
2003.03-6821,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1016.638,1035.334,"What is... as a lawyer who works in this area, what do you think is the correct procedure that should be followed in respect to Ford mental incompetence claims or general challenges to a whole big method of execution not just this individual one which arise for the first time after termination of a first habeas?"
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1035.334,1037.053,"Well, Justice Breyer, I... I think you're right."
2003.03-6821,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1065.055,1066.222,"Yes, that may be."
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1069.99,1070.474,--Yes.
2003.03-6821,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1070.474,1072.126,This fits into a bigger picture.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1072.126,1072.676,"Yes, yes."
2003.03-6821,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1072.676,1074.359,And I'd like to be clear about the bigger picture--
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1074.359,1074.692,Yes.
2003.03-6821,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1074.775,1075.525,--in your opinion.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1075.525,1075.792,--Yes.
2003.03-6821,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1085.048,1088.416,And... and you say that it would be... count as a first habeas.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1088.416,1090.202,"--Well, it would be part of the first habeas."
2003.03-6821,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1090.535,1096.32,"Well, what the... what the response to that is it's very hard to reconcile that with the language of the statute."
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1096.32,1097.072,"--Well, what the--"
2003.03-6821,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1097.072,1108.597,"And... and also they add that the right route is to file an initial habeas here or, alternatively, to go to the State court, at least if that's still open."
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1108.597,1109.08,--Yes.
2003.03-6821,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1109.597,1115.25,In which case it raises no constitutional question about blocking habeas because we could review the State court.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1118.118,1118.635,"--Yes, sir."
2003.03-6821,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1129.66,1137.497,Was there... was there anything open to this petitioner in the State for an application for relief here?
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1137.497,1139.016,"--No, Justice O'Connor, unfortunately not."
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1190.399,1193.566,"Your... your claim here is an Eighth Amendment claim, cruel and unusual punishment."
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1193.566,1194.352,"--Yes, sir."
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1194.352,1195.135,Right?
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1202.708,1203.491,"No, Your Honor."
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1203.491,1207.426,Anything that does not comport with the most advanced medical procedures is cruel and unusual punishment?
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1207.426,1207.893,That--
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1207.893,1208.695,"I mean, you know--"
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1208.695,1209.212,"--No, I hear you."
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1209.528,1211.278,--this man is... is looking death in the face.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1211.278,1211.98,Sure.
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1211.98,1219.551,And... and the crime was committed over a quarter of a century ago for which he was... he was condemned.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1230.776,1235.862,"Well, Your Honor, it's not our position that he is seeking and... and demanding the most advanced procedures."
2003.03-6821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1270.766,1271.968,You're saying it's... it's not the Eighth Amendment.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1273.418,1273.735,No.
2003.03-6821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1281.391,1283.759,It just doesn't fit under deliberate indifference somehow.
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1291.43,1293.799,"I... I agree, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-6821,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1322.801,1325.92,"But your deliberate indifference claim is also an Eighth Amendment claim, isn't it?"
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1325.92,1326.553,"--Yes, sir."
2003.03-6821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1382.189,1386.141,When... when did Alabama switch from electrocution to lethal injections?
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1386.141,1391.628,"That happened in July of 2002, after Mr. Nelson had already completed his Federal habeas procedure."
2003.03-6821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1391.628,1394.58,"And before that, electrocution was the only option?"
2003.03-6821,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1394.58,1395.349,"Yes, sir."
2003.03-6821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1399.401,1400.551,"Very well, Mr. Stevenson."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1402.67,1420.298,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-6821,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1469.593,1474.431,"On the... on your first point, are you going to address directly whether this is second or successive?"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1474.431,1477.716,"I can certainly address that, Your Honor, and I can address it now, if you'd like."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1477.716,1478.516,Yes.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1478.516,1488.44,"We simply cannot agree with... with... with Mr. Stevenson's contention here that this is second or successive, and I would like to point out to the Court that I... that I think--"
2003.03-6821,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1488.44,1489.34,He says it's not.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1489.34,1490.023,--I'm sorry.
2003.03-6821,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1505.885,1508.018,You mean if it's treated as habeas.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1508.018,1508.687,--Correct.
2003.03-6821,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1525.897,1528.715,"Well, it wasn't raised because he brought 1983."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1549.129,1552.581,"--And our position certainly is, Your Honor, that this would have been barred as second or successive."
2003.03-6821,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1575.962,1577.481,"Well, isn't that a possibility?"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1664.687,1668.491,"My own sense, Justice Souter, is that that might just be slicing the bologna a little thin."
2003.03-6821,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1678.347,1682.399,"But that's... that's fine, but I mean, that's a conclusory statement: for whatever reason."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1691.689,1700.712,"--Perhaps, but I think that we are coming awfully close simply to... to reading the limitations that Congress imposed on these sorts of petitions out of the statute."
2003.03-6821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1700.712,1705.747,"If Congress felt that way, they simply wouldn't have added the second condition."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1705.747,1707.033,That's certainly the position that--
2003.03-6821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1707.033,1714.353,They would have just said the facts... the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1719.174,1719.724,--That's--
2003.03-6821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1719.724,1720.857,But Congress didn't leave it there.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1727.863,1731.564,--Which is exactly the point that I'm trying to make about stripping out the limitations.
2003.03-6821,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1733.516,1756.816,"Except that to... in order to make that point, you have to assume that Congress was adverting to this problem, and you have to assume that the words, second and successive, could... could simply have been... or the word subsequent could have been inserted in place of second or successive, which in fact is... is a set of phrases that... that are terms of art."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1756.816,1757.599,--Well--
2003.03-6821,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1757.599,1760.751,So I think... I think the argument is a stretch.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1760.751,1773.241,"--It... it... I... I think it is not the case, Your Honor, that... that second or successive is a term of art in the sense that... that AEDPA in section 2244 merely incorporates the old abuse of the writ doctrine as... as this Court made--"
2003.03-6821,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1773.241,1790.353,"It doesn't necessarily incorporate the old abuse of the writ doctrine, but it seems to me that it does allude to a body of law by which we made... because there was no other law involved, we had to draw conclusions as to whether it was appropriate or not appropriate to bar this claim."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1799.559,1807.499,"--Again, Your... Your Honor, I... I feel like clearly I'm not convincing you, but I think that... that we are... that the Court would be coming awfully--"
2003.03-6821,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1807.499,1808.382,Convince the others.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1809.365,1814.985,--that the Court... the Court is certainly coming awfully close to simply stripping out the limitations on the statute--
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1814.985,1816.087,What... what should happen?
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1820.639,1821.491,--The... the--
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1821.491,1822.141,--law was?
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1822.141,1822.658,--The Court--
2003.03-6821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1822.658,1828.312,The first condition alone: the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1828.312,1829.378,"--That's absolutely right, and that--"
2003.03-6821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.378,1829.628,Isn't that a fair description--
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1829.628,1829.961,--that's the--
2003.03-6821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.961,1832.278,--of what our prior second or successive law was?
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1832.278,1832.913,--I... I--
2003.03-6821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1832.913,1836.532,And Congress rejects that by adding to it a new... a new number (ii).
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1836.532,1837.065,--Precisely.
2003.03-6821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1837.065,1840.567,So it's impossible to say that it was... it was simply embracing our prior law.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1840.567,1843.019,"Which is precisely the point we tried to make in our brief, that under--"
2003.03-6821,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1843.019,1846.638,"Well, so can it be brought as a 1983 action?"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1846.638,1848.256,"--I don't think it can, Your Honor, and... and I--"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1848.256,1849.006,And why not?
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1849.006,1849.806,--I hope I can convince why it can't.
2003.03-6821,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1876.423,1878.359,"Well, there are other ways to do it--"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1878.359,1878.859,--Well--
2003.03-6821,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1878.859,1879.842,--is his point.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1890.832,1892.701,"--Well, let me just... if I could answer in two parts."
2003.03-6821,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1909.211,1913.448,"Well, does that mean that... what is the description of the other?"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1913.865,1915.548,--The percutaneous central line placement.
2003.03-6821,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1915.548,1915.998,--Percutaneous.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1920.352,1920.902,By all means.
2003.03-6821,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1922.137,1924.087,And you make that assurance to us today.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1924.087,1924.67,"Oh, absolutely."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1928.041,1928.491,That will be attempted.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1928.491,1928.841,Yes.
2003.03-6821,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1960.929,1962.562,"Are you sure, Mr. Newsom--"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1983.776,1985.461,"Well, the important point here... and I--"
2003.03-6821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1985.461,1986.128,If... if any.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1986.794,1987.33,"--Sure, absolutely."
2003.03-6821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2002.505,2003.972,What would the remedy be in Alabama?
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2005.791,2009.593,"--Well, he is, of course... I... I should just be careful about how I answer this question."
2003.03-6821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2029.489,2033.208,"Well, let's assume he... assume he's denied relief in the Alabama courts."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2035.226,2036.893,May I just--
2003.03-6821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2036.893,2037.763,"And if so, how?"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2037.763,2044.166,"--May... may I continue with the Alabama courts just on a minute because that's not... that's not... I'm not done with the Alabama courts, in essence."
2003.03-6821,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2046.118,2050.485,"But you... you said if this happened today, that rule 32 procedure would not be available."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2050.485,2051.77,--I think very arguably.
2003.03-6821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2058.275,2059.176,The law wasn't changed.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2067.896,2075.769,--Rule 32 statute of limitations is a... is a 6-month statute of limitations that begins running at the time new... a new factual predicate is discovered.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2075.769,2076.352,I see.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2076.352,2094.33,"That... that... if... if the statute began to ran... began... began to run, as... as we would say, on August 19th of 2003, when the record at pages 25 and 26 of the joint appendix makes plain that he knew that a cut-down was a possibility as a means of gaining access to his veins, then yes, that statute has expired."
2003.03-6821,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2111.692,2112.977,Can he... can he get a stay?
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2121.332,2122.599,He can get into--
2003.03-6821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2122.599,2124.368,"And if so, how?"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2124.368,2126.268,"--He can... of course, by all means."
2003.03-6821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2133.224,2135.424,Apply for an original writ in this Court?
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2136.426,2137.209,"--Well, not--"
2003.03-6821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2137.209,2141.228,"If... if that's not the remedy, is there a remedy in the district court in Alabama?"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2141.228,2143.496,--There is not I think a remedy in lower Federal courts.
2003.03-6821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2154.054,2160.292,"Well now, if there is no remedy in the Federal district court, why should there not be a 1983 remedy?"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2160.292,2174.717,"--Well, because our... our position, Your Honor, is that 1983 is not intended to be used to fill the gaps in the remedial scheme that Congress has specifically set up in the habeas statutes, that instead section 1983 deals with different kinds of claims."
2003.03-6821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2174.717,2177.084,Do you think AEDPA amended 1983?
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2177.084,2177.736,No.
2003.03-6821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2187.425,2191.244,"If AEDPA had never been passed, would there be a remedy under 1983?"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2191.244,2192.429,--No.
2003.03-6821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2198.167,2205.653,If the only thing... say it's a person who's not on death row who's going to be subjected to this kind of treatment for 6 days.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2207.605,2208.122,--To be sure.
2003.03-6821,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2237.892,2242.696,"You were going to... you were going to tell us that, you know, the sky is going to fall if we find that this is 1983."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2242.696,2244.879,"--I think it will fall pretty hard, Justice Kennedy."
2003.03-6821,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2261.239,2263.107,"Well, there are a lot of ways to deal with that."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2267.225,2267.908,--That's--
2003.03-6821,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2267.908,2270.01,"If they are valid, why shouldn't they be able to make it?"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2270.01,2273.712,"--Well, that certainly is one way of... of dealing with the problem, Your Honor, but--"
2003.03-6821,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2273.712,2275.314,Or there's the equitable problem--
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2276.781,2277.35,--I'm sorry.
2003.03-6821,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2277.35,2278.65,The district court says it's not valid.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2293.36,2294.393,In answer--
2003.03-6821,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2294.393,2299.764,"And indeed, the reason there's no remedy is because the courts are unable to use their normal rules to prevent abuse of process."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2299.764,2302.649,"--Let me try to answer these various questions in order, if I can keep up."
2003.03-6821,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.533,2330.249,But there's nothing in the language.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2343.659,2344.393,To be sure.
2003.03-6821,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2344.393,2352.648,And there's nothing in the habeas statute that suggests it fits because habeas is when you're challenging a custody in violation of the Constitution.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2387.321,2387.921,Okay.
2003.03-6821,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2388.504,2392.808,--into the language of any prior case or the statute itself?
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2392.808,2394.458,--Bear with me.
2003.03-6821,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2431.266,2434.552,You're right about that.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2434.552,2435.035,--Bear with me.
2003.03-6821,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2442.908,2448.46,Gomez was 10 years and a claim that could have been brought much earlier.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2503.047,2505.065,I think that's just not quite right.
2003.03-6821,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2509.617,2517.122,"But was there... whatever labels you use, was there something else that they asked for that you were not willing to give?"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2517.122,2518.705,They... I'm sorry.
2003.03-6821,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2519.688,2520.188,Yes.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2543.22,2552.409,--The point that I'm trying to make is that... that in fact those first two... what the... what the plaintiffs asked for in this case was indeed percutaneous central line placement.
2003.03-6821,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2582.345,2584.714,I'll ask Mr. Stevenson to clarify that.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2584.714,2585.347,Fair enough.
2003.03-6821,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2619.119,2621.738,"It wasn't an issue in that case, was it?"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2625.255,2626.291,Accurately describes.
2003.03-6821,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2626.291,2628.057,"--in that case it was... yes, accurately described it."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2634.98,2640.734,"Well, I think... I think it is fairly clear, Your Honor, from Gomez and Lonchar, read together, that method of execution--"
2003.03-6821,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2640.734,2648.888,"But is there anything other than... other than... Lonchar, which is describing the posture of the case as it appeared here on a different issue?"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2676.14,2684.58,"--I think it is unquestionably correct, Justice Scalia, that this Court has held that habeas is an appropriate vehicle for a method of execution claim or otherwise."
2003.03-6821,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2696.554,2700.923,So those are the two cases which you feel are the strongest support for you.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2700.923,2708.778,"--The strongest support I think, yes, for the... for the fact that a... that a habeas... that habeas is... is the appropriate vehicle for a method of execution claim."
2003.03-6821,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2741.667,2755.324,"But this is... you made the point earlier that if this man were just in his cell and under a term of years, that this would be an entirely proper 1983 case."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2783.66,2784.194,To be sure.
2003.03-6821,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2820.702,2821.602,"Well, but... but is it?"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2843.048,2848.286,"It just strikes me, Justice Souter, that that with respect... well, let me answer in two ways."
2003.03-6821,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2875.586,2883.025,"What you're doing is asking all the courts, including this one, to ignore the very issue and simply say, in effect, under AEDPA we don't care."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2889.679,2904.606,"I certainly am not suggesting in any... to any extent that... and I don't think it's true... that... that to extent that, say, a... a technically unnecessary but nonetheless chosen procedure for gaining venous access is unreviewable."
2003.03-6821,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2907.14,2909.426,That's I thought is what he wanted reviewed.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2917.063,2917.58,--Right.
2003.03-6821,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2924.602,2936.244,"There is no appropriate forum because the appropriate forum was closed to him before you announced, A, that you were going to execute him by injection and, B, that you were going to use this procedure as a last resort."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2936.244,2940.362,"--With respect, Justice Souter, the appropriate forum in this case exists."
2003.03-6821,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2950.253,2951.603,"Well, let's try this again."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2957.757,2960.275,"--Your Honor, I think that there certainly are procedures."
2003.03-6821,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2973.869,2975.402,"Well, we're talking about now."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2978.421,2979.087,--Those--
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2979.087,2979.773,--in Alabama?
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2979.773,2987.693,"--Those procedures, Your Honor, are in fact open to... to the prisoner today because when this Court stayed the execution, the death warrant expired."
2003.03-6821,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2998.65,3004.071,And do you represent he can get a hearing on the merits of his arguments in one of those procedures?
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,3004.071,3018.231,"--What I... what I can represent to the Court is that I am certainly not aware of any procedural bars that exist to him participating in either one of those processes, and that certainly with respect to Mr. Nelson, we would... we would be glad to waive any procedural bar that did exist."
2003.03-6821,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3019.531,3029.02,So that there could be a factual hearing on... on the necessity of the... and the... and the medical propriety of these procedures?
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,3029.02,3029.536,--Sure.
2003.03-6821,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3040.227,3046.481,"But... but if he does and loses, his only access to the Federal courts is by a petition for an original writ here."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,3046.481,3053.904,"--That's right and that's... that's very close, Your Honor, to the... to the very situation that this Court dealt with in Allen v. McCarty."
2003.03-6821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3053.904,3063.01,"He would also have the opportunity to seek a stay, would he not, from this Court from the decision of the Alabama court saying that his Eighth Amendment claim was--"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,3063.01,3063.677,To... to be sure.
2003.03-6821,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3067.812,3074.817,"--Would we have to go into the question of whether that's a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in a case, say, much worse than this one?"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,3079.102,3083.173,"I don't think, Justice Breyer, that this case even presents a suspension--"
2003.03-6821,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3083.173,3083.756,"No, no, no."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,3102.885,3104.17,--I think it's not in this Court--
2003.03-6821,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3104.17,3108.639,"And you'd refer me, because there's only a minute, to read on that so I'd become convinced what?"
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,3108.639,3110.49,--Please read Felker.
2003.03-6821,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3126.433,3131.837,"But if we... we're doing 1983, then there's no... there's no exhaustion requirement."
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,3132.454,3137.975,"That's... that's certainly true, but I guess it assumes that... that I'm wrong about... about the nature of this claim."
2003.03-6821,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3140.343,3149.549,--But you've said it is a good 1983 claim except if it... if it is in relation to the administration of the death sentence.
2003.03-6821,1,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,3149.549,3155.536,"--Your... that's right, Your Honor, and this will give me I think a... as good an opportunity as I can to try to sum up our position in this case."
2003.03-6821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3204.202,3204.602,May I--
2003.03-6821,2,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,3209.337,3211.873,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-6821,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3226.349,3229.151,"Before you go into that, would you clarify one thing for me I want?"
2003.03-6821,2,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,3233.971,3234.804,"--No, they did not."
2003.03-6821,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3237.006,3240.042,And the district court did not rule on the claim that there was--
2003.03-6821,2,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,3240.042,3246.546,"--Absolutely, and the problem here is, again, none of these issues were... were permitted to... to develop."
2003.03-6821,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3298.312,3305.085,--But that's a little different from a case that alleges a current impending constitutional violation.
2003.03-6821,2,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,3305.085,3305.901,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.03-6821,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3347.562,3352.048,We were told there were a couple of other methods besides rule 32.
2003.03-6821,2,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,3352.048,3354.181,"There are none, Justice O'Connor."
2003.03-6821,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3366.558,3371.11,"Well, he did ask for a stay you said, in order that this could be resolved."
2003.03-6821,2,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,3371.11,3372.01,Absolutely.
2003.03-6821,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3372.01,3376.414,"So, as I understand it, he does want a stay in order that this can be heard."
2003.03-6821,2,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,3376.414,3387.889,"Well, he wants a stay to... he wants to enjoin the kind of conduct that we're talking about here, but filing a stay motion in the Alabama Supreme Court would not get him merits review where we could present the kind of facts that we're now presenting."
2003.03-6821,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3433.984,3441.904,"Well, what we heard today, does that satisfy the prisoner's request that these... all of these other things be used first?"
2003.03-6821,2,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,3441.904,3449.409,"Well, if... if the State had then and would now concede that percutaneous line placement would be an acceptable method, then yes."
2003.03-6821,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3451.778,3453.961,Is that not what was said today?
2003.03-6821,2,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,3453.961,3455.98,"--Well, it's not said in a way that we can enforce, Your Honor."
2003.03-6821,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3536.665,3537.717,"Thank you, Mr. Stevenson."
