1991.90-1859,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.348,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-1859, J.C. Keeney v. Jose Tamayo-Reyes."
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,11.998,20.486,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1859,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,238.777,243.371,"xxx courts as to these issues, was there?"
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,243.371,245.863,"--That is correct, Your Honor, there was no--"
1991.90-1859,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,245.863,247.913,And yet you obtained grant of cert?
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,247.913,248.895,--I beg your pardon?
1991.90-1859,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,248.895,251.116,And yet you obtained a grant of cert?
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,251.116,252.628,"Yes, we did, Your Honor."
1991.90-1859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,343.788,356.674,"Well, of course, in all those other instances, I suppose it is true that we could look to an adequate and independent State ground as the basis for the procedural bar and so forth."
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,358.547,378.46,"Justice O'Connor, it is true that the Court has looked at the policies that underlie the adequate and independent State ground in some of its decisions, though not all, in those decisions in which the cause and prejudice standard is adopted."
1991.90-1859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.153,409.131,"Well, of course one other concern might be that here the Federal court has agreed to entertain the legal issue."
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,436.716,454.008,"My response to that, Justice O'Connor, would be that Federal habeas petitioners get a single opportunity to make their factual record or show cause for failure to do so, as this Court held in the McCleskey case just this last term."
1991.90-1859,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,475.202,478.574,"Well, McCleskey was a State prisoner."
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,484.328,486.639,"That is true, Justice Kennedy."
1991.90-1859,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,492.544,501.98,"Yes, and we made it very clear that it is the duty of the petitioner to the extent possible to bring all of his claims in the first proceeding."
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,515.798,517.02,--Absolutely.
1991.90-1859,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,535.683,550.543,"Well, I said first opportunity and my submission to you was that it was the first hearing in Federal court where the statute, one of the provisions of the statute for disregarding the State's finding is that the facts were not adequately developed."
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,550.543,575.398,"Well, as the Court has observed repeatedly in its cause and prejudice tests, one of the most important defects of the deliberate bypass test is that it fails to pay proper respect to the State's role in the overall criminal adjudication process."
1991.90-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,708.923,712.807,"Mr. Landau, can I interrupt with just one question?"
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,721.152,722.233,That is correct.
1991.90-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,722.233,728.856,What about... how consistent is your position with subsection (d)(3) of 2254?
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,728.856,732.209,"I'd be happy to turn to that portion of my argument, Justice Stevens."
1991.90-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,849.296,850.997,That's a successive petition.
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,850.997,851.558,That's correct.
1991.90-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,851.558,853.04,But this is not a successive petition.
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,853.04,853.748,That's correct.
1991.90-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,853.748,858.483,Then I'm not quite sure I understand why that section should inform the problem before us.
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,858.483,868.619,"As this Court said in Brown v. Allen, the same policies that underlie the successive petition sections also inform the evidentiary hearing."
1991.90-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,868.619,873.152,Do you think the same strict standards that apply to second habeas petitions should apply to first habeas petitions?
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,873.152,874.041,This is true.
1991.90-1859,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,903.764,908.166,I wasn't quite sure when you answered Justice Steven's first question about 2254(d)(3).
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,937.314,944.99,"That is absolutely correct, Justice Kennedy, but what... if you look carefully at the language of the statute, I think it works in the following way."
1991.90-1859,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,985.255,988.548,"Well, provided it finds that the facts were adequately developed."
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,988.548,991.739,"I'm sorry, I'll have to take a look at my statute here."
1991.90-1859,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,996.962,999.544,"Well, 2254(d)(3)."
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,999.544,1002.378,"Oh, certainly, that is one of the--"
1991.90-1859,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1002.378,1010.931,"But isn't that the gravamen of the respondent's argument, that the facts weren't adequately developed?"
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,1010.931,1024.531,"--Yes, and if the facts were not adequately developed under Townsend, and if, depending on what standards you apply under Townsend, you determine whether or not there will be a hearing."
1991.90-1859,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1037.387,1041.031,And there's no evidentiary presumption if the facts were not adequately developed.
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,1041.031,1041.813,That's correct.
1991.90-1859,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1057.413,1058.623,You mean the Federal court may not make the presumption?
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,1058.623,1059.474,That is correct.
1991.90-1859,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1059.474,1060.335,But that's this case.
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,1060.335,1061.335,That's correct.
1991.90-1859,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1072.961,1080.878,"What you're saying, basically, is that there's going to be some form of waiver under section 3 anyway."
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,1105.453,1106.425,That is correct.
1991.90-1859,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1120.553,1130.14,"You're saying that subsection (3) is given application, under your theory, when a case is accepted by the Federal court because there was cause and prejudice."
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,1145.15,1145.671,Precisely.
1991.90-1859,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1145.671,1147.681,So it still does have some application.
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,1147.681,1152.793,"As I said, they are related, but they serve distinctly different purposes."
1991.90-1859,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1152.793,1159.719,My only point was that the State... that the district court on the first Federal petition has not option but to accept the proceeding.
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,1159.719,1161.669,That is correct.
1991.90-1859,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1162.701,1166.134,The question is whether or not there should be an evidentiary hearing.
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,1166.134,1166.524,--Correct.
1991.90-1859,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1191.271,1198.454,"But in this respect it's different from McCleskey because McCleskey said there should be no proceeding, that proceeding itself is barred."
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,1198.454,1200.857,I will grant you that distinction.
1991.90-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1212.015,1214.266,"Well, except they're interpreting different statute."
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,1216.597,1217.578,--That is correct.
1991.90-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1217.578,1218.838,I was going to ask you.
1991.90-1859,0,31423,jack_l_landau,,1228.424,1234.188,Whether a hearing shall be held for State... petitioners who had a State hearing?
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,1502.238,1510.212,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1859,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1564.659,1569.841,Does it also cast doubt on the adequacy of the determination?
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,1587.352,1589.063,"I believe it is, Your Honor."
1991.90-1859,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1592.325,1597.09,"You talked about adequate development, not the accuracy of the determination."
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,1597.09,1605.654,--I do not believe that the affidavit in and of itself is the reason why we're entitled to a hearing.
1991.90-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.785,1823.557,"Are these basically policy arguments, Mr. Wax, or are they based on the statute or our cases?"
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,1824.819,1827.26,"They're a little of each, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1987.135,2001.294,"Well, then, Mr. Wax, when you look at subsection (3), which is and exception, I guess, to the presumption of correctness, and there that the material facts were not adequately developed at the State court hearing."
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,2004.056,2004.858,That's correct.
1991.90-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2004.858,2012.103,"Now, that section as written doesn't say anything about either cause and prejudice or about deliberate bypass, does it?"
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,2012.103,2014.964,"No, the language of the statute does not."
1991.90-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2015.623,2024.289,So both of those are really judicially created modifications or amendments to that section of the statute.
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,2029.233,2037.989,"--Mr. Chief Justice, we say that because Congress used the identical language that was used in Townsend."
1991.90-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2052.938,2061.625,But why do you say that since the only thing they took from Townsend was this particular phrase with no reference to any concept of waiver?
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,2061.625,2076.554,"In the legislative history, which appears in both the 1964 House report and again in the 1966 reports, one finds Congress specifically adverting to the decision in Townsend."
1991.90-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2076.554,2080.507,Do you find them specifically adverting to deliberate bypass?
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,2080.507,2083.288,"No, that specific language does not appear."
1991.90-1859,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2126.317,2149.121,"Mr. Wax, 2254 also includes subsection (b), which says that an application shall not... for Federal habeas shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State or that there is either an absence of available State corrective process or the existence of circumstances rendering such process ineffective."
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,2168.045,2169.515,I believe that it does not.
1991.90-1859,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2252.068,2257.173,I must say that's an unusual application of exhaustion.
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,2301.292,2311.787,We are not urging a rule which would permit a petitioner to come in a do that without showing the absence of the deliberate bypass.
1991.90-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2349.372,2350.985,You can show cause and prejudice.
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,2350.985,2364.07,"--I believe... I'm not sure though whether Justice Scalia's comment, if I understood it correctly, would extend or could extend to precluding a hearing even if cause and prejudice were shown."
1991.90-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2364.07,2365.963,"Well, you're entitled to answer him on his hypothesis."
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,2368.825,2369.756,That's correct.
1991.90-1859,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2369.756,2371.597,I think you're mistaking my point.
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,2397.703,2412.233,Most of the discussion of exhaustion comes up in the context of having presented a claim to the State court and not coming into Federal court and significantly changing the claim.
1991.90-1859,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2450.988,2463.447,"But the fact does remain that, of course, (d) on its own terms, taken with or without conjunction with (b), sets forth some very substantial State policies."
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,2484.201,2499.95,"I believe, Justice Kennedy, that the existence of 2254(d) assumes the type of standard that was set up in Townsend."
1991.90-1859,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2989.04,2996.446,"Is it correct, Mr. Wax, that the district court has the discretion to hold a hearing if it chooses to do so?"
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,2996.446,3001.548,It is certainly correct that they have the discretion to do so.
1991.90-1859,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3027.415,3035.612,"Well, even under the deliberate bypass standard, does the court have discretion to go ahead and hold a hearing?"
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,3035.612,3047.658,"I believe that it does since Townsend says that a hearing is mandatory in the six enumerated circumstances, but is discretionary in any other--"
1991.90-1859,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3047.658,3060.899,"Does that circumstance work for you or against you in this case, the fact that there is discretion to ignore the deliberate bypass rule, if that's the rule, or I assume, the cause and prejudice rule, if that's the rule we adopt?"
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,3060.899,3069.884,"--The reality, I'm afraid, is that that works against us because the district judges are not, in my experience, exercising their discretion in that way."
1991.90-1859,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3079.701,3086.203,"Well, does it work for you to the extent that if the rule is valid, it indicates that the statute is not binding on the district court?"
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,3086.203,3087.615,"Yes, it would."
1991.90-1859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3090.347,3094.41,But the discretion described in Fay v. Noia was not discretion to hold a hearing.
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,3115.873,3117.936,That is correct.
1991.90-1859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3121.667,3122.808,Grant hearings for additional reasons.
1991.90-1859,1,42217,steven_t_wax,,3122.808,3123.73,--Yes.
1991.90-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3173.131,3174.591,"Thank you, Mr. Wax."
1991.90-1859,2,31423,jack_l_landau,,3177.135,3180.465,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-1859,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3250.072,3256.687,Why isn't that incentive provided by the natural desire of a person in prison to try to get out as soon as possible?
1991.90-1859,2,31423,jack_l_landau,,3256.687,3261.539,"Justice Stevens, there's no question that there is that incentive that works in the system."
1991.90-1859,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3278.619,3284.373,"You're arguing for... the rule you're arguing for is really for the benefit of the prisoners, to make sure they make their cases as promptly as they can."
1991.90-1859,2,31423,jack_l_landau,,3284.373,3304.276,"--I think, as I said in my opening remark, that adoption of the cause and prejudice test ultimately will benefit the prisoners because it will promote the ability of the Federal/State fact-finders to make accurate decisions as early on in the process."
1991.90-1859,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3304.276,3308.169,"Well, that just means it'll benefit those prisoners who deserve to get off."
1991.90-1859,2,31423,jack_l_landau,,3308.169,3308.86,That's true.
1991.90-1859,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3308.86,3315.244,"It will not benefit those who don't deserve to get off, because in those cases, bad memory is a positive advantage, isn't it?"
1991.90-1859,2,31423,jack_l_landau,,3315.244,3316.203,"Well, that is true, but--"
1991.90-1859,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3316.203,3319.796,"So you have to judge for yourself which percentage is the higher, I--"
1991.90-1859,2,31423,jack_l_landau,,3319.796,3328.733,"--Without attempting to be glib in the slightest, what we are after here is the accurate determination of the facts."
1991.90-1859,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3409.696,3410.976,"Thank you, Mr. Landau."
1991.90-1859,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3412.388,3418.584,The Honorable Court is now adjourned until Tuesday next at ten o'clock.
