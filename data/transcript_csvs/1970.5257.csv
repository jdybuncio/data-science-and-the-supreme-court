1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.086,"We’ll hear arguments next in 5257, Labine against Vincent."
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,10.433,13.591,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,51.411,59.467,"Mr. Cox, in many if not most states, that kind of acknowledgment suppose is the whole question?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,59.467,61.498,"As rightly said, Your Honor."
1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,61.498,63.668,"Well, I mean as a matter of statute?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,76.803,78.325,Does not Your Honor.
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,184.674,187.775,Suppose the brothers and sisters were rather aged people weren’t they?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,187.775,190.203,They were Your Honor and in fairness --
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,190.203,193.301,"The father was 70, her father who acknowledged --"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,193.301,193.527,Yes.
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,193.527,197.082,"-- this child was his child, was 70-years old at the time of his death?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,197.082,199.213,Yes Your Honor but that’s not beyond the --
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,199.213,204.999,"And I suppose some at least, some of his brothers and sisters were older than she and --"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,204.999,240.371,"In fairness Justice Stewart, I would say that records were not kept in Louisiana, there were court house fires and other reasons why it was difficult to prove relationship by the same token of the fact of burden of proof and the fact of proof of relationship is extremely significant in a case of this sort because it goes to the question of what is a state's legitimate interest in legislating against a particular class of people."
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,240.371,242.039,How old is the mother?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,242.039,243.408,The mother was 51-years old.
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,243.408,250.932,"And she is now, she is now married Mr. Labine?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,250.932,255.328,Mr. Labine is deceased Your Honor.
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,255.328,255.841,I see.
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,256.786,263.015,She was married to James Brookes and then she married Mr. Labine and Mr. Labine is now deceased and she’s unmarried.
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,272.019,279.033,"At the time of the birth of this child, she was -- are they in between marriages?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,279.033,281.421,There was no marriage Your Honor at the time of the birth of this child.
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,281.421,282.723,She’s never been married?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,282.723,287.283,She had been married first to Mr. Brookes and then to Mr. Labine who is deceased.
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,287.283,290.674,"Yes, and very well, when was this child born?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,290.674,293.359,This child was born after the death of Mr. Labine.
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,293.359,294.725,I see she was a widow?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,294.725,296.546,Yes Your Honor.
1970.5257,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,296.546,304.291,Is there any disability from the two parents marrying at the time and that one might have been married to someone else.
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,304.291,310.46,"No, Ezra Vincent Your Honor was not married nor was Mrs. Labine, there was no disability."
1970.5257,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,310.46,328.774,"As you move along your argument, will you touch upon the question whether if you prevail with respect to this little child, the same would be true if any illegitimate child whether acknowledged or not if paternity were established?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,328.774,352.512,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, the question of burden of proof and standards of proof are questions which would be more appropriately resolved by judicial declarations and statutes, statutes from the stand point of setting reasonable burdens and judicial declarations if the burdens are unreasonable."
1970.5257,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,378.519,379.629,Or draw a will?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,379.629,381.053,Or draw a will.
1970.5257,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,415.228,429.473,"Well, I just want to be sure that your due process argument wouldn’t carry all the weight to benefit any other illegitimate child once paternity was established. But I take it you’re drawing the line between the two."
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,429.473,441.744,"As a matter of standing before the Court, as an officer of the Court, I would say that to draw the line a formal acknowledgment would be perhaps an inappropriate line."
1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,526.143,545.268,"Mr. Cox, do you need to do more than persuade that where there has been formal acknowledgment in a life time of the alleged father that that’s enough to satisfy the claim?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,545.268,547.85,This is the case in controversy before this Court.
1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,547.85,549.654,"Well, do you have to do any more than that?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,558.079,575.423,Only in order to answer hypothetical posed by Your Honors because I think that a formal acknowledgment is sufficient to satisfy the burden of proof perhaps other clearing convincing modes of proof would satisfy Your Honors also or the Courts that would interpret the statutes.
1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,575.423,579.029,We couldn’t get anything stronger than the formal acknowledgment that was made here.
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,579.029,583.881,"No, we’re very fortunate in that respect as far as having a real case in controversy before this Court."
1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,583.881,591.05,"How many states have a statute that would be satisfied by the record here, do you happen to know?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,591.05,594.105,In one of the amicus curiae briefs various --
1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,594.105,594.646,Show some effort for that --
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,594.646,629.141,"-- differentiations are made in the brief of the American Civil Liberties Union written by the eminent writer in the field primarily professor Harry D. Krause joined by Mr. Melvin Wolfe and Mr. Dorson, he points out that I believe in perhaps at least 16 states, if I’m not mistaken but I don’t have the figures before me Your Honor."
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,800.245,810.173,"Well, that’s true everywhere, isn’t it? (Inaudible)"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,810.173,812.258,Yes Your Honor.
1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,885.961,891.418,"I was puzzled by your emphasis on that in your brief, what’s the real connection between the two?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,891.418,895.291,"Well, this was in the amicus curiae briefs Your Honor?"
1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,906.314,917.77,"Well, aren’t you confusing the declared purpose of the legislative body and making an enactment and the actual consequence is nearly as anyone can discern it."
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,932.027,939.706,"Well, there must be some real and viable relationship between the declared purpose and an actual state of facts Mr. Chief Justice Burger."
1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,939.706,939.955,"Well, but you don’t know?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,939.955,941.44,"In my respectful submission, --"
1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,941.44,949.528,"You have no way of knowing that absent to statute, the situation might not be a lot worse in Louisiana?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,953.262,953.853,I can’t really --
1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,953.853,954.63,-- very strong how impress I am.
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,954.63,957.468,I can’t really argue with that.
1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,957.468,959.125,"That’s my point, nobody knows and therefore --"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,959.125,959.597,Nobody really knows.
1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,959.597,961.913,-- reliable yardstick for anything?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,961.913,977.311,"No, I don’t think that pursuing these figures we will come out with an answer except to say that Justice Stewart’s observation in the case of Shelton versus Tucker I think is pertinent."
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,997.062,999.031,Was that a First Amendment case?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,999.031,1000.899,Yes it was Your Honor but --
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1000.899,1000.949,With association --
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1000.949,1010.451,-- I do believe that the language there -- let me post this question to you Justice Stewart.
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1030.397,1031.496,Allow me to answer the question now or later?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1031.496,1041.56,"Well, I’ll sure I’ll receive an answer but this is what strikes me to be the question here from the standpoint of this child’s rights."
1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1041.56,1070.486,Mr. Cox aren’t you in a stronger ground if you simply take the old thesis that one of the predicates on this problem has been that it exposes people to fraudulent claims which are difficult to establish truth either way and that none of those factors are served when a state denies this right to one as to whom there is no question on the part of the father?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1070.486,1074.321,I would like to take those grounds in my argument.
1970.5257,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1119.275,1124.873,"Is it quite accurate to say the father did what he could, he could had drawn a will?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1124.873,1125.22,He could have --
1970.5257,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1125.22,1130.39,Which is a lot easier than going through adoption proceedings or --
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1130.39,1149.894,"He could have Justice Blackmun but it’s every man’s right not to draw a will and we -- I do not feel speaking for the little child and not engaging in colloquy with the Court, that this child should have any heavier burden after the proof of her relationship to her parent than any other child is concerned."
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1162.482,1175.564,I would suppose perhaps that the state would assume an intention on the part of a decedent who do not draw a will that his property should go under the state laws of descendant distribution?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1191.94,1199.98,"If those laws were constitutional, I would imagine that the man in the streets thinks that the laws are constitutional Your Honor from talking to ordinary people and that’s not before this Court."
1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1208.377,1236.732,"That doesn’t meet the problem that suppose that the state makes a will for all people who do not take the trouble to make one for themselves and the man, it’s a common thing for lawyers consulted by people of no great means in finding out what they want to do to tell them that they don’t need a will because what they want is what is already provided for by the statutes."
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1245.163,1260.658,"Once lawyers know what this honorable court holds the constitution means, when it says Equal Protection of the law which most people think they know then the attorneys won’t be giving advice not to do something about one way or another."
1970.5257,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1270.257,1274.135,"That’s equal protection with what, with what other children?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1274.135,1280.775,With children similarly situated except for the accident of what their parents have done.
1970.5257,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1280.775,1294.013,"You’re not saying that Louisiana could not constitutionally leave all children legitimate or illegitimate out of the laws of intestacy, or are you?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1294.013,1312.095,That would be -- this has never been done in any state Mr. Justice Blackmun and I’m not saying that they couldn’t but it certainly wouldn’t promote what common sense dictates that is the parents support their children and leave basic methods of support.
1970.5257,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1312.095,1334.848,"I come back to the question I originally asked and I realized as the Chief Justice indicated that you don’t have to go this far but I wonder how you can -- if you prevail constitutionally here, you don’t also carry with you every illegitimate child who’s paternity is established by other methods than acknowledgment, I would suspect you do?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1334.848,1347.181,I would say Mr. Justice Blackmun in answer to that question that it would depend upon the way that this Court rules.
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1370.847,1374.567,On this case there were no legitimate children of the decedent?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1374.567,1375.605,There were no legitimate children.
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1375.605,1382.746,"So, in this case with respect to this property there was no discrimination as among these children, was it?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1382.746,1383.883,There was discrimination against this one child.
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1383.883,1386.632,No children got?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1388.281,1388.801,That’s right and there was --
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1388.801,1396.952,"There was no discrimination as between legitimate children and illegitimate children of this decedent, was there?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1396.952,1404.656,"There was discrimination as between an illegitimate child and legitimate brothers and sisters, but because of the fact --"
1970.5257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1404.656,1415.397,"Two quite different classes of people, there was no -- oh I think you’ve answered my question, if there were no legitimate children then there was no discrimination as among children in this case?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1415.397,1416.234,That’s correct Your Honor.
1970.5257,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1416.234,1423.31,"What if this plaintiffs disposition had been legitimate, she would have automatically inherited, is that right?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1423.31,1428.616,"That’s correct, this is where I feel the discrimination comes in."
1970.5257,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1487.772,1514.012,Supposed the legislature had passed a law which said that no father of illegitimate children in this state shall be permitted to exclude his legitimate children -- illegitimate children or all that all fathers in this state must give as much to the illegitimate children as they give to their legitimate children?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1514.012,1519.194,This would be a good and valid way to clear the problem Mr. Justice Black.
1970.5257,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1524.724,1536.031,"The legislature just left it open I presume for a man to dispose that his property go as he felt it under the law, isn’t it?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1536.031,1560.82,"Admittedly Mr. Justice Black, the father could have left to his illegitimate child what he did to his legitimate brothers and sisters but we get into the area of presuming the intention of the testator, this is what the state has done, the legislature has presumed that all testators intend to exclude illegitimates but the legislature also presumes and has said that a parent cannot exclude legitimate children."
1970.5257,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1560.82,1581.808,"But why wouldn’t the next step be under your argument that say that well, it’s not fair, it denies equal protection through bad policy for a father not to have to leave some of his money to his illegitimate children, why shouldn’t the Court decide that denied due process or equal protection?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1581.808,1582.864,Why should the Court --
1970.5257,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1582.864,1585.343,Why would not be about the next argument?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1585.343,1586.574,I didn’t understand it.
1970.5257,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1586.574,1601.32,"Well, the next argument that there’s no law on it but the Court should hold that it denies Equal Protection to permit the father to discriminate against his illegitimate children?"
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1601.32,1606.081,That step may very well come because the father cannot discriminate against legitimate children in Louisiana.
1970.5257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1621.351,1624.683,Do you mean that under Louisiana law a man cannot disinherit his children?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1624.683,1633.815,"That’s correct Your Honor, but he can disinherit his illegitimate children by not saying anything and he doesn’t intend to."
1970.5257,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1633.815,1642.83,"Well, if he hadn’t intended to he could have prevented it certainly under Louisiana law? He could have made a will and left it in the part of the father."
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1642.83,1646.39,Yes he could have Your Honor.
1970.5257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1646.39,1647.936,Would you answer that for me again?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1649.758,1655.937,He could have made a will and he could have left his property to his illegitimate child if he had so desired.
1970.5257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.937,1658.017,At the expense of his legitimate children?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1658.017,1659.848,He had none so he could not.
1970.5257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1659.848,1660.145,Suppose he did have?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1660.145,1668.984,"But if had had some, no he could not have, they would have been forced to the same extent. There’s a small disposable portion that he can distribute but --"
1970.5257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1668.984,1675.494,So that by will he cannot give his entire state to charity to the exclusion of children under the Louisiana law?
1970.5257,0,29679,james_j_cox,,1675.494,1677.678,That’s correct Your Honor.
1970.5257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1683.036,1684.217,Mr. Leithead.
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,1684.217,1688.299,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.5257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1744.338,1748.715,The acknowledge illegitimate child come anywhere in the hierarchy if there had been --
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,1748.715,1750.006,Yes sir.
1970.5257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1795.692,1812.921,"If this decedent had died living no surviving brothers and sisters and no issue of any siblings, would this appellant have inherited?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,1812.921,1828.265,"This child would have inherited because the law states that if a man dies leaving no legitimate children, no mother and father and no surviving wife, then his acknowledged child would inherit."
1970.5257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1828.265,1831.008,"Well, wait a minute, this man didn’t have mother, father and a wife?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,1831.008,1835.824,"No, I say it, so the child would have inherited if he didn’t have brothers and sisters."
1970.5257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1835.824,1839.698,"Oh yes, because the brother as in this case, the brothers and sisters come ahead but --"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,1839.698,1839.965,Come ahead.
1970.5257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1839.965,1839.965,"There have been no brothers and sisters, the appellant would have inherited here under the --"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,1844.43,1845.168,That’s correct.
1970.5257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1845.168,1846.962,Laws of descendant distribution?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,1846.962,1848.006,That’s correct.
1970.5257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1848.006,1858.451,"And from the mother, the natural mother I suppose you don’t need to be having any certification of parenthood in that kind of -- and for the mother, do you?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,1858.451,1872.544,"Proof of motherhood is very easily made, mother knows as usually witnesses, a midwife or something as to the birth of the child but the children, natural children of a mother come in just after her legitimate children."
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1879.385,1888.491,"Well, what’s your reason for drawing the line between the legitimate and illegitimate children insofar as the mother is concerned?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,1888.491,1896.691,"The state realizes that the mother has a close family connection to the -- well, to answer to question, the state of Louisiana prefers --"
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1896.691,1898.822,That is a closed family connection --
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,1898.822,1898.974,Yes.
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1898.974,1901.134,-- between the illegitimate child and legitimate child?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,1901.134,1923.048,"Yes, the state of Louisiana has a state policy preferring legitimacy over illegitimacy and in connection with that policy, it’s obvious that they prefer legitimate heirs to illegitimate heirs and their policy is a -- it is to promote marriage and discourage illegitimacy and also for the protection of their land titles."
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1923.048,1931.611,Is to promote the marriage of the illegitimate child or his mother but the illegitimate child is the one to suffer?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,1931.611,1951.392,"That is correct, but if the parents wish to, they could prevent the illegitimate child from suffering by doing some other things and that is they could legitimate the child by informally acknowledging the child before or after a marriage if they could marry, they could adopt him or they could leave a will."
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1955.978,1960.527,What course of events can the child change?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,1960.527,1962.447,The child cannot change any course of events.
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1962.447,1963.693,That’s what I thought.
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,1963.693,1965.177,That’s right.
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1965.177,1974.247,"Somewhere in these briefs I thought, I recalled seeing a figure on the total number -- estimated total number of illegitimate people in the country, do you recall the figure?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,1974.247,1977.891,"I don’t remember what those figures are Your Honor, that must be an amicus curiae brief."
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1977.891,1979.716,Amicus briefs yes.
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,1979.716,1980.138,Wasn’t in my --
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1980.138,1984.524,"It’s a very large number, the total number of all ages."
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,1984.524,1986.464,Yes.
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2239.808,2248.864,"If the child had been legitimate, it hadn’t seen the father for the past 50 years and was now living alone, she would have inherited?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2248.864,2251.544,That’s correct.
1970.5257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2251.544,2257.348,He could have made a will I suppose in given at least to part of his property to somebody else.
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2257.348,2264.791,"A small one –if you have one child, the fourth portion is 1/3 that you have to leave the child, 2/3 you can give them."
1970.5257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2264.791,2267.684,You can give them 2/3 of the property still to his brothers and sisters.
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2267.684,2268.806,Right.
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2268.806,2277.974,"While you were pausing here, I’m looking at page 8 of the appendix, that’s the certificate of acknowledgment of paternity."
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2282.874,2283.51,That’s correct.
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2283.51,2286.581,And then before a notary public and two witnesses?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2286.581,2287.51,Right Your Honor.
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2287.51,2295.264,"So that, is the formality of executing a will in Louisiana any more complex than this?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2295.264,2301.079,"There is -- no sir, there is -- a will maybe executed in Louisiana before a notary public and two witnesses."
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2301.079,2301.613,The same as this --
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2301.613,2317.117,"Same as this, say -- and the notary public has authority to take a will, so at the same time these parties were doing this, if Ezra wanted to, he could with -- had signed the will and left his property to his acknowledged child."
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2327.814,2330.383,That indicates what?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2330.383,2345.605,"He indicates to my way of thinking that if Ezra was in the notary’s office and had two witnesses and did not sign a will, at that time living his property to his acknowledged child. It would indicate that he did not want to do that."
1970.5257,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2345.605,2349.344,What would be the purpose of you acknowledging the child?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2349.344,2350.926,To provide for the child support.
1970.5257,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2365.945,2370.894,What date was these acknowledgment made?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2370.894,2375.505,"It’s on page eight of the appendix, 1962."
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2375.505,2378.054,1962 apparently?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2378.054,2380.139,1962 Your Honor.
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2380.139,2382.955,Social security had to pay sometime before that as it is?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2382.955,2385.762,Yes.
1970.5257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2386.233,2388.519,"By reason of the certificate, --"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2388.519,2388.849,Yes sir.
1970.5257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2388.849,2396.547,"By the acknowledgment that he was the father of the child, the child received as his child?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2396.547,2397.596,"That’s right, under the Social Security Act."
1970.5257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2397.596,2407.743,Social security and veterans benefits totaling a $100.00 a month from the United States Government and then all of his property went to his brothers and sisters?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2407.743,2409.298,"That’s correct, that by statute."
1970.5257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2409.298,2411.9,There’s no way of knowing that that’s not exactly what he intended?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2411.9,2413.923,That’s exactly correct.
1970.5257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2426.15,2427.117,What do you mean by that?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2427.117,2436.865,"Well, it means that a man came in and acknowledged this child and the child -- the brothers and sisters come in inherit before the child."
1970.5257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2440.114,2445.689,The acknowledgment did serve to make her illegible to receive a $100.00 a month from the United States Government.
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2445.689,2450.23,"Right and that’s equivalent to $24,000.00 at 5% interest."
1970.5257,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2450.23,2456.66,I assume that parents frequently distinguished in the amounts they leave to their children?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2456.66,2469.211,"That is true and in some case, some states so I informed that there is no forced heirship and the child maybe left just by testament of mere pittance where another child maybe cleared."
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2469.211,2471.058,Or omitted entirely?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2471.058,2471.652,Or omitted entirely.
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2471.652,2476.993,As long that it’s clear that the omission wasn’t over sized.
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2476.993,2477.448,"Yes, if --"
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2477.448,2480.112,"It’s true in almost all the states in this country, is it not?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2480.112,2482.86,"Yes, but in Louisiana, no sir, you cannot do that."
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2482.86,2484.691,That’s because if the civil law of --
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2484.691,2484.924,Civil law.
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2484.924,2486.421,"-- wanting, isn’t it?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2486.421,2497.007,"You must leave the forced heirs, their forced portion and the forced heirs in Louisiana are lawful children and parents."
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2573.38,2577.399,"May I, does the record show how much of estate this man left?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2577.399,2585.343,"The record does show in its approximate $15,000.00 in property real estate."
1970.5257,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2585.343,2587.946,"$15,000.00?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2587.946,2588.409,Yes sir.
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2588.409,2595.116,"And the benefit that he conferred by this acknowledgment as a capitalized value of 24,000 did you say?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2595.116,2597.907,"Capitalized at 5%, yes Your Honor."
1970.5257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.907,2612.9,Do I understand that there had been no veteran or social security division (Inaudible)
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2612.9,2613.341,Yes Your Honor.
1970.5257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2617.212,2618.714,Even though between the acknowledgment?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2618.714,2625.639,"No, no, oh, no, if there had been, the acknowledgment -- the father -- the estate would still have to support the child, that’s correct Your Honor."
1970.5257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2625.639,2630.838,And when is it that the father -- the father’s state did not subject to terms?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2630.838,2640.634,"It supports the child, if the child is 21 or until the child can earn a living for himself, it’s doing minority."
1970.5257,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2640.634,2647.882,"Why is it in this instance, wasn’t there an effort here to have the state contribute to this child’s support?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2647.882,2650.225,The trial judge reasoned this way.
1970.5257,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2668.047,2670.84,But the statute itself doesn’t fix --
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2670.84,2671.222,No sir.
1970.5257,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2671.222,2672.107,Fix from.
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2672.107,2679.313,"The statute just says what is necessary for the support of the child and is left up to the discretion of the Court, the Trial Court."
1970.5257,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2679.313,2689.465,"So if you have this pension or whatever it is this $100.00 a month, it’s been only $50.00 a month, there might still have been a holding that the state was not to pay anything for --"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2689.465,2697.368,May have been and may have been just the opposite and the state shouldn’t contribute so much money from it.
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2783.908,2791.445,"Do you think the case, could have this man alone could have adopted this child?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2791.445,2791.738,There’s no --
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2791.738,2792.492,In Louisiana.
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2792.492,2797.299,There’s no prohibitions that I know off that he could not.
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2797.299,2801.351,And then he would meet the same category for legitimate child.
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2801.351,2802.897,Yes Your Honor.
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2802.897,2821.734,"So that if an illegitimate child is born to a couple who has no access to legal advice or adoption, had no way in the world for that child to become able to inherit?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2821.734,2823.384,No sir.
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2827.116,2829.538,But not to inheritance?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2829.538,2832.951,He has to be acknowledged or legitimated.
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2832.951,2835.446,"Well, that means adopted?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2835.446,2837.308,You say if the child was adopted?
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2837.308,2839.668,"No, I said the child has to be adopted?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2839.668,2841.869,Or legitimated.
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2841.869,2842.746,How is legitimated?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2842.746,2856.271,"Now, legitimated is when the persons maybe done by a notarial act where you go before the notary and say that this is my child and I want him to be my heir and I want him to inherit from me, that is a legitimation."
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2858.761,2860.093,And that’s under Louisiana law?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2860.093,2869.621,"That’s under Louisiana law, are -- that are the parties, the man, the mother and the father of the child may marry."
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2878.738,2880.076,At the court notary.
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2880.076,2885.032,"No, just go into the Court’s church and get married and just having the child live in a home with them and acknowledge him."
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2885.032,2888.585,I thought legitimizing is done before notary?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2888.585,2890.83,There’s two ways of doing a legitimizing.
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2904.675,2911.727,"This has to be done before notary and in Louisiana that’s different from notaries in the other countries, that’s officially banned."
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2911.727,2913.379,Yes Your Honor.
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2913.379,2926.152,"If that’s the only way to do it, the only difference between that child in this case, the only reason she can’t inherit because they differ as far as willing to do that?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2926.152,2936.133,The father did not legitimize her before a notary public and he did not marry the natural mother or he did not of course leave a will or adopt the child.
1970.5257,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2936.133,2940.207,And none of this things could she on her own had done obviously?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2940.207,2941.138,No.
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2941.138,2954.208,"Mr. Leithead, under the statute of Louisiana must -- with that certificate -- the acknowledgment had been valid if the mother had not also joined in it, but must both of them join in the acknowledgment?"
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2954.208,2966.951,"To my understanding is they do both or if the -- only the husband signs the acknowledgment, it is not binding on the mother, it's only binding on those who actually acknowledge."
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2977.356,2989.779,Would it -- how much more would they had to say on this certificate of paternity in order to confer rights of inheritance by intestacy?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,2989.779,3005.283,"They wouldn’t had to say that they acknowledged that -- Ezra Vincent would have had to say that he was the father of this child and that he acknowledged the child as his child and granted him the right to inherit from him, it has to be specific."
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3005.283,3006.159,And it’s just the time --
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,3006.159,3007.228,"A similar to a will, it has to be --"
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3007.228,3009.263,As to five more words isn’t it?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,3009.263,3011.923,"Well, I’m just giving you those in my words."
1970.5257,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3053.53,3055.386,Louisiana have a common law marriage?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,3055.386,3067.539,Louisiana does not recognize common law marriages although many states do and Louisiana and other states have different laws in respect to putative marriages.
1970.5257,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3067.539,3071.737,Has there been any question raised yet about that being unconstitutional?
1970.5257,1,31398,james_a_leithead,,3071.737,3080.005,"There’s never been any question as to whether or not the -- no sir, that question has never been raised in Louisiana."
1970.5257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3267.862,3269.475,Thank you Mr. Leithead.
1970.5257,2,29679,james_j_cox,,3278.853,3281.539,Thank you very much Mr. Chief Justice Burger.
1970.5257,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3352.121,3355.293,On what ground did North Dakota based that holding?
1970.5257,2,29679,james_j_cox,,3355.293,3368.37,"Oh, the Court of North Dakota and in re estate of Jensen, based it on the grounds of the North Dakota constitution and the United States constitution granting Equal Protection of laws to all of its citizens."
1970.5257,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3498.025,3512.463,"Mr. Cox, I live in Virginia which permits a testator to make a will, I think anyway he wants to do it, he cut off his children, I suppose that’s true in 49 of the states."
1970.5257,2,29679,james_j_cox,,3529.875,3536.037,"No because, here we have a question of class, a class of people Your Honor."
1970.5257,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3549.549,3560.974,"You got a class, suppose I had some children -- well, children in Louisiana can inherit and children in Virginia and the other states can’t."
1970.5257,2,29679,james_j_cox,,3560.974,3561.185,I see no reason.
1970.5257,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3561.185,3563.519,You don’t see any Equal Protection problem there at all.
1970.5257,2,29679,james_j_cox,,3563.519,3602.661,"I see no reason why children in one state should not be able to inherit and children in another state according to the state’s legislative wisdom can inherit only if their parents say they can or cannot, but I do see something invidious in one state saying that under -- or any state saying that a -- that Japanese as was this case in Oyama versus California, that the child of an alien cannot hold property because it’s presumed to be the alien’s property and I would join with Justice Black who wanted to go further and say that not only could that child hold property but his parents should be able to hold property."
1970.5257,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3612.018,3613.402,Thank you Mr. Cox.
