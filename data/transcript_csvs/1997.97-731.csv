1997.97-731,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.678,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-731, United States v. Beggerly."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,13.831,17.154,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-731,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,95.243,108.732,"Incidentally... and I want you to keep on this vein so far as I'm concerned, but do you have to... in order to prevail, do you have to convince us both of the sovereign immunity point and of the statute of limitations point under the Quiet Title Act?"
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,108.732,114.738,"Well, they both... there are two... I have to turn to the statute of... the QTA, the Quiet Title Act for a minute."
1997.97-731,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,129.298,131.259,"Well, what if they want to set aside the settlement, or something."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,131.259,137.623,--I don't... my... our position is that the Quiet Title Act would not allow a... would not allow the settlement to be set aside.
1997.97-731,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,181.912,188.608,"--made the claim preclusion argument was the one as I was reading your brief, and I said, what is this about equitable tolling, statute of limitations?"
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,193.693,205.04,"--Well, I mean, we of course... it has to be understood in the district court the respondents relied on the quiet title action... on the Quiet Title Act not really... they didn't really want title to the land back."
1997.97-731,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,239.865,244.286,"Even apart from that, why don't you, as to damages, also have res judicata to plead?"
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,252.242,260.166,"--I have to emphasize that the reason... the Quiet Title Act is in the case only because, essentially, of a surprise that the court of appeals--"
1997.97-731,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,260.166,261.807,"No, but what's the answer to my question?"
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,261.807,272.716,"--I think that... well, I think that if we win on the first question presented, then we have those defenses to plead, but if we lose on the first question presented--"
1997.97-731,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,272.716,290.207,"But do you say you have that defense to plead not only with respect to the party in whom title has been adjudicated, but that you also have that defense to plead with respect to the amount of money that could possibly be a liability from the Government to the respondents?"
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,290.207,295.98,"--Well, again, I think that I... you know, we are here on our petition sort of taking the case as the court of appeals--"
1997.97-731,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,295.98,296.919,"Yes, but yes or no?"
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,297.75,302.315,"--I may not be understanding your question exactly, but if we--"
1997.97-731,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,302.315,307.197,"Look, Justice Ginsburg asked you why preclusion isn't your answer if you get to quiet title."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,321.255,329.39,"--Right, and my... I guess what I have to say is, it's an answer that we can give only if that judgment remains closed."
1997.97-731,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,329.39,334.365,"Well, but the judgment remains closed, I presume, because you have won on the first issue."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,334.365,334.565,Right.
1997.97-731,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,339.598,340.039,Not any more.
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,342.102,342.563,"--Well, no."
1997.97-731,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,342.563,344.446,--Res judicata can be waived.
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,344.446,347.007,I don't... I have to say I don't think we waived it.
1997.97-731,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,470.607,478.953,Is it your position the court of appeals was wrong in saying that the independent action was just really a continuation of the earlier action?
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,478.953,479.363,"Yes, it is."
1997.97-731,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,482.496,482.726,Yes.
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,487.531,487.771,Right.
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,580.672,592.112,"--Right on that point, supposing... I know it's not this case, but supposing there had been allegations of fraud here, would there need to be an independent jurisdictional basis for attacking the judgment on fraud grounds?"
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,592.112,609.941,"--Yes, because they're outside the time limit of Rule 60(b), which is 1 year for seeking relief from a final judgment based on fraud, whether intrinsic or extrinsic, as the rule specifically says, so--"
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,609.941,613.825,But the sentence describing independent actions includes fraud as a ground of relief.
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,613.825,636.919,"--Well, there may be... there may be some substantive law... for example, between private parties is one that would come to mind, where one party could seek to... could bring a lawsuit in Federal district court against another and get relief from a final judgment based on fraud, but when such an independent action is filed in Federal district court, it is just like any new lawsuit."
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,642.947,644.107,What is your authority for that?
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,644.107,646.018,What is our authority for that?
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,651.504,655.064,"Yes, but there's no pre-Kokkonen law that establishes that?"
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,655.064,656.236,"Well, I mean, we recognize--"
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.236,657.846,"I mean, Kokkonen, of course, wasn't really directed at this problem."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,657.846,658.918,--I acknowledge that.
1997.97-731,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,665.255,669.519,How about that it would undercut 60(b) entirely if you could just--
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,669.519,670.45,--I think that's right.
1997.97-731,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,670.45,676.456,"--avoid 60(b) and say, here, we... because 60(b), you don't have to establish any independent jurisdictional basis."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,676.456,676.565,Right.
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,678.688,678.909,So--
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,678.909,697.112,"--and I think it would be hard to understand why the drafters of the Federal Rules would have put in a 1-year time limit for relief from judgment, motions for relief from judgment based on fraud, among other things, and mistake, if it had... were also possible just to file a new or an independent action without invoking the--"
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,697.112,704.675,"--But then it's also puzzling why did they use the word fraud in subparagraph (3), or clause (3), and also put it in with regard to independent actions if that's just meant to duplicate?"
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,705.596,712.839,"--I think that... well, there is... I mean, I do have to... I do want to say, there is a separate concept of fraud upon the court."
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,712.839,713.069,Right.
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,713.069,716.842,"Right, and that... that is really, really bad fraud."
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,716.842,717.232,"All right, let's--"
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,717.232,717.683,"I mean, there's no other way to--"
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,717.683,718.954,--That's what I wanted to do.
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,721.227,721.507,--Right.
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,721.507,726.352,"--which doesn't involve that kind of fraud, with a case that does involve really, really bad fraud upon the court."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,726.352,726.582,Right.
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.582,727.912,And in that case--
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,727.912,727.972,Right.
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,728.223,731.325,--does there have to be an independent Federal basis for jurisdiction?
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,731.325,735.869,--I don't think that case... that case does not really involve an independent action at all.
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,736.309,739.042,"Oh, but it's in the sentence about independent action."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,739.042,750.678,"--No, it says... but you see, it says, it does not relieve a... it does not prevent a party from bringing an independent action or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court."
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,760.756,761.257,Right.
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,761.257,764.218,That is an inherent authority of the court.
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,772.383,775.996,"You know, there's been debate within the Court as to the extent of our inherent power."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,776.727,789.123,"But I think that this is a... it doesn't even... as I understand the cases under this, to be... for a court to purge itself of a fraud upon the court, it doesn't even really require a new lawsuit."
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,801.602,802.633,--Why do you think that?
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,826.19,826.979,Well--
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,826.979,833.324,"And if there was a jurisdictional problem, there was no problem, because you went to the same court and they let you in in the same court that you had the original action in."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,835.387,836.438,--I think that--
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,836.438,838.9,"So I grant you, I agree with you, I don't understand the relation to that."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,849.028,849.669,--Well... all right.
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,849.669,850.578,But maybe it does... it does gut it.
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,850.578,851.669,"I mean, first... right."
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,851.669,851.829,So what are we supposed to do?
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,851.829,862.267,"First of all let me say, although there were these independent actions in equity, they were not allowed to proceed against the sovereign under cases that we've cited in our brief."
1997.97-731,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,862.657,868.421,I thought they could proceed against whatever party was involved in the first action.
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,868.982,869.172,"--Well, all--"
1997.97-731,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,869.172,871.215,"--Didn't Missouri... what is it, Pacific Railroad--"
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,871.215,871.485,--Missouri Pacific Rail--
1997.97-731,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,871.485,872.195,--Yes.
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,872.685,875.918,"--Well, that is... I would acknowledge that that is the strongest case for the other side, but that's not--"
1997.97-731,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,875.918,877.34,"--That... to be sure, that speaks of citizenship."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,877.34,877.501,--Right.
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,898.505,899.326,"Well, suppose I thought--"
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,899.326,900.328,I want to emphasize that before I--
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,900.328,901.647,--I understand that.
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,901.647,901.858,--Right.
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,902.098,903.5,But suppose I didn't want to be technical about it--
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,903.5,903.7,Right.
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,903.7,918.771,"--and said that the whole point of these independent actions in equity was to set aside an initial judgment obtained through fraud, so if the sovereign waived immunity as to the first, they waived it as to the second, and moreover, since an action in equity, forget the statute of limitations in the statutes."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,920.189,920.39,Right.
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,920.39,920.77,It's equitable.
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,922.733,922.934,Right.
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,922.934,924.704,--that totally guts the first part.
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,924.704,924.924,Right.
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,924.924,925.565,But--
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,925.565,926.686,"Well, there is--"
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,926.686,927.798,--And it says it in the second sentence--
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,927.798,927.978,--But there is--
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,927.978,928.578,--in the rules.
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,930.822,951.676,"--Well, I think that if... looking at those cases, they really... although they are referred to as independent actions in equity they really are devices that courts of equity were trying to fashion in order to get around the problem that a court of law could not reopen its judgments after a few months, and--"
1997.97-731,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,951.676,958.479,"Well, in Missouri Pacific the second action was brought as a matter... in a matter of months, after the original decision came down from this Court, wasn't it?"
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,958.479,970.917,"--Right, and that's... and in Missouri Pacific there had been a problem because there was no longer complete diversity among the parties, and the Court said... now... said yes, you know, the parties can go forward."
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,987.648,988.509,Am I supposed to do this?
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,995.834,996.015,--Right.
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,996.426,1002.83,"--let's say, to relieve a party, so I'm supposed to imagine I'm back in the days of yesteryear, I'm back in the 19th Century."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1002.83,1003.02,Right.
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1003.02,1009.425,"I'm supposed to imagine that, and I'm supposed to imagine what would a court have done then in an independent action in equity."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1009.425,1010.426,"But the bill... all right, but the rule--"
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1010.426,1010.576,That's what it seems to tell me to do.
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1010.576,1029.971,"--But the rule also says, and I think this is very important, writs of coram nobis, coram vobis, ad ide corella, bills of review and bills in the nature of bills of review, are abolished, so I think first of all you have to make sure that it isn't anything like those, and in the advisory committee notes it says, you know, we have endeavored to list every single form of ancillary form of--"
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1029.971,1031.584,"All right, but then you're agreeing with me about how to read it."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1041.56,1042.642,--I'm not sure... I'm not sure... I'm not sure I agree with--
1997.97-731,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1042.642,1046.696,--what the court would then have held in respect to this independent action and why.
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1046.696,1049.628,--I'm not sure I agree with you that we are back in the 19th Century.
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1082.3,1101.971,"Yes, but Mr. Wolfson, if under all those rules, coram nobis or the various common law writs that were available then, if they could have been brought without a new basis of Federal jurisdiction you can't argue, I don't believe, that substituting a category of independent action for all of those limited the court's jurisdiction, because the rules are not intended to change jurisdiction."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1109.756,1111.358,And I think it's not.
1997.97-731,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1116.581,1118.203,But they're replaced by--

1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1122.788,1144.372,"--was rule 60(b)... right, and so I would say that the only way... what Rule 60(b) is intended to make clear is that the only way you can get relief from final judgment without filing a new lawsuit is to make a motion under the rules, and the advisory committee notes say the rules, the practice of the rules are intended to be complete in this regard."
1997.97-731,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1147.604,1151.966,"Mr. Wolfson, before you do, I'd just like to fasten on something extraordinary about this case."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1184.437,1205.013,"--Well, I... obviously it's difficult to... I mean, I agree with you that the court of appeals was... you know, there was something that really concerned it about the case, but I have to say, to the extent that the court of appeals might have thought there was some problem that led it to toll... thought... think that equitable tolling, for example, was proper, I have to say I disagree with it."
1997.97-731,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1362.796,1362.986,--You've mentioned the word tentative.

1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1382.42,1386.021,--The third... there was a third that was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
1997.97-731,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1394.006,1396.979,"--But there were three... two left standing, 3 and 4, right?"
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1396.979,1401.333,--There's only three... I believe there's only three causes of action in the complaint.
1997.97-731,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1407.878,1410.77,You said the... in the... the first count was dismissed?

1997.97-731,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1417.808,1420.659,"Well, I'm probably wrong."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1421.19,1431.427,"--Yes, it's at page 42a and 43a of the petition appendix, because the court said, well, even if there is a... some claim of taking here, it has to be presented to the Court of Federal Claims."
1997.97-731,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1431.427,1436.259,"--So you're telling me there was only one count left over, only one thing that wasn't dismissed."
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1436.259,1437.921,"No, everything was decided by the district court."
1997.97-731,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1451.269,1452.912,Okay.
1997.97-731,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1452.912,1482.681,"Turning last to the court of appeals decision on the merits, the respondents have argued that this Court decided Power's Heirs on the basis of an incorrect and incomplete understanding of the history of West Florida, and we disagree with their reading of that history, but we would say that even if the question is doubtful, that the Court should nonetheless adhere to its decision in Power's Heirs, which was a controlling decision of Federal law about the interests of the United States obtained under the Louisiana Purchase."
1997.97-731,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1515.002,1516.223,"Very well, Mr. Wolfson."

1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,1603.101,1603.561,--Excuse me.
1997.97-731,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1630.168,1632.581,"Well, maybe you shouldn't in adversary litigation."
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,1643.869,1646.06,"Certainly not, Your Honor."
1997.97-731,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1646.06,1650.992,"Well, why is it here, if there is no knowledgeable fraud on the part of the Government?"
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,1650.992,1657.247,"What happened here, in my mind, is similar to what happens in discovery in all cases."

1997.97-731,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1712.835,1716.908,He wasn't... he wasn't misrepresent... wasn't intentionally misrepresenting.
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,1716.908,1717.159,Right.

1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,1793.888,1794.098,Right.
1997.97-731,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1803.175,1810.389,"But in the record are they cited somewhere, because I want to look and see what it is that the Government said that you said was a misrepresentation."
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,1810.389,1813.224,"Your Honor, we have cited in our brief Mr. Dorasavage's testimony."
1997.97-731,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1814.072,1815.173,That's what I quoted here.
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,1816.845,1817.316,"--All right, sir."
1997.97-731,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1820.218,1820.418,"Yes, it is."
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,1820.418,1822.809,--it's that representation that they did rely upon.
1997.97-731,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1822.809,1823.49,Fine.
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,1838.791,1847.215,"Well, the misrepresentation is that there and in the briefs the Government indicated the grant didn't exist when in fact it did exist."

1997.97-731,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1971.583,1976.635,You say you can come in and reopen the original quiet title action?
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,1976.635,1977.436,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-731,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1977.436,1979.888,Without any time limit on doing that?

1997.97-731,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2126.684,2129.255,"So wouldn't that make sense, the difference between the two?"
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2159.346,2172.225,"Your Honor, it's curious to me that you can go either to a separate court or into the court that rendered the action, and I frankly do not understand why you may go into a circuit court as well as an original court."

1997.97-731,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2233.875,2234.676,--and involved fraud--
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2234.676,2235.506,That's true.
1997.97-731,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2235.506,2237.158,--or misrepresentation.
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2237.158,2237.419,Right.
1997.97-731,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2237.419,2271.36,"Now, did you find a case where an independent action was permitted that involved a fraud or a misrepresentation, let us say as... I want to say as little or trivial... I don't mean to be pejorative, but as small as the one that seems to be at issue here, but nonetheless the court said, I know it was an inadvertent misrepresentation, I know it was somebody who was looking for a needle in a haystack, I know it isn't much of a fraud, but still you can bring your independent action?"
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2275.413,2276.155,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-731,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2276.155,2276.635,What was it?

1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2378.26,2389.479,"Your Honor, the intensity of the investigation slowed down some after the judgment was entered but did increase again, or did recontinue afterwards."

1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2510.258,2527.69,"Well, the point is the Government had tried to buy the Beggerly property for several years, and negotiated with them and made offers to buy it, fully recognized their title, with the exception of their ultimate determination that there was not a valid disposal out of the Federal Government."
1997.97-731,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2537.384,2539.097,But why was it apparent?
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2545.451,2549.502,"--The Government did have an opportunity to question that, Your Honor."

1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2560.679,2571.859,"--Yes, Your Honor, and of course the same thing in the Fifth Circuit, and I might add, the attack that's brought concerning Galvez' authority was brought for the first time in this Court, something we objected to."
1997.97-731,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2580.274,2586.477,"But the district court denied you summary judgment, and that's what the court of appeals granted you, and that's what I don't understand."
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2605.76,2613.365,"Your Honor, it's because the issues that were presented to the district court and to the Fifth Circuit were purely legal issues."

1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2698.551,2698.991,--I think--

1997.97-731,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2706.725,2707.546,Why wouldn't you have to give it back?
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2727.87,2737.827,"--The Government paid that money... and this is documented by the letter of Steve Herman, which is in the Joint Appendix, in order to settle the litigation."
1997.97-731,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2737.827,2741.849,"So if they had to settle the litigation, why didn't you have to settle the litigation?"
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2741.849,2756.478,And they made the choice not to... they made the representation that they were doing this for the purpose of resolving the litigation and not... I'm avoiding your question.
1997.97-731,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2767.867,2775.064,"But if we send it back and you win, wouldn't we have to say, you asked to reopen this, very well, it's reopened?"
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2775.064,2783.502,"If we... I think that would be an issue the district court could take up, is whether or not they had the right to pursue repayment of that money, yes, sir."
1997.97-731,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2854.097,2861.911,"Well now, you... is the proposition that you're now stating, is that consistent with the Power's Heirs decision?"
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2861.911,2866.984,"The Power's Heirs decision did not reach that issue of law, Your Honor."
1997.97-731,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2872.477,2875.261,But I don't think you've answered the question I asked you.
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2875.261,2875.58,--I'm sorry.
1997.97-731,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2875.58,2881.255,"Which was, is the proposition that you're now maintaining consistent with the Power's Heirs decision?"
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2881.255,2884.656,"Yes, Your Honor, I think it is consistent with the Power's Heirs decision."
1997.97-731,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2886.739,2886.989,Yes.
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2886.989,2891.971,"--The other point is, it's a point that was not presented in the Power's Heirs case."
1997.97-731,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2913.994,2918.087,And therefore your alleged predecessor in title did not have title.
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2918.087,2924.643,"Well, but this was Power's Heirs, and that's a different document from the document we're dealing with, Your Honor."
1997.97-731,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2932.548,2942.085,"No, but isn't the crucial point that the issue is the authority of the Governor to make the grant, and the grant in Power's and the grant in this case were made on the same day?"
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2944.265,2956.083,"They... the grants were made on the same day, Your Honor, but I believe a reading of the Power's Heirs case indicates that the court had questionable evidence before it as to whether or not there even was a grant--"
1997.97-731,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2956.083,2957.095,Maybe it did have questionable evidence--
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,2975.807,2984.875,"--Well, the court did say that Galvez did not have authority to make that grant on that day."
1997.97-731,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3001.894,3008.75,"But that... but the decision turned... or, at least, it concluded that Galvez didn't have the authority to make that grant, did it not?"
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,3008.75,3012.401,"It stated that in the opinion, Your Honor, no question about that."
1997.97-731,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3013.312,3020.567,Then it seems to me that the position you're maintaining isn't consistent with the decision in Power's Heirs.
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,3020.567,3029.584,"Arguably not, Your Honor, but I think you can distinguish it in this manner, that there were other... I don't think that--"
1997.97-731,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3029.584,3042.31,"Is this something we want to do in a case involving real property title, where I think the Solicitor General is right, that there stare decisis is regarded as the most... at its greatest peak?"
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,3042.31,3071.969,"--I do not believe that this... the Court's affirmance of the Fifth Circuit ruling and therefore finding the validity of the Boudreau grant would do violence to titles, and the reason is, Your Honor, that this... we're talking about a period in the late 18th Century and the Government raises a specter that we'll have competing titles out there and that the Government may have titles based upon the Louisiana Purchase and authority it gained, which is in conflict with the Spanish titles."
1997.97-731,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3077.633,3086.358,But it still undermines the principle to say that this... it will just have a limited effect because other factors historically soon came into play.
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,3099.198,3132.8,"I understand that rule of law, Your Honor, and I understand the reason behind it, but I... my statement is, it is a matter of fact there will not be any conflict with any titles caused by ruling that the Boudreau grant was a valid grant, because adverse possession, whether it's the Government's title, and you've got a national forest, or museum, or whatever it may have on the land, adverse possession will clear up any problems with that, and if there's conflicting, theoretically conflicting private titles, adverse possession again would clean those up."
1997.97-731,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3204.519,3205.84,I think not.
1997.97-731,1,23294,ernest_g_taylor_jr,,3206.962,3207.162,All right.
1997.97-731,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3207.413,3207.914,--Mr. Taylor.
1997.97-731,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3210.375,3212.659,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.97-731,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3223.488,3225.681,"Well, and it also requires negligence on the part--"
1997.97-731,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3225.681,3226.069,Right.
1997.97-731,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3226.069,3228.412,--the absence of negligence on the part of the moving party.
1997.97-731,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3228.412,3228.552,Yes.
1997.97-731,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3228.592,3241.602,"Do you think we have the authority in this... based on the issues that are before us, to rule in your favor based on the fact that the misrepresentation is not sufficient to set aside the judgment?"
1997.97-731,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3241.602,3246.525,--On the facts--
1997.97-731,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3246.525,3247.896,Your brief asks that we remand.
1997.97-731,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3247.896,3247.996,--Right.
1997.97-731,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3275.244,3277.567,Was there a ruling on laches on--
1997.97-731,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3277.567,3277.787,--Yes.
1997.97-731,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3277.787,3278.266,--the independent action?
1997.97-731,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3278.266,3278.887,"Yes, there was, Your Honor."
1997.97-731,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3295.64,3296.709,Can you go back to Justice Kennedy's question?
1997.97-731,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3296.709,3296.91,Yes.
1997.97-731,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3296.91,3310.88,"I was thinking, maybe if we're trying to reconcile independent action with the first part of the rule, you would do it by saying, independent action of those unusual egregious frauds, et cetera, but you say, if I thought that I couldn't say that here."
1997.97-731,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3311.788,3313.2,"On the facts of this case, yes."
1997.97-731,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3313.2,3314.61,As to whether it is egregious?
1997.97-731,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3314.61,3330.141,"As to whether it is egregious, and because the... it's the district court that is supposed to... it's the district court that's supposed to make an evaluation, and then when it looked at the case it said, you know, I don't find any evidence here of fraud or mistake that would warrant setting aside the judgment."
1997.97-731,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3330.141,3332.402,"But I mean, is... can we take certain facts... I mean, they have the record here."
1997.97-731,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3338.427,3355.647,"Well, of course, we... I mean, I think if it went back to the district court, we would move for summary judgment, probably, on the grounds that there was no evidence of fraud or mistake on... and so on the merits the independent action should not go forward."
1997.97-731,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3392.652,3393.233,"Thank you, Mr. Wolfson."
