2006.06-102,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.309,"We'll hear argument first today in case 06-102, Sinochem International versus Malaysia International Shipping Corporation."
2006.06-102,0,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,11.246,13.979,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-102,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,102.038,104.661,Just on the second point.
2006.06-102,0,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,154.828,160.92,"Well, I think there are two components to your question, Justice Kennedy, and let me see if I can answer both of them."
2006.06-102,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,178.084,185.88,What about the ruling that this would be governed by Chinese law and that the Chinese court is the best forum to consider that?
2006.06-102,0,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,192.109,197.171,--Let me... that was the second part of your question that I was going to try to answer.
2006.06-102,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,240.043,255.366,"Do you know any case, Mr. Castanias, where there has been a forum non conveniens dismissal in favor of a foreign forum where the plaintiff has then attempted to go into a different--"
2006.06-102,0,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,259.692,265.769,"And by U.S. court you mean Federal court like Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, or perhaps a state court as well?"
2006.06-102,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,265.769,266.704,Either one.
2006.06-102,0,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,266.704,275.169,"Well, I think I have seen cases, and I can't cite them to you as I stand here right now, where litigants have tried to go to a state court."
2006.06-102,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,278.106,299.895,You... you were urging that this is a threshold issue and it has nothing to do with the merits; but there is an argument that the existence of personal jurisdiction or not might have some bearing on the forum non conveniens evaluation.
2006.06-102,0,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,299.895,314.029,"In some cases, I suppose that could be true, Justice Ginsburg; but the point of our rule is that the only issue presented by this case is that of Federal court power."
2006.06-102,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,350.123,350.295,Uh-huh.
2006.06-102,0,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,350.295,363.791,"With regard to the body of this Court's decisions, we cited in our briefs cases like Leroy against Great Western, which holds that a Federal court can decide venue before deciding personal jurisdiction."
2006.06-102,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,520.039,522.179,One question that doesn't even have to do with the issue before us.
2006.06-102,0,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,532.911,535.456,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear the last part of your question."
2006.06-102,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,535.456,537.22,There was an agreement to arbitrate.
2006.06-102,0,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,552.497,564.6,"My understanding, Justice Ginsburg, and this is a vague recollection from one aspect of the record, is that the arbitration clause was held not to apply in this case."
2006.06-102,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,564.6,566.35,Thank you.
2006.06-102,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,566.35,570.301,That's not an exercise of law declaring authority on the merits?
2006.06-102,0,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,570.301,571.941,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2006.06-102,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,580.11,582.938,"In other words, the district court didn't hold that it didn't apply?"
2006.06-102,0,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,582.938,583.67,"--Yes, correct."
2006.06-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,624.452,631.151,It might have been the allegedly defrauded Chinese court that found that the arbitration clause did not apply?
2006.06-102,0,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,631.151,632.073,I'm sorry.
2006.06-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,633.604,640.506,It might have been the allegedly defrauded Chinese court which found that the arbitration clause did not apply.
2006.06-102,0,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,640.506,641.538,--That... it may be.
2006.06-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,643.787,646.879,I don't see how that court would have gotten into the act unless that was the case.
2006.06-102,0,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,646.879,649.816,"Again, we'll reserve the remainder of our time for rebuttal."
2006.06-102,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,649.816,650.863,"Thank you, Counsel."
2006.06-102,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,657.469,668.075,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-102,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,785.917,802.284,But the Gulf Oil case does say that a forum non conveniens dismissal presupposes that the forum is one in which there's personal jurisdiction and one of proper venue.
2006.06-102,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,805.236,807.298,"That's, that's right, Your Honor."
2006.06-102,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,846.518,847.938,"It was not, not--"
2006.06-102,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,884.737,885.394,"--That... that's right, Your Honor."
2006.06-102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,916.27,928.562,"Do I correctly understand your argument to be that, that in this case it happened to be the doubt about personal jurisdiction rather than subject matter jurisdiction but you would make the same argument if it were a doubt about subject matter jurisdiction?"
2006.06-102,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,928.562,929.874,"--That's right, we would."
2006.06-102,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,969.436,971.295,Can a district court do both?
2006.06-102,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,982.4,984.477,--I think they could do both.
2006.06-102,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,987.772,990.819,"But not if there's, I presume, if there's an appeal."
2006.06-102,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,990.819,994.88,"If... if... an appeal, the court could, the court of appeals could affirm on either ground."
2006.06-102,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1044.984,1060.416,"In Martin, in the hypothetical where this case is dismissed for forum non conveniens and then they go to another Federal district court, could the second Federal district court say this has already been heard by the first district court; I'm not getting into it?"
2006.06-102,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1067.569,1077.737,"--Well, I think the second court would have to at the very least ascertain that circumstances had not changed or that there weren't relevant difference of facts."
2006.06-102,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1083.454,1084.329,"Now, why is that?"
2006.06-102,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1108.567,1115.721,"It is in the nature of a discretionary determination, as Your Honor says, that... that different judges could reach different decisions."
2006.06-102,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1199.983,1233.502,"Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, because your time is running out, there is a question about a court without personal jurisdiction dismissing on forum non conveniens ground, and that is, it's common, as you know, to condition forum non conveniens dismissals on the defendant's undertaking that the defendant will not raise the statute of limitations and other conditions."
2006.06-102,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1243.888,1268.049,"Our understanding of a conditional dismissal in this circumstance is that the dismissing court is explaining its understanding of the world, and that... and facts as they bear upon its analysis, such as is the defendant subject to jurisdiction in a foreign forum."
2006.06-102,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1297.023,1298.412,"Thank you, Counsel."
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,1318.529,1321.95,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-102,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.486,1479.043,"Well, that only proved that an appellate court can affirm on grounds other than the ground relied upon by the district court, even if the ground relied upon by the district court is also a valid ground."
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,1492.913,1495.912,"Justice Scalia, I think it's appropriate."
2006.06-102,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1510.812,1513.561,"Well, you found one appellate court that chose to do it that way."
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,1521.385,1523.556,"--Well, I tend to agree with you on that point as well--"
2006.06-102,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1523.556,1523.775,Yes.
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,1523.775,1524.806,--with it.
2006.06-102,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1544.048,1545.532,May I ask this question.
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,1570.491,1585.203,"--I think it is, Justice Stevens, and I think the Court would address that by saying certainly on the negligent misrepresentation claim at this stage the record indicates that there was a ruling in China, but the appellate window is still open."
2006.06-102,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1591.092,1598.776,"There couldn't be any question about the alternate forum taking jurisdiction here, because it, in fact, had."
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,1628.999,1641.493,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg; but as practical matter, with the resolution of this case by this Court we would certainly have to start the process, whatever ruling this Court finds, all over again."
2006.06-102,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1654.691,1655.363,I'm sorry.
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,1667.39,1669.185,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-102,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1669.185,1679.119,Your claim was that a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court in connection with the arrest of this vessel and the ensuing proceedings?
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,1679.119,1681.29,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.06-102,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1681.29,1689.427,"Now, why in the world should a court in the United States get involved in determining whether a fraud was committed on a Chinese court?"
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,1689.427,1700.438,"Justice Ginsburg, we believe it was appropriate for U.S. review because of the balancing of the maritime commerce that occurred in the case because of the bills of ladings."
2006.06-102,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1720.79,1725.49,American law to determine whether a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court?
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,1736.142,1750.994,"That would have been a concern, Justice Ginsburg, except that issue was brought up expressly before the Chinese court; and if I may refer you to page 18 of the joint appendix, the Chinese court ruled that, quote,"
2006.06-102,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1773.128,1783.952,"Well, that was a very polite way of the Chinese court saying: We don't care what the United States court is doing; we've got this case, we've got the ship, and we're going to adjudicate it; and it doesn't matter."
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,1793.806,1802.959,"And I agree with you, Your Honor, except it is the only indication in the record that there is some foreign nation that has expressed an opinion on this."
2006.06-102,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1856.983,1874.43,"Well, why... I mean, I assume that in deciding forum non conveniens... that there is an inconvenient forum, the court making that judgment would assume that there was personal jurisdiction and would simply say, you know, put that into the mix."
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,1905.762,1912.306,"Well, for Malaysia International the desirable outcome would be upholding the Third Circuit opinion."
2006.06-102,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1915.663,1921.192,"Right, and the district court at best for you, at best, finds personal jurisdiction."
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,1943.23,1949.29,"And Justice Scalia, I concede that, but you would also have the ability of the defendant to waive personal jurisdiction."
2006.06-102,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1956.022,1960.473,Why would a defendant that has moved to dismiss for forum non conveniens waive jurisdiction?
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,1985.307,1993.866,"--That is correct, Your Honor, and then I would have to look for an evaluation of forum non conveniens that was favorable to the client."
2006.06-102,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2000.269,2004.003,"Yeah, but discovery for its own sake is no fun."
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,2025.228,2027.244,That's one possibility.
2006.06-102,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2076.27,2097.308,"I guess we should ask the other side, but I think I know what their answer will be, whether if the Court does dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens without first addressing personal jurisdiction, it must assume the existence of personal jurisdiction?"
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,2099.167,2100.933,"--I think it has to, Your Honor."
2006.06-102,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2100.933,2101.603,"Yes, I agree."
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,2101.603,2102.29,The Seventh Circuit case--
2006.06-102,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2102.29,2102.822,I agree.
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,2115.958,2124.172,"--But there is the possibility of a case happening, as it happened in the In Re Bridgestone case, which was a Seventh Circuit case."
2006.06-102,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2150.866,2158.252,"But we know that that's not going to happen here, because the Chinese court has adjudicated the case."
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,2158.252,2161.141,"Not on this issue, Your Honor, and actually not on the bills of lading issue."
2006.06-102,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2175.262,2185.507,"We're dealing with, because it's a foreign nation, not the codified forum non conveniens that's in 1404 and 1406."
2006.06-102,2,16188,ann_michele_g_higgins,,2238.656,2252.823,"I think, Your Honor, in that case, it's... as the doctrine developed, the difference lies in the statutory framework of the 1404 versus the judicially created version of the forum non conveniens."
2006.06-102,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2306.301,2307.317,"Thank you, Ms. Higgins."
2006.06-102,3,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2309.785,2319.953,"Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has further questions, we'll rest on the argument given in the briefs."
2006.06-102,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2319.953,2320.937,"Thank you, counsel."
