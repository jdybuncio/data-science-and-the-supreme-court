1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,50.554,"We'll hear arguments next in 1439, Hughes against Oklahoma."
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,59.878,65.519,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-1439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,174.368,179.032,"Mr. Helton, I take it you are relying solely on the Commerce Clause?"
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,179.032,180.521,"Yes, Your Honor, no other."
1978.77-1439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,180.521,183.655,You are not relying on the Privileges and Immunities Clause or anything else.
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,184.157,185.11,That is right.
1978.77-1439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,185.11,187.258,You put your case in the Commerce Clause?
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,187.258,188.684,Yes sir.
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,284.389,316.074,"What if Oklahoma passed a statute that had as its preamble or recital that the supply of buffalo if they have any or elk if they have any being limited, there could only be one taken by any person within a certain limited season and none could be taken outside of the State?"
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,316.074,316.712,Alright sir.
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,337.529,338.189,Fine.
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,338.189,352.602,The difference sir in this case and the supposed case that you gave me is the party here complaining is not the party with the right of the access.
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,370.499,380.869,"But under this particular statute that before us now there is no prohibition against his buying, but there is a prohibition against his taking them out of the state, is there not?"
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,380.869,381.638,That is right sir.
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,381.638,388.501,How do you distinguish that from taking elk out of the states?
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,388.501,421.66,"The difference between the right to take in my judgment is the State very likely in fact I think without question, the State has and is properly exercising its police power when it controls the access to its wildlife as distinguished from controlling the right to, that is prohibiting the right to transport."
1978.77-1439,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,436.149,448.633,"Well so that, under the law you may commercialize with -- was natural minnows as long as you transport and sell them inside the State."
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,456.575,462.969,In my -- I don't think there is any question about -- you are asking about the right of Oklahoma to limit that.
1978.77-1439,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,462.969,477.497,"No, I am asking if I'm a dealer in minnows, I can buy natural minnows or I can go seine them myself and sell them to anybody I want to inside the state?"
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,477.497,478.511,You are right.
1978.77-1439,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,478.511,482.676,And transport them anywhere I want to inside the State for sale?
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,482.676,482.978,Yes sir.
1978.77-1439,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,482.978,486.353,But I can't transport them across the boundary for sale?
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,486.353,487.027,Correct.
1978.77-1439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,487.027,491.467,"Or he can destroy them if you chooses, burn them up?"
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,491.467,492.454,I am sorry sir.
1978.77-1439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,492.454,498.204,I say or he can destroy them if he chooses or burn them up as long as he does it within the state of Oklahoma?
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,498.204,502.081,That would be right.
1978.77-1439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,586.159,592.492,"But that regulates, doesn't it, that one section that you just referred to?"
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,592.492,596.27,"It does sir, but and I don't disagree with it."
1978.77-1439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,625.56,635.515,You say then that Oklahoma could prohibit any sort of commercial dealing in natural minnows?
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,635.515,648.393,"I believe they can sir, provided, provided that they make the requisite necessary finding that's the basis of their exercising their police power."
1978.77-1439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,648.393,655.731,"Well, I thought the police power is always presumed to have been properly exercised unless your state --"
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,655.731,657.02,States very seldom --
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,657.02,658.134,I don't understand it.
1978.77-1439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,660.803,668.377,"Well, aren't all state laws presumed constitutional?"
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,668.377,690.644,"I am aware of the utterances to that effect, but I also I am aware that wherever a law shows on its face for example and refutes that presumption, then the presumption is refused."
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,848.107,852.54,Could they put a limit on how many could be transported over the state line?
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,852.54,854.741,"They certainly could in my opinion, yes sir."
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,854.741,859.992,Haven't they done so indirectly here?
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,859.992,860.403,No sir.
1978.77-1439,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,875.934,878.196,Texoma I assume it is called.
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,878.196,878.606,The part of the lake --
1978.77-1439,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,878.606,880.156,The lake is is called Texoma.
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,880.156,884.003,"Yes sir, that's the name of it Your honor, it sure is."
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,884.523,891.366,"But what was the purpose, what do you suggest was the purpose of the three dozen limit?"
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,891.366,893.281,To take care of lake Texoma.
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,893.281,894.062,Well.
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,894.062,895.627,"In other words, I'm a Texan and I --"
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,895.627,898.066,Is there anything in the statute about that?
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,898.066,898.645,I beg your pardon.
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,898.645,901.287,Anything in the statute about that?
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,901.287,903.592,"No, sir, no."
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,903.592,908.719,What do you suggest on its face the three dozen limits implies or suggests?
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,908.719,911.395,"Well, if the --"
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,911.395,912.363,You want to hold down.
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,912.363,916.553,There really isn't anything from the law that we could tell anything Your Honor.
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,916.553,925.492,"Isn't it the same kind of limitation that you put, that you can only take six trout or five pheasants or whatever?"
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,925.492,927.926,"Well, I feel this way that --"
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,927.926,933.701,Isn't it a conservation measure?
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,933.701,938.476,I'm unable to read a conservation measure in the three dozen.
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,938.476,949.846,"Well, isn't three dozen about what you might mean for a day of fishing, to catch whatever limits Oklahoma has."
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,955.432,967.787,"Well, my trouble sir is I fish too much down there and I can understand the relationship of three dozen to us local boys that fish now --"
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,967.787,968.074,You don't have –-
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,968.074,970.168,Now that's not in this record and I understand that.
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,970.168,971.901,You don't really need it --
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,971.901,972.848,Well to me --
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,972.848,973.819,More than three dozen in a day do you?
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,973.819,975.532,It is impertinent sir.
1978.77-1439,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,994.375,1000.57,"Mr. Helton I didn't understand, but I guess I'm just stupid, but what is the reference to lake Texoma?"
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,1001.695,1002.866,Alright sir.
1978.77-1439,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.631,1010.258,Right.
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,1010.258,1031.852,"So consequently, I think the legislature had in mind, if a Texas fisherman came over into Oklahoma to buy him some minnows and does go back on the Texas side of the lake to fish without this exception, he can be a violator of this law."
1978.77-1439,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.852,1035.173,"Well, why don't you make him fish on the Oklahoma side of the lake you know that."
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,1035.173,1037.673,Oh that's terrific.
1978.77-1439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1042.944,1052.405,"Of course, if they want to make him fish on the Oklahoma side of the lake they would have no exception at all?"
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,1052.405,1061.471,"If I listen to you sir, you're meaning to infer that -- if they wanted to leave the three dozen exception acts --"
1978.77-1439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1061.471,1061.986,They'd force him to fish.
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,1061.986,1066.412,The effect would be the Texan people fish on the Oklahoma side.
1978.77-1439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1171.204,1174.579,"Mr. Helton, could I ask you one question before you sit down."
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,1183.483,1192.432,"Well, sir, I -- no sir I'm really, yes and no, if I may."
1978.77-1439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1253.335,1257.61,"But it makes the Oklahoma Statute narrower than the one in here, doesn't it?"
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,1257.61,1258.532,Sir I am sorry.
1978.77-1439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1258.532,1262.666,Doesn't it make the Oklahoma Statute narrower than the one in Geer?
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,1262.666,1264.034,Narrower?
1978.77-1439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1264.034,1270.853,Because Oklahoma Statute regulates less conduct than the Connecticut Statute did in Geer?
1978.77-1439,0,39433,robert_m_helton,,1270.853,1277.18,"Well sir to me the Geer statute, the emphasis is on the initial right to take."
1978.77-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1340.923,1349.336,Mr. Bruce?
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1349.336,1353.401,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1978.77-1439,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1512.698,1518.588,What in your opinion Mr. Attorney General is the justification for the Oklahoma statute?
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1518.588,1521.311,"As a conservation measure, Your Honor."
1978.77-1439,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1521.311,1534.571,"Well, do you agree with counsel on the other side that a Texas resident could go into Oklahoma and buy minnows and burn them up in front of the commercial establishment from which he bought them?"
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1534.571,1535.133,I would agree if there is no statutory prohibition.
1978.77-1439,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1535.133,1537.282,That there's no wildlife conservation.
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1537.282,1541.966,"No, sir, the statute does not address that, that possibility notion."
1978.77-1439,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1541.966,1549.733,"Well, if that's a possibility, why they would be characterized as a conservation measure?"
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1549.733,1564.518,"Well, as argued by the appellant below in which the state concedes the only viable commercial use for minnows is as bait for other fish."
1978.77-1439,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1587.758,1591.359,"For ducks and birds and a lot of others too, don't they--?"
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1591.359,1591.598,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1439,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1591.598,1593.68,-- live off of minnows.
1978.77-1439,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1593.68,1602.421,"Isn't that interest served just as much on the Texas side, of the lake that straddles the state boundary?"
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1602.421,1604.681,Are you speaking of Lake Texoma Mr. Justice Blackmun?
1978.77-1439,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1604.681,1607.057,Whatever the lake is?
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1607.057,1610.602,"Yes, I think that interest would serve Texas as well as Oklahoma."
1978.77-1439,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1610.602,1619.496,Wouldn't it serve just as much on a lake ten miles inside Texas as Oklahoma lake?
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1619.496,1622.239,I am not sure I understand your question sir.
1978.77-1439,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1622.239,1642.344,"Well, suppose that Mr. Hughes here took his minnows and sold them to Texas fishermen on a lake ten miles inside the Texas boundary, isn't that natural preservation purpose just as well served there, or are you restricting it entirely to Oklahoma nature?"
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1642.344,1668.927,"Well, I would concede that certainly that would serve Texas interests, but such wholesale exploitation of minnows, natural minnows in Oklahoma streams, if Oklahoma permitted the export, it would require Oklahoma to not only keep track of what's happening, but to make sure that additional minnows were added to make up for those which were exported."
1978.77-1439,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1668.927,1674.827,"But at the same time though, I could go into Oklahoma and buy them and bring them up."
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1674.827,1675.271,Well --
1978.77-1439,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1675.271,1678.003,And there is no statute that would prevent me from doing so?
1978.77-1439,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1678.003,1684.865,Maybe the next legislature counsel may take that into account and make a standard prohibition?
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1684.865,1692.543,"Well sir, we've never had that type of problem in Oklahoma?[Laughter]"
1978.77-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1692.543,1696.411,I doubt if you will either.
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1696.411,1721.136,Now one another case citied by the appellant the City of Philadelphia versus New Jersey of course a recent case by this Court regarding a dispute between New Jersey and other states regarding the land -- for use of landfill sites.
1978.77-1439,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1738.169,1742.653,Also the subject of a commerce wasn't wildlife?
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1742.653,1743.323,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1439,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1743.323,1745.486,The Geer case didn't have anything to do with that case?
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1745.486,1759.605,"Yes sir and as I pointed out in my brief or hopefully I pointed out in my brief that wildlife is a unique area of law, and that the state has special interest in preserving the wildlife."
1978.77-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1759.605,1770.589,"So you -- do you think in serving that in you can permit commercialization with the same natural minnows within the state, but prevent their export?"
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1770.589,1771.842,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1771.842,1775.343,Just as a way of limiting the take?
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1775.343,1779.187,A way of conservation yes Mr. Justice White.
1978.77-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1779.187,1784.538,Even though there are no limits on the amount or number of minnows that your own people can take?
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1784.538,1793.653,I might say that I believe other states do use the possession limit as a means of protecting their interest as an advice to --
1978.77-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1793.653,1804.408,"Anybody, any out of staters who come to Oklahoma, they are free to buy minnows and use them in Oklahoma waters."
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1804.408,1806.548,Yes Mr. Justice White they are.
1978.77-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.548,1818.564,Your Oklahoma supply people are -- then have -- they have the exclusive on the sale of naturally seined minnows?
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1818.564,1820.274,"Well, they are licensed by the state, yes sir."
1978.77-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1820.274,1820.757,Yeah.
1978.77-1439,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1820.757,1826.832,"Well, there is no prohibition against buying minnows in Texas and bringing them into Oklahoma and using them as a bait, is there?"
1978.77-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1826.832,1830.889,There is a prohibition on buying Oklahoma minnows?
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1830.889,1834.244,"Well, that's the focus of our statute in issue here."
1978.77-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1838.032,1840.158,Now we got -- what's there about that?
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1840.158,1842.159,But that's not the focus of the inquiry here.
1978.77-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1842.159,1844.795,But what about it then?
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1850.091,1852.13,The statute provides a procedure for that.
1978.77-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1852.13,1853.021,For the licensing?
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1853.021,1854.464,Yes sir.
1978.77-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1854.464,1859.343,You don't object to commercial raising of minnows and taking them?
1978.77-1439,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1859.343,1860.219,No.
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1860.219,1863.996,"Commercial hatchery of minnows, no Mr. Justice Marshall."
1978.77-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1863.996,1870.562,You don't object to people taking them and seining them either do you as such?
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1870.562,1871.141,No sir.
1978.77-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1871.141,1875.394,Because this man here was a professional (Inaudible).
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1880.193,1881.356,That's correct.
1978.77-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1881.356,1890.573,"So If you are allowed that unlimited, how are you preserving wildlife or protecting wildlife –"
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1890.573,1892.0,The very –
1978.77-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1892.0,1893.762,-- the unlimited.
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1893.762,1894.249,Alright sir.
1978.77-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1894.249,1896.989,"The taking is unlimited, right?"
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1896.989,1898.35,That's correct.
1978.77-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1898.35,1900.678,And sold it off.
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1900.678,1902.026,"As to the number taken, no sir."
1978.77-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1902.026,1903.481,Yes sir.
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1903.481,1917.022,"Mr. Justice Marshall in response to your inquiry, the -- it's true that Oklahoma has no numerical limits on the actual taking of minnows from its natural streams."
1978.77-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1947.247,1959.098,"Supposed they were returned to the streams in a state above Oklahoma, wouldn't they in turn return to Oklahoma?"
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1959.098,1964.571,"Well, if it adjoined, if the stream ran into Oklahoma, yes sir, conceivably they would."
1978.77-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1964.571,1967.853,So that's not the only point.
1978.77-1439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1967.853,1975.054,"Mr. Bruce when they returned to the streams as bait, their life expectancy isn't very long.[Laughter]"
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1975.054,1978.805,"Well, Mr. Justice Stevens I won't debate."
1978.77-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1981.434,1985.901,The minnow's life expectancy isn't the longest anyhow?
1978.77-1439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1985.901,1998.325,"Would you take the position that Oklahoma could have a statute that said that any fish caught in Oklahoma shall be consumed in Oklahoma, isn't that what the statute, with respect to one time?"
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,1998.325,1999.574,"Yes, yes."
1978.77-1439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1999.574,2003.894,"So they could say any fish caught here have to be consumed, cannot be shipped out of state?"
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,2004.904,2006.826,Yes.
1978.77-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.826,2008.603,Just like Geer?
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,2008.603,2012.341,Yes sir.
1978.77-1439,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2012.341,2039.225,"We are not – we were discussing in response to some questions the fact there is no limit on how much you can – what quantity of natural minnows can be seined within the state, but the only purpose, the rational purpose of seining within the state would be for a dealer to sell them under that three dozen limit to other fishermen is that not so?"
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,2042.852,2045.925,"For recreational purposes, no Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-1439,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2045.925,2055.793,"-- they're not edible in that sense, and will be pretty expensive fertilizer, you would only be seining them to probably to sell them three dozen at a time to fishermen?"
1978.77-1439,1,17481,bill_j_bruce,,2055.793,2057.936,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1439,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2086.402,2088.552,"Do you any further, Mr. Helton?"
1978.77-1439,2,39433,robert_m_helton,,2088.552,2113.684,"Your Honor, I'm just -- in answer to Mr. Justice White's question to counsel in Section 4-1159(A) it provides, “No person may ship or transport minnows for sale into this state from an outside source without having first procured a license for such from the Director."
1978.77-1439,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2121.295,2122.791,Without a license.
1978.77-1439,2,39433,robert_m_helton,,2122.791,2128.821,"And you can't get one, now let's talk about minnow dealer license and you can't get a minnow dealer's license."
1978.77-1439,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.821,2129.371,They just --
1978.77-1439,2,39433,robert_m_helton,,2129.371,2131.891,-- unless you are a resident of Oklahoma.
1978.77-1439,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2131.891,2132.364,Alright.
1978.77-1439,2,39433,robert_m_helton,,2132.364,2142.032,So I am pointing out to you that nobody can come into Oklahoma to fish and bring their minnows into Oklahoma.
1978.77-1439,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2142.032,2154.024,"And so no out of state minnow dealer, fellows who would like to sell you the fishing equipment can send you any minnows from outside the state for two reasons."
1978.77-1439,2,39433,robert_m_helton,,2156.706,2163.349,And then of course for an outsider that wanted to bring minnows into Oklahoma --
1978.77-1439,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.349,2164.237,Can't get the license.
1978.77-1439,2,39433,robert_m_helton,,2164.237,2166.704,"-- to feed the fish in Oklahoma, couldn't do it."
1978.77-1439,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2166.704,2167.64,Yes.
1978.77-1439,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2167.64,2170.586,Well could you read that language again Mr. Helton.
1978.77-1439,2,39433,robert_m_helton,,2184.58,2194.938,"“No person may ship or transport minnows for sale” you were right sir, yes sir I am sorry sir you can do it"
1978.77-1439,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2194.938,2196.615,I may tempt to bring my minnows into Oklahoma.
1978.77-1439,2,39433,robert_m_helton,,2196.615,2197.585,"Yes sir, okay you are right Mr. Justice --"
1978.77-1439,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2197.585,2198.726,As long as he goes into --
1978.77-1439,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2198.726,2203.95,That's a great relief to Mr. Justice White.[Laughter]
1978.77-1439,2,39433,robert_m_helton,,2203.95,2205.761,Yeah.
1978.77-1439,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2206.942,2207.655,Thank you gentlemen.
