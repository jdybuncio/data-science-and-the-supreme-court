1972.71-1623,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,40.061,"We’ll hear arguments next in number 71-1623, Bullock against Weiser."
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,42.439,45.602,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1623,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,484.951,486.718,The elections Mr. Black were held under --
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,486.718,487.325,Under state plan.
1972.71-1623,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,487.325,488.247,S.B.1.
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,488.247,490.32,"Under S.B.1., yes sir, yes Your Honor."
1972.71-1623,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,490.32,491.804,Not under the proceedings?
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,491.804,504.056,"No, the judgment was being wholly stayed, there was no injunction against S.B.1 and it was there for used by the Secretary of State as who is the appellant herein."
1972.71-1623,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,504.056,506.227,So the present state legislature was elected under S.B.1.?
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,506.227,509.549,The State congressional delegation was elected.
1972.71-1623,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,509.549,510.194,I beg your pardon?
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,510.194,535.595,"Yes, the intervention, there was an intervention on the plaintiffs’ side on the appellees’ side by the chairman of the Bexar County Republican Committee and others and they have filed the brief herein as appellees intervenors but it’s believed that the -- neither the intervention or the -- nor the position here add anything significantly one way or another to the issue of this case."
1972.71-1623,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,671.173,682.367,"Well Mr. Black, can you find anything in there that indicates that any degree of -- in its exactitude would be against the Constitution?"
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,682.367,701.056,I think it is fair to a -- to infer analogically or as a matter of functional equivalency from a plan which aims at a rough and substantial proportionality of representatives to constituencies that the groups which make up of the delegations or --
1972.71-1623,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,701.056,707.678,"If within the State, one district was five times as large as another?"
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,713.8,714.175,"Well, that would --"
1972.71-1623,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,714.175,717.158,Now you would say that would violate that provision in --
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,717.158,718.446,"On Article 1 Section 2, that --"
1972.71-1623,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,718.446,719.989,Now what – where do you find that?
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,719.989,731.199,That would Your Honor -- that would be relatively easy I think because there is no variation amongst the States which is anything like that great.
1972.71-1623,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,759.907,767.099,Do you say the State ought to be free to vary as much as the Constitution permits states to vary among themselves?
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,767.099,768.408,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-1623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1028.579,1029.782,Mr. Black?
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,1029.782,1030.012,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1030.012,1036.464,Why is that you would read Mahan as being a reaffirmation of Kirkpatrick?
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,1046.637,1077.477,Your Honor of course that is correct and perhaps I have been guilty of advocates pessimism but they did seem to us to be expressions which at least I assume that Kirkpatrick was for the moment being taken as a fix star and the part of wisdom for us therefore is directly to address ourselves to that point.
1972.71-1623,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1722.326,1734.957,"I don’t know that in actual census speaking, these is as much of a justification for varying from what -- from absolute equality based on census figures is inaccurate as they are."
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,1740.456,1752.979,"With the deepest respect Mr. Justice White, it’s not upon the inaccuracy of the census figures that we principally rely that is as we have said in our brief a probably existing but relatively minor factor."
1972.71-1623,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1753.952,1757.656,It isn’t much for an argument for justifying the variation.
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,1757.656,1758.33,Not very much.
1972.71-1623,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1762.148,1764.98,Or even growth patterns aren’t much?
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,1764.98,1769.891,"Growth, I should respectfully differ when one considers that growth patterns up and down in Texas."
1972.71-1623,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1769.891,1773.008,But what if it’s growth down like a lot of places are?
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,1773.008,1778.542,"Well in Texas, one has growth both up and down."
1972.71-1623,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1778.542,1779.199,That’s right.
1972.71-1623,0,18477,charles_l_black_jr,,1779.199,1790.003,So that the -- when one superimposes these growth patterns only in part predictable on the age eligible population.
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,1873.154,1877.061,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1623,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2148.502,2158.818,You seem to be perhaps suggesting on variation of the test here Mr. Fischman if I understood you correctly.
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2183.872,2192.913,I think not in the -- not in classical sense of trying to “divine intent” for example in a criminal case.
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2250.207,2253.552,What if it’s simply a neutral consideration?
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2275.639,2277.29,I don’t think it can never be neutral.
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2277.29,2279.243,"Well, why couldn’t it be?"
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2285.576,2286.473,Well --
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2286.473,2299.489,"In other words, we can all agree, everybody would agree that if there were evidence here, racial discrimination, we would all agree that that’s wholly illegitimate for rather constitutional business."
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2320.991,2329.504,"Is to stand, we think that this is an element of the equation in determining good faith effort."
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2329.504,2333.734,"This factor, this ingredient wasn’t in Kirkpatrick, does it?"
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2333.734,2334.33,No.
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2334.33,2334.913,One way or the other?
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2334.913,2335.865,It’s not.
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2358.146,2365.815,What is in the Constitution that prevents a legislature that considered this?
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2374.67,2382.269,"Mr. Justice, the members of the United States House of Representatives are to be elected by the people and not by the legislatures."
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2382.269,2388.81,"Well, but the legislature devised this plan of the congressional districting and that’s what I’m talking about."
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2413.17,2429.598,"Well, I can’t follow the premise because, I can’t -- I’m not prepared to say that consideration of preserving incumbents is not otherwise violative or Article I, Section 2."
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2475.571,2487.685,Are you suggesting that this motivation to preserve incumbency is itself violative of something in the Constitution?
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2487.685,2497.063,"Insofar as it negates, the good faith effort that we believe Article I, Section 2 requires."
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2509.908,2533.444,"What if -- even though you have computerized, perfect equality at least so far as any figures you could use as a benchmark had it and yet if you could show racial discrimination it would -- it could still be a highly unconstitutional scheme of congressional districting, couldn’t it?"
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2533.444,2535.552,"Yes, it could under Fourteenth Amendment."
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2535.552,2536.536,Right.
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2561.019,2562.024,Oh!
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2580.364,2585.85,"You didn’t say it’s not a justification for any variation, any between districts?"
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2585.85,2587.643,And we believe not.
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2587.643,2592.568,It’s just not good enough reason to vary from equality?
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2592.568,2595.309,I cannot think of any justification to support it.
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2597.121,2604.799,What about following county lines or local subdivision lines?
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2604.799,2607.36,"No, I don’t."
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2607.36,2612.018,Will that justify some variation?
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2612.018,2617.671,I’m inclined to say not in the congressional case.
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2617.671,2621.264,Which one cut the most lines in this case?
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2623.925,2630.275,"Plan B, I believe, Your Honor."
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2630.275,2634.799,Plan B cut more county lines than C did?
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2634.799,2635.222,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2635.222,2637.681,And C was adopted by the Court?
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2637.681,2638.245,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2638.245,2640.944,"And C had more variation in than Plan B, didn’t it?"
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2640.944,2647.174,It was approximately three times as great if the amount involved is significant.
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2648.799,2654.409,"Well what was the justification for that, for Plan C varying more than Plan B did?"
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2657.861,2669.168,"We have nothing in the Court’s opinion other than the statement that Plan C most closely effectuates the principle of one man, one vote."
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2675.3,2676.893,There is just wasn’t any evidence about it.
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2683.715,2686.616,There was nothing in the Court’s opinion.
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2703.766,2707.531,Which one followed the incumbency of the plans?
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2709.763,2713.453,"That would be the plan that the Court declared unconstitutional, S.B.1."
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2713.453,2715.05,Yes but how about between --
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2715.05,2715.958,Plan B --
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2715.958,2717.26,Plan B and C?
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2717.26,2719.185,There is no evidence in the record and --
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2719.185,2721.335,Your client instructed both B and C.
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2721.335,2722.459,That’s correct.
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2722.459,2727.206,"So, you ought to know which one did what to incumbents."
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2727.206,2730.652,"In all kinder, I do not."
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2730.652,2732.077,So you really were neutral.
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2732.077,2733.024,"Yes, I was."
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2733.024,2741.325,"Well, is it not true that Plan B more closely resembled in shape and form S.B.1. than plan C did?"
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2741.325,2742.186,That is correct Mr. Justice.
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2742.186,2746.849,And yet it had less variance than Plan C on a population basis?
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2746.849,2748.107,It did.
1972.71-1623,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2748.107,2758.61,How can you defend Plan C here over and above your own plan B?
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2758.61,2763.647,Only on the basis that this is what the Court imposed.
1972.71-1623,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2862.019,2875.619,"Mr. Fischman, I gather under your view, you would reject the following of county lines and you would reject protection of incumbency as justifications for population deviation."
1972.71-1623,1,34439,lawrence_fischman,,2884.161,2886.499,"I do, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
