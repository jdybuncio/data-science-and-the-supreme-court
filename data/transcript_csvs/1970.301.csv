1970.301,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.852,We'll hear arguments next in number 301 Bivens against Six Unknown Agents.
1970.301,0,41348,stephen_a_grant,,15.753,19.227,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1420.47,1424.245,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1495.701,1508.342,"But what would you say, if the state court entertained a suit by this very plaintiff based on the Constitution and said certainly we'll give a remedy and we have no jurisdictional problems in our Court about --"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1508.342,1522.904,"What happens -- well, what happens to practical matter Mr. Justice is that if this suit have been brought in state court, it would have been removed by the Federal Government to the federal court under 1442 (a) of the removal statute because the federal defenses under these --"
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1522.904,1524.035,"Now, this is the point."
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1544.155,1572.843,"The governing law with regard to the issues of justification for the officer's action in arresting the petitioner or the defendant -- the plaintiff in that case, law with regards to perhaps defenses of immunity would be governed by federal law, but the nature of the cause of action itself as I had indicated, the type of injuries compensable, the kind of damages recoverable would not be governed by federal law."
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1572.843,1574.891,Why not?
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1575.48,1582.307,"Well, unless this Court creates a constitutional tort because historically --"
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1582.307,1599.92,"Why couldn't that -- a state court -- it would be beyond the power of the state court to say to this plaintiff you seek to sue under the Fourth Amendment, we accept the suit for that -- in that very sense."
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1606.392,1623.915,"State court could say assuming as I've said that it's not being removed to the federal court as it always will be against a federal officer under 1442 (a), the state Court could under settled precedent say, looking to the officer's action, we will determine this as it has to under federal law."
1970.301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1642.344,1647.639,"Can I get one point straight, you keep saying, if it is removed back to the federal Court?"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1647.639,1650.846,"No, I didn't -- I meant to say, if I did say that excuse Mr. Justice."
1970.301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1658.38,1663.873,Then it will be tried on the exact the same -- take this particular case.
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1666.764,1667.07,Right.
1970.301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1667.07,1673.469,"It will be removed to the federal court, you precede with the exact the same plead that you have right now?"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1673.469,1675.403,"And what would happen, that's correct."
1970.301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1675.973,1683.323,But what other than motion is accomplished by sending it back them to the state court?
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1683.323,1690.127,"Well, this was never commenced in the state court, so that the issue is not what would be gained."
1970.301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1706.414,1711.979,"But as it's staged now, wouldn't the statute of limitations take care of the state court?"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1711.979,1717.212,"In terms of -- you mean, in terms of the Government's favor, Your Honor?"
1970.301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1740.34,1745.883,"So, as of right now, he can't -- if he goes back to the state court, he is out of court?"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1745.883,1765.087,"Well, and even if this Court decides to create a cause of action and we, of course suggest that do not -- does not reach Barr and Matteo at all, and if it goes back to the federal Court, for example, and you say there is such cause of action, presumably, it would be dismissed under the statute of limitations."
1970.301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1768.133,1773.097,Is there a cause of action for injunctive relief as Mr. Grant suggested?
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1773.097,1777.386,There – and I think this fits in with our general proposition.
1970.301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1791.923,1795.039,Now is there for violation of the Fourth Amendment?
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1795.039,1798.419,I would assume that there could be a situation where they would be.
1970.301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1798.419,1801.504,"Well, then would this Court be creating a cause of action?"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1801.504,1808.241,It would be arising under the Constitution in terms of the injunctive remedy.
1970.301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1808.241,1810.197,That's not my question Mr. Feit.
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1821.637,1822.191,I think the government --
1970.301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1822.191,1824.246,It's the remedy of damages for now --
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1824.246,1827.363,"Because, we think that the two are somewhat different."
1970.301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1827.697,1828.617,What two are different?
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1828.617,1837.124,"That is – that the cause -- that the injunction, the action for injunctive relief which is essentially an action which rests on necessity."
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1959.715,1983.388,Didn't the Congress had pass in 1983 and keeping it on the books all these years turn over it back to the courts the task of fashioning a good many -- a good part of a federal law of constitutional rights against state officers?
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,1983.388,1997.034,"Yes and of course, I think that tends to support our position that is Congress in 1983 as this Court read it in Monroe and Pape created by statute a civil remedy against state officers."
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.034,2000.538,But left a – left it very open ended in the sense that all of the --
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2000.538,2002.336,And acting under the color of state law.
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2002.336,2006.476,-- all of the internal rules and standards are to be fashioned by the Court?
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2006.476,2013.969,"Well, under the 1983 you look to the federal -- you look to whatever federal common law applies and you can look to state law certainly."
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2013.969,2027.104,"You don't think it, you don't think it's odd at all to have the cases against state officers rest on federal law and the liability of federal officers rest exclusively on state law."
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2027.104,2038.773,I think this is a not a real meaningful distinction because all of these cases against federal offices brought in the state courts will be removed to the federal courts.
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.773,2044.34,I know but on your position the law applied in the federal court will be state law?
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2044.34,2050.946,"The law with regard to the nature of the damages and regard to the injuries, the type of injuries compensable."
1970.301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2110.978,2117.173,What's left in the state law under your submission.
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2119.906,2120.843,The case is removed to the federal court.
1970.301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2120.843,2128.062,You say that now most of the important elements both of the cause of action and the defense is federal law of Government.
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2128.062,2131.586,"I say that, as to the -- essentially as to the defense as federal law."
1970.301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2131.586,2135.677,That's what I say now then what's left for state law?
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2135.677,2140.503,As I understand it what would be left for state law would be the measure of damages.
1970.301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2140.503,2141.407,"Well, what --"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2141.407,2144.119,What the type of damages that can be recoverable.
1970.301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2144.119,2145.629,"What do you mean by type, I mean as between?"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2145.629,2150.583,"Punitive, punitive compensatory damages."
1970.301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2183.073,2199.91,"My difficult is you -- government apparently concedes so much -- so many the issues would be ruled by federal law but something you tell us is left for state law and I must confess, I don't follow why the distinction?"
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.91,2208.635,"Certainly, it can't be to protect the federal courts because you suggest that all the cases are going to end up in the federal court anyway?"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2208.635,2211.622,"No, it's not to protect the federal courts in that sense."
1970.301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2213.749,2217.196,What difference is it going to make in the plaintiff's cause of action?
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2231.537,2254.952,"Well, it seems to me that first as a jurisprudential kind of thing is to whether or not this Court -- as it is not done in over 200 years of litigation in these areas to determine that a cause of action exists under the Constitution without the showing any necessity."
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2302.068,2322.39,"Do you think -- you think you could go into a state court or federal court to sue a federal law officer for having broken into the house at night and seized a bunch of drugs and asked for an injunction and turned it over, have him return the property?"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2322.39,2324.24,I would have great doubt about that.
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2325.865,2327.447,"It's just an injunction, isn't it?"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2327.447,2328.212,No.
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2330.124,2334.069,You couldn't sue the federal officer to get the property back?
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2334.069,2335.286,"It's a replevin action, isn't it?"
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.286,2339.543,"A replevin action, you mean, to sue to get the property back in state court."
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2339.543,2344.308,"Well, I know but a replevin action rests on the violation of the Fourth Amendment?"
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2344.308,2350.433,"But of course, again, that question when we remove to the federal Court --"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2350.433,2356.754,"Well, would the federal law govern it or not?"
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2356.754,2362.527,I would have to say that the state law would govern the cause of action.
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2362.527,2366.017,"Well, why wouldn't it?"
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.017,2372.989,I thought I have been able to establish because --
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2372.989,2374.094,It's not Erie railroad.
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.576,2379.534,No.
1970.301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2396.216,2405.504,"What happens if this case, involving the state court to remove to the federal Court, who controls the damages, the state or the federal government?"
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2405.504,2424.359,"Oh, it is our submission that the measure of damages would be governed by state law and I might point out that New York State is a leader in compensatory damage recovery for alleged invasions -- in mental invasions of the petitioners or claimants."
1970.301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2424.359,2429.34,"So, why can't you hear this now on the same basis?"
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2429.34,2430.504,"Yes, it would be very --"
1970.301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2430.504,2435.261,"Why did you say, this make believe that it was filed in the state court first, you wouldn't be here, would you?"
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2435.261,2436.357,Well --
1970.301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2436.357,2437.124,Would you?
1970.301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2437.124,2444.574,"No, if this case were filed in the state Court, removed to the federal court and we tried out in the federal court."
1970.301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2444.574,2446.995,Right.
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2446.995,2452.727,"Now, what I missed somewhere along the line is, why do you say that state law would be applicable?"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2452.727,2455.218,Excuse me that why state law would not be applicable?
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2455.218,2457.141,"Would be, would be?"
1970.301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2457.141,2458.817,To the extent you say it is?
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2458.817,2459.115,Yes.
1970.301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2459.115,2462.605,Because I gather it's a very small?
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2462.605,2476.438,"I thought that my position is that state law would be applicable because the cause of action as a common law basis, did not arise from the Constitution in the Fourth Amendment."
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2492.187,2495.9,You're assuming what kind of a cause of action for trespass?
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2495.9,2501.432,"Assuming a cause of action for trespass, false imprisonment, of that nature against a federal officer."
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2501.432,2503.247,For possibly replevin as Mr. Justice White suggested?
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2503.247,2503.934,Possibly replevin --
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2503.934,2505.837,If wanted the property back?
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2505.837,2506.146,Yes.
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2506.146,2513.073,"The $2 million worth of whatever contraband, you want that back?"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2513.073,2513.263,"Well, --"
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2513.263,2515.245,And --
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2515.245,2517.231,As I say it may --
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2517.231,2536.787,"What if you sued in the state court simply for a violation of your Fourth Amendment rights in the state and that particular state said, that's fine, we have Tort Remedy for that."
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2545.939,2547.425,Correct.
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2547.425,2552.309,And then that's removed to federal Court --
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2552.309,2554.235,That's removed to the federal court --
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2554.235,2560.889,"And then, you have an action then in the federal court removable only because the defendant is a federal officer --"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2560.889,2563.318,He is a federal officer.
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2563.318,2570.754,And what's the difference then between the what have then and what the petitioner alleges you have here?
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2570.754,2582.803,"I think you have then in a sense in which and I'd like to get to the other second point again, the thing you have just then it seems to us is the creation of a constitutional cause of action."
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2582.803,2584.551,It's a cause of action --
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2584.551,2585.472,Because if you do --
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2585.472,2592.268,-- for damages based upon rights that are accorded to you under the Constitution.
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2604.035,2621.744,"Well, it seems to us that there are defects in creating that kind of remedy, even if it isn't a constitutional tort in that sense could Congress then change it as against federal officers."
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2621.744,2623.455,"Well, that's another case, isn't it that?"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2623.455,2638.601,"And secondly, for example, if you recognize the existence of this federal cause of action, might it not be or have an over deterring effect on federal officers."
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2697.251,2699.49,"What was the remedy asked for here, money damages?"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2699.49,2703.316,"The remedy asked for here was $15,000.00 against each federal officer."
1970.301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2703.316,2705.98,"That's certainly not a very unusual remedy, is it?"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2715.212,2716.487,"No, it does not."
1970.301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2852.121,2857.251,"But the government could credit all that by its motion summary judgment, right?"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2857.251,2859.239,"Well, it seems to me that the Government should --"
1970.301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2859.239,2861.168,Is that right?
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2861.168,2865.775,The Government moved to dismissed the complaint.
1970.301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2866.052,2869.861,"I am sorry for my language, but that's (Voice Overlap)"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2869.861,2876.621,And file an affidavit relying on part on the claim that the action was brought under the civil rights statute.
1970.301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2876.621,2880.093,How can you argue about what you would prove when you weren't interested in proving this --
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2880.093,2894.101,"It seems to us that the fact that the Government may have made a mistake or that the Court did not require, the District Court did not require further governmental affidavits of further showing."
1970.301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2943.719,2947.683,"Mr. Feit, was that suggestion made to the Court of Appeals, do you know?"
1970.301,1,30393,jerome_feit,,2947.683,2950.407,I think the suggestion was not made to the Court of Appeals.
1970.301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3006.643,3008.21,"Thank you, Mr. Feit."
1970.301,2,41348,stephen_a_grant,,3015.767,3018.486,I'll make only a few remarks unless there are questions from the bench.
1970.301,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3032.664,3033.817,"Because of the statute limitations, correct?"
1970.301,2,41348,stephen_a_grant,,3033.817,3034.449,Yes.
1970.301,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3303.478,3316.317,"Obviously if were to hold that there is a cause of action, Congress should pass a Bill saying that, there should not be a cause of action. What will be the situation?"
1970.301,2,41348,stephen_a_grant,,3316.317,3331.002,"This Court would hold that the plaintiff had a right under the Constitution for compensation for violation of Fourth Amendment, such a law, I believe would be in derogation of Fourth Amendment, but that doesn't mean that Congress doesn't have considerable flexibility."
1970.301,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3340.038,3358.252,"Your idea is that -- your belief here is that if we were to hold, there is a cause of action, Congress should study the matter and reach a conclusion there should not be a cause of action, that the Congressional Act would be unconstitutional?"
1970.301,2,41348,stephen_a_grant,,3358.252,3362.15,"I would certainly differ to the Court's judgment but that would be my position, yes."
1970.301,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3365.867,3374.073,You wouldn't think Congress could instead of putting it that way say the federal court should have no jurisdiction to hear suits against federal officers?
1970.301,2,41348,stephen_a_grant,,3374.073,3379.227,"That is precisely why I insist that the question is not simply jurisdictional question, Mr. Justice White."
1970.301,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3379.227,3383.048,How about answering my question?
1970.301,2,41348,stephen_a_grant,,3383.048,3385.783,"To that I'm sorry, Mr. Justice White."
1970.301,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3385.783,3395.589,"Well, what if Congress didn't put it the way you, Mr. Justice Black put it to you but just said that federal court shall have no jurisdiction to hear any cases against federal officer?"
1970.301,2,41348,stephen_a_grant,,3395.589,3414.637,"That would be fine, the suits will be brought in the state courts, but the point is that the law in the state courts would be federal law and it would be subject to being brought up to this Court, and the rules hopefully would be loud and clear on the right to damages for all kinds of suffering, and the rule on the defendant's liability would be equally clear."
1970.301,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3421.454,3428.256,Could Congress repeal the exclusionary rule?
1970.301,2,41348,stephen_a_grant,,3434.79,3435.173,That is very --
1970.301,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3435.173,3435.991,You said no.
1970.301,2,41348,stephen_a_grant,,3435.991,3438.113,Yes.
1970.301,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3445.069,3454.111,"Well, it rested as -- part of the rest on finding that the exclusionary rule is part of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments which was something --"
1970.301,2,41348,stephen_a_grant,,3454.111,3488.804,"I think that's right but there made very well be room once the underpinning of the inadequacy of civil remedies if there were effective civil remedy for an argument that it is essential in a case where it is being used with an over reaching part -- on the part of the Government to prosecute the defendant and in that type of case maybe it is certainly an essential part where is in the technical case where there is no over reaching no authorization from higher Government Officers then perhaps, once the other basis is removed the question should be reexamined."
1970.301,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3488.804,3502.788,"So, if you prevail here the logic of progressive events might lead the Court to be invited to reconsider the -- at least the full force of the exclusionary rule?"
1970.301,2,41348,stephen_a_grant,,3502.788,3506.032,It certainly might.
1970.301,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3506.806,3508.673,"Thank you Mr. Grant, Mr. Feit."
