1989.89-645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.689,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-645, Michael Milkovich v. the Lorain Journal Company."
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,22.529,25.965,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,59.539,69.061,"Mr. English, do you think that this case involves a matter of public concern?"
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,69.061,74.549,"Your Honor, not a general matter of public concern, but certainly a matter of public concern as to the local communities involved."
1989.89-645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,74.549,78.834,Does it fall under the rubric of the Hepps case?
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,78.834,90.574,"Your Honor, I believe it does fall under the rubric of the Hepps case, and had the Hepps case been properly followed by the trial court, clearly this case would have been actionable as opposed to absolutely privileged."
1989.89-645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,90.574,100.347,"And if it's... if Hepps applies, then the plaintiff below would have the burden of proving falsity?"
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,100.347,103.382,"Without a doubt, Your Honor, that is absolutely the case."
1989.89-645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,103.382,109.486,And are these statements capable of being proven false?
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,109.486,112.255,"Your Honor, these statements are quite capable of being proven false."
1989.89-645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.928,154.501,"If that's true, it doesn't much matter whether you label it fact or opinion, does it?"
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,154.501,155.451,"Your Honor, I would agree with you."
1989.89-645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.451,158.486,The question is whether you can prove that it's false.
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,158.486,175.497,"Clearly this Court in the Hepps case has indicated, at least with reference to private individuals on matters of public concern involving newspapers... which is exactly the situation that we have here... that it is the Plaintiff's burden to establish without resort to presumptions that a particular statement is false."
1989.89-645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,186.722,192.224,So... so you would... would accept as a definition of opinion is something that cannot be proven true or false?
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,192.224,195.928,"Your Honor, I would say that that is a fundamental aspect of the question of opinion."
1989.89-645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,494.788,508.982,Is there... are there any indication on the Ohio cases that state law and First Amendment Federal constitutional law are one and the same so far as the definition of opinion?
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,508.982,509.515,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,514.302,517.587,"I mean, how... not... not, pre-New York Times v. Sullivan, I assume?"
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,517.587,528.694,"--They are... they are pre-New York Times v. Sullivan, basically standing for the proposition that the Ohio constitution means essentially the same thing as the First Amendment with respect to freedom of the press."
1989.89-645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,585.815,605.812,"Is the... is the only language that the Ohio Supreme Court used in Long that... that justifies the assertion of independent state grounds the phrase that the ideals of the First Amendment are independently reinforced in Section 11, Article I of the Ohio... is there--"
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,605.812,607.279,"There is... I'm... I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1989.89-645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,653.376,663.832,"--Is this... is this is... is this your primary submission, Mr. English, or is your primary submission that there really is no... no need for a separate First Amendment privilege for opinion?"
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,663.832,670.588,"--Your Honor, I would say that under the Hepps case, after the... after the Hepps was decided there is no need for a First Amendment-based privilege, period."
1989.89-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,699.005,714.867,"Yeah, but Hepps... in Hepps you still have to... before you give the jury... before you... before a plaintiff can undertake to prove something is false it has to be provable, I guess."
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,714.867,715.55,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,715.55,717.617,So... so you really don't solve much.
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,720.702,721.404,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,732.31,732.778,"Well, then--"
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,732.778,733.744,--on speech of public concern.
1989.89-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,733.744,736.53,"--Well, then, if it isn't verifiable, it's opinion."
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,739.065,739.432,Your Honor--
1989.89-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,739.432,740.032,--the same result.
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,740.032,746.152,"--Your Honor, that... that is the position that I have advanced in the brief, and I believe that that would adequately protect the competing interest at stake."
1989.89-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,815.398,827.456,"May I ask you on that point, Mr. English, you say it's quintessentially a question of fact, but isn't it obvious that the author of the statement could not possibly know as a matter of fact what everyone who attended the meet knew in his heart?"
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,836.062,838.562,"Your Honor, that's a very different statement than what was said in here."
1989.89-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,838.562,843.416,You think he saying as a matter of fact he knows that everyone there knew in his heart that he... he--
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,843.416,844.033,"No, I'm saying--"
1989.89-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,844.033,844.752,--that's verifiable.
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,844.752,845.652,"--No, I'm not saying that."
1989.89-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,859.075,860.777,"Well, there are two different things I'm suggesting."
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,867.865,868.7,--I agree.
1989.89-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,869.683,875.354,"As to... that's... the latter half, was that fact or opinion?"
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,875.354,877.989,--I would say that it depends on how the article is written.
1989.89-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,880.175,883.377,"Well, I don't understand why you say it depends on how... it was written in English, I guess."
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,884.577,888.179,"Well, I... I'm not suggesting it was written in Japanese, Your Honor, but--"
1989.89-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,888.179,891.983,"xxx says that everyone knows in his heart, that includes the speaker."
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,891.983,892.499,"--Yes, sir."
1989.89-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,892.499,893.416,That includes the person.
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,893.416,894.749,No... no question about that.
1989.89-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,894.749,900.402,So that... that general statement subsumes a statement that I think he lied.
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,900.402,905.223,"And that's exactly the gist or the sting of the statement, that Mr. Milkovich lied under oath."
1989.89-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,908.342,913.579,"So the statement that you're relying on is... is the portion of it which in substance says, I, the author, know he lied."
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,913.579,914.129,--That's correct.
1989.89-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.129,917.198,And you... you can disregard the fact that everyone else thought he lied.
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,917.198,917.798,That's correct.
1989.89-645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.285,926.22,"Would it be libelous if he'd said, I believe he lied?"
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,926.22,948.319,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, Justice... Judge Friendly in Second Circuit noted in a case that I call the Court's attention to... it's Cianci v. New Times Publishing... a very capable analysis of how it is that someone might be able to avoid this opinion/fact distinction by saying, I think, I believe, it's my constitutionally protected opinion that someone lied under oath."
1989.89-645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,948.319,948.752,Wait.
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,952.971,954.473,It would be clearly libelous if he said that.
1989.89-645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,958.191,961.727,But you can't avoid it by saying in my opinion he is a liar?
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,963.829,965.112,"I think that is correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.112,966.031,"Oh, I... I thought you said the opposite."
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,968.733,969.266,I certainly didn't mean to do so.
1989.89-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,969.899,980.623,"Supposing he said this, I attended the meeting and I saw these facts and I saw... then somebody else told me these facts; on the basis of these facts, I think he lied?"
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,980.623,982.023,"Your Honor, that's a much closer call."
1989.89-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,986.325,987.96,"Well, what... what do you do with that case?"
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,1003.237,1004.906,--Actionable.
1989.89-645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1015.445,1017.063,You don't agree with the restatement second?
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,1017.063,1018.513,--I do not agree with the restatement second.
1989.89-645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1021.081,1024.55,"You have to right not only about the facts, but also about the assessment of the facts--"
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,1024.55,1024.984,--That's correct.
1989.89-645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1024.984,1027.085,--unless you can... and the burden's on you.
1989.89-645,0,17590,brent_lawson_english,,1033.439,1034.59,That's correct.
1989.89-645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1043.631,1044.997,"Very well, Mr. English."
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1049.451,1052.903,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1082.072,1083.672,"In which opinion, Mr. Panza?"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1083.672,1085.374,"Scott case, 1986, Your Honor."
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1085.374,1085.724,No.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1087.91,1091.612,"There are only... Your Honor, the Scott case reversed the Milkovich case."
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1101.902,1110.625,"But as I recall reading the Scott case [inaudible], there wasn't just one opinion, there were a number of different opinions by the justices of the Supreme Court of Ohio."
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1110.625,1111.941,"Majority opinion, Your Honor."
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1111.941,1112.608,The majority opinion?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1112.608,1115.993,"Written by Judge Locher, who was speaking for the majority."
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1115.993,1118.579,But that's not the case we have before us.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1118.579,1119.195,I beg your pardon?
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1119.195,1124.433,That isn't... that isn't the opinion that is... that is on appeal here.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1124.433,1125.535,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1132.755,1145.848,"Well, we... we don't make an independent inquiry into state law whenever we're reviewing the judgment of a state court to determine whether even though this state judge didn't rely on state law, he could have--"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1145.848,1146.231,--Your Honor--
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1146.231,1147.964,"--because, in fact, it is a matter of state law."
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1149.55,1150.25,"--Not at all, Your Honor."
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1158.889,1160.691,I don't care what the motion for summary judgment cited.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1162.808,1164.41,"--The court of appeals said the very same thing, Your Honor."
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1164.41,1165.443,--What did the court of appeal say?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1167.362,1179.069,"The court of... the court of appeals, in citing the Scott case, cited the proposition that there is a... a constitutional protection for... for this exact column pursuant to Article I, Section 11 of the Ohio constitution."
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1179.069,1180.62,--It cited Federal cases and Scott.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1192.143,1202.951,"Your Honor, I believe exactly that there was a separate paragraph that the court of appeals made citing Article I, Section 11, and then the next paragraph on cited the Gertz case."
1989.89-645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1202.951,1222.848,"Well, there might be a constitutional rule in the state protecting this sort of thing, but if the state just follows the Federal rule in applying... in construing its own constitution, I'm not sure that that is an adequate independent state ground."
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1222.848,1223.814,"Well, I agree with you."
1989.89-645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1270.162,1286.255,Is there any case precedent in the State of Ohio which undertakes to analyze defamation issues separately under state law and reject contrary to result to what the Federal Law reaches?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1286.255,1309.037,"Not since the Scott case, Your Honor, but I might point out to you that the Ohio Supreme Court one year later in the case of Lansdown once again reiterated that the... there was a constitutional protection, a state constitutional protection, for opinion independent of the Federal Constitution."
1989.89-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1310.67,1311.839,Mr. Panza--
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1311.839,1313.006,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.006,1315.108,"--Mr. Panza, would you help me on one matter."
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1329.884,1331.168,Doesn't say it either.
1989.89-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1331.168,1334.453,"And isn't it the syllabus that's the law in Ohio, rather than the opinion?"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1334.453,1335.188,That's absolutely correct.
1989.89-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1335.188,1342.425,"So if the syllabus does not contain an independent adequate statement they're relying on a state ground rather than Federal, isn't that the end of the ball game?"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1342.425,1349.012,"Well, I don't believe so, Your Honor, because the syllabus doesn't say... doesn't cite to the Federal Constitution, nor does it cite to the Ohio--"
1989.89-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1349.012,1349.429,Right.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1349.429,1349.964,--Supreme Court.
1989.89-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.291,1364.624,There is--
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1364.624,1365.807,"But there is no reference, one way or another."
1989.89-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1366.441,1367.091,--All right.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1377.349,1379.984,Page 108.
1989.89-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1379.984,1381.501,108.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1388.572,1412.455,I'd like to address myself now to Justice O'Connor's comments concerning why Respondent believes that Hepps in no way is sufficient to protect opinion if the purpose of the protected speech is to advance public debate.
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1503.115,1513.57,"Well, supposing in this case Mr. Diadiun had said, in my opinion Milkovich perjured himself."
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1516.755,1520.743,I don't think Mr. Diadiun's intentions have... are relevant.
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1520.743,1522.143,"Well, can you answer my question?"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1522.143,1522.743,"Yes, I can."
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1522.743,1523.526,Why don't you?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1523.526,1524.445,I will.
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1532.984,1537.769,"Well, I'm... I'm asking you hypothetical question, Mr. Panza, that doesn't necessarily depend on the article."
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1539.471,1547.393,"--I think what you're asking me, Your Honor, if I'm... if... is if Mr. Diadiun merely said, I think, and then referred to a certain set of factual scenarios."
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1547.393,1559.118,"If he said, in my opinion Milkovich committed perjury, is that... should that be... should there be no action because the First Amendment... even if... even if Milkovich cannot prove he did not commit perjury?"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1559.118,1560.834,"If it is opinion, and if it concerns--"
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1560.834,1564.17,"Well, answer... can you answer my question yes or no?"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1564.17,1566.022,"--Yes, it should be protected, Your Honor."
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1566.022,1567.122,That should be protected?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1567.122,1568.474,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1989.89-645,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1568.474,1571.842,"And suppose that the words, ""in my opinion"", were left out?"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1576.913,1585.1,"No, then that would sound like a... an objective factual dissertation of the legal effect of Mr. Milkovich's testimony."
1989.89-645,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1585.1,1587.285,And that would be actionable in your view?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1587.285,1592.272,"If it was perceived as an objectionable... or, excuse me, an objective recitation of the facts, yes."
1989.89-645,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1592.272,1593.189,Do you... do you then--
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1593.189,1594.055,That's not the case here.
1989.89-645,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1594.055,1603.98,"--Is it... is it good reporting, therefore, to... in your view... under your view of the case, to preface statements of fact with the words ""in my opinion"" in order to immunize yourself--"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1603.98,1604.547,Absolutely not.
1989.89-645,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1604.547,1605.163,--from responsibility?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1605.163,1607.532,"Absolutely not, and that's not what was done here."
1989.89-645,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1608.899,1609.817,So that would be bad reporting?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1609.817,1611.317,I would absolutely say so.
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1611.317,1613.519,"Well, but that... that's a very handy device."
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1624.577,1625.161,Justice Scalia--
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.161,1626.594,And there's no liability for libel at all.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1632.581,1632.981,--Justice Scalia--
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1632.981,1634.348,And there's no such thing as libel.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1634.348,1636.7,--I'm not... I'm not a proponent of that.
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1636.7,1637.533,I thought you were.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1637.533,1637.966,Not at all.

1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1638.402,1638.785,Not at all.
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1638.785,1639.568,--to the Chief--
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1639.568,1641.018,Not at all.
1989.89-645,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1674.241,1677.027,"--Well, then, you're qualifying the answer you gave to the Chief Justice earlier?"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1677.027,1679.577,"No, I'm not qualifying at all."
1989.89-645,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1681.062,1681.829,"I mean, it's not clear--"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1681.829,1682.262,--I couldn't explain--
1989.89-645,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1682.262,1682.764,--to me what your position is.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1693.952,1697.523,"--If the reader perceives that as opinion, then... then that is protected."
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1707.346,1708.629,"Well, shouldn't that be a jury question?"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1708.629,1709.248,--Absolutely not.
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1709.248,1719.62,"When you say... when you say if the reader perceives it as opinion, is that a question that a... that a court decides without... as a matter of law?"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1719.62,1720.787,"Yes, it is."
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1721.222,1721.739,Why?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1721.739,1722.189,Why?
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1722.189,1727.309,"I mean, why shouldn't it be a question of fact if you're talking about the perception of a reader?"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1727.309,1729.442,"If you will... I'm... thank you, Your Honor."
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1759.431,1768.286,"So... so the question of how this... how the statement is perceived is not a question of fact, but it's a question of law that's decided by the court?"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1768.286,1768.869,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1768.869,1771.238,And how... how does the court go about deciding that?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1771.238,1774.19,"Well, it has to use a test and it has to adopt a test."
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1828.658,1836.264,"Well, it... it's one thing to say he never said it, and it's another thing to say... to say that he said it, that was taken out of context."
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1838.497,1839.883,He never said he committed perjury.
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.392,1856.092,That's not saying he committed perjury.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1856.092,1862.748,"I think... I think... I think if you isolate that and if you have a lawyer look at it, he will conclude it constitutes perjury."
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1926.172,1928.441,"Mr. Panza, let me... let me understand your position."
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1943.95,1955.691,"Well, I can imagine that there are scurrilous forms of opinion that this Court may not choose to extend constitutional protection to."
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.043,1962.112,"Oh, the difference is between calling someone a... a child abuser and a perjurer?"

1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,1981.508,1981.841,--No.
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1999.151,2006.723,Are... are you seeking to distinguish between an acquisition that someone is a perjurer and someone is a child abuser?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2006.723,2008.659,"Gee, I don't think so, Your Honor."
1989.89-645,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2029.688,2030.238,"Well, this...."
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2030.238,2031.055,--Not because--
1989.89-645,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2031.055,2031.938,This man... this man was an educator.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2041.796,2043.73,"--Oh, and it absolutely is, if that's the scenario."
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2043.73,2044.648,It... it would be all right?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2046.615,2047.15,If a man--
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2047.15,2048.6,I thought you were going to say for sure yes to that.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2048.6,2049.434,--If a man is an educator--
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.434,2050.085,That wasn't a real question.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2071.565,2072.982,"--Well, if it goes to his qualifications--"
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.982,2078.168,Doesn't it trouble you that people's reputations without any ability to defend it can be destroyed this way?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2078.168,2079.705,"--Well, of course, it does."
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2080.487,2081.771,"Well, what's your solution?"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2081.771,2085.242,"Well, first, I think you have to analyze what is being said."
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2124.467,2135.507,"Your answer to my question is, yes, you could publish in your paper 90 percent of the teachers in so and so school think that he's a child abuser and that is not libelous?"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2135.507,2137.974,With the qualifications as I've answered the Court's question.
1989.89-645,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2137.974,2146.73,"Mr. Panza, do you agree with the petitioner that this case is governed... falls within the Hepps' holding?"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2150.517,2151.967,"Oh, without question."
1989.89-645,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2152.817,2153.303,All right.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2174.9,2177.251,"Absolutely right, it can be proven true or false."
1989.89-645,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2177.584,2181.903,And why shouldn't we let that go to the jury and let them have their chance?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2181.903,2186.124,"--Well, if you're dealing with this article, that's not what Mr. Diadiun said."
1989.89-645,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2188.892,2205.519,What if the conclusion of the jury is that the reasonable average reader would have understood this article as saying the plaintiff lied under oath?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2205.519,2213.592,"--Well, if the Court has ruled that it... it has to go to the jury, but I'm not a proponent of submitting it to the jury for the reasons I've... I've outlined to the Court."
1989.89-645,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2236.723,2240.925,"Well, the plaintiff says they're not interested in the statement about what other people think."
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2248.412,2258.737,"Well, I think... I think the Plaintiff is very interested in... in... in fostering onto the Court that that is the opinion of Mr. Diadiun when he wrote the article."
1989.89-645,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2268.942,2277.914,Shouldn't it turn on what the average reasonable reader of the article would think was being said?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2277.914,2278.9,"--Absolutely, yes."
1989.89-645,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2278.9,2279.55,Yes.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2279.55,2280.566,"Absolutely, yes."
1989.89-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2280.566,2281.252,Okay.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2298.811,2313.32,"I would submit to you, Justice Stevens, that, as I pointed out before, I do not see that the speaker's intention is in any way relevant."
1989.89-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2313.32,2313.904,"Well, just under--"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2313.904,2314.454,What is relevant--
1989.89-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2314.454,2317.939,--under the actual malice standard he knew the statement was false when he made it.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2318.708,2319.258,--Well--
1989.89-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2319.258,2320.524,But... but that would be irrelevant?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2326.212,2327.647,"--Yes, sir."
1989.89-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2327.647,2327.897,Yeah.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2328.514,2329.03,Sure.
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2329.03,2343.739,--Your response earlier to Justice Kennedy and me said that... the... suggested that the fact/opinion dichotomy only applies if it's a matter of... of public concern.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2359.951,2361.868,"First of all, you're absolutely correct."
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2371.593,2373.009,Right.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2378.913,2380.449,--Under that... under that principle.
1989.89-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2420.857,2421.859,--Let's see what this proves.
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2447.174,2450.009,"--Well, I guess there's the problem."
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2493.555,2502.311,"If the speaker goes on, or the writer goes on for 10 or 12 column inches, isn't it conceivable he may be saying several different things?"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2502.311,2503.744,"Sure, it is."
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2503.744,2509.615,And might not one of them in this case be that Mr. Milkovich perjured himself?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2509.615,2521.139,"Well, it might be, but I don't believe that in this case you can separate that particular statement from the rest of what Mr. Diadiun is saying."
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2521.139,2522.807,Why can't you?
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2522.807,2530.678,"Well, because it is part and parcel of... of the general opinion that failing to take responsibility is in fact a lie."
1989.89-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2550.725,2559.197,"So in a sports column, unless you really mean to say that someone perjured themselves, it... it's okay?"
1989.89-645,1,40195,richard_d_panza,,2559.197,2559.714,No.
1989.89-645,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2570.038,2574.257,"I gave up reading the sport column because it had nothing but legal news, antitrust, contract breach--"
