1985.84-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,52.283,"Mr. Horowitz, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,52.283,56.753,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court:"
1985.84-1144,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,159.035,171.878,"Mr. Horowitz, is the remission proceeding basically used as a statutory authorization to customs people to just settle these cases?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,175.497,177.116,"Well, they have settlement authority."
1985.84-1144,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,187.737,191.522,"I mean, it just seems to operate as a practical matter--"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,191.522,191.872,Yeah.
1985.84-1144,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,191.872,196.593,--As agency settlement of a potential forfeiture?
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,196.593,199.545,"Yes, I would agree as a practical matter, that's basically how it operates."
1985.84-1144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,305.98,308.766,Is there a difference between litigation and remission?
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,308.766,311.232,I would say no.
1985.84-1144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,318.622,319.805,Or less than?
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,319.805,320.722,--Or less than.
1985.84-1144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,320.722,323.074,"So, mitigation is not less than?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,323.074,328.542,I think mitigation can also mean less than.
1985.84-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,328.542,340.584,"At that stage, on these facts, in your view could the government have justified forfeiting the Jaguar completely?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,340.584,342.302,After it had acted on the remission petition?
1985.84-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,342.302,351.574,"No, no, before there had been any effort to mitigate or remit, on these facts could the government have taken and kept this Jaguar?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,351.574,358.497,"There's no question that the government could have forfeited the Jaguar, and in fact the Ninth Circuit itself held that the Jaguar was forfeitable."
1985.84-1144,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,369.936,371.738,I'm interested in the same sort of question.
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,382.279,383.513,"Well, possibly."
1985.84-1144,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,403.676,408.228,"--It seems to me this is a stupid act of generosity, but it's irrelevant to the legal issue."
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,410.263,415.0,"--Let me just say, it's not a typical act of generosity on behalf of the Customs Service."
1985.84-1144,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,415.0,421.088,"--Is not the predicate for a petition for remission that there's been a fine or a penalty imposed, or that a forfeiture has occurred?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,421.088,424.872,"Well, the assumption of the remission petition is that the property was forfeitable."
1985.84-1144,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,424.872,428.74,Isn't that what 1618 says?
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,428.74,429.974,"Yes, 1618--"
1985.84-1144,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,429.974,430.49,You have to--
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,430.49,432.34,--provides for that.
1985.84-1144,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,459.573,466.644,"--Once you decide that it's forfeitable, then it isn't his property at all, is it?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,466.644,473.548,"Once it's decided in a judicial proceeding that it's forfeitable, it's the government's car, and under United States against Stowell--"
1985.84-1144,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,473.548,480.737,"You concede that if he puts the forfeitability at issue, it has to be decided?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,480.737,485.105,--If he puts the forfeitability at issue in the remission proceedings?
1985.84-1144,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,491.259,493.909,How can he put forfeitability at issue?
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,493.909,495.744,--How can he put forfeitability at issue?
1985.84-1144,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,500.281,502.9,"Well, may he do it in the remission proceeding?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,502.9,508.201,As part of his remission petition he may be claiming that he had no culpability at all and--
1985.84-1144,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,508.201,516.438,"Well, I know he may, but may he put forfeitability at issue in the remission proceeding?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,516.438,517.24,"--I'm sorry, Justice."
1985.84-1144,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,522.009,530.13,"He files a petition for remission, or whatever you want to call it, and he says, please remit because my car wasn't forfeitable?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,530.13,530.48,--Yes.
1985.84-1144,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,537.201,539.303,"So, he may raise it?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,539.303,548.242,"He may raise it, but when Customs acts on a remission petition it usually is not with a full panoply of due process protections that are associated with a judicial hearing."
1985.84-1144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,560.717,578.345,"Are you saying that he is entitled to some sort of a due process protection if he raises the issue of forfeitability in the remission proceeding, or are you saying he is entitled to due process protection if he seeks a judicial determination?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,578.345,586.967,"What I am saying is that at the time his property is seized he is entitled to a judicial determination of forfeitability at some point, if the government is going to forfeit it."
1985.84-1144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,595.723,601.977,"Well, anyway, Mr. Horowitz, there is no forfeitability procedure except in the District Court, is there?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,602.663,606.115,--For smaller seizures it can be done administratively.
1985.84-1144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,606.115,608.181,"But let's take a larger one, like this one."
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,608.181,608.65,Yes.
1985.84-1144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,608.65,610.95,"A $24,000 Jaguar."
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,610.95,613.784,"Well, this was $24,500, and--"
1985.84-1144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,613.784,615.886,"Well, $24,000--"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,615.886,620.005,"--Well, today, actually the limit is $100,000, so this could be administratively--"
1985.84-1144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,620.005,624.509,"--Whatever it may be, if there is to be a judicial proceeding, doesn't the government have to initiate it?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,624.509,626.861,"--The Government has to initiate it, although the Claimant--"
1985.84-1144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,626.861,639.002,"So, if there is a remission proceeding, it's denied, then the government has to go in if the government says it's forfeitable, and go in and initiate a proceeding in some court, doesn't it?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,639.002,639.686,--That's correct.
1985.84-1144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,649.625,655.011,And this is in response to due process considerations?
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,655.011,656.38,I believe so.
1985.84-1144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,657.93,667.503,"It's in response to a statute, isn't it, that the government initiates a procedure, is that just kind of a constitutional--"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,667.503,668.621,"No, there's a statute that does it."
1985.84-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,683.531,695.255,--Does this record show what facts were alleged to lead the Customs Service to exercise this compassionate authority?
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,695.255,702.176,"As far as I know, there's nothing in the administrative file that... in the record that reflects why the administrative decision was made."
1985.84-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,702.176,710.182,"Isn't it pretty clear that this record shows that from the outset, he's embarked on a scheme to defraud the government?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,710.182,712.734,"Well, it's not clear whether he had an intention to defraud it."
1985.84-1144,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,714.55,719.888,"Well, isn't there a statement from him in writing that he was about to give this to his girlfriend?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,719.888,722.49,"--Well, he says that he bought it for his girlfriend."
1985.84-1144,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,722.49,724.942,"Well, there was a statement by him."
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,724.942,729.394,I don't know what that has to do with why he was bringing it into the country without paying customs duty.
1985.84-1144,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,729.394,735.999,"Well, I thought the question was, did he make any statement at all, and you said none."
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,735.999,741.403,"No, he made a statement in his remission petition that he did not intend to violate customs duty."
1985.84-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,759.865,777.576,"Well, it seems to me if a person makes a return and has a number of purchases and he forgets to list or declare a scarf or some such thing, but a $24,000 Jaguar is a little hard to forget, isn't it?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,777.576,788.634,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I understand you to be asking a question along the same lines as Justice Powell, that you don't understand why the Agency would send him a check for $21,000, and I understand why you are asking that."
1985.84-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,807.827,816.968,"Wasn't the problem that he thought he had to report at the Canadian customs rather than American, he allegedly got all mixed up, and I don't know if it's true or not, but he did have some kind of an explanation?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,816.968,819.052,I'm not... I don't--
1985.84-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.052,823.206,"--It was frivolous or he wouldn't have given them $24,000--"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,823.206,827.99,"--Well, the guidelines tend to go to first offense and things like that."
1985.84-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,846.987,848.837,--And what they got was about three times the normal?
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,848.837,853.225,"About, yes, maybe four or five."
1985.84-1144,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1039.879,1058.674,"Well, Mr. Horowitz, it seems as though you reach exactly the same result if you acknowledge that there is a property interest in the car and it is subject to due process protections, but the forfeiture proceeding itself provides all the process that's due."
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1058.674,1062.645,"Well, that is our position, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1123.968,1133.241,"Then the only question is, that's the very point, that that's not what the government does, that they haven't set up something where they have this procedure after the legal determination has been made."
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1137.443,1144.03,"He has a property interest in the car, but it's not implicated at all in the remission proceeding."
1985.84-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1144.03,1151.885,The remission proceeding... 95 percent of these cases are really settlement proceedings to determine who gets the car and how much he pays?
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1151.885,1160.225,"Yes, and just like any other settlement proceeding, we would submit that the litigant has no due process right in whether the government decides to agree to a settlement or not."
1985.84-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1160.225,1165.795,"Your argument is, if they had a different procedure it would be obvious, but my point is, they don't have that different procedure?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1165.795,1176.168,"I think the question... what he is claiming is that he has an independent right to due process in the remission proceeding, quite separate from the forfeiture proceeding."
1985.84-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1179.437,1185.091,"Can we really separate them entirely, if 95 percent of them actually end up settling the forfeiture proceeding?"
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1195.181,1208.806,"--Because the question is whether the government's decision in the remission proceeding involves a deprivation of property in any sense, and the answer to that is no, because either the property is forfeitable in which case it's--"
1985.84-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1208.806,1220.697,"--a decision in a proceeding which leads either to a deprivation of property or refusal to deprive of a property, and it's a proceeding that takes place before the deprivation has taken place, and it's part of the overall procedure."
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1220.697,1224.149,"--Well that's true, but there are all kinds of intermediate steps in the course of a proceeding."
1985.84-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1236.707,1239.825,"That of course is a very separate question, whether there's anything unfair about it."
1985.84-1144,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1249.697,1252.397,"Well, it wouldn't be perfectly all right but it would be perfectly constitutional."
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,1567.21,1569.828,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court:"
1985.84-1144,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1645.627,1659.552,"Well, Mr. Birke, there eventually is a hearing in connection with the forfeiture proceeding, and this Court has determined that that proceeding has to be provided within a reasonable time to meet due process concerns."
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,1666.206,1678.281,"The reason is, Your Honor, that there is by code, by regulation and by custom one integrated procedure here which I think you pointed out or referred in your comments."
1985.84-1144,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1693.474,1700.379,"It's just like a settlement authorization, as used before forfeiture, isn't that--"
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,1700.379,1706.617,"--Your Honor, there's a difference and I'll tell you, it is and it isn't, and the ""isn't"" is the key point."
1985.84-1144,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1724.912,1735.451,"--Well, in the normal civil litigation setting, why would there be some right to force the government to settle a lawsuit early?"
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,1735.451,1743.54,"The reason, Your Honor, is that in the normal... whether it be government or private litigation, there is no seizure of property without a hearing."
1985.84-1144,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1752.329,1762.87,"Well, suppose it is a matter of... a dispute over property which the government has taken, and there's a civil suit that arises."
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,1766.156,1768.358,I think there's an obligation for this reason.
1985.84-1144,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1801.695,1810.685,Is the consideration of the petition for remission a precondition to the institution of a judicial forfeiture proceeding?
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,1822.575,1824.444,"--He is led to believe, Your Honor--"
1985.84-1144,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1824.444,1826.877,"Well, I'm not interested in what he's led to believe."
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,1830.348,1843.789,"--I suppose it would have been possible to... on the basis of what this Court said in 8850, although I don't think it was particularly clear at the time, that he could have brought some motion under Rule 41-E."
1985.84-1144,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.547,1860.618,"But what you're talking about... all you're really claiming is the prompt right to a determination of the forfeiture, isn't it?"
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,1860.618,1861.118,--Yes.
1985.84-1144,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1861.118,1869.139,"If you can't prove that the remission proceeding is a necessary precondition to that, I think your due process argument is awfully weak."
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,1869.139,1877.01,"Well, Your Honor, I would say that I prove it, or strengthen it, by the point that the Government encourages this."
1985.84-1144,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1892.672,1906.379,"If the Government sets up a structure and says, we encourage this kind of settlement, why don't you go through with it, and you say, it's just too darn slow for me, why don't you go the way you want to?"
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,1906.379,1912.05,"--Because Your Honor, that's, with all due respect, totally unrealistic, to expect... excuse me."
1985.84-1144,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1912.05,1921.339,"It's like saying the Government has to plea bargain by a certain date in a criminal proceeding, or like it has to promptly reply to a settlement letter in a condemnation proceeding."
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,1925.393,1930.714,"Your Honor, I don't think it's exactly the same because there is a whole panoply of different interests."
1985.84-1144,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1976.509,1984.181,"What did your client consider the $21,000, a gift?"
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,1984.181,1993.12,"I don't know what he considered it, but I think he never, I will say, never considered nor was he told that he was making a waiver."
1985.84-1144,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1996.839,2004.06,"Did he think the Government was just handing him $21,000, of my money?"
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,2004.06,2009.964,"--Your Honor, again, what his state of mind was this, I would say that... it's fiction."
1985.84-1144,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2013.416,2015.366,"Well, fiction, I think, is probably--"
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,2015.366,2025.472,"But if you're getting to settlement, Your Honor, I think the implication of your question if I can get the direction of the point, it's the same as Justice White made, is that somehow this should be regarded as a settlement."
1985.84-1144,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2044.399,2046.068,Maybe we have to get a new lawyer?
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,2046.068,2064.43,"But, Your Honor, no lawyer could have said that it's a waiver because no case is ever decided at... if this Court decides that that's a waiver, it will be decided on an issue which was not pled, and which has not been briefed, and which, I respectfully submit, is not what the Government took the case up about at all."
1985.84-1144,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.834,2072.953,"Well, then the Government may claim, in effect, a waiver in the District Court?"
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,2072.953,2076.237,"--In effect, what they claimed was a counterclaim in the District Court."
1985.84-1144,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.237,2079.022,"Was it based on, that there was a waiver?"
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,2079.022,2087.878,"I think the based it upon a claim that there was a settlement, and it was not... the issue was never reached and never was taken up by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals."
1985.84-1144,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2087.878,2099.77,"That may be so, but do you think the Government, either you or the Government can force us to make a constitutional decision when there's a non-constitutional basis for disposing of it?"
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,2099.77,2101.055,"I know I can't, Your Honor."
1985.84-1144,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2101.055,2102.572,"Well, the Government can't either, can it?"
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,2102.572,2115.212,"Well, I believe, Your Honor, and I don't know again what's in the Government's mind, is that they were hoping... I think that both parties here think the principle of law involved is more important than the $3,000, and so I suppose--"
1985.84-1144,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.212,2117.164,"Well, that may be so."
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,2130.574,2148.117,"--Well, Your Honor, I would say it raises a... if you were to find in this case that there was a waiver, that would raise a serious constitutional question and I believe that it would be a violation of due process, if you were to decide in this case that there was a waiver on the basis of, it is an encouraged procedure pursuant to a statute."
1985.84-1144,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.482,2194.482,I don't understand the Government to be arguing with you.
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,2195.849,2201.151,"--They don't, but I understood you were suggesting that the case could be decided on that basis."
1985.84-1144,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.151,2201.92,"No, not here."
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,2201.92,2203.803,"Oh, all right."
1985.84-1144,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2207.407,2210.693,Let me try to clear up a procedural question.
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,2235.159,2241.462,"Your Honor, if they took possession of it, it wouldn't make any difference, because he had... they wouldn't."
1985.84-1144,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2255.888,2259.774,But they didn't start the forfeiture proceedings in 36 days.
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,2262.626,2281.539,"I would say it would depend upon the factors that this Court enunciated in 8850, and the relative guilt or clearness of the guilt, the Second Circuit in Johns-McKinley pointed out, is an argument for having less time than the 30 days, because they go through this in their petition for certiorari."
1985.84-1144,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2382.652,2395.293,"Well, when the Government has seized, whether it's diamonds or Jaguar automobiles, is not the... they have seized it and are holding possession of it, does not the individual have a right to bring a Klevin action?"
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,2395.293,2412.071,"Well, as I indicated in response to a previous question, he is... he may have a right, if he consults a lawyer who looks at 8850... of course it wasn't clear then, that was ten years ago, but he might be able to bring a Klevin action."
1985.84-1144,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2476.43,2509.484,"Well, Mr. Birke, wasn't the tacit assumption of the Court in the 8850 case that regardless of what happened with any remission, these are the limits that the Government will employ in going ahead with a forfeiture, and we recognize in 8850 that there is a property interest to be protected, and I just have difficulty understanding how there should be an additional concern about timeliness of the remission."
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,2525.176,2547.609,"Your Honor, in 8850, by the way, at page 566 and 67, the Court did say, unreasonable delay in processing the petition for remission could not justify prolonged keeping of the property without a hearing, and I think it's going to turn... whether or not you essentially accept the proposition that it's one procedure and that... you just can't ignore reality--"
1985.84-1144,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2547.609,2556.548,"Mr. Birke, may the Government initiate the forfeiture proceeding without having decided the petition for remission?"
1985.84-1144,1,18507,charles_l_birke,,2556.548,2558.881,"--Well, if they do that I think they have--"
1985.84-1144,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3404.774,3407.993,"I would like to make a couple of points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1144,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3431.758,3440.531,"May I ask, in that connection, just because of a suggestion your opponent made, supposing you did away with the remission proceeding, if Congress hadn't provided for it."
1985.84-1144,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3451.437,3452.872,"Well, it would go to--"
