1999.99-166,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.489,"We'll hear argument now in No. 99-166, United States v. Webster Hubbell."
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,8.826,12.413,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,69.408,73.583,How... how long was the witness before the grand jury to explain all these documents?
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,73.583,75.684,It would have been a matter of just a few minutes.
1999.99-166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,88.884,90.858,He... he was there for just a few minutes?
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,90.858,93.702,The testimony was... was for just a few minutes.
1999.99-166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,97.88,99.895,I thought that he had to identify each document.
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,123.938,141.307,"Well, I think that that's true, but I think that in this particular case and I think in most cases where you have a production of documents, you have to distinguish between the things that the witness is forced to say, implicitly or explicitly... and in this case, I think those things were much the same... and the contents of the documents."
1999.99-166,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,161.258,167.679,"Well, but did you... did the Government know about the contents of the documents ahead of time?"
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,167.679,167.925,No.
1999.99-166,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.003,173.432,You had... you had no idea what... what you were going to find.
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,173.432,181.429,"--Well, I mean, I think no idea is probably something of a stretch, but we certainly are not in a position to prove that we knew with reasonable particularity what the documents contained."
1999.99-166,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,181.429,190.372,And it was only by virtue of the production of the documents that you learned the facts that enabled you to then carry out a prosecution.
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,190.372,209.862,"That's absolutely right, but I think it's important to... to remember that it's clear, in the cases that the Court has had since Kastigar, in Fisher and in the other cases interpreting the statute, that it's not a problem for the Government to show that we would not have the incriminating information but for the compelled act of production."
1999.99-166,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,215.177,216.137,What do you have to show?
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,220.732,223.042,"--Well, I think... I think analytically that's a good way to put it."
1999.99-166,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,239.043,240.857,"Mr. Mann, you didn't answer Justice O'Connor's question."
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,242.444,243.772,"Well, I think what we have to--"
1999.99-166,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,243.772,244.365,Do you have to show anything?
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,244.365,249.737,--I think what we... I don't think we have to show anything about our quantum of knowledge of the contents of the documents.
1999.99-166,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,249.737,250.335,What do you have to show?
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,250.335,261.75,"I think we have to show, once... under Kastigar, once a defendant shows that he's been compelled to testify, the burden shifts to us to show that we did not use any of his compelled testimonial communications."
1999.99-166,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,262.648,262.76,No.
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,266.302,275.482,"--Oh, well, to get the subpoena, we have to satisfy the regular standard under R. Enterprises and then the regular standard under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to show that we have a basis for issuing a subpoena."
1999.99-166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,279.164,289.567,"Well, do you have to show anything in addition in order to satisfy the Fifth Amendment, that you had... that... that these are documents or... or items that everyone knows exists, something like that?"
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,289.567,291.287,"No, I... I think we do not."
1999.99-166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,303.58,312.297,"So, if everybody knows that the defendant, the target, has guns in his house, you can have a subpoena say bring all guns that are in your house to the grand jury."
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,312.297,316.791,--I think that that's perfectly permissible under the Court's decisions in Schmerber.
1999.99-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.236,321.638,"Well, how... how do you distinguish... what is magical about documents?"
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,349.427,349.689,--Yes.
1999.99-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.614,352.61,And then you get the gun.
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,358.232,358.36,Well--
1999.99-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,358.36,359.754,--not been compelled testimony?
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,359.754,366.79,"--The difficulty, of course, in that case is it might be that we would have difficulty in proving that the gun had been in the possession of the defendant, if that was relevant to us."
1999.99-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,369.36,369.492,It's registered.
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,374.228,375.4,"--But, see, that goes to your initial thing."
1999.99-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.386,393.958,"You're... you're accepting my gun hypothetical, and you say that the Government is entitled to demand of the defendant, who has squirreled away the gun... he's actually the murderer."
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,395.195,396.039,"Well now, of course--"
1999.99-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,396.039,399.912,"The Government can come to him and say, turn over the gun with which you committed the murder."
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,399.912,400.822,"--Well, I guess I'm--"
1999.99-166,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,400.822,404.732,And then you can introduce it in evidence and use it against him at trial.
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,405.137,410.874,--It's obviously more difficult for the Government if the Government subpoena says turn over the gun with which you committed the murder because they're going to have a heavier--
1999.99-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.874,411.792,"Well, they don't say that--"
1999.99-166,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,411.792,412.206,--If we say--
1999.99-166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,412.206,413.03,--turn over the gun.
1999.99-166,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1163.949,1168.3,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1225.087,1242.337,"Mr. Dreeben, I... I gather that means that your answer to my hypothetical earlier would be that there is no Fifth Amendment problem in requiring a person to turn over the handgun which... which was used in the commission of a murder."
1999.99-166,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1242.337,1244.13,"No, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1263.647,1268.89,But the only thing the Government can't use is the fact that he turned it over to prove that he possessed it.
1999.99-166,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1278.526,1286.476,"--Well, the Government has to show that it does not use anything testimonial in the investigation that leads up to the prosecution."
1999.99-166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1286.476,1294.005,But the Government could show at the trial that the murder was committed with a handgun that had been purchased by Mr. X.--
1999.99-166,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1294.005,1305.819,"It would need to do at least that, and it would also need to show that it did not make use, as an investigatory lead, of its knowledge that this witness possessed the particular item."
1999.99-166,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1305.819,1309.529,--Could we go to the other part of Justice Kennedy's hypothetical?
1999.99-166,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1425.025,1438.395,"Justice Breyer, I think, first of all, the... the notion that the subpoena respondent says, the thing exists, is not a meaningful statement and is not one that the Court's cases actually contemplate as being the testimonial statement."
1999.99-166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1481.758,1484.837,Do you know how long the defendant was before the grand jury?
1999.99-166,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1484.837,1485.656,I don't.
1999.99-166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1487.915,1491.178,"Well, I... I understand that, but I... I can't seem to get an answer."
1999.99-166,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1517.622,1528.87,"Well, I think the case comes to the Court, Justice Kennedy, on the assumption that the... the actions of Mr. Hubbell, sitting in a grand jury, do not change the essential testimonial representations that were made."
1999.99-166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1528.87,1537.125,"The case comes before the Court on the assumption that you can use this subpoena of this breadth in every drug prosecution that the Government brings, as I understand it."
1999.99-166,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1537.125,1539.527,And the result of that is that we would be--
1999.99-166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1539.527,1542.922,And I think there's a very serious problem of prosecutorial overreaching with that.
1999.99-166,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1542.922,1550.369,--The problem exists if we make use of what is testimonial and what the witness is compelled to do.
1999.99-166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1556.108,1569.74,"It's very odd to me, in response to Justice O'Connor, that... the counsel has conceded, as he must, that you have to have probable cause... you can now have a witness come live, a target of investigation, before a grand jury with less than probable cause."
1999.99-166,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1570.994,1575.056,"Well, we can bring witnesses before the grand jury with less than probable cause."
1999.99-166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1579.191,1590.011,"Well, I... I understand that, but with reference to requiring him as well to bring documents covering a tremendously broad description."
1999.99-166,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1590.011,1608.628,I think that the essential position that we have taken responds to the fact that in Fisher and in Doe this Court overruled the doctrine of Boyd under which the notion was that the contents of the documents themselves were testimonial and that a witness was being compelled to testify by producing those contents.
1999.99-166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1616.812,1623.969,Would your argument change if the defendant were before the grand jury for 3 hours responding to every paragraph of this subpoena to see if he complied with it?
1999.99-166,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1623.969,1638.198,The argument would change only insofar as there is a greater chance that more testimony that is protected would go before the grand jury and potentially influence--
1999.99-166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1638.198,1638.777,"So, we are concerned with risk."
1999.99-166,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1638.777,1639.615,--Yes.
1999.99-166,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1639.615,1667.684,"Mr. Dreeben, I... I had the... have been making the assumption that the Government makes use of section 6002 immunity provisions to compel testimony from witnesses largely in a third party context, in other words, getting evidence that way from a third party to use against another criminal defendant."
1999.99-166,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1678.182,1681.673,"It is relatively unusual, but far from unheard of."
1999.99-166,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1713.347,1728.887,"Well, and... and the language of section 6002 itself is sort of broad: No other information compelled under the order or information directly or indirectly derived from it may be used against the witness."
1999.99-166,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1730.314,1742.679,"--This Court said in Kastigar and also in United States v. Apfelbaum, which is at 445 U.S. 115, that 6002 was intended to go as far as but no further than the Fifth Amendment."
1999.99-166,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1743.502,1746.974,"Well, certainly that language goes pretty far, doesn't it?"
1999.99-166,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1746.974,1760.584,"--Well, the language I think was written against a backdrop of Boyd in which the contents of the records were protected, and so if the witness were compelled to produce private papers that he had created, that created a Fifth Amendment issue."
1999.99-166,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1766.311,1767.564,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,1769.484,1773.208,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-166,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1806.658,1810.804,"Well, he didn't have much choice except to tell the truth, did he, when he was before the grand jury?"
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,1810.804,1824.111,"No, and that was because he had asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege respectfully declining to state whether he had any documents, and he was compelled to state whether he had any by the immunity order."
1999.99-166,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1860.157,1865.537,"Mr. Nields, what... what is your position with respect to your client's production?"
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,1870.086,1879.201,The incriminating aspect of it was that he told them what documents existed and were in his possession--
1999.99-166,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1879.201,1883.636,You mean he... he told them by speaking not just by producing?
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,1883.636,1884.683,--Both.
1999.99-166,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1899.732,1901.445,And how did... how did that incriminate him?
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,1901.445,1905.799,It led the Government to get incriminating documents.
1999.99-166,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1905.799,1907.061,"Well, but is that the test?"
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,1910.277,1937.284,"Fisher doesn't deal, of course, with immunity, but what Fisher says is that the... the testimony that is involved... and the first thing that it says is the testimony involved is that the documents exist and are in the witness' possession because everybody who responds to a subpoena is required to say... tell the Government what documents he has."
1999.99-166,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1937.284,1945.411,What if the Government subpoenas income tax... copies of income tax forms and records?
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,1955.831,1960.166,I would have to answer that in two parts.
1999.99-166,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1967.149,1969.181,"Well, for most people it is."
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,1970.502,1971.144,It may be.
1999.99-166,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2006.312,2009.067,The Fifth Amendment was adopted in 1791 I think.
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2011.706,2014.76,"--Counselman against Hitchcock was decided, Your Honor, and this Court--"
1999.99-166,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2014.76,2016.627,"Well, that presumably interpreted the--"
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2016.627,2016.784,--Yes.
1999.99-166,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2016.784,2017.315,--the law--
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2017.315,2018.064,Yes.
1999.99-166,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2018.064,2019.144,--rather than changed it I trust.
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2019.144,2019.6,You're correct.
1999.99-166,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2068.067,2073.745,"Well, why doesn't that apply to your... to the income tax question that Justice O'Connor said?"
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2076.161,2077.556,--It does.
1999.99-166,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2077.556,2078.789,"--The Government says, we've lost ours."
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2079.572,2080.443,It does.
1999.99-166,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2082.65,2083.858,"Well, but then--"
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2083.858,2088.534,"--the Court holds that it's a foregone conclusion that he possessed it, in which case Fisher--"
1999.99-166,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2088.534,2090.071,--The Court holds... I stipulate to that.
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2092.264,2096.844,"--Then there's no testimony involved at all, so we don't even get to the question of incrimination."
1999.99-166,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2096.844,2102.138,"Well, but that... that just didn't fit your... your nice summary that you gave, it seemed to me."
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2112.709,2116.601,"It... I believe it does, but it needs a little more explanation."
1999.99-166,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2140.683,2147.76,"All right, but in any case where it's not a foregone conclusion, that this particular document... I mean, why stop there?"
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2167.74,2168.345,Correct.
1999.99-166,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2168.345,2168.757,All right.
1999.99-166,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2171.242,2171.541,--Yes.
1999.99-166,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2171.541,2180.834,"--back to Boyd, and not only Boyd, well beyond Boyd because exactly... as Justice Scalia pointed out, it's exactly the same thing whether it's a document or not."
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2193.462,2194.501,Yes.
1999.99-166,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2194.501,2201.055,"That's very far-reaching and... and seems... is there a... I mean, suppose the Court decides we're not going to overrule Fisher."
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2208.817,2222.773,"Well, Fisher... Fisher is I believe quite clear, that the... the relevant language in Fisher is... is the language that says that the existence and possession of the documents are a foregone conclusion."
1999.99-166,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2222.773,2223.581,"Yes, that's right."
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2223.581,2226.333,And therefore... but it's the therefore... we're not relying--
1999.99-166,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2226.333,2227.755,"Good, but we're on exactly the same track."
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2227.755,2228.08,Okay.
1999.99-166,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2228.08,2234.682,And what I'm searching for and have been unable to find... we're absolutely eye to eye as far as the logic is concerned.
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2258.472,2258.696,--Yes.
1999.99-166,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2258.696,2261.289,But... but that's a sort of illogical compromise.
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2262.183,2265.601,I think what you do is... I would do two things.
1999.99-166,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2289.475,2293.254,"Well, why do you emphasize truth-telling, Mr. Nields?"
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2304.258,2312.921,"The... the reason I emphasize truth-telling, Your Honor, is that the Court has done so in Doe II."
1999.99-166,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2343.153,2349.036,"Well, that's the cruel trilemma, which I think we've paid little attention to in the last few years."
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2349.036,2355.323,--It was absolutely adopted as the standard in Pennsylvania against Muniz.
1999.99-166,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2384.491,2392.875,What... what was the document involved in this case that's the least ordinary sort of document?
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2396.461,2401.757,"I'm not sure I could pick out the least one, Your Honor."
1999.99-166,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2401.757,2402.517,The... the subpoena--
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2402.517,2402.84,There was an enormous--
1999.99-166,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2402.84,2403.953,--is... is enormous.
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2403.953,2404.69,--quantity.
1999.99-166,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2429.59,2436.566,"Well, supposing this is an... perhaps it wasn't... an ordinary income tax fraud prosecution."
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2450.509,2462.068,"It absolutely can serve the subpoena, but if the witness claims the Fifth Amendment privilege, and... and he is... he is compelled to disclose the existence under immunity--"
1999.99-166,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2462.068,2464.315,Then... then Fisher becomes almost meaningless.
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2478.279,2482.015,"--I think the answer is no, Your Honor, and this is the reason."
1999.99-166,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2502.505,2507.828,"Well, when you're... you're saying contents, you mean the information contained, in other words, the information does not become immunized."
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2507.828,2508.451,--Correct.
1999.99-166,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2508.451,2508.88,Okay.
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2508.88,2511.048,"Correct, so that the Government... this is what they usually do."
1999.99-166,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2531.033,2535.8,"But the fact that the information is in the document subpoenaed, that remains subject to privilege."
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2535.8,2538.246,No.
1999.99-166,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2538.246,2538.513,No.
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2541.852,2542.02,Yes.
1999.99-166,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2542.02,2550.906,But you can't use the information as a result of its being contained in the subpoenaed document subject to the immunity grant.
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2550.906,2553.406,"Yes, but I would put it a slightly different way."
1999.99-166,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2563.268,2564.404,"Yes, I... I understand."
1999.99-166,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2564.404,2566.532,"You couldn't require a handwriting example, I guess, could you?"
1999.99-166,2,32181,john_w_nields_jr,,2566.532,2572.161,--You can command a handwriting example because this Court has said so.
1999.99-166,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2572.161,2573.339,"Well, but I mean... no."
