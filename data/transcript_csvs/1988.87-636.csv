1988.87-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.289,We'll hear argument next in No. 87-636 Efthimios A. Karahalios v. National Federation of Federal Employees.
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,64.49,66.156,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,123.493,136.337,"Well, suppose the general counsel issues a complaint and then there's a... there is a provision for an administrative hearing on unfair representation."
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,136.337,137.42,That's correct.
1988.87-636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,137.42,142.241,"So, Congress certainly anticipated that there would be an administrative remedy."
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,142.241,144.157,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1988.87-636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,144.741,154.382,"So, what would happen if there was an administrative proceeding on an unfair... and there's a ruling that there wasn't any unfair representation?"
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,155.499,161.553,--I think that's exactly the wrong which was addressed by the Court in Vaca v. Sipes.
1988.87-636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,168.122,170.158,But could you go to court in my... in my question?
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,171.308,173.093,"--In the private sector, Your Honor?"
1988.87-636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,173.093,173.759,Would you... yes.
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,178.128,183.449,"As it's currently structured, Your Honor, I believe that you can go to district court."
1988.87-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,294.372,301.692,"Although in that case there had previously been... before the administrative remedy was adopted, there had previously been judicial relief available though."
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,301.692,304.811,--In the Vaca v. Sipes case.
1988.87-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,304.811,306.144,"Yes, in that situation."
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,306.144,317.802,It was an open question in Vaca whether or not the availability of unfair labor practice review was sufficient to allow preemption of a judicial remedy.
1988.87-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.802,323.689,"No, but hadn't the judicial remedy been... been available before the administrative remedy was provided?"
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,323.689,324.521,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1988.87-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.521,329.592,It was... there was no question that... that... that you have the judicial remedy before the administrative remedy.
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,339.198,343.4,"Well, I'm not certain that that... that's actually the case here."
1988.87-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,379.858,383.06,Which came... which came... which came first in the Vaca situation?
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,385.845,391.48,"--Well, the judicial remedy was established in Steele and Tunstall some 20 years before the... the Vaca remedy."
1988.87-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,391.48,395.932,"And it had been before the board decided this would be an unfair practice, didn't it?"
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,395.932,396.482,That's correct.
1988.87-636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,468.563,473.531,But you... you still have to be implying a cause of action.
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,473.531,476.05,"Well, I think that--"
1988.87-636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,476.05,477.0,There is no express provision for it.
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,477.0,481.702,"--Well, there's... there's no question that it's not set forth in the statute, Justice White."
1988.87-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,522.529,528.933,"Of course, what the statute says, as opposed to what the... what you're reciting from the legislative history, is that there will be an administrative remedy."
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,530.949,533.301,"That's correct, Your honor, and--"
1988.87-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,533.301,538.388,"Which makes it different from... from the National Labor Relations Act, does it not, and the Railway Labor Act?"
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,538.388,540.506,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1988.87-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,549.262,553.131,"No, but was there the express administrative remedy provided in those acts?"
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,553.131,555.75,"Certainly in the Notional Labor Relations Act, there was."
1988.87-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.689,725.724,Fairness is not... it's not just the legislative history that's rife with that.
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,730.711,732.195,"--Well, surely, Your Honor--"
1988.87-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,732.195,734.913,Management's rights are set forth in the statute with some specificity.
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,734.913,737.199,--With a great deal of specificity.
1988.87-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,744.702,755.16,My point is that the departure that the legislative history refers to... the other departures that the legislative history refers to are departures that are contained in the text of the statute.
1988.87-636,0,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,757.076,760.695,"--That may well be the case, Your Honor."
1988.87-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,831.172,833.291,"Thank you, Mr. Duffy."
1988.87-636,1,27141,h_stephan_gordon,,835.243,843.147,Mr. Chief Justices and may it please the Court:
1988.87-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1046.411,1055.001,"I must say I've never heard a union argue this before, but it's... it's an interesting [inaudible] to hear from that side."
1988.87-636,1,27141,h_stephan_gordon,,1055.001,1056.034,"Thank you, Justice Scalia."
1988.87-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1118.443,1128.715,xxx but they... but any complaint against a union made administrative could... could just be stopped dead in the water by the general counsel.
1988.87-636,1,27141,h_stephan_gordon,,1128.715,1130.751,"That is correct, Justice White."
1988.87-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1134.786,1136.321,"And the Court, made quite a bit."
1988.87-636,1,27141,h_stephan_gordon,,1137.705,1140.539,"--That is correct, Justice White."
1988.87-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1165.757,1168.474,Such as any equivalent to Section 301.
1988.87-636,1,27141,h_stephan_gordon,,1168.474,1170.459,"What is one of them, Your Honor, yes."
1988.87-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1553.959,1559.279,"You say the administrative remedy is not only comprehensive, but adequate I suppose."
1988.87-636,1,27141,h_stephan_gordon,,1559.279,1562.231,"Yes, I believe, Justice White, it is adequate--"
1988.87-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1562.231,1562.998,What kind of... what kind of--
1988.87-636,1,27141,h_stephan_gordon,,1562.998,1572.103,"--since the... since Section 7118 specifically provides that the authority is authorized to issue back pay orders, for example, where back pay is indicated."
1988.87-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1572.103,1573.27,--Against whom?
1988.87-636,1,27141,h_stephan_gordon,,1573.27,1582.894,"Well, the... the... the Authority has broad remedial powers which I submit are quite adequate and which the Authority has exercised."
1988.87-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1582.894,1587.43,Can the... can the... can the Authority order the union to pay anything?
1988.87-636,1,27141,h_stephan_gordon,,1587.43,1587.863,Yes.
1988.87-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.048,1590.182,What?
1988.87-636,1,27141,h_stephan_gordon,,1590.182,1593.917,Whatever... whatever damages the Authority will seek.
1988.87-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1596.202,1599.654,"Well, back pay normally runs against the employer."
1988.87-636,1,27141,h_stephan_gordon,,1599.654,1616.882,"Well, under Vaca v. Sipes, it runs to the employer, but since Vaca and Bowen, the... the Court has extended this so that unions have become equally liable to pay back pay--"
1988.87-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.882,1618.484,"So, you think--"
1988.87-636,1,27141,h_stephan_gordon,,1618.484,1618.917,--the Court--
1988.87-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.917,1625.988,--the administrative remedy would include any remedy that might... a court might give.
1988.87-636,1,27141,h_stephan_gordon,,1625.988,1635.244,"--Well, it would certainly not include punitive damages, for example, since the Authority would not be authorized to issue any orders which... which are punitive in nature."
1988.87-636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1750.369,1751.738,"Thank you, Mr. Gordon."
1988.87-636,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1753.538,1766.164,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2143.04,2153.83,"I would think the reverse argument would be true, that if you want one place to settle... to settle a claim against the employer and the union, you ought to do it where you can get the employer."
1988.87-636,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2153.83,2159.984,"Well, you... you can get an employer for unfair labor practices before... before the FLRA."
1988.87-636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.984,2160.451,Exactly.
1988.87-636,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2161.02,2161.536,That's right.
1988.87-636,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2224.427,2226.296,"Thank you, Mr. Taranto."
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,2229.831,2234.466,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-636,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2647.217,2656.655,"Is the... under... under the federal law in the federal sector, is the violation of the duty of fair representation... is that an unfair labor practice?"
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,2656.655,2662.309,The Federal Labor Relations Authority has taken the position that it is an unfair labor practice.
1988.87-636,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2663.325,2669.713,"What did the statute say in giving... in... in putting it... it expressly puts a duty on the union, doesn't it?"
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,2669.713,2670.513,"--That's correct, Your honor."
1988.87-636,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2670.513,2673.798,But it doesn't say expressly that it's an unfair labor practice?
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,2673.798,2674.031,No.
1988.87-636,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2686.689,2690.658,"Yes, but the... the... the board has held that it is an unfair labor practice."
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,2690.658,2694.009,"The Authority has taken the position, much like the National Labor Relations board--"
1988.87-636,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2694.009,2695.378,Has that been subject to judicial review?
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,2695.378,2697.43,--I--
1988.87-636,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2697.43,2700.115,"I mean, it is subject to... to judicial review... that--"
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,2700.115,2702.898,"--Yes, it is subject to judicial review, and I--"
1988.87-636,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2702.898,2705.234,--And its decision in any fair representation--
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,2705.234,2705.617,--Yes.
1988.87-636,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2705.617,2707.702,--case is subject to judicial review.
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,2707.702,2711.42,"That, would be reviewable in the courts of appeal--"
1988.87-636,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2711.42,2711.887,Yes.
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,2711.887,2713.689,--much like in the National Labor Relations Act.
1988.87-636,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2726.08,2727.73,And it affirmed... affirmed the Authority?
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,2727.73,2729.281,"Yes, it affirmed the Authority."
1988.87-636,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.791,2747.993,But it didn't disagree with the notion that it was an unfair labor practice.
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,2747.993,2751.195,--It did not disagree with the notion that it was an unfair labor practice.
1988.87-636,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2839.92,2843.038,The D.C. Circuit didn't make that decision on its own.
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,2850.942,2852.977,"I think that's correct, justice Scalia."
1988.87-636,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2962.798,2976.522,"But in most unfair representation cases, aren't you really complaining about the union's failure to... to take his case against the... against the employer?"
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,2976.522,2982.359,Certainly I think that the bulk of such cases are contract breach cases.
1988.87-636,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.359,2988.33,"And you're not about to win an unfair labor... unfair representation case unless you prove that the employer was at fault, too."
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,2988.33,2991.532,I think that's a necessary corollary--
1988.87-636,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2991.532,2992.234,Yes.
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,2992.234,2993.467,--in the breach of contract cases.
1988.87-636,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3003.59,3003.992,For example--
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,3003.992,3004.809,xxx--
1988.87-636,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3004.809,3006.575,--[inaudible] something in this case about that.
1988.87-636,3,42599,thomas_r_duffy,,3006.575,3007.811,"--Oh, in this case?"
1988.87-636,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3169.517,3171.0,"Thank you, Mr. Duffy."
