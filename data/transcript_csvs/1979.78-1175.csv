1979.78-1175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,48.63,"We will hear arguments next in 78-1175, Hatzlachh Supply Company v. United States."
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,53.98,57.849,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,138.298,152.721,"Mr. Lewin, it has been my experience in my service here that the Court of Claims is usually astute to seize opportunities to broaden its jurisdiction."
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,169.861,188.792,"Well, I think quite frankly the Court of Claims did not consider in this case the location of and the language of this particular subsection as compared with those that were near it, nor indeed did it consider the legislative history of Section 2680(c), which we've set out in our brief."
1979.78-1175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,227.069,230.699,"But this is a detention of property, isn't it, Mr. Lewin?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,230.699,232.738,"It was a detention; yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-1175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,232.738,235.045,You think it changed its character at a point?
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,235.045,238.353,"Well, of course, this case was decided on summary judgment."
1979.78-1175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,377.967,388.065,"By paying $60,000, though, to dispose of this matter, there is some intimation, at least, that it wasn't totally inadvertent."
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,388.065,401.996,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, let me point this out What happened, those goods contained, and the first letters that went to the Customs Service contains strong protest about the fact that these goods were dated film, most of them were dated film which would expire a year and a half later."
1979.78-1175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,570.699,576.76,"Mr. Lewin, out of that language, I take it you infer a commitment to return the goods on the part of Customs?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,576.76,578.826,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,578.826,585.088,And I take it the opposition will take just the opposite approach to these facts?
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,585.088,606.628,"I suppose so, although I think the government's brief in this Court, at least, asserts mainly that there is no bailment in this case, not because the statute does not provide for it but because in some way the custody of the United States is inconsistent with title remaining in the importer."
1979.78-1175,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,608.332,618.561,"They say it's a bailment imposed by law, rather than a bailment in fact, so it isn't the kind of a bailment contract that's subject to suit in a Court of Claims?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,618.561,628.583,"Our position on that is that whether something is a bailment implied in fact depends of course, when you're dealing with the government, on what the government knows about its obligations under the law."
1979.78-1175,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,643.325,660.868,"Mr. Lewin, I suppose that if the Court of Claims was wrong in saying that 2680(c) provides no remedy, let's assume that when you don't return goods back, you can sue the United States under the Court of Claims Act."
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,663.056,664.869,Yes.
1979.78-1175,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,664.869,668.004,"Of course, this case wouldn't amount to a whole lot, would it?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,668.004,671.099,"No, it wouldn't, of course."
1979.78-1175,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,672.815,674.927,You say we've granted cert on that?
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,674.927,681.749,"Well, I think you've granted cert because the Court of Claims has said that by reason of 2680(c) we can't bring a contract action."
1979.78-1175,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,681.749,689.551,"I understand, because this means that the United States intends to be immune generally?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,689.551,692.728,"It tends to be immune even under the Tucker Act, even under implied contract."
1979.78-1175,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,692.728,699.99,"But if they were wrong on that, say they're wrong on that, it wouldn't change their position that this is not an implied contract?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,699.99,701.954,"Well, I don't think the Court of Claims really said it was not an implied contract."
1979.78-1175,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,701.954,703.918,"Well, it wouldn't change the United States position?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,703.918,722.393,"Oh, it wouldn't, I agree, and I think the United States really in this Court has, we have said in our reply brief, relegated to a secondary role the Court of Claims reasoning, which I think the Court of Claims seized on the 2680(c) language, and now the United States mainly argues in this Court there's no implied --"
1979.78-1175,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,722.393,725.617,We've granted cert on this conflict on (c)?
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,725.617,727.071,That's what we argued in our petition.
1979.78-1175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,735.541,741.742,Do you think that old case of United States v. Sole is no longer the law?
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,741.742,745.978,"Well, the case, the one I --"
1979.78-1175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,745.978,747.607,It's the case in which the --
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,747.607,749.889,Schmaltz' case?
1979.78-1175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,749.889,762.088,"It is the settled doctrine of this Court that the property, the specific property shall be forfeited, and the forfeiture takes place, takes effect immediately upon the commission of the act."
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,762.088,762.987,Oh.
1979.78-1175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,785.054,795.659,"I thought the language was not quite that, the forfeiture constitutes a statutory transfer of the right to the United States at the time the offense is committed."
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,799.571,800.321,Right.
1979.78-1175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,800.321,808.326,"-- any judicial proceeding, the U. S. Marshals or Revenue agents took the title, they took physical possession and title."
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,808.326,816.899,"Well, I think the language immediately preceding that, Mr. Chief Justice, is the right to the property vests in the United States although their title is not perfected until judicial condemnation."
1979.78-1175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,858.456,874.236,"But if all this material had been seized at two o'clock in the morning when they were trying to land it on the coast of New Jersey or someplace, a smuggling operation, wouldn't it be in the same posture as the still in the Stowell case?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,874.236,890.103,"I think if somebody -- I think, Mr. Chief Justice, if it were something different, if it were not going through the regular procedures and it were in that sense contraband, if it were like narcotic drugs or something, I think it might be in that sense, because then the owner has no rights do it."
1979.78-1175,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,974.11,986.921,"Well, could it be that if the Court of Claims was wrong on the Tort Claims Act on 2680, could it be that there could be a tort claim, an action of the Tort Claims Act, and also an action in the Court or Claims, or not?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,986.921,988.259,"Yes, I think it could."
1979.78-1175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,997.916,1003.625,What you're saying is that these same facts gave rise to both the contract action and the tort?
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1003.625,1008.65,"Yes, sir, it could give rise to a tort claim if you could prove -- it might be the highest burden of proof --"
1979.78-1175,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1008.65,1010.96,But you couldn't bring a tort claim in the Court of Claims?
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1010.96,1013.2,"No, you couldn't bring a tort claim in the Court of Claims."
1979.78-1175,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1028.053,1042.544,"So you've got two shots at this case, one if you win on 2680, you'll win in any event; at least you can stay in court, in some other court, and if you win on the other and, you might stay in the Court of Claims contract?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1042.544,1043.4,"Well, no."
1979.78-1175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1049.787,1050.461,"Oh, really?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1050.461,1051.705,It's too late to bring a tort action.
1979.78-1175,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1051.705,1052.089,Statute of limitations.
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1052.089,1053.794,So we're -- on the statute of limitations.
1979.78-1175,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1055.852,1056.296,I see.
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1056.296,1062.739,"-- and if the Court of Claims is right in its broad reading of 2680, contract actions are barred by 2680."
1979.78-1175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1079.29,1085.927,You say that this would not fall within one of the exceptions to the tort claims act?
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1085.927,1088.83,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1318.305,1325.166,But let's assume you construe Subsection (c) so it doesn't immunize.
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1338.977,1340.316,"No, we're not home free."
1979.78-1175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1436.388,1447.286,"Suppose the language, Mr. Lewin, of Subsection (c) instead of using the words ""or the detention,"" ""or the failure to return and account for."""
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1449.343,1451.327,"I think that definitely would, yes."
1979.78-1175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1451.327,1455.562,"Aren't they still in a sense detaining, when they do not return?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1455.562,1463.357,"No, I think detention, what Congress had in mind was you shouldn't be able to go and bring a Tort Claims Act to challenge the legality of detention."
1979.78-1175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1517.093,1522.681,"Well, I would, on the contrary, I would read detention to mean just exactly that."
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1522.681,1527.725,"Well, detention I think carries a very temporary meaning."
1979.78-1175,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1551.668,1573.736,"Mr. Lewin, perhaps this, I guess it was suggested by my brother Rehnquist's question, but if there were no 2680(c) as it's been construed by the Court of Claims, you'd still have, there'd still be a question of whether or not the Court of Claims had jurisdiction of this lawsuit, would there not?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1577.151,1577.857,There would be a question.
1979.78-1175,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1581.9,1584.039,"It was brought under 1491, wasn't it?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1584.039,1585.725,"Yes, sir, the Tucker Act."
1979.78-1175,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1585.725,1588.875,"And as an implied contract claim, not as a constitutional claim?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1588.875,1591.132,"Not as a constitutional claim, no; it was an implied contract."
1979.78-1175,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1591.132,1593.941,And not founded upon an act of Congress?
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1593.941,1600.003,"Well, that was an alternative claim that was made below; it wasn't passed on really by the Court of Claims, as to whether it was founded on an act of Congress."
1979.78-1175,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1600.003,1605.95,"But there would still remain questions to which you say the answers are reasonably clear, but in any event, there would be questions --"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1605.95,1607.284,Right.
1979.78-1175,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1607.284,1615.02,"-- as to the, to whether or not this law-suit fits under the jurisdictional language of 23 USC 1491, would there not?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1615.02,1617.076,"Yes, sir; yes, sir."
1979.78-1175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1617.076,1627.93,"Whereas if we agree with you on Subsection (c), it would be quite clear that you could bring an action in the United States District Court under the Tort Claims Act?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1627.93,1629.664,"The problem is, our time has run out."
1979.78-1175,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1629.664,1631.175,Your time has run out.
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1631.175,1632.203,So we couldn't do that.
1979.78-1175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1632.203,1634.843,"Well, you could have if you had decided rightly originally?"
1979.78-1175,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1634.843,1635.986,"We could have done that, yes."
1979.78-1175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1646.47,1651.15,Mr. Jones.
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1651.15,1654.709,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1175,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1717.925,1727.293,"Mr. Jones, on the question of negligence under such an action, would the mere failure to return be sufficient to make out a prima facie case of negligence?"
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1730.793,1734.198,"Well, you'd have to show title to the goods."
1979.78-1175,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1737.645,1740.258,Supposing he proved title but he doesn't know what happened to them.
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1744.145,1749.536,"Well, I think it would be enough to create a presumption of negligence, probably on a --"
1979.78-1175,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1749.536,1750.179,Res ipsa locutor?
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1750.179,1752.02,-- res ipsa locutor theory.
1979.78-1175,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1754.012,1758.995,"It's an action against the individual officer, isn't it, as opposed to against the United States?"
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1758.995,1759.511,"Yes, it is."
1979.78-1175,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1759.511,1760.561,The traditional action?
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1760.561,1761.198,That's right.
1979.78-1175,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1761.198,1767.43,And it's a presumption that the individual he happens to name as the defendant in the complaint has been guilty of negligence?
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1767.43,1786.254,"Well, the individual that he happens to name has to be the Customs officer, and the presumption would be that if the goods were lost, without explanation, the burden would be on the Customs officer to show that he exercised due diligence and that the goods -- that he was at fault for the loss of the goods."
1979.78-1175,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1787.068,1799.252,"One cannot tell from the complaint whether the claim is -- all we know is that the goods disappeared, allegedly, and it could have been that they were negligently lost or it could have been that they were negligently stolen, or it could have been that they were converted."
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1799.252,1800.668,That's right.
1979.78-1175,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1800.668,1802.983,Deliberately converted.
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1802.983,1803.836,That's right.
1979.78-1175,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1803.836,1804.993,So far as the --
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1804.993,1808.224,But none of those would create a claim under the Tucker Act.
1979.78-1175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1808.224,1813.799,"No, but in the case of stolen goods, say a third party broke into a government, Customs warehouse and stole the goods."
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1829.0,1829.317,No.
1979.78-1175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1860.349,1865.237,Who has to prove that the customs officer had possession of them in the first place?
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1877.012,1881.542,I would think that he would have to prove they came into the possession of the customs officer.
1979.78-1175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1889.208,1892.751,"But there wouldn't be any presumption that he received them, would there?"
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1892.751,1894.599,"No, that would be subject to proof."
1979.78-1175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1894.599,1908.146,"And if common law -- weren't there at least three different standards of proof, depending on whether you were a bailee for hire or a bailee for the benefit of the bailor or bailee for the benefit of the bailee?"
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1908.146,1909.907,There were many different standards.
1979.78-1175,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1930.699,1942.479,"At least as I learned in law school, that was the standard exacted upon a gratuitous bailee, in contrast to the bailee for hire."
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1942.479,1945.211,I am not certain that that would be the standard for --
1979.78-1175,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1945.211,1947.949,"That is a mutual benefit, a mutual account."
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1950.912,1962.382,We didn't study bailments in my --(Laughter)Petitioner never sought to invoke this traditional statutory tort remedy for the claimed loss of his goods.
1979.78-1175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2041.418,2054.507,"Do you think there is any difference in the kind of seizure, whether it is somewhere just off the coast or while they are unloading a ship at midnight or seized in the customs house, as a matter of law?"
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2054.507,2067.034,"I think as a matter of law, the only difference is that the person who brings the goods into the port under a false declarations is engaging in white collar smuggling."
1979.78-1175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2113.515,2133.785,"You say that they seized the goods in either situation, that title leaves the ostensible owner, whatever title was in the possessor has gone even if the possessor title of the United States does not become perfect, is that your position?"
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2133.785,2138.532,I would think that the result would be the same for any kind of forfeiture.
1979.78-1175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2147.92,2155.648,"And then it is redeemed, as it was here, if that is the right word, that is in effect a sale back, is that the idea?"
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2155.648,2156.698,"No, it is --"
1979.78-1175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2156.698,2157.615,Buying it back?
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2157.615,2175.704,"-- it is under 19 U.S.C. 1618, the Secretary of the Treasury can upon petition remit any forfeiture if he decides that the violation of the customs laws was not done with willful fraud or there are other mitigating circumstances."
1979.78-1175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2300.274,2307.569,"Now, the Court of Claims didn't deal with whether this was a claim under federal statute?"
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2307.569,2309.149,The claim wasn't presented.
1979.78-1175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2328.134,2340.233,"But there is a provision somewhere that says if at the end of some litigation the government loses, they are suppose to return it."
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2340.233,2340.648,Okay.
1979.78-1175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2357.052,2361.537,I suppose you would say that wouldn't create any claim under the federal statute.
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2361.537,2364.062,It wouldn't create a claim against the United States.
1979.78-1175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2364.062,2364.74,Why?
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2364.74,2372.571,"Well, if you trace the history of that provision, which goes back to the First Congress --"
1979.78-1175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2372.571,2380.908,"I know, but the reason I take it is that that statute created no substantive right, is that it?"
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2380.908,2384.451,It created no right of money damages against the United States.
1979.78-1175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2400.566,2413.377,"So you would say that in order to sustain the action against the United States, that statute would have said that upon failure to return the United States shall pay damages?"
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2415.736,2420.591,I think it would have to come close to -- much closer to saying that than what it does say.
1979.78-1175,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2434.232,2447.801,"Although if somebody said there was a bailment contract here, you wouldn't require some express provision in the contract, you would just say everybody knows a contract that is breached calls for damages."
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2447.801,2456.919,"Well, the Tucker Act creates jurisdiction for claims brought under the contracts, so you wouldn't have any trouble finding a source of authority for that."
1979.78-1175,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2480.413,2482.309,He claims there is a contract.
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2482.309,2484.611,That's right.
1979.78-1175,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2581.855,2598.38,"Do you think it is similar to the case we heard argued on Monday involving the -- in which the government was also involved, involving the General Allotment Act and the duty of the United States with respect to the timber?"
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2598.38,2600.791,I didn't head that lead into your sentence.
1979.78-1175,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2600.791,2605.136,"Well, is this part of your argument similar to the government's argument in that case?"
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2605.136,2611.167,"Well, it is not similar because it is inverted."
1979.78-1175,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2623.085,2623.344,"Well, that is the same thing, I think."
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2630.207,2634.315,"Well, Mitchell was a case based on a statute, not on a contract."
1979.78-1175,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2634.315,2638.182,"Right, but the claim was a trust."
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2638.182,2647.534,It was a claim based saying that a statute providing for a particular relationship is a statute that creates a money claim against the United States.
1979.78-1175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2647.534,2657.18,"Didn't it also rely on the fact that there were powers of attorney between the United States and the Indians which is certainly a consensual sort of thing, isn't it?"
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2657.18,2659.368,A Court of Claims in the Mitchell case?
1979.78-1175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2659.368,2660.694,"No, Monday's case."
1979.78-1175,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2660.694,2663.362,That was Mitchell.
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2663.362,2665.032,I am not aware that they relied on that.
1979.78-1175,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2684.467,2692.429,"Perhaps my question was a little wide of the mark and maybe also unfair, but that case was argued Monday and it is over."
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2692.429,2699.689,"Well, we do agree with petitioner that the Federal Tort Claims Act has only a tangential relevance to this case."
1979.78-1175,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2705.93,2709.58,You don't defend the Court of Claims reasoning then?
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2709.58,2724.107,"No, we think that the Court of Claims, for reasons that I don't know, was unaware of the private tort action that has always been available, has been available -- has been decided as recently as 1974 by the Fourth Circuit and --"
1979.78-1175,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2724.107,2726.136,Was that called to the attention of the Court of Claims?
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2726.136,2728.394,It was not called to the attention of Court of Claims.
1979.78-1175,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2728.394,2742.852,"So you don't say that 2680, even if it means what the Court of Claims thought it meant, insulates the United States from any suit in the Court of Claims on a contract?"
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2742.852,2747.744,"No, we don't take the position that 2680(c) refers to contracts, contract claims."
1979.78-1175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2747.744,2762.736,"Well, your position is that the United States doesn't need to be insulated against a suit in the Court of Claims, the plaintiff has to show an affirmative authorization to sue in the Court of Claims?"
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2762.736,2766.686,"Because he brought it under a contract theory, he has to show a contract."
1979.78-1175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2812.947,2814.627,Do you know whether that has ever happened?
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2814.627,2817.091,I don't think it has ever been necessary.
1979.78-1175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2817.091,2819.508,That isn't what I asked you.
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2819.508,2820.739,The Treasury has always paid.
1979.78-1175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2820.739,2824.003,"But it has never happened, so the answer is no, is that right?"
1979.78-1175,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2824.003,2828.786,Yes.
1979.78-1175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3020.222,3023.632,"Mr. Lewin, do you have anything further?"
1979.78-1175,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3023.632,3024.166,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1175,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3073.86,3079.048,That is because of the plaintiff's choice to sue the United States rather than the collector personally.
1979.78-1175,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3079.048,3119.687,"But given that the United States has now decided that individual employees are no longer to be sued, they passed the Federal Tort Claims Act so you don't have to go running after the individual employee, it is just totally inconsistent with the current thrust of federal statute and remedies against the federal government to say you have to sue under the cause of action that you had 150 years ago against a collector of customs and under a Civil War statute, 2006, which appears in the footnote on page 27 of the government's brief, is a statute passed in 1863 to keep levies from being made against the property of collectors of customs -- executions shall not issue against a collector."
1979.78-1175,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3162.254,3163.871,"That is involved in the Fifth Amendment, isn't it?"
1979.78-1175,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3163.871,3176.02,"That is partly involved in the Fifth Amendment, but this Court has very clearly said, language by Justice Frankfurter, I think, in the Dickenson case, that in no circumstances does either a taking or there was an implied promise by the government to pay for it."
1979.78-1175,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3188.423,3191.83,"Well, it is a constitutional duty to reimburse, to pay for it."
1979.78-1175,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3191.83,3193.111,The same is true here.
1979.78-1175,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3215.024,3222.405,Doesn't the Firth Amendment contemplate taking for the use of the government and not the negligent loss of it?
1979.78-1175,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3222.405,3224.705,That is why there is no claim that this is a taking.
1979.78-1175,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3248.32,3270.677,"Dickenson and Lynah in part depend on the fact that where the government takes and doesn't bring an action, the person who is the victim of the taking has to bring an action for inverse taking and has to show an authority on the part of the government to take and the taking isn't enough."
1979.78-1175,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3273.476,3283.231,"In Dickenson he talks about it being an implied promise to pay for the consequences of building a dam which spreads water on somebody's property, there is an implied promise."
1979.78-1175,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3305.527,3306.214,"Thank you, gentlemen."
