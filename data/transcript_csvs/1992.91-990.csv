1992.91-990,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.606,"We'll hear argument now in No. 91-990, Dale Farrar and Pat Smith v. William Hobby."
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,11.808,14.541,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,114.589,116.375,What was the denial of procedural due process?
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,116.375,119.993,"The denial of procedural due process was very complex, Justice White."
1992.91-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,144.525,150.179,"But did the, was the proceeding... was due process finally given?"
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,150.179,152.648,--Was due process finally given?
1992.91-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,163.356,164.922,"Well, was the school, are we talking about a school?"
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,164.922,165.506,--The school was closed.
1992.91-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,166.391,167.64,Which was shut down?
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,167.64,169.509,It was shut down and it remained closed.
1992.91-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,169.509,172.159,And it has never opened?
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,172.159,173.077,It has never opened.
1992.91-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,174.611,179.115,And is it conceded that it didn't deserve to be opened?
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,179.115,180.248,"--Well, conceded by whom?"
1992.91-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,193.791,202.064,"That the school should have been, that the jury found that if due process had been given it still would have been closed."
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,202.064,206.683,--I think that's a fair inference of what one could read into the jury verdict.
1992.91-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,206.683,212.502,"So you lose on the merits, you lose on the merits but by the wrong process?"
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,212.502,213.871,"Lose which by the merits, Justice White?"
1992.91-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,213.871,217.156,"Well, you lost on the merits of whether the school should be open."
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,217.156,220.875,We certainly lost on the merits of whether the school should be opened or should be closed.
1992.91-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,220.875,225.512,"The only problem was that they, that it was by the wrong process?"
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,225.512,226.879,I think in part that's true.
1992.91-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,283.483,286.718,The lieutenant governor didn't have the authority to close the school?
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,293.656,295.39,"--No, in fact he acted substantively."
1992.91-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,365.87,366.77,--I just have one other question.
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,366.77,367.289,--I'm sorry.
1992.91-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,367.289,370.657,"Did he argue that there was some, that there was a privilege?"
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,372.942,375.025,A privilege to make the statements?
1992.91-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,388.868,393.254,"Well, in any event we take the case with the jury finding against the lieutenant governor?"
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,393.254,397.974,"I believe that's the posture of the case at the present time, Mr. Justice."
1992.91-990,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,397.974,411.734,"Mr. Birnberg, do you take the position that any nominal damages award entitles the winner to get a fee award for attorneys' fees--"
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,411.734,413.167,"Justice O'Connor, I take the position--"
1992.91-990,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,413.167,416.185,--regardless of the context in which it's given?
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,416.185,425.391,"--Yes, if it is a procedural due process violation which is thereby vindicated according to Carey against Piphus."
1992.91-990,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,437.099,448.741,I guess this Court has at least spoken in dicta to the effect that a de minimis victory does not justify the award of fees.
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,448.741,449.793,That's absolutely correct.
1992.91-990,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,527.793,543.986,"Well, I would have thought that the statute 1988 speaks both in terms of discretion whether to award the fees and secondly that they should be in a reasonable amount."
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,553.658,562.514,"Of course it should, and our point is not that you should not take into account the amount of the recovery in fixing what is a reasonable fee."
1992.91-990,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,578.576,583.028,"Well, I guess the language in Garland said you're not entitled to any fee at all."
1992.91-990,0,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,583.028,586.146,"I would... you were the author of the opinion, Your Honor--"
1992.91-990,1,23796,finis_e_cowan,,1528.544,1530.846,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-990,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1563.383,1575.524,But I suppose there had to be the equivalent of a declaratory judgment here that the procedural due process rights were violated.
1992.91-990,1,23796,finis_e_cowan,,1575.524,1581.361,"--No, Your Honor, there was never any judgment of any kind, even a judgment for $1.00."
1992.91-990,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1581.361,1584.047,Why pecuniary damages then?
1992.91-990,1,23796,finis_e_cowan,,1584.047,1585.547,Why pecuniary damages?
1992.91-990,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1585.547,1587.832,I mean why nominal damages then?
1992.91-990,1,23796,finis_e_cowan,,1587.832,1595.937,"Because... well, no judgment for nominal damages was ever entered, which is one of the facts that my friend and I differ about."
1992.91-990,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1605.043,1605.976,"Well, all right, but anyway--"
1992.91-990,1,23796,finis_e_cowan,,1605.976,1607.412,--that the judgment was never entered.
1992.91-990,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1607.412,1620.903,"--Why would the court of appeals have said nominal damages unless there had been a violation of the due process rights, which it said there were?"
1992.91-990,1,23796,finis_e_cowan,,1620.903,1623.422,The jury in fact found that there was.
1992.91-990,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1623.422,1623.705,All right.
1992.91-990,1,23796,finis_e_cowan,,1623.705,1628.159,And if you look at that single jury finding you get one result.
1992.91-990,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1628.159,1629.742,"Well, that's what the case is all about."
1992.91-990,1,23796,finis_e_cowan,,1629.742,1643.001,But if you look at the whole case and if you look at the entire test set forth in TSTA v. Garland you come up with an entirely different result than if you look at that one jury finding.
1992.91-990,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1651.691,1654.143,And when you look at it what do you come up with?
1992.91-990,1,23796,finis_e_cowan,,1654.143,1654.709,You come up with--
1992.91-990,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1654.709,1657.511,"That there shouldn't have been even nominal damages, I suppose."
1992.91-990,1,23796,finis_e_cowan,,1657.511,1659.261,"--That can be argued, but you come up with--"
1992.91-990,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1659.261,1660.713,"Well, you aren't arguing that."
1992.91-990,1,23796,finis_e_cowan,,1660.713,1662.43,--It's too late to argue that.
1992.91-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1681.126,1692.934,"Just as a factual matter, Mr. Cowan, the opinion of the Fifth Circuit says that following remand from that court the trial court awarded the Farrar's $1.00 in nominal damages."
1992.91-990,1,23796,finis_e_cowan,,1692.934,1694.318,"Factually inaccurate, Your Honor."
1992.91-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1694.318,1697.803,"Well, we're certainly not going to delve into that here."
1992.91-990,1,23796,finis_e_cowan,,1702.124,1709.111,Except that in the record before Your Honors and the briefs it is factually undisputed that the judgment for $1.00 was never entered.
1992.91-990,2,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,3232.33,3234.948,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
