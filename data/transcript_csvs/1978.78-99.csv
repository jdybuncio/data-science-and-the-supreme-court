1978.78-99,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,66.711,We'll hear argument next in Parker against Randolph.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,70.873,73.426,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,341.212,342.917,Where was this in a private residence or --
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,342.917,344.522,This was in an apartment house in Memphis.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,345.401,346.156,"In an apartment, is it?"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,346.156,348.507,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,434.87,438.957,What is the state's position on redaction?
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,447.055,451.482,"Mr. -- Mr. Justice, I think that the redaction process was admirable."
1978.78-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,492.906,501.782,So -- so it isn't a question of erroneous redaction where some words that should have gone off or left in?
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,501.782,502.095,"No, sir."
1978.78-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,504.43,505.311,I understand you.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,505.311,507.236,-- in reaching the -- in reaching the final question.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,507.236,510.071,"Now in this trial, there were how many co-defendants?"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,510.071,511.041,"There was five, sir."
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,511.041,512.0,Five co-defendants --
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,512.0,512.118,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,512.118,514.299,-- the charges were murder and robbery?
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,514.299,518.381,"They were charged under the felony murder statute, murder and perpetration of robbery."
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,518.381,522.914,All charged with murder and some of most so if not all of them charged with robbery as well?
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,522.914,524.039,They were charged.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,526.469,527.387,It's not a matter of belief.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,528.979,530.482,I -- I know.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,537.586,538.693,Five co-defendants.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,538.693,538.759,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,538.759,539.544,In one trial.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,539.544,543.793,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,728.659,735.445,"Mr. Terry, are you basically making a harmless error argument?"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,735.445,741.56,"Mr. Justice, I think that it's fair to say that but I think that --"
1978.78-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,741.56,742.49,The reason I'm asking.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,775.676,789.767,The problem I have of that Mr. Justice Stevens is -- is starting with Bruton as a starting point when you have more than one confession or when the objector is also a confessor.
1978.78-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.789,830.848,"Or is it because the -- each defendant confessed or because the confession of each defendant was very, very probative against him?"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,830.848,833.479,I think the most important distinction is that they confessed.
1978.78-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.137,853.686,"You would make the same argument even if you didn't have -- what's the other Wood -- if you didn't have a confession from Robert Wood and if you didn't have a lot of detail in each of confession -- in -- just say -- say that for example, Pickens had a very short confession in which he just said, “Well, I met with these people but then I went home.”"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,868.748,873.484,"Our -- no, I think that Mr. Pickens would be in much better situation because --"
1978.78-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,873.484,878.535,"Well as a matter of law, would he be able to make a Bruton con -- Bruton objection?"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,879.537,881.951,"Again and I, you know, I don't want to appear to argue with you."
1978.78-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,887.619,888.209,"Well, yes."
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,888.209,889.986,-- no cross-examination.
1978.78-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,889.986,890.161,Unless --
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,890.161,892.111,I am being convicted on hearsay.
1978.78-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,913.815,918.266,"You see, what I'm trying to find out is whether you're making a legal argument or factual argument?"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,928.683,933.687,I think it's because of this particular record and I think that under harmless error.
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1005.872,1007.435,"Well, Mr. Terry, tell me."
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1014.509,1015.623,Because of Miranda.
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1015.623,1020.503,"So there's no interlocking confession issue as to him under Bruton, is still here?"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1021.754,1027.006,I'll be less than candid to tell you that we're in as good position with Mr. Pickens as we are with Randolph and Hamilton.
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1027.006,1034.503,"If it is improper -- it was improperly admitted then it's obviously no interlocking confession issue at all as to him, is it?"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1034.503,1034.625,Well --
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1034.625,1036.563,Then Bruton has violated as to him?
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1036.563,1036.872,It --
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1036.872,1039.573,As what -- what you have suggested it.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1045.665,1046.301,That's correct.
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.486,1051.506,"When Mr. -- at least as to -- as to Pickens, isn't he entitled a little affirmance here?"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1051.506,1054.765,Pickens was positive -- he was identified by Robert Wood.
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.765,1063.272,"I -- I know but you said yourself, as I understand it, the three confessions were introduced afforded for."
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1063.272,1064.397,Because Robert Wood was in --
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1064.397,1067.029,And it's been held now that Pickens was improperly introduced.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1067.029,1068.297,Right.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1068.297,1069.028,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1069.36,1076.719,"Well then, if -- if his conviction rests on the three confessions that were introduced, why isn't that a Bruton situation?"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1076.719,1078.472,It's not a Bruton situation because --
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1078.472,1079.638,A -- as to him?
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1079.638,1081.057,As to him is not because --
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1081.057,1085.677,If -- if conviction rests only on the convict -- on the confessions of the others that were introduced.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1085.677,1097.757,"Because Robert Wood testified at trial and he said Pickens was one of those people who came through that door and he was cross-examined and he was -- and in cross-examination, Pickens' counsel asked one question."
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1109.477,1112.708,What you're -- what you're telling me is this evidence other than --
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1112.708,1113.115,Yes.
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.115,1113.969,-- the confessions?
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1113.969,1114.158,Yes.
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.158,1116.457,So with evidence of Robert Wood.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1116.457,1117.225,Yes.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1119.103,1124.61,"Which of these defendants if any or maybe all of them, testified at the trial?"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1124.61,1126.232,Robert Wood.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1129.347,1131.592,"Well, you told us there were five co-defendants?"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1131.592,1132.791,Joe Wood did not either.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1137.302,1138.229,But he was a co-defendant?
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1138.229,1138.55,He was co-defendant --
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1138.55,1140.922,Only one of the five testified that it was Robert Wood?
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1140.922,1141.725,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1141.725,1149.546,"In the Bruton case, there was Evans whose confession was the critical document or the critical fact."
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1157.931,1158.133,No.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1158.133,1158.909,-- testified.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1158.909,1159.024,No.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1159.024,1167.355,All I had was the confession of evident -- of Evans as reported by a third party.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1167.875,1168.797,Posts comes back --
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1168.797,1185.662,"The trial court say, you can't use that except against Evans and this court held that despite those instructions that was so damaging with respect to Bruton and violated so greatly his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation that that conviction was reverse, is that it?"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1185.879,1185.94,That's accurate.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1185.94,1187.709,-- neither of them would testify.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1187.709,1190.957,Neither one testified and there was no redaction.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1190.957,1191.187,Right.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1191.187,1199.195,And in an examination with this Court found in rendering the opinion that Evans confessing was just about it against Bruton.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1205.533,1207.059,What happened before the case got here --
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1207.059,1207.211,Right.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1207.211,1208.164,-- if you remember?
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1208.164,1209.997,"Correct, before it got here."
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1210.448,1212.616,We must have Bruton's case here.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1212.616,1213.312,That's correct.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1220.145,1225.141,"Although, it says right until by the trial judge to disregard with respect to Bruton."
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1225.141,1225.975,"Yes, they had."
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1227.295,1234.346,So the judge must have considered there was an evidence other than that confession to go -- to take a case to the jury.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1234.346,1236.872,I don't think so.
1978.78-99,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1246.509,1248.884,"Bruton was federal prosecution, wasn't he?"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1248.884,1249.555,"Yes, it was."
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1249.555,1250.141,Yes.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1250.141,1252.791,"Yes, it was."
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1341.829,1346.138,"Mr. Terry, may I come back a moment with these Pickens and Wood's testimony."
1978.78-99,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1375.741,1377.356,What argument?
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1377.356,1378.491,How is there a Bruton issue?
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.491,1379.401,Yes.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1379.401,1382.159,"Well, there is a Bruton issue."
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.515,1385.565,He's not here complaining.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1386.789,1387.198,He's --
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1387.198,1389.494,He is satisfied with what happen below.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1389.494,1398.157,But I'm complaining that the writ of habeas corpus was issued because he has been successful with the Bruton argument in the Sixth Amendment.
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1410.444,1415.621,"Well, if his -- if his confession was improperly admitted."
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1427.885,1428.937,I agree with you.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1429.151,1434.169,With the event -- whether or not there might also be a Bruton issue with respect to him.
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.498,1439.116,Yes.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1439.116,1439.772,No.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1439.772,1440.465,Isn't that correct?
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1440.465,1441.044,No.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1443.269,1447.891,"Well, before his conviction may be reversed for a new trial, that's generally the result."
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1447.891,1448.254,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1448.254,1449.961,If a confession is improperly admitted.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1449.961,1452.573,Not if you can say that there's still enough evidence in this record to convict --
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1452.573,1453.236,No.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1468.491,1469.62,"Well, I --"
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1469.62,1471.025,"Well, isn't it?"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1471.025,1473.504,-- I think that has been holding of this Court in the past.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1473.504,1474.616,In many times?
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1475.393,1483.243,What I -- what I urged with regard to Pickens is and I mean to emphasize this.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1491.223,1495.271,"Well, all of these convictions are --- convictions were reversed by the Court of Appeals, were they not?"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1495.271,1496.465,Yes.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1496.465,1509.125,And Pickens was reversed because of among other maybe two reasons but one of them was that his himself incriminatory statement was admitted against him in violation of the Miranda rule.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1512.984,1520.544,About the only thing the Court of Appeals said about that was it they were reversed under Bruton and they went through pages and pages --
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1520.544,1526.057,Wny what -- what's your second question in the petition for cert which we refuse to review.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1527.457,1527.828,It has to do with --
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1527.828,1536.302,"What the Court of Appeals and District Court violated 2254 (d) by finding out one of the respondents was denied of his right to counsel, is that Pickens?"
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1536.302,1537.224,Yes.
1978.78-99,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1537.224,1538.601,"Well, we refuse to review that."
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1538.601,1541.616,I know and I'm not asking you to review it.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1546.892,1554.142,"Well, I -- so if Pickens conviction was reversed for that reason alone, if -- if for no other."
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1554.142,1572.362,"Pickens conviction by reading the Court of Appeals opinion was reversed for a violation of Bruton in the bottom line of their opinion they say, we do not have to reach the Miranda issue or discuss it but we have looked at it and we agree with the District Court and that's about it."
1978.78-99,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.362,1580.259,"Even that isn't technically accurate, federal habeas courts of appeals don't reverse convictions, do they?"
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1586.247,1586.675,That's right.
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1586.675,1600.196,They issue the writ of habeas corpus and in this case that meant that we had -- a reasonable time to retry them or let them go.
1978.78-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1602.307,1605.957,"Do you mean Pickens, isn't either one that didn't get anything out of this whole thing."
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1607.292,1611.859,I -- I think the only place you can make that finding is in his own confession.
1978.78-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1615.264,1616.716,He got $50.00 too?
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1616.716,1617.946,$50.00.
1978.78-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1617.946,1619.846,Each claimed but he was the one who didn't get anything?
1978.78-99,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1619.846,1625.34,He is the one.
1978.78-99,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1625.34,1627.579,Mr. Evans.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,1627.579,1628.889,Mr. Chief Justice --
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1628.889,1636.359,"You're going to deal with Mr. Pickens' case, differently from the other two or not?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,1636.359,1637.296,Yes.
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.296,1637.977,Alright.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,1637.977,1638.91,"Yes, if Your Honor please."
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1909.4,1910.867,All five respondents?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,1914.484,1915.236,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1915.236,1918.401,Is there any question about the involvement of the Wood brothers?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,1918.401,1920.915,"No, there is no question as I understand it."
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1920.915,1924.448,I mean in your mind or after reading the record?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,1924.448,1926.934,There's no question in my mind as to the Wood involvement.
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1926.934,1927.436,Yes.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,1927.436,1936.299,"In fact, we contend that the Wood brothers possibly along with Tommy Thomas, the supposedly impartial observer --"
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1936.299,1937.662,He was the fellow lying on the floor?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,1937.662,1938.746,Right.
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1963.636,1968.598,Why do you think those three others came there at all?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,1968.598,1972.137,If you would -- if the Court would examine the --
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1972.137,1976.047,"They did come there and the evidence was that they swept a lot of the money off the table, didn't they?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,1976.047,1978.604,"That is not the evidence, if Your Honor please."
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2010.834,2019.611,What is the -- what do you suppose the reasonable fact finder could have found as to the reason that those three others were came there all that night?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2019.611,2028.374,"Well, it's a -- Mr. Justice Stewart if would consider the confession of the statement, the all statement of Hamilton --"
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2028.374,2028.719,Uh-huh.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2028.719,2031.537,-- which was presented to the jury.
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2067.407,2067.714,Yes.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2067.714,2071.42,-- “I want you to come and may you bring some of your friends.”
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2081.987,2088.05,Where the Wood brothers white man and the three respondents Negroes?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2088.05,2088.592,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2088.592,2089.647,The three others.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2091.083,2104.049,And the -- the entire episode carries a very interesting scenario and we have a situation here where the -- the evidence that was presented.
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2132.551,2134.997,Didn't we take this on one point only?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2134.997,2136.236,"Yes, if Your Honor please."
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2136.236,2140.476,But how do we get to harmless error?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2140.476,2143.028,Involved in the Harrington case.
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2180.414,2184.35,But why do you think Bruton is in there?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2187.262,2205.28,Bruton stood for the proposition that the admission into evidence of statements of co-defendants which implicate each other and where these co-defendants do not take the stand to testify and be available for cross-examination violates the co-defendants right to confrontation and cross-examination.
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2205.28,2217.452,"But in this case -- in this case, going to the state's argument, the only people that didn't confess were those that weren't arrested?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2217.452,2218.832,The only ones who did not confess --
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2218.832,2219.358,No.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2220.742,2222.508,All confessed except --
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2222.508,2222.677,Right.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2222.677,2224.531,-- in our opinion the crucial man.
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2224.531,2225.01,Except one.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2225.01,2232.77,Joe Wood was the link between these three respondents and the one who actually fired the fatal blow.
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2234.279,2234.907,Trying to finish.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2234.907,2239.739,-- there are certain facts in this case that are undisputed without any question.
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2247.71,2249.18,"And he was the card player, wasn't he?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2249.18,2249.535,Yes.
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2300.768,2302.898,Some of which he considered his anyway?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2302.898,2303.26,Right.
1978.78-99,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2307.523,2313.979,"But taking money isn't essential to the crime of robbery under Tennessee law, is it?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2313.979,2321.354,"No, but these respondents were convicted of murder in the perpetration of a robbery."
1978.78-99,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2322.818,2329.016,It doesn't or -- doesn't robbery simple require the --
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2329.016,2330.831,Forcible taking.
1978.78-99,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2330.831,2340.737,-- or in attempt to take with the threat to use great bodily force?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2340.737,2349.55,"If there was an attempt which was not consummated, I believe and you can correct me that that would be an offense of attempted robbery."
1978.78-99,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2354.602,2359.659,So you have to actually succeed under Tennessee law in getting the money in order for it to be robbery?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2359.659,2375.085,"Oh, I understand -- we will not -- we will not go there far if you please Mr. Justice Rehnquist and saying that the robbery had to be consummated at the time of the murder in order for that to be a violation of the statute."
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2425.845,2428.212,Didn't George testify to that?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2428.212,2428.923,Who is that?
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2428.923,2432.009,"Didn't the man who testified, did he say that they were there?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2432.009,2433.073,But if the Court --
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2433.073,2434.144,Didn't he?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2434.144,2434.261,Not -- not --
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2434.261,2435.655,"Without evidence, wasn't it?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2435.655,2437.307,"No, if Your Honor please."
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2437.307,2437.833,What?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2437.833,2445.562,Did -- the testimony was assumed that they were there and the record will show that three out Robert Wood's testimony.
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2461.896,2468.303,If he -- if he met them for a second isn't that testimony that they were there?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2468.303,2469.671,"No, if Your Honor please."
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2469.671,2473.652,"Well, how long does that mean, two seconds?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2473.652,2479.019,I -- he - he did not testify that they were there.
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2563.586,2566.883,"You don't want us to reverse the Supreme Court, do you?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2566.883,2586.68,"If Your Honor please, we would like for this Court to support the opinions of the Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee and the Sixth Circuit puts all three of these courts in reviewing the whole record."
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2587.213,2589.856,"Actually, all you want is an affirmance of the Court of Appeals."
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2589.856,2590.926,That is correct.
1978.78-99,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2609.271,2610.979,"No, one court."
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2610.979,2611.514,I'm sorry.
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2615.235,2616.747,Where you in the state proceedings?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2616.747,2618.613,"No, I was not If Your Honor please."
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2618.613,2624.536,Do you know if the intermediate Court of Appeals of the state dealt with the Miranda issue at all?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2624.536,2634.495,The -- the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals dealt with the sufficiency of the conviction on felony murder or murder in the perpetration of robbery in the Bruton rule.
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2634.495,2636.557,But it did not reach the Miranda issue?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2636.557,2637.329,"No, it did not."
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2637.329,2640.847,"And neither that the Court of -- neither the Supreme Court of Tennessee, I take it?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2640.847,2641.237,"No, it did not."
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2641.237,2642.2,It just reversed?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2642.2,2642.769,Right
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2642.769,2649.794,"So, what this -- what the highest courts of the state think of the Miranda issue, we have no idea at all?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2649.794,2650.436,No.
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2650.436,2653.784,And so the issue has never been exhausted in the Tennessee Courts?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2653.784,2660.683,The issue was raised in the -- it was raised in the Court of Appeals --
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2660.683,2663.833,"If it was though presented -- never presented in the state Supreme Court, was it?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2663.833,2668.239,"I believe it was, if Your Honor please, but the Court did not address itself to those issue."
1978.78-99,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2676.692,2682.189,But if a state Supreme Court has present three federal constitutional claims.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2691.104,2701.82,"Well, the Court of Criminal Appeals felt that the reversal on the grounds of insufficiency of the felony murder and Bruton was --"
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2701.82,2710.028,"That would be true -- that would be true, the Bruton issue would dispose of the case but the -- that decision got reversed by the Court of -- by the Supreme Court of Tennessee."
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2710.028,2710.691,That is correct.
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2714.484,2723.554,"Yes, but the question then remains, what about the Miranda issue, was that ever decided by Tennessee courts?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2730.014,2731.765,The Miranda issue as I recall was not --
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2731.765,2744.006,"Because the convictions were affirmed by the Tennessee Supreme Court and if the Miranda issue was presented, I suppose it was rejected."
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2744.006,2744.89,It would not have been.
1978.78-99,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2764.414,2778.467,"Yes, but the question is when did the -- these respondents raised the Miranda issue in the state courts and then one of the state courts."
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2778.467,2780.547,It was raised initially in the trial court.
1978.78-99,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2780.547,2782.823,And was it also raised in the Court of Criminal Appeals?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2782.823,2784.403,I believe so if Your Honor please.
1978.78-99,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2784.403,2784.872,"Well, I know."
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2788.902,2797.54,"It was raised to the best of my recollection that the records are pretty faked and I came in at the District Court, U.S. District Court Level."
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2808.225,2817.536,What -- did various in every state it seems the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Tennessee over the intermediary court.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2825.09,2832.582,The respondents appeal that conviction from -- on the trial court decision to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2832.582,2832.891,Right.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2832.891,2851.768,"It was on appeal and after the Court of Criminal Appeals reversed all the term of the convictions on the basis of Bruton and insufficiency of the evidence on the state of Tennessee's felony murder rule, the state appeal that decision to the Tennessee Supreme Court."
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2851.768,2859.474,"Well under the law of Tennessee, does the whole thing go up or does just the constitutional part of it all?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2859.474,2863.432,Those issues that were raised in the court below would go up.
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2863.432,2865.95,"Now, all of it."
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2870.488,2873.491,It went -- it would go to the Court of Criminal Appeals.
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2873.491,2875.34,"Then after that, will it go to the Supreme Court?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2875.34,2878.982,That was decided by the Court of Appeals will go to the Supreme Court.
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2878.982,2879.647,"Yes, that's --"
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2879.647,2884.491,That was -- that was decided or everything that was right?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2884.491,2886.284,That was decided if Your Honor please --
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2886.284,2899.444,Because all the Criminal Court of Appeals decided was that the conviction should be reversed for two reasons insufficiency of the evidence to prove a felony murder and secondly a violence of Bruton.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2905.407,2905.476,Right.
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2905.476,2906.959,-- reverse the convictions.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2940.24,2940.569,Right.
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2942.46,2949.948,"And therefore my brother Marshall's question, I guess is some importance, was there before them the Miranda claim?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2949.948,2950.769,It was -- not before --
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2950.769,2953.991,Which should not been dealt with by the Court of Criminal Appeals eventhough it raised there.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2953.991,2955.334,Right.
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2958.925,2960.375,"It was -- certainly, it wasn't surely wasn't dealt with and --"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2960.375,2964.449,It wasn't dealt with but presented on appeal from the trial court.
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2964.449,2965.081,Uh-huh.
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2965.081,2968.225,You say it wasn't presented to the Tennessee Supreme Court?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2968.225,2968.726,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2972.084,2973.75,"Yes, but not to the Tennessee Supreme Court."
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2973.75,2974.088,Right.
1978.78-99,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2974.373,2975.242,The only way you --
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2975.242,2977.172,The state was the appellant there.
1978.78-99,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2977.172,2980.114,"Sure, the only way you would present it --"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2980.114,2981.344,If we have lost --
1978.78-99,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2981.344,2987.434,"-- would be on the ground, look we raise this other question and even if we're going to lose on these two, we are entitled to hear that one."
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2989.3,2993.366,"No, they really -- respondents did not have to present or raise a new issue before this --"
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2993.366,2994.617,Before the appellant?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,2994.617,2994.863,Right.
1978.78-99,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2998.537,3008.011,"I'm just inquiring whether there's been exhaustion in terms of federal habeas corpus of the Miranda issue, exhaustion in the state court?"
1978.78-99,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3008.011,3010.14,"Well, were you in the habeas proceedings?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,3010.14,3012.898,I was in the District Court--
1978.78-99,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3012.898,3013.303,In the --
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,3013.303,3014.05,"Right, in the habeas --"
1978.78-99,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3014.05,3020.944,And did the state ever raised any to failure to exhaust as a reason for denying --
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,3020.944,3021.274,Not on --
1978.78-99,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3021.274,3022.263,-- in having habeas?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,3022.263,3023.772,"Not on these issues, if the Court please --"
1978.78-99,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3023.772,3024.984,"Well, in any issue?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,3024.984,3026.887,"Yes, if Your Honor please."
1978.78-99,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3036.802,3039.785,But this -- but the Miranda obviously was not one them because --
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,3039.785,3040.29,"No, it was not."
1978.78-99,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3040.29,3041.927,-- at least the court decided the Miranda.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,3041.927,3044.11,That is correct.
1978.78-99,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3044.11,3051.08,"Well, certainly the Tennessee Supreme Court went so far as to affirm the convictions."
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,3051.08,3051.706,That is correct.
1978.78-99,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3051.706,3054.898,They did send the case back for consideration of the Miranda case.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,3054.898,3056.393,They did not.
1978.78-99,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3056.393,3061.352,"Which would indicate, it was not raise or if it was not raised or if it was raised, they decided they rejected it?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,3061.352,3062.972,Right.
1978.78-99,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3076.496,3077.944,"Of course, when we granted certiorari."
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,3080.312,3081.2,That is correct.
1978.78-99,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3253.332,3259.579,"Is that really before us Mr. Evans, on the petition that was granted?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,3259.579,3267.602,It -- in considering the tainted evidence against the untainted evidence.
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3314.279,3318.932,Did the testimony show that this five people heard the shot?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,3322.395,3322.653,The --
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3322.653,3324.288,When they heard the shot?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,3324.288,3326.456,"The -- the -- as I read the record, Mr. Justice --"
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3326.456,3329.26,"The witnesses, those five witnesses?"
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,3329.26,3335.513,"As I read the record Mr. Justice Marshall, the witnesses merely testified to what they observed outside the apartment."
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3337.294,3342.185,"Well, that turned me again to wonder why these three went in."
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3343.518,3344.821,As curious.
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3344.821,3347.989,They just – these three were more curious than the five?
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,3347.989,3349.464,Of which three are you referring to?
1978.78-99,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3349.464,3350.21,Your client.
1978.78-99,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3350.21,3351.48,Your client.
1978.78-99,1,44599,walter_l_evans,,3351.48,3364.498,The state contends they went in and of course the Court could -- couldn't possibly conclude that they did or some of them did go into the apartment.
1978.78-99,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3433.92,3435.847,Do you have anything further counsel?
1978.78-99,2,36817,michael_e_terry,,3435.847,3437.621,Yes.
1978.78-99,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3460.346,3460.609,Right.
1978.78-99,2,36817,michael_e_terry,,3460.609,3463.362,-- and it wasn't before the Supreme Court of Tennessee.
1978.78-99,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3513.483,3519.185,But Mr. Evans -- isn't his argument if I understood it correctly that some confessions are more probative than others.
1978.78-99,2,36817,michael_e_terry,,3541.079,3541.589,Well --
1978.78-99,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3541.589,3543.57,Isn't that -- isn't that a valid argument?
1978.78-99,2,36817,michael_e_terry,,3543.57,3546.651,I think I have to reflect that one.
1978.78-99,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3546.651,3550.967,Because he did argue did he not that the confessions were not voluntary?
1978.78-99,2,36817,michael_e_terry,,3550.967,3554.255,He did but that point was not before the Sixth Circuit.
1978.78-99,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3554.919,3559.18,"No, but it close to the – at this point it goes to the quality of that evidence."
1978.78-99,2,36817,michael_e_terry,,3559.18,3562.761,That issue was -- all was decided outside the presence of the jury.
1978.78-99,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3563.542,3564.169,"Oh, I see."
1978.78-99,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3567.388,3571.443,"Well, didn't the District Court say it was one of them?"
1978.78-99,2,36817,michael_e_terry,,3571.443,3571.992,One of them.
1978.78-99,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3574.953,3575.579,Violation of Miranda?
1978.78-99,2,36817,michael_e_terry,,3575.579,3578.109,Violation of access to counsel.
1978.78-99,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3578.109,3578.951,Pickens?
1978.78-99,2,36817,michael_e_terry,,3578.951,3580.982,Access to counsel.
1978.78-99,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3581.76,3582.487,Thank you gentlemen.
