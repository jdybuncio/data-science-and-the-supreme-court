1972.72-95,0,40318,r_jackson_rose,,33.857,41.329,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court."
1972.72-95,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,134.774,137.577,No reference to this claim at that time?
1972.72-95,0,40318,r_jackson_rose,,137.577,141.44,"No, Your Honor, none."
1972.72-95,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,163.607,165.481,In what year is this now you've moved?
1972.72-95,0,40318,r_jackson_rose,,165.481,170.488,Then we have moved to 1967.
1972.72-95,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,388.895,400.099,Would you just think that he had any kind of waiver in 1964 when he sought habeas corpus release and did not raise the claim?
1972.72-95,0,40318,r_jackson_rose,,400.099,411.345,"Yes, Your Honor, as a matter of fact I filed a motion to dismiss the petition for that reason in the district court."
1972.72-95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,618.477,626.521,"General Rose, under the Tennessee procedure, at what point was it required to be raised, if it were --?"
1972.72-95,0,40318,r_jackson_rose,,626.521,631.481,"Before a plea was entered to the indictment, whether there be plea of guilty or not guilty."
1972.72-95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,631.481,632.935,Anytime before a plea?
1972.72-95,0,40318,r_jackson_rose,,632.935,635.993,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,635.993,639.462,"And what, I know there was a guilty plea in this case --"
1972.72-95,0,40318,r_jackson_rose,,639.462,639.703,Yes.
1972.72-95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,639.703,645.535,-- does the record show what happened if anything before the plea was entered?
1972.72-95,0,40318,r_jackson_rose,,646.958,649.963,Just that there was --
1972.72-95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,649.963,655.513,"You just assumed there were things, is that it, or does the record show something?"
1972.72-95,0,40318,r_jackson_rose,,655.513,657.826,"Maybe the record does not show, Your Honor."
1972.72-95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,661.106,663.221,Were there any Motions filed of any kind?
1972.72-95,0,40318,r_jackson_rose,,663.221,667.165,"There is no indication that there was, Your Honor."
1972.72-95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,678.16,682.489,Did the (Inaudible) your client as he saw it by way of negotiation with the prior with the state --
1972.72-95,0,40318,r_jackson_rose,,682.489,684.084,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-95,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,847.015,848.662,Mr. Hoefle.
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,848.662,852.896,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may I please the Court."
1972.72-95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,976.023,984.417,You think he is waiting more than 20 years to assert the right has as a factor in the case?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,984.417,986.197,"I think it's a pathetic factor, Your Honor."
1972.72-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1014.932,1018.424,Has the laws changed since then?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1018.424,1020.83,I don't think the law has ever changed on this point Your Honor.
1972.72-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.384,1025.271,Do you have to (Inaudible)
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1025.271,1030.393,"No, but since 1880 this has been a violation of --"
1972.72-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.393,1033.758,(Inaudible) changed with Solicitor General?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1033.758,1034.546,I don't think so.
1972.72-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.762,1052.709,Was there anything in this (Inaudible) in this record to impeach the --
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1052.709,1058.397,I think the fact that he was unaware of the right to object.
1972.72-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1059.433,1070.04,"I know, but that might indicate that he might not have known of his right to object to about the composition of the jury."
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1075.356,1082.549,"He alleged, and he has alleged that his guilty plea was more or less coerced out of him."
1972.72-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1088.921,1091.42,Did he allege his attorney was incompetent?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1091.42,1105.132,"No, he alleged his Attorney was not there at the time the arrangement was made for the plea, four days before his trial date they took him out into the meeting with the prosecutor, and the police, and threatening with a chair."
1972.72-95,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1109.232,1115.135,"There is also some indication in the record or somewhere that there was no corpus delicti, that there was no murder by anybody?"
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1115.135,1116.531,Also the --
1972.72-95,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1116.531,1118.517,That the so called victim died of pneumonia?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1118.517,1119.35,"Pneumonia, that's correct."
1972.72-95,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1152.193,1160.688,"His testimony on page 85 in the record, is this on the raise, Mr. Henderson, you plead guilty, is that right?"
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1189.739,1191.36,"This is all I have Your Honor, what is in there --"
1972.72-95,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1191.36,1192.005,It's all --
1972.72-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.005,1196.646,Is there a transcript of the proceedings' excerpts at all?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1196.646,1203.696,"This I don't know, it would not be -- I was appointed by the Sixth Circuit and I never had access to the Tennessee records down there, Your Honor."
1972.72-95,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1234.719,1238.765,Mr. Murray does rather truly indicated that the petitioner did plead guilty or doesn't he --
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1238.765,1240.514,"Yes, there is no question if there was a plea of guilty."
1972.72-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1243.195,1245.575,What do you mean there is no question of the plea of guilty?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1245.575,1246.827,There was a plea of guilty.
1972.72-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1272.847,1281.941,"So isn't there some connection between these two issues as to whether -- I mean, his conviction rests on his plea of guilty?"
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1281.941,1283.31,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1284.271,1290.377,And when he was represented by counsel?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1290.377,1294.396,I think -- I am sorry.
1972.72-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1294.396,1304.974,"Are there rights to go to trial or rights to be indicted by some of the kind of a jury, they may have existed, but he pleaded guilty."
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1323.779,1325.051,I don't think so Your Honor.
1972.72-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1325.051,1326.616,Mann and Parker and Brady cases.
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1326.616,1337.8,"Well, first of all those cases all evolved about -- there was a consultation between counsel and client in those cases."
1972.72-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1339.06,1340.87,Is that issue here?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1340.87,1348.965,"I think it has got a lot to do as far as the grand jury, because there was no consultation. Henderson didn't know about it, the lawyer didn't know about it."
1972.72-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1361.873,1372.801,"You are saying the reason for -- isn't barred by McMann and that line of cases, because this was an incompetent counsel case."
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1375.066,1375.225,That the part --
1972.72-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1375.225,1376.897,And he wasn't advised?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1376.897,1383.513,"That's part of it, and also another part is, it wasn't really voluntary, he didn't attack that, but these are all facets of the same thing."
1972.72-95,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1383.513,1386.434,"He didn't attack the voluntariness of the plea, is that?"
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1386.434,1388.432,"No, but I think it's almost implicit --"
1972.72-95,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1388.432,1391.313,"Although here at least he testified, he never plead guilty at all?"
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1391.313,1391.899,That's true.
1972.72-95,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1391.899,1394.12,But obviously a plea of guilty was entered though?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1394.12,1396.199,These are all part of the same thing.
1972.72-95,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1407.07,1421.204,"I notice that at the end here at pages 8, A128, there are excerpts of proceedings in 1948, largely they were dealing with the selection of the jury."
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1431.698,1435.982,"There is Your Honor, A137."
1972.72-95,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1435.982,1437.213,A 137?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1437.213,1440.678,"Yes, this is -- it's not a transcript --"
1972.72-95,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1440.678,1440.823,Oh!
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1442.234,1445.273,"Pardon me, 135."
1972.72-95,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1455.782,1456.838,Right.
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1456.838,1458.932,"-- and I assume they were all white also, but he didn't (Voice Overlap)"
1972.72-95,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1458.932,1467.737,Whether there was any colloquy between judge and this petitioner when his plea was entered?(Voice Overlap)
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1467.737,1474.671,Another thing that the requirements of Boykin about the fact that the Judge must satisfy himself.
1972.72-95,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1474.671,1476.283,"Yes, but this was back in 1948?"
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1476.283,1477.68,Righ.
1972.72-95,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1477.68,1486.605,"But there doesn't seem to be at least any transcript of any proceeding, involving any kind of colloquy with the court when his plea of guilty was entered?"
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1486.605,1501.02,"I could find then Your Honor there are transcripts in your testimony that occurred at the habeas corpus hearing in the State Court, which is what was relied upon by the in lieu of the hearing by the Federal District court."
1972.72-95,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1501.02,1507.352,"Well, did you allege in your Federal habeas that the plea of guilty was involuntary?"
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1507.352,1509.923,"Henderson did Your Honor, it was per se."
1972.72-95,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1512.052,1517.472,And what was the district court's ruling on that aspect of his petition?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1517.472,1536.797,"He defined to consider, he indicated I believe that -- first of all he went forth on the systematic exclusion issue, and did not consider the others."
1972.72-95,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1536.797,1546.173,"But it doesn't have much do about it, but in the journal entry as you call it, as you just read the case that after a guilty plea the jury was impaneled and so on."
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1546.173,1546.827,"Yes, to sentence."
1972.72-95,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1546.827,1553.115,"That's a little alien to what is done in most jurisdictions, isn't it?(Voice Overlap)"
1972.72-95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1553.115,1554.627,It was on the punishment wasn't it?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1554.627,1556.556,That was just for the punishment.
1972.72-95,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1556.556,1557.824,(Inaudible)
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1557.824,1558.958,And they --
1972.72-95,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1558.958,1561.263,"At that stage, at least to that time the jury has --"
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1561.263,1563.99,I assume they were all white --
1972.72-95,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1563.99,1573.45,-- although the indication was from General Rose that the punishment had been kind of agreed upon beforehand.
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1573.45,1578.479,"It would seemed that there have been some discussion, but I would see how we can infer that."
1972.72-95,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1578.479,1582.88,"Well, it says, they find that the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree?"
1972.72-95,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1582.88,1584.496,And that was after a guilty plea?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1584.496,1590.067,"Yes, I guess based on the plea they determined the guilt and went on from there."
1972.72-95,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1590.067,1599.034,"Well, just like the British men where the jury is instructed to find a man guilty stealing the watch go out and receive verdict, is that what they say?"
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1599.034,1606.61,"I am not sure it doesn't say, I am not familiar with Tennessee procedure, Your Honor, I am sorry."
1972.72-95,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1606.61,1626.35,"Is it fair to say that Mr. Henderson might have had a little luck here, I suppose his counsel had raised the point back in 1948 and suppose that there had been a new indictment by a validly selected grand jury, and he had been tried and convicted, he might have been executed, might he not?"
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1626.35,1628.675,"Yes, he might have."
1972.72-95,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1644.049,1657.423,"Mr. Hoefle, under Tennessee practice at that time, when the guilty determined punishment after the entry of a guilty plea, was that limited to giving him a -- well, or was a death penalty then excluded?"
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1657.423,1660.755,"That I don't -- not by statute, I don't believe and there are some states have excluded that --"
1972.72-95,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1660.755,1663.136,"You mean, if he pleaded guilty, and he might still have got the death penalty?"
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1663.136,1668.203,"I believe that's correct Your Honor, but I really -- I don't want to give you definitive answer on that --"
1972.72-95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1668.203,1688.82,"Is it possible, reasonable that in this kind of a negotiation for a plea that the prosecutor would then and going to the county jury make certain the plea negotiation was carried out --"
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1688.82,1689.112,I assume that was possible.
1972.72-95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1689.112,1690.502,-- as certain as he could?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1690.502,1692.001,"I assume it is possible, Your Honor."
1972.72-95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1692.001,1697.731,That is he would ask for only a life sentence not for the death penalty?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1697.731,1709.713,"The only thing is again, in one of our recent theories and cases last year, I don't remember which one, but it was stated real emphatically that it's impossible to tell what the jury would have done."
1972.72-95,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1760.506,1764.384,As if he get to pleaded not guilty without having a motion?
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1764.384,1765.552,"Without motion, yes."
1972.72-95,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1766.452,1774.388,"Once he pleaded to the indictment, he waived that he has the right to make any motions challenging in the grand jury, that's your point?"
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1774.388,1775.331,"That's my point, Your Honor."
1972.72-95,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1864.745,1876.455,"This case in your state -- the Supreme Court, you had concurring opinion stating just what you have said, didn't you that at least the 1948, that nobody would have thought of bringing this up?"
1972.72-95,1,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,1876.455,1892.271,"Yes and that I would believe that was a Court of Criminal Appeals and then in Tennessee Supreme Court I believe in another opinion said that rather regretfully declined Henderson the relief and said perhaps it is over due, it should come from someone higher than us and here we are."
