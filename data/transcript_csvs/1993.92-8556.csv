1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.228,"We'll hear argument next in No. 92-8556, Kenneth O. Nichols v. the United States."
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,49.344,55.479,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-8556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,170.991,183.43,"Well, assuming that is so, for the original DWI conviction there was no jail sentence imposed, right?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,183.43,184.511,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-8556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,184.511,191.485,"So that that sentence, under our holding in the Scott case, is not unconstitutional."
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,191.485,192.036,That is--
1993.92-8556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.036,197.64,"The conviction and sentence for the DWI are not unconstitutional, right?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,197.64,203.904,"--Under the holding of Scott, Your Honor, that DUI conviction was not unconstitutional at the time it was imposed--"
1993.92-8556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,203.904,205.156,"Right, and you accept that."
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,205.156,212.993,"--And I accept that, but for the limited reason that there was no fine, or rather no term of imprisonment or incarceration."
1993.92-8556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.993,232.333,"Now, I suppose that at most sentencings it is possible for the sentencing authority to consider even prior acts for which there is not even a conviction in terms of determining a sentence?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,232.333,245.564,"Your Honor, it is true that under the Guidelines a judge is entitled... a district judge is entitled and required to consider, to hear, and to weigh such evidence to determine what impact it should have."
1993.92-8556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,247.427,255.071,"I mean, what makes this particular prior conviction less reliable than that kind of evidence?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,255.071,270.191,"--Your Honor, I believe that the thing that makes this conviction more unreliable... it's really not a question of making it quite more unreliable, as it is making it more improper to use... is the fact that under the Federal Sentencing Guide--"
1993.92-8556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,270.191,272.054,"Well, but now it's not unconstitutional."
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,272.054,273.493,--It isn't initially.
1993.92-8556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,273.493,274.615,There's nothing unlawful about it.
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,274.615,278.766,"No, Your Honor, not initially for the limited purpose of giving him a money fine."
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,278.766,288.133,"Well, you say... you talk as though there's some sort of a springing use concept, that the conviction wasn't unconstitutional initially."
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,291.285,292.016,"I am, Your Honor."
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,339.487,345.323,May I just ask you those purposes for which you agree it is valid?
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,350.938,354.459,"--So long as there is no term of imprisonment, yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,354.459,355.82,"That's right, just criminal status, he's got a record."
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,355.82,356.241,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,356.241,358.825,And it's valid for purposes of a fine.
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,358.825,359.666,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,359.666,360.277,A substantial one.
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,368.693,369.724,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,369.724,382.333,"Why isn't it valid... why shouldn't it be valid, why isn't it reliable enough to be used to identify a class of individuals who are going to be subject to a heavier penalty in the future?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,398.455,403.049,I think the reason why it is un... it is improper is because of its unreliability.
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,404.859,411.684,"Well, but where... where... where does the relative unreliability... how do you draw the line on relative unreliability?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,426.545,431.429,"--Well, frankly, Your Honor, I think that the distinction is... is that of incarceration."
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,437.523,456.556,"Well, would your answer... would your answer be different if the individual had an opportunity before he was sentenced, as giving... giving weight to the first conviction, to prove that, in fact, he didn't do what, on the record, he appears to have been convicted of?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,458.398,474.12,"--Your Honor, if the judge had a weighing and sentencing... in the sentencing determination was able to himself weigh something then yes, I think an argument could be made that even though it's initially unreliable, that the judge, since he has some discretion, could decide how much weight to give."
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,474.12,489.311,"Well, doesn't... doesn't the judge have that discretion under the Guidelines, because he can depart downward if the criminal... if he is satisfied that the criminal history does not give an adequate or accurate indication of the... of the individual's past culpability?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,489.311,499.668,"I think it is true that under the Sentencing Guidelines the judge does... if he finds a reason which he articulates and which will stand on appeal, that he can depart."
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,501.611,507.144,"Well, you could... you could give him that reason, couldn't you, if you said, look, this was an unreliable conviction because, in fact, I didn't do it?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,507.144,507.695,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,507.695,511.248,And I'll... I'll bring in a couple of witnesses to show that I didn't.
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,518.183,524.236,--Except that the judge does not have an option to determine what sentencing range it is within which he is to be sentenced.
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,539.387,554.006,"Yeah, but the judge... the judge can then... if the judge is satisfied that the... that the criminal history is not sufficient... is not adequately revealing of the facts, he can then depart downwards so that a person in your client's position would come out the same way as if it hadn't been considered in the first place."
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,554.738,557.259,--Only if there is an adequate justification for that.
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,557.259,557.509,"Well, that's right."
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,568.07,572.291,"Well, I think it is true there can be a downward departure."
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,577.857,588.522,"But you... do you agree with me that there is an opportunity to show the unreliability, and if that unreliability is shown the judge has an opportunity to consider that in a downward departure?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,588.522,589.744,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,589.744,589.944,Okay.
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,589.944,593.577,"Subject to, of course, being reversed if he gave undue deference or weight to it."
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,702.306,710.971,"Well, they've have a right... would they have a right to appointed counsel if they chose to contest the thing across the board and not simply agree to pay a fine?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,710.971,714.234,"If they were indigent, they would have the right to find appointed counsel."
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,760.124,771.932,"Well, you say they're unreliable and therefore that the person not only chose to pay the fine, but chose to pay the fine when he could have defended... successfully defended the action?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,771.932,773.384,"That's right, Your Honor, and that can happen."
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,773.384,774.716,"Well, what reason do you have for thinking that?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,774.716,777.059,"Well, Your Honor, experience."
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,779.56,782.542,"Well, but anything... anything other than your own personal experience?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,782.542,797.144,"--Well, Your Honor, I think my personal experience and I think the Court's decisions that have... in Gideon, in Argersinger, and in Scott that have noted that the process... we're all human with all of our frailties in the system."
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,811.004,817.109,Do you think that the basis for Gideon and Argersinger and Scott was reliability?
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,817.109,819.93,"Well, I think that's one of the things that the Court--"
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,819.93,822.371,"Well, do you think they were heavily relied on, say, in Gideon?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,822.371,825.304,"--Well, perhaps not."
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,827.117,828.487,I mean in the opinion.
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,829.388,829.579,--Right.
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,829.579,832.35,--Unspoken minds of the justices.
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,832.35,848.231,"I believe that reliability is essentially the key to why we want to have counsel, is that counsel makes the system more reliable by making certain that the accused is aware of the significance of what they're doing."
1993.92-8556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,848.231,863.94,"Suppose that the accused was advised that one of the consequences of the conviction that could be entered if he proceeded without counsel and entered a plea of nolo contendere, was that the sentence could late be escalated based on a previous conviction?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,863.94,864.671,If Your Honor--
1993.92-8556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,864.671,865.602,Would that resolve your problem?
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,865.602,867.435,"--Your Honor, I believe it would resolve my problem."
1993.92-8556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,868.874,870.547,Would that make the conviction more reliable?
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,870.547,887.897,"--If there is a facially valid waiver of counsel indicating on the face of the document that the rights were read, that the defendant waived the right, then I think that that does enhance the reliability of the conviction, yes."
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,887.897,894.792,Why does it enhance reliability as opposed simply to making it fair to stick the defendant with the conviction?
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,896.853,898.045,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I did not hear--"
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,898.045,911.034,"I mean if... you're saying that the waiver of counsel makes the conviction without counsel more reliable, and my question is why does it make it more reliable as opposed merely to making it more fair to charge him with it, reliable or not?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,911.034,914.666,"--Well, it makes it more reliable--"
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,914.666,914.876,Isn't the only difference--
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,914.876,925.825,"--Because at least we know that what has been explained to the man is that... or the woman who faced the lower court, that the judge took the time to explain that they did have a right to a trial, that they did have a right to confront the witnesses."
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,928.565,939.051,"--No, but... that goes to waiver, but why does it make the resulting uncounseled conviction more reliable as to... I assume as to the facts which it imports?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,939.051,943.024,"--Well, I suppose the answer to that is perhaps it doesn't, but because there was still no counsel."
1993.92-8556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,973.577,987.246,"Mr. Carter, do I understand that what you're saying is what is needed here is something comparable to a Rule 11 plea that this is a piece of information that the judge should have told the defendant the possible consequences?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1001.253,1002.235,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-8556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1037.233,1041.564,--But you're saying it could not be a valid waiver without an explanation of this collateral consequences--
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1041.564,1044.047,"Your Honor, all there needs to be is a facially valid waiver."
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1056.424,1060.008,"--Well, that would be contrary to Scott if you allowed that, would it not?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1060.008,1063.621,"Well, that would require that that be done prior and in a prior event."
1993.92-8556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1074.57,1086.855,"The one part of your presentation that puzzled me, you said in your reply brief that underlying conduct could be taken into account."
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1094.412,1104.427,"--Well, I think that under the Guidelines that you can, within the sentencing range, take into account conduct to determine where in that particular range that it can fall because of conduct."
1993.92-8556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1105.569,1108.541,Conduct that's unrelated to the present offense we're talking about.
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1108.541,1108.972,"--Right, right."
1993.92-8556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1108.972,1117.928,"But you're saying that the judge could have considered this very conduct, the DUI conduct, could consider the conduct but not the sentence, is that it?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1117.928,1124.111,"If it was... if it was... if it turned out that the judge, in his discretion, felt that it was reliable after hearing evidence about the conduct, yes."
1993.92-8556,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1131.047,1143.045,"Mr. Carter, would you allow the judge to receive evidence of the uncounseled conviction as proof of the underlying facts, but not automatically add the point to the criminal history score?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1143.045,1144.477,Could the Court repeat the question?
1993.92-8556,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1144.767,1151.58,Your position is that the conviction does not automatically... should not automatically add another point to the criminal history score.
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1151.58,1152.731,"Right, should not, that's correct."
1993.92-8556,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1152.731,1163.88,"In your view, in the judge's review, to the extent he has discretion under the Guidelines, could he receive the conviction in evidence for the purpose of understanding what, in fact, happened, but without giving it the automatic triggering effect?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1163.88,1165.139,"I think that he could, Your Honor."
1993.92-8556,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1171.025,1175.539,And then he would decide whether or not to increase the criminal history score.
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1175.539,1179.551,"--Yes, Your Honor, but he... well, no, I don't think he would be deciding whether to increase the criminal history score."
1993.92-8556,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1181.604,1181.784,That's--
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1181.784,1187.458,I would espouse a rule that says you don't change the Guideline range if there is no lawyer or if there's no waiver of counsel.
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1214.289,1218.882,"--But when you say the Court held, there was no Court opinion in Baldasar, was there?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1218.882,1219.353,--That is correct.
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1222.515,1227.841,And was there any lowest common denominator that represented the views of five justices?
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1227.841,1255.177,"Your Honor, I believe that the view that represents the views of the five justices is that if the prior misdemeanor conviction was uncounseled, even though there was only a money fine, that if that prior misdemeanor conviction was for an offense of more than 6 months, more than a petty offense as Justice Blackmun said, then I think that that is unconstitutional and cannot be used to change the... automatically change the Sentencing Guideline range in this case."
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1255.177,1261.681,"Well, were there... was there a line of reasoning supported by a majority of the justices?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1261.681,1264.893,"Your Honor, I have to combine the reasoning, as the Court knows."
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1264.893,1267.277,So the case is not... is not binding precedent.
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1267.277,1271.198,"Your Honor, I think not only... I think it should be binding precedent."
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1271.198,1274.07,"Well, but under our decisions is it or is it not binding?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1274.07,1283.016,"Your Honor, I think that that is the lowest common denominator that, under Marks, could be found to be binding precedent, but I'm... I will leave that to the decision of the Court."
1993.92-8556,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1283.016,1283.367,What do you mean by binding precedent?
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1284.819,1290.953,"Well, Your Honor, I have finally reached the court where you can always overrule, so I certainly know that it can be overruled."
1993.92-8556,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.953,1292.022,"--We are never totally bound, are we?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1292.022,1293.875,"No, Your Honor, you're not ever totally bound."
1993.92-8556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1316.621,1317.661,Maybe this is same--
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1317.661,1318.312,And why should it become more reliable later?
1993.92-8556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1318.312,1322.485,--Why does the waiver of it make the result more reliable?
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1343.081,1348.296,"The reason it doesn't make it unconstitutional is because under Scott it wasn't unconstitutional, even though there was no lawyer."
1993.92-8556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.296,1350.145,We're not talking about unconstitutionality here.
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1369.44,1371.751,"Your Honor, I'll certainly accept that interpretation."
1993.92-8556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.302,1375.836,"Oh, don't do it, except for the reason that it's true."
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1380.517,1381.068,"Well, that's correct, Your Honor, and I'm not arguing it is."
1993.92-8556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1381.068,1386.922,--But in that case why is it that you're willing to accept a waiver?
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1391.816,1393.366,"Well, I mean Boykin--"
1993.92-8556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1393.366,1394.357,Why does the waiver make it reliable?
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1394.357,1398.07,--Boykin v. Alabama talked about the fact that there needs to be a knowing and intelligent waiver.
1993.92-8556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1399.533,1406.656,"That's for purposes of the constitutionality of the original proceeding, not for purposes of deciding whether the result of that proceeding is reliable."
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1413.191,1413.912,--I think--
1993.92-8556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1413.912,1417.154,"You have an idiotic defendant who waives counsel, says I waive it, yes, I--"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1417.154,1423.018,--I don't disagree with Your Honor that the reliability is enhanced when there's a lawyer.
1993.92-8556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1464.832,1479.201,"--Do you have any authority, social science authority or otherwise for the proposition that uncounseled misdemeanor convictions are unreliable in general?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1479.201,1490.239,"Your Honor, the only authority that I can recall from my reading is... I believe I am recalling correctly that in Argersinger and in Scott there were discussions of the fact that it is--"
1993.92-8556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1490.239,1491.909,Of a speculative nature.
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1497.705,1500.935,"--Your Honor, I do not presently, as I stand here, have such."
1993.92-8556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1540.165,1554.165,"Well, why wouldn't be an equally bright line rule to say that uncounseled misdemeanor offenses that are not unconstitutional may be used in subsequent sentencing for a subsequent offense?"
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1554.165,1564.453,"Your Honor, it would be an equally bright line rule for you to say that, but it would be an equally bright line rule that ignores the inherent unreliability of uncounseled misdemeanors."
1993.92-8556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1564.453,1571.927,You insist on talking in terms of reliability instead of in terms of fair notice to the defendant of the consequences going in.
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1582.795,1588.18,Because I'm a little bit fearful as to whether this Court would go so far as to say that we ought to have fair notice.
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1659.745,1664.149,There's quite a difference of opinion among the State courts on the Baldasar point.
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1670.134,1671.125,"--Oh, heaven's no, Your Honor, I'm not."
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1672.464,1673.907,They've split quite dramatically.
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1673.907,1677.47,"--I think that they've split less than the Federal courts have, is really what I guess I would have to say."
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.47,1677.64,Well--
1993.92-8556,0,44278,william_b_m_carter,,1677.64,1680.803,"If I may reserve my... any remaining time I have, unless the Court has more questions."
1993.92-8556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1680.803,1682.345,"--Very well, Mr. Carter."
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1684.786,1689.599,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1766.942,1780.241,"Mr. Bryson, isn't there a difference between using a factor at sentencing when the judge has broad discretion, on the one hand, and having an automatic enhancement by adding to the criminal history score and making him... perhaps making him eligible for imprisonment for the first time?"
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1780.241,1782.715,"--Your Honor, constitutionally I don't think it makes a difference."
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1804.451,1822.592,"Yes, but you have to acknowledge that here there's a difference that if you didn't have the automatic addition of the point and the judge took evidence and found that there was this bad conduct committed in the form of a misdemeanor, whether a valid conviction or not, he would have discretion as to whether to enhance or not, but under the Guidelines he doesn't."
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1822.592,1826.685,"Well, he doesn't have discretion under the Guidelines to do that, that's true."
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1828.706,1833.07,And most of your cases where you talk about using prior history have been in the discretionary context.
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1833.07,1833.291,--Yes.
1993.92-8556,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1855.179,1884.768,"Even if we were to leave that aside, was I correct in my suggestion to opposing counsel that the judge would have discretion, in effect, to... by means of downward departure to mitigate this automatic character, if the defendant came in and offered evidence to the effect that this history of his conviction was not a reliable guide to what he had actually done, because for whatever reason he could show that he had not committed the offense."
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1888.561,1906.863,"Your Honor, I'm doubtful that the Guidelines' provision for departure, which is section 4A1.3, was designed to permit a hearing in every case over whether the particular prior convictions were in fact convictions that result... that--"
1993.92-8556,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1906.863,1915.178,"Would it be the Government's position that that would be improper, that the Court should not entertain a request to present evidence for that purpose?"
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1915.178,1920.824,"--Your Honor, there may be extreme cases in which that would be a permissible application of 4A1.3."
1993.92-8556,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1953.085,1955.436,So you're saying there's got to be some kind of a high initial showing.
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1955.436,1955.596,Yes.
1993.92-8556,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1955.596,1958.209,And offer to prove something extraordinary.
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1958.209,1958.819,Yes.
1993.92-8556,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1958.819,1959.129,Yeah.
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1959.129,1959.48,At least.
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1959.48,1974.13,"Well, in this very case, for example, if you have just one that makes all the difference between one category and another, would the judge have heard evidence if he wanted to get on the stand and say it was cheaper to plead guilty than it was to hire a lawyer and I really wasn't drunk that night when I was driving, but I decided I'd take a plea?"
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1975.692,1979.085,"I don't think that, in the typical case, would be admissable."
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1979.085,1980.887,I wouldn't... in this very case I wouldn't think so.
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1980.887,1981.616,"And, in any event, there was no such suggestion here."
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1983.008,1983.298,"No, I understand."
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1988.824,1990.494,--I'm doubtful that that would support a departure.
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1992.908,2003.963,"But on the other side of the coin, if we rule for the other side, the Government could nevertheless put in the conviction as evidence supporting some additional bad characteristics of the individual, I would think."
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2003.963,2007.296,"--Within the Guidelines range, as counsel has--"
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2007.296,2009.707,"No, just as factors to be considered in total history."
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2009.707,2010.898,"--Oh, I doubt it, Your Honor."
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2010.898,2011.058,You do.
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2011.058,2022.588,"I suspect... at least if the Court adopted the position of the concurring justices in Baldasar, the conviction would be out of bounds for any purpose that could result in an enhancement of the term of imprisonment."
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2036.11,2036.841,And allowing it to be admitted into evidence.
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2036.841,2040.634,"--Or criminal history level, and just allowing it to be considered within the Guidelines range."
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2040.634,2041.906,I hadn't thought of that as being the same.
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2042.645,2055.793,"The Guidelines range is 25 months, so the judge... if the one impermissible misdemeanor conviction throws you up by 25 months it's exactly the same outcome that occurred here by changing the criminal history, so I don't think there could be a distinction on that ground."
1993.92-8556,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2055.793,2068.681,"Just to make sure I understand your answer to Justice Stevens, is it your position that it would not only be improper to introduce the conviction, but that it would be improper for the Government to attempt to introduce evidence of the underlying fact?"
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2068.681,2069.373,"No, Your Honor."
1993.92-8556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2140.402,2148.867,"But those are... are they not, Mr. Bryson, all conduct relating to the offense before the court?"
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2162.424,2176.786,"--Your Honor, the uncharged conduct referred to in Williams of course referred to uncharged other activities of the defendant that had nothing to do with the particular conduct that's at issue in the case on trial, so the answer would be in some cases yes, in other cases no."
1993.92-8556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2207.187,2223.208,But isn't there a difference between related conduct... conduct related to the offense that the judge must take into account and that can throw you into a higher range and any kind of conduct that ever... that this defendant was every involved in that is part of the defendant's background?
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2223.208,2225.949,"Your Honor, I don't think there's a difference for constitutional purposes."
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2256.189,2257.862,"Mr. Bryson, can I ask you another question?"
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2266.002,2267.391,They are in the Guidelines.
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2269.664,2269.844,Yes.
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2269.844,2272.707,"And, in fact, in Georgia where, of course, this plea was entered."
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2272.707,2272.877,Yes.
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2272.877,2288.164,"There's a specific statute that provides that the nolo contendere plea can be used in aggravation of later sentences, and the court... Georgia courts have held that it may be used in recidivism proceedings."
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2288.375,2291.199,It's kind of contrary to the theory of nolo contendere plea.
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2292.1,2295.222,"--Well, the theory, Your Honor, is that you can't use it in a civil proceeding."
1993.92-8556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2331.477,2344.717,"--But, Mr. Bryson, what about the fair notice consideration, the Rule 11 question, where judges are cautioned to be meticulous when they take a plea that the defendant is fully informed of consequences of that plea?"
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2346.349,2353.845,"Your Honor, it is my understanding that there is no requirement under Rule 11 that a defendant be notified."
1993.92-8556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2381.027,2389.144,"Mr. Bryson, I'm not talking about the general... the run of the mill case where the defendant knows when he takes a plea that he is subject to a term of imprisonment."
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2399.48,2400.331,--That's right.
1993.92-8556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2400.331,2405.402,"Because if the judge thinks incarceration is within the ballpark, the judge has to afford counsel."
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2405.402,2406.304,That's correct.
1993.92-8556,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2406.304,2407.205,So--
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2407.205,2429.369,"But, Your Honor, in this kind of setting it is... it is probably the most basic principle of... I think of sentencing that is understood by every 16-year-old that has ever stood before a juvenile court judge or justice of the peace, where the court says I'm going to give you a break this time, but I never want to see you back here and if I do I'm going to throw the book at you."
1993.92-8556,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2446.241,2447.102,"--Well, Mr. Bryson--"
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2447.102,2447.643,That's part of our legal culture.
1993.92-8556,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2447.643,2454.538,--The risk that an uncounseled conviction might be used in a later recidivist proceeding was not discussed in Scott.
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2462.774,2471.252,"Well, Your Honor, I just think it is... it is just something that is... is so familiar to us that you... there are any number of different risk--"
1993.92-8556,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2471.252,2471.94,So familiar to us that we missed it in Scott.
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2471.94,2481.097,"--Well, but you also didn't refer, for example, to the possible effect of a conviction on employment, on other... sorry, on whether you could be a public official."
1993.92-8556,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2602.712,2604.101,"Well, then do you... then you disagree with Burgett and Texas?"
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2604.101,2604.722,"No, Your Honor."
1993.92-8556,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2645.5,2653.007,"Well, I suppose we could use that same reasoning to distinguish your boiler room civil conviction hypothetical and an uncounseled criminal conviction."
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2653.868,2664.506,"Well, I don't think so, Your Honor, because there's no violation of the Sixth Amendment in my misdemeanor case, just as there's no violation of the Sixth Amendment in the civil case."
1993.92-8556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2681.009,2694.106,"But, Mr. Bryson, in your hypothetical it's not really the conviction... it's the conduct that the judge would be taking into conduct, because the... because there's no instruction to the judge to take into account an adverse civil judgment."
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2723.485,2728.339,"Your Honor, in my hypothetical I'm positing that the judge is looking at the judgment, not at the conduct."
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2750.364,2751.696,Now--
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2754.398,2762.144,The Guidelines provide for using civil adjudications as a basis for departure.
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2765.445,2768.727,Do they have any automatic increase in points where you go from one bracket to another based on civil--
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2768.727,2770.549,"No, it's limited to convictions."
1993.92-8556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2771.159,2773.552,--So it's always a matter for the discretion of the judge.
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2773.552,2775.202,"--Well, that's right."
1993.92-8556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2793.246,2801.183,"If you're making an analogy to civil cases, there certainly are civil judgments that are good for one purpose but not for another, are there not?"
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2801.183,2802.084,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1993.92-8556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2827.061,2837.247,"There are civil judgments that, at least in the old days, constitutionally were good for only one case only, the old quasi in rem jurisdiction where you were suing the property and not the person."
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2837.247,2837.958,--Certainly.
1993.92-8556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2837.958,2840.99,"That was a good judgment for that case, couldn't be used in any other."
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2840.99,2844.643,"Well, that's right, because it wouldn't say anything about the person, presumably."
1993.92-8556,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2873.824,2879.059,Is it clear that... under the Guidelines it refers to civil adjudications?
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2879.059,2879.44,Yes.
1993.92-8556,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2879.44,2882.552,Is it clear that a default judgment would be considered an adjudication?
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2882.552,2886.103,"I think a default judgment... I'm not sure of the answer to that, Your Honor."
1993.92-8556,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2886.734,2891.949,"Well, you ought to be, because otherwise it's really not germane, is it?"
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2895.111,2895.732,"--Well, no, Your Honor."
1993.92-8556,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2895.732,2896.593,Nolo contendere.
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2896.593,2897.945,"No, he was there."
1993.92-8556,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2909.313,2909.743,It's very different from admitting--
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2909.743,2910.755,--Have actual notice.
1993.92-8556,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.755,2910.975,--Yes.
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2910.975,2914.077,"Well, Your Honor, it's not, we submit, very different from admitting."
1993.92-8556,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2914.077,2917.79,"No, I had notice, I just chose not to appear and a default judgment was taken against me."
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2917.79,2934.71,"Well, in this case he had full notice and we know from the presentence report, in fact, on the facts of this case, that he actually consulted a lawyer who suggested that since he really wasn't going to contest the case and the arrangement sounded acceptable, no reason to bring a lawyer with him."
1993.92-8556,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2962.509,2964.662,In his concurrence in what case?
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2964.662,2965.444,"--I'm sorry, in Baldasar."
1993.92-8556,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2965.444,2966.142,In Baldasar.
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2966.142,2989.969,"I'm sorry, Your Honor... made the argument that the fact that you can't directly impose an extra term of... a term of imprisonment for a misdemeanor conviction is inconsistent with allowing you indirectly to impose it by using that misdemeanor conviction at sentencing for another crime."
1993.92-8556,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3071.516,3078.792,"Well, another way of looking at it is that we don't really care whether it's for the first or the second or some combination, because both have been counseled convictions."
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3078.792,3093.371,"Well, Your Honor, I'm getting away from the question of counsel here and just asking... addressing right now the question of whether there is force to the logic that was at the base of the concurring opinions in... of Justice Marshall and Justice--"
1993.92-8556,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3093.371,3097.615,"Well, I think you can argue about whether or not you're being punished for some combination of the first crime and the second."
1993.92-8556,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3101.939,3113.747,"--Well, yes, but it's clear... the one thing that is quite clear is that you may do, with respect to the second penal... punishment proceeding, something that you could not have done with respect only to the first."
1993.92-8556,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3214.306,3216.039,"Thank you, Mr. Bryson."
1993.92-8556,2,44278,william_b_m_carter,,3218.162,3220.203,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.92-8556,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3308.127,3309.068,"Thank you, Mr. Carter."
