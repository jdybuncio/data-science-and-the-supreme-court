1966.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,25.143,"Number 19, Harriett Louise Adderley, et al, petitioners versus Florida."
1966.19,0,39226,richard_yale_feder,,26.167,28.241,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,37.439,42.464,Your motion is granted.
1966.19,0,39226,richard_yale_feder,,42.464,44.389,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,1799.94,1803.304,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1834.737,1837.57,"How big is the jail is it, Mr. Roth?"
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,1837.57,1843.184,"I've been by there many times, Your Honor, I couldn't tell you certainly how large is the jail."
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1899.612,1907.723,"Could you tell us, Mr. Roth about how large the public area is around that jail?"
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,1907.723,1908.639,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1973.009,1976.469,But how large it is the grassy part?
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,1976.469,1979.026,"Well, I couldn't give you the measurement."
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2066.864,2067.802,White and Blue?
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2067.802,2070.248,"White and Blue, yes, sir."
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2107.227,2110.105,"Very well, we'll recess now."
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2110.105,2113.317,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2127.677,2129.152,Would you mind speaking just a little louder?
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2129.152,2131.399,"Excuse me, sir."
1966.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2156.921,2160.947,"Now, was this parking lot -- was this parking lot used by whom?"
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2162.968,2169.006,"If someone want to park there, presume that they could on the upper part, before going to the health department to save up something."
1966.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2169.006,2173.126,(Inaudible)
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2173.126,2176.969,"On the other side of the jail, yes, sir, there is a juvenile home."
1966.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2176.969,2178.207,(Inaudible)
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2178.207,2185.915,And I believe -- and there's a health building on the other side of the -- of parking lot number 2 which is on the upper area.
1966.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2186.366,2192.356,That's all then the proper area of the public jail?
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2192.356,2203.748,"Well, it's not like a quadrangle in that sense but certainly it's public – I walked to there before many times and I'm sure many other citizens have."
1966.19,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2511.246,2514.389,Could I ask you just one question.
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2533.825,2534.689,And they've been asked --
1966.19,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2534.689,2541.934,"And no -- no particular -- no permission, expressed permission, they just come by."
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2546.751,2550.832,"There are in the cases defining that but I would say, yes, sir it would be."
1966.19,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2550.832,2553.576,You think they would have been subject to prosecution?
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2553.576,2553.844,"Yes, sir."
1966.19,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2554.687,2556.592,"Now, this was a public place?"
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2556.592,2556.867,"Yes, sir."
1966.19,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2557.748,2563.556,And the public was invited that was part of the public property?
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2563.556,2571.258,"It was public property yes, sir, in the sense that the inside of the jail is not for sale but if you have business to walk inside the jail, that's public property."
1966.19,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2571.258,2582.917,"Now the 200 high school children congregated in a park, that would not be a trespass when it is a public park."
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2582.917,2583.282,That's right.
1966.19,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2585.328,2592.22,And suppose 200 children gathered on the driveway on mister.
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2633.608,2636.642,"Where with the malicious and mischievous intent, yes, sir."
1966.19,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2636.642,2638.031,That's right.
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2657.055,2677.317,"Well, Your Honor in my opinion, the very nature of what these people said or what petitioner said when they came to this area, the very area that they only use for that entrance to the jail or for the entrance way there is to bring in prisoners, ingress and egress of prisoners and for maintenance -- maintenance men to come."
1966.19,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2685.808,2687.221,So they couldn't charge you with trespass.
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2687.221,2688.994,"No, so they couldn't charge me with trespass."
1966.19,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2709.779,2711.552,I beg your pardon.
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2726.751,2733.415,"Your Honor, it would have been if they have said that but that is not in the record; that this was ever said."
1966.19,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2753.698,2771.486,"But if you assume which you may not, but if you do assume that it wasn't for mere presence of these people at this particular place should constitute a trespass."
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2795.376,2799.94,"Your Honor, I would have to speculate on what we don't have in the decisions on that particular statute --"
1966.19,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2799.94,2810.892,"Oh, I thought your point was that there was that the thing that triggered the trespass was a lawful order of the sheriff that they had to disperse."
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2810.892,2811.784,"This -- yes, this is --"
1966.19,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2811.784,2836.944,"Now, what I want to ask you is, that might depend upon the location of this group was with reference to the jail property if they were on the remote outskirts that might be said to be without the beyond the implied authority of the sheriff as custodian or that was right up near the jail and one might say that was certainly within the proper authority of the custodian."
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2851.334,2853.526,I don't know -- I didn't mean to mislead the court.
1966.19,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2860.986,2861.912,Blackboard demonstration?
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2861.912,2862.913,A blackboard demonstration.
1966.19,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2874.851,2877.418,"Mr. Roth, may I ask you?"
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2899.668,2900.668,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.19,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2900.668,2912.534,"Well now, your statute says in other words, your construing trespass as I understand it, that's the word of your statute isn't it?"
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2923.42,2923.847,"Yes, sir."
1966.19,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2924.515,2928.42,Had that statute even been so construed by your courts before?
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2928.42,2929.422,"No, sir."
1966.19,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2937.755,2949.369,"Well ordinarily, didn't trespass done contemplate in initial unlawful entry on the property of another?"
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2949.369,2953.255,"Your Honor, it would say to me that it could be either way that the initial entry could be lawful --"
1966.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2953.255,2955.774,Are you familiar with the Bouie decision?
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2955.774,2956.99,"Yes, sir."
1966.19,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2956.99,2965.621,"Well, I thought we dealt with the statute like this which I would call it in terms of -- as I read that opinion even when I wrote it."
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,2996.217,2996.514,"No, sir."
1966.19,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3003.824,3018.559,"Well, I can understand that but even so, if trespass means ordinarily, and I think you can -- you just told me you believed that the initial entry on this property was not unlawful; initially."
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3041.71,3047.571,"Your Honor, I don't have it my fingertips in the other Florida statute exactly on this."
1966.19,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3053.747,3055.427,The prosecution wasn't under that?
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3055.427,3055.643,"No, sir."
1966.19,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3057.369,3058.373,"Well, I'm just wondering here."
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3068.812,3072.633,"Your Honor, I'm unsure."
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3072.633,3077.104,What was the punishment that was inflicted?
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3077.104,3077.915,The -- its a miss to me.
1966.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3090.379,3091.396,All of them were fined?
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3091.396,3094.218,"Yes, I think he was fined it could be no more than $100.00."
1966.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3094.218,3095.236,No jail?
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3095.236,3095.682,Sir?
1966.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3095.682,3097.995,No jail?
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3097.995,3101.056,"I don't think there was a jail, sir."
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3101.056,3143.061,"Mr. Roth, as I understand it that this block or square where these people were was a public block or square on which were buildings of several departments of the county government, there was a jail and I thought you told us also that there was a probation department and I thought also you said there was a health department and some parking facilities for those who were doing business with those agencies of the government and then some general parking space around there and lawn."
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3145.002,3151.15,"Well, with this exception, Your Honor, that they want the public health building was on the four side of the jailhouse."
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3151.15,3151.628,Yes.
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3151.628,3162.604,The -- the lower parking area which was adjacent to the gravel area which petitioners were arrested on was actually -- was considered the parking lot of the jail.
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3184.773,3200.951,"That was there any -- was there any division of responsibility for these properties as much as you say well this much is for the – under the jurisdiction of the probation department, this is under the health department, this is under the sheriff?"
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3200.951,3206.65,"Your Honor, as the record is silent as to any other division as to the upper parking lot."
1966.19,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3280.981,3282.468,And did they move back two feet?
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3282.468,3284.02,"Yes, it's on the record."
1966.19,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3318.117,3324.968,Does that mean or worse for the petitioners in your view of the case here.
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3334.873,3334.998,Well --
1966.19,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3334.998,3336.141,"What was it, I take it?"
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3336.141,3357.385,"From -- from the stand, I think it makes it worse for the petitioners in this case because in the Cox case, it was stated time and time again, and with majority opinion that these people, that the authorities knew what it was and given them permission to do it for a certain length of time that the statute was vague because they have the permission to step in anytime they would revoke it."
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3726.296,3730.297,"Mr. Roth, may I ask you just one more question."
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3755.845,3759.805,"To prove that isn't the conduct, yes, sir."
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3777.745,3778.995,I thought you said that can be --
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3778.995,3780.581,"Well, I said -- I said that in --"
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3780.581,3781.372,-- any difference unless you --
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3781.372,3781.957,Well that is in --
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3781.957,3786.765,-- it was specific violation that that would amount to anything?
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3786.765,3793.681,"I said that that's specifically, I didn't think would allow someone be arrested just because I showed that this is part and partial."
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3875.765,3890.715,"May I ask you that there is anything in the evidence to show that anyone of these petitioners in this case were the ones who said, “We came to get arrested.”"
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3890.715,3891.907,"Your Honor, I don't think there is."
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3896.636,3904.704,"Is there anything in the record to show that they sat down, these two or anyone from this group?"
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3904.704,3910.043,"Well, the record showed, I think that one of the men, Mr. Blue was sitting down at the time that he was talking to."
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3913.576,3915.591,"Yes, (Inaudible)."
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3924.926,3925.086,Yes.
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3925.086,3927.436,They are all taken in a jail.
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3937.553,3944.872,"Your Honor, the record is silent as to that and I didn't take any part in the prosecution and I don't know --"
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3944.872,3954.559,Is there anything in the record that Mr. Roth that would show that these people did anymore than the other 70 whom they turned loose.
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3954.559,3954.834,"No, sir."
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3968.056,3969.034,Very well.
1966.19,1,45985,william_d_roth,,3969.034,3975.906,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1966.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3975.906,3979.98,"Mr. Feder, you have few moments or five minutes, I think."
1966.19,2,39226,richard_yale_feder,,3979.98,3982.199,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court --"
1966.19,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3982.199,3983.287,"Mr. Feder, before you begin."
1966.19,2,39226,richard_yale_feder,,3983.287,3983.795,Yes.
1966.19,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3983.795,3987.177,What were the sentences imposed in this case?
1966.19,2,39226,richard_yale_feder,,3988.678,3989.978,It doesn't appear on the record.
1966.19,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3992.06,3993.753,Do you have any -- you know?
1966.19,2,39226,richard_yale_feder,,3993.776,3995.291,I do not know in my own personal knowledge.
1966.19,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3999.438,4002.505,Can you get some for us?
1966.19,2,39226,richard_yale_feder,,4002.505,4005.901,I presume I could Justice Black.
1966.19,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4013.133,4014.837,"Yes, I saw that but I couldn't find any --"
1966.19,2,39226,richard_yale_feder,,4014.837,4016.944,"That's all there is in the record, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1966.19,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4047.538,4050.79,"Except that I know, this is not the point you are addressing, Mr. Feder."
1966.19,2,39226,richard_yale_feder,,4057.406,4058.713,"No, I did not, Justice Brennan."
1966.19,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4059.398,4060.246,You did not?
1966.19,2,39226,richard_yale_feder,,4060.246,4065.557,"-- as I answered you previously, we did not raise the Bouie case."
1966.19,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4065.557,4068.116,And you don't raise it now?
1966.19,2,39226,richard_yale_feder,,4068.116,4077.698,"We raised it only as used in the Garner case and I believe in the Peterson, the Lombard and the Shuttlesworth cases."
1966.19,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4077.698,4079.805,"Well, Bouie followed all of them."
1966.19,2,39226,richard_yale_feder,,4079.805,4083.251,"We did not raise that, Your Honor."
1966.19,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4096.134,4099.182,You mean at that time they were arrested?
1966.19,2,39226,richard_yale_feder,,4099.182,4104.02,I'm talking now of their original walking upon the grounds.
