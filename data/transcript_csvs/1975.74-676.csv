1975.74-676,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,48.858,"We will hear arguments next in Estelle against Williams, 74-676."
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,51.72,55.982,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-676,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,253.756,256.334,Do you have bail in Texas?
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,256.334,259.113,"Yes, your Honor, we do."
1975.74-676,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,259.113,264.873,"(Inaudible) comes to ask and stand in jail, is that what you said?"
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,264.873,265.467,Yes sir.
1975.74-676,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,265.467,266.776,What do you mean by that?
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,266.776,278.422,"Well, I mean the ones that are not able to be released on a bail would be brought in in jail clothes."
1975.74-676,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,278.422,281.15,(Inaudible)
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,281.15,281.951,Yes sir.
1975.74-676,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,281.951,282.888,(Inaudible)
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,282.888,284.454,They have to wear the jail clothes.
1975.74-676,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,284.454,286.194,(Inaudible)
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,286.194,289.382,Yes sir.
1975.74-676,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,289.382,293.288,Mr. Sullivan what kind of jail clothes were they?
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,296.231,296.849,No your Honor.
1975.74-676,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,303.316,305.482,"What do you mean, (Inaudible)?"
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,305.482,322.144,"It was a white T-shirt and Harris County Jail stencil across the back and pair of pants with the Harris County Jail, maybe stencil down, one side of the pants."
1975.74-676,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,323.691,337.932,We will resume there after lunch.
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,341.143,343.836,Thank you your Honor.
1975.74-676,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,458.466,465.821,Mr. Sullivan did Judge Love give any instructions about prison garb to the jury at all?
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,465.821,466.88,"No sir, he did not."
1975.74-676,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,504.711,511.538,(inaudible) Mr. Williams had any personal clothes that were taken from him at the time of his incarceration?
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,511.538,515.404,"Yes sir, he says that he did in the Federal Habeas Hearing."
1975.74-676,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,531.823,541.694,Is it your position that personal clothes might be more offensive in the eyes of the jury than prison garb might be.
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,541.694,542.291,No sir.
1975.74-676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,571.088,586.11,"One of the Courts below commented that it was the preference of some defense attorneys to have their clients tried in prison clothes to give the impression that he had already served some time, so why give him a lot more than that?"
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,586.11,587.935,Yes sir.
1975.74-676,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,628.42,635.628,As I understand it the Fifth Circuit has explicitly cut out an exception from their so-called per se rule for that?
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,635.628,636.853,"Yes sir, that is true."
1975.74-676,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,636.853,637.604,Is that correct?
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,637.604,652.208,If you can get an attorney to testify that he wants his man tried in jail clothes because he thought it would make the jury be in sympathy and that there is an exception.
1975.74-676,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,652.208,668.878,"Well, I suppose after this decision of the Fifth Circuit in any case where there was not a request that he would be tried in civilian clothes and there he would assume that he and his counsel were satisfied."
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,675.473,677.266,Yes sir.
1975.74-676,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,735.213,742.989,(Voice overlap) What is your position that if the defendant asks to be tried in civilian clothes that he is entitled to it.
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,742.989,743.394,Yes sir.
1975.74-676,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.813,759.626,"How about a constitutionally, would he, assuming he requested to be tried in his civilian clothes, and is turned down and he is convicted."
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,762.778,769.035,"Under my view then I think that he has to show that he was harmed, substantially harmed by being tried."
1975.74-676,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,769.035,773.825,So you would not have a per se rule even in that situation.
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,775.818,779.636,"No sir, unless he was able to specifically show harm."
1975.74-676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,779.636,784.674,When you answered Justice White’s question about a request to be tried in street clothes.
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,787.088,787.415,Yes sir.
1975.74-676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,811.243,823.551,"Well, even if he is perfectly accurate in his testimony, I suppose asking somebody at the Rehabilitation Center isn’t the same thing as calling it to the attention of the judge who is responsible for conducting the trial?"
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,823.551,824.177,Yes your Honor.
1975.74-676,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,843.472,850.495,"Mr. Sullivan, how was the prisoner -- he was harmed by being tried in the prison garb?"
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,850.495,863.331,"Well your Honor, I think in one of the Tenth Circuit cases, they proved he was harmed when the prosecutor kept referring to him as Manson over here with the jail clothes on he was just like all the rest of them."
1975.74-676,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,866.348,869.535,Well that sounds to me like prosecutorial misconduct.
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,878.529,886.794,"Well, perhaps by the length of the term of sentence, he got."
1975.74-676,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,897.94,899.72,Was that a jury sentencing arrangement?
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,899.72,901.002,"Yes sir, I believe so."
1975.74-676,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,901.002,906.673,"And that is in your State, the jury sentence that does it?"
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,911.82,912.199,Yes sir.
1975.74-676,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,934.836,939.681,Mr. Sullivan why does Texas tried him in jury clothes?
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,939.681,945.946,"And, well your Honor we have not tried him since the Hernandez decision in '71."
1975.74-676,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,955.708,957.932,It used to be the fashion to do it this way.
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,957.932,958.47,Yes sir.
1975.74-676,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,992.372,1006.161,This is why I asked before as to whether it might not be possible to be less offensive for the defendant to be in issued garments rather than in his own.
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1022.631,1030.395,"Well your Honor, really I do not think, like I said, it was, that the State, you do not have much I has formed the impression one way or another."
1975.74-676,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1052.254,1066.08,(Inaudible) or it is the part of the State's interest to prevent this decision from being applied to everyone who has ever been tried in Texas and who is still in jail?
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1066.08,1066.751,No sir.
1975.74-676,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1069.772,1071.139,"Well, that is what I mean."
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1071.139,1071.905,Right.
1975.74-676,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1071.905,1074.212,"Well, when was this tried?"
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1074.212,1076.59,The William's case was tried in 1970.
1975.74-676,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1076.59,1077.401,1970?
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1077.401,1077.959,Yes sir.
1975.74-676,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1077.959,1079.89,And this was applied retroactively then (Inaudible)
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1079.89,1081.067,Yes sir.
1975.74-676,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1081.067,1088.468,"Is this what you mean, it was applied retroactively in the sense that the Fifth Circuit had already decided the case, Hernandez?"
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1088.468,1089.104,No sir.
1975.74-676,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1092.403,1093.769,(Inaudible) was this the first case that—
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1093.769,1094.056,No sir.
1975.74-676,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1095.449,1098.758,"Well, was this the first case that announced this particular rule?"
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1098.758,1100.915,Of retroactivity?
1975.74-676,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.915,1103.923,"Would you think this is a retroactivity case, is it?"
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1103.923,1104.384,Yes.
1975.74-676,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1109.972,1113.37,(Inaudible) everyone that has never been tried is still in jail.
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1113.37,1113.717,Yes sir.
1975.74-676,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1133.777,1137.076,Why do say Williams is being applied retroactively?
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1137.076,1139.495,Because the Fifth Circuit held it was.
1975.74-676,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.495,1141.497,Right.
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1155.42,1155.643,Yes sir.
1975.74-676,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1158.342,1164.055,Isn’t this the first case that ever announced this particular rule?
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1177.859,1179.138,Yes Sir.
1975.74-676,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1179.138,1186.58,Hernandez was in 1971 and the trial of Williams was in 1970.
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1199.066,1200.4,That is in the Brooks case you are talking—
1975.74-676,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1200.4,1201.422,Yes.
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1201.422,1201.695,Yes.
1975.74-676,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1249.887,1266.588,(Inaudible) was the first case that said that conviction in prison clothes cannot be upheld even though the defendant did not request being tried in civilian clothes.
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1266.588,1268.477,"Yes sir, I suppose."
1975.74-676,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1306.303,1310.582,"So what, in this case Williams did not go any farther than prior cases (Inaudible)"
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1310.582,1314.403,"Except, of course specifically holding it was retroactive."
1975.74-676,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1376.394,1383.823,"In any event, not any trial before Hernandez and Hernandez was decided when?"
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1383.823,1386.096,"In 71, 1971."
1975.74-676,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1386.096,1389.257,(voice overlapped) any trials before 1971?
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1389.257,1389.362,Yes your Honor.
1975.74-676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1389.362,1395.452,"You also asked us to hold that it is not constitutionally affirmed that he did try a person in prison garb, right?"
1975.74-676,0,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,1395.452,1395.715,Yes sir.
1975.74-676,1,17398,ben_l_aderholt,,1686.736,1694.423,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the court."
1975.74-676,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1744.71,1745.264,In what?
1975.74-676,1,17398,ben_l_aderholt,,1745.264,1750.978,Shower tongs where the feet slip through are kind of a crows foot.
1975.74-676,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1754.155,1755.927,Would you mind stating what is that called?
1975.74-676,1,17398,ben_l_aderholt,,1755.927,1773.389,"Shower tongs, that is what I called them, it is what I believe the defendant called them in the Habeas Corpus Hearing where its feet – sandals – where his feet are bare and he slips one of the tongs through his toe."
1975.74-676,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1784.506,1786.837,What if they had seen it?
1975.74-676,1,17398,ben_l_aderholt,,1790.093,1796.849,I think it carries with it all kinds of negative inferences.
1975.74-676,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.46,1818.318,What would that be?
1975.74-676,1,17398,ben_l_aderholt,,1834.625,1846.322,"I am not sure that the jury, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, knows or should know whether the defendant cannot make bail."
1975.74-676,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1846.322,1859.156,How would it prejudice the jury in determining the issues in this criminal offense of which he is charged to know that he had not been able to make bail or to know that he had been able to make bail.
1975.74-676,1,17398,ben_l_aderholt,,1859.156,1867.202,I think precisely because we are not able to measure what the jury thinks of a man who comes in dressed like this.
1975.74-676,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1868.796,1870.214,Now wait a minute.
1975.74-676,1,17398,ben_l_aderholt,,1887.584,1900.895,One of the Lower Courts stated that the prosecutor could not have gotten administrable prior convictions or other charges brought against the defendant.
1975.74-676,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1914.91,1923.765,Why would it be any sort of a permissible inference on the jury’s part that he had prior convictions from seeing him in prison garb?
1975.74-676,1,17398,ben_l_aderholt,,1923.765,1927.137,Because he has jail printed on his chest.
1975.74-676,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1935.475,1940.331,"But he is in the custody of the sheriff during the trial whether he has got prison garb on him or not, isn’t he?"
1975.74-676,1,17398,ben_l_aderholt,,1940.331,1956.322,But he does not have the choice of putting on clothes that would be -- make him look like an ordinary average jury where the defendant that has presumption and dignity and the self-respect of a free man.
1975.74-676,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1956.322,1967.228,What if his counsel has consented on the record to being tried in jail clothing because he wants to be tried in jail clothing?
1975.74-676,1,17398,ben_l_aderholt,,1983.543,1995.576,"In view of the long line of cases, I think a trial judge might consider something in his charge just to protect the integrity of the trial."
1975.74-676,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2010.654,2021.935,"What do you suggest, the jury infers when there has been a trial in jail clothing by request."
1975.74-676,1,17398,ben_l_aderholt,,2029.053,2036.368,"If I understand your correction, your question and statement correctly, Mr. Chief Justice I believe that they would draw the same inference."
1975.74-676,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2037.382,2048.931,"That is just as harmful or just as beneficial depending on the point of view as in the case where he has not the consented, is it not?"
1975.74-676,1,17398,ben_l_aderholt,,2048.931,2052.098,I would never consider to be a beneficial thing.
1975.74-676,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2067.012,2071.527,But then let me go back to the same question I asked your opponent.
1975.74-676,1,17398,ben_l_aderholt,,2107.894,2113.853,I believe the record does show it to be on his back.
1975.74-676,2,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,2615.117,2616.639,"Yes, of course, it is."
1975.74-676,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2616.639,2625.431,"Isn’t that that you not only make objection, you have to file a Bill of Exception in writing, is that still the law in Texas?"
1975.74-676,3,17398,ben_l_aderholt,,2625.431,2627.918,I do not know Mr. Justice Marshall.
1975.74-676,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2636.905,2642.109,"But normally do not you file objection and a Bill of exception, both?"
1975.74-676,3,17398,ben_l_aderholt,,2642.109,2648.077,I think it is wise unless the record reflects what you complaint of.

1975.74-676,3,17398,ben_l_aderholt,,2680.269,2690.938,I believe that the rule is presently in all jurisdictions with varying degrees that there is no objection required.

1975.74-676,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2712.157,2730.175,"Can you really bring yourself to say that this is the right not to be tried in prison garb, is you can equate with the right of counsel that was involved in Zerbst if we are talking about fundamental rights?"
1975.74-676,4,21493,dunklin_sullivan,,3899.766,3901.253,No your Honor.
1975.74-676,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3901.253,3909.452,"Mr. Aderholt did you appear by appointment of the Court, our request as you did in the Fifth Circuit on Behalf of the Court."
