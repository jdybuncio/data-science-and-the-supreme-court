1974.73-1765,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,49.75,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1765, Meek against Pittenger."
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,53.968,58.755,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,860.633,864.435,Marburger case involve all three auxiliary services --
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,864.435,865.221,Yes.
1974.73-1765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,865.221,866.734,-- and instructional materials and --
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,866.734,868.523,Yes.
1974.73-1765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,868.523,868.607,-- textbooks?
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,868.607,871.783,Everything which is in the statute is involved in Marburger and textbooks too.
1974.73-1765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,878.277,879.685,"Well, what were the differences?"
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,879.685,889.258,"Well, the basic difference was in the Margburger case that the course and money for the textbook was given instead of the textbooks themselves."
1974.73-1765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,894.109,895.002,"The money was given, wasn't it?"
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,895.002,898.39,"Yes, the money to reimburse the cost of textbooks."
1974.73-1765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,898.39,899.658,And how about auxiliary services?
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,899.658,901.503,"No, that was similar to this."
1974.73-1765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,901.503,902.345,How about instructional materials?
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,902.345,903.425,Similar to this.
1974.73-1765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,903.425,904.035,Similar or the same?
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,904.035,905.205,Similar.
1974.73-1765,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,918.155,923.108,I take it Mr. Pfeffer that you're going to treat each of these separately at some point.
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,923.108,924.262,"Yes, yes I will do that right now."
1974.73-1765,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,924.262,926.016,Speaking for myself that would be very helpful.
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,926.016,937.187,"Yes, well now -- but I say that I will do that Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, but I note that in Marburger it was not."
1974.73-1765,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,999.354,1010.396,"Well, I suppose you'd agree Mr. Pfeffer that at the time that the First Amendment was drafted, there were no services of the kind we now embrace in these areas."
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1010.396,1014.091,I don't think Mr. Chief Justice because the regulations --
1974.73-1765,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1014.091,1017.711,"Well I'll put it another way, you didn't have all the range of services --"
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1017.711,1017.913,Not all.
1974.73-1765,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1017.913,1018.671,-- provided that you have today.
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1018.671,1057.26,"But the bulk -- the bulk you do have, because if the regulations which have been adopted by the State of Pennsylvania which I'm -- my footnote 3 on page 15 of my brief indicates that services, auxiliary services, are defined to include those service necessary to assist a student to perform at the grade level of his age and potential."
1974.73-1765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1113.689,1125.719,"In 1787 of course the First Amendment, you said a minute ago, the way you read the First Amendment there's certainly nothing in the First Amendment that would suggest that it has anything to do with this case."
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1131.627,1137.446,"Well, but Your Honor, this Court has held way back as far as Campbell against Connecticut."
1974.73-1765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1137.446,1139.692,"Yes, but not be back in 1787, it didn't."
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1139.692,1141.239,Well there was no Fourteenth Amendment in 1787.
1974.73-1765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1141.239,1142.891,Exactly.
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1142.891,1147.046,There was no Fourteenth Amendment and there were no -- they were practically no public schools either.
1974.73-1765,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1438.983,1442.975,"Mr. Pfeffer, you are asking that we overrule Allen?"
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1442.975,1447.519,I ask that this Court overrule Allen but I point out my brief.
1974.73-1765,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1496.822,1502.386,Did the religion clauses deal with any aspect of discrimination?
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1502.386,1505.231,"Well, as interpreted by this Court by all means."
1974.73-1765,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1515.123,1519.979,"[Voice Overlap] the First Amendment did it, in Norwood?"
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1519.979,1547.476,"No, Norwood is a Fourteenth Amendment case, but the Court noted, Mr. Justice White's opinion in the First Amendment cases that the First Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment it doesn't matter which, I mean its the First, Fifth or Fourteenth or all of them combined forbids the use of public funds to provide services from which persons are excluded or put in a lower category than this is."
1974.73-1765,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1554.089,1571.288,"Do you think that the First Amendment mandates the same sort of state hostility towards religious education as the Fourteenth Amendment mandates towards segregated, as education segregated by race?"
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1571.288,1594.159,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist the answer is not hostility that is unfortunate -- an unfortunate term because the Court, this Court has had the task, ever since it started with the first case and which it declared unconstitutionally state statute involving a state tax involving release time at the public schools."
1974.73-1765,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1607.032,1620.893,"But what I'm asking you is, conceding that, isn't the barrier of the Fourteenth Amendment in fact motivated by hostility towards public education segregated by race?"
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1620.893,1631.748,It's motivated by that because it involves state involvement not by private education or Fourteenth Amendment doesn't prevent a private school from segregating by race.
1974.73-1765,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1710.298,1712.682,"Well, how is it on textbook?"
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1712.682,1713.487,On textbooks?
1974.73-1765,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1806.867,1808.283,Mr. Pfeffer?
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1808.283,1808.699,Yes?
1974.73-1765,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1808.699,1815.479,"Before you move on, it's not clear to me what the discrimination is in this case with respect to the textbooks?"
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1815.479,1819.693,Well the discrimination is in respect to the textbook in Walz.
1974.73-1765,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1851.723,1853.075,Well --
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1853.075,1856.086,He can't get the benefit of that textbook.
1974.73-1765,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1856.086,1871.715,Boards of Education have approved a wide list of textbooks and then local school boards and sometimes the local superintendent or even the teachers in the classes have discretion as which books they use.
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1886.907,1887.441,Yes.
1974.73-1765,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1887.441,1888.933,"Now, how there can be ended discrimination?"
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1888.933,1910.881,"The answers is the discriminations is this that it is certain within the discretion of the school board to say “We will use text A rather than B and the student who like to use text B rather than text A has no constitutional agreement” unless, unless the only reason he is barred from using textbook B is because of his race of his color."
1974.73-1765,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2286.044,2289.568,"Mr. Pfeffer, I take that you have worked out your arrangements with your – counsel."
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2289.568,2292.885,"Oh yes, I'm sorry I was supposed to --"
1974.73-1765,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2292.885,2295.783,"Unless, I think you had a signal on it sometime ago."
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2295.783,2298.897,"Well, I'm sorry I didn't -- the signal just -- thank you Your Honor."
1974.73-1765,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2304.422,2307.094,Are you going to reserve the entire remaining time for rebuttal?
1974.73-1765,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2307.094,2308.43,"For rebuttal, yes."
1974.73-1765,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2308.43,2320.082,Very well.
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2321.076,2327.395,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2707.074,2716.684,I didn't understand your point a moment ago that schools providing these services do not qualify as compulsory attendance schools?
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2716.684,2730.595,"No, by the virtue of the fact that they afford speech therapy psychological service and so on, those facts, those services do not qualify them as compulsory attendance schools."
1974.73-1765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2756.853,2761.983,"The provision of these services is irrelevant to this status as qualifying as compulsory, isn't it?"
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2761.983,2764.023,That is correct Mr. Justice Powell.
1974.73-1765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2765.755,2768.495,Right.
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2768.495,2780.967,"The services are also obviously of immediate and meaningful benefit to children, the record very definitely establishes that."
1974.73-1765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2797.147,2803.854,"These services are just to – just to clear my mind, these services are provided in the public schools, are they not?"
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2803.854,2805.434,"Yes, and they have long been."
1974.73-1765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2805.434,2806.274,And long been?
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2806.274,2810.95,"Yes, that is correct Mr. Justice Stewart."
1974.73-1765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3277.71,3280.024,"Mr. Ball, what's the record show about these people?"
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3291.606,3298.611,The record does not clearly disclose this Mr. Justice Stewart.
1974.73-1765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3316.103,3317.385,In a geographic area?
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3317.385,3319.5,She is only a speech therapist.
1974.73-1765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3333.928,3344.973,Might she move then from a catholic parochial school on where she is on Tuesday afternoons to Lutheran parochial school on Wednesday afternoon --
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3344.973,3346.365,"Moravian, Lutheran, yes indeed."
1974.73-1765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3346.365,3350.215,To Nominational parochial school on Thursday afternoon?
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3350.215,3350.861,Yes.
1974.73-1765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3350.861,3354.688,"And ever back, ever into a public school on Friday and Monday afternoons?"
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3354.688,3361.875,"This I could not say but she would be available to be used in public schools also for same services as far as this Act is concerned, it would not affect that."
1974.73-1765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3361.875,3364.955,The record doesn't show what the actual practice is.
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3364.955,3366.212,It doesn't show that --
1974.73-1765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3366.212,3366.482,In this respect.
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3366.482,3371.73,-- that there is any particular pattern and there may be no particular pattern Mr. Justice Stewart.
1974.73-1765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3371.73,3384.094,Because the claim is that of course that these teachers get so imbued and involved with the religious atmosphere over a particular school that they --
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3384.094,3387.486,Well that Mr. Justice Stewart is the claim and --
1974.73-1765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3387.486,3391.82,"Well, I thought that the question would might have something to do with that claim?"
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3391.82,3400.043,We went directly to that contention in examination of three witnesses.
1974.73-1765,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3458.197,3459.864,Mr. Ball?
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3459.864,3460.482,Yes sir.
1974.73-1765,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3460.482,3470.171,Does the evidence show the extent of which these services are available in religious schools without the benefit of the state aid?
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3470.171,3482.189,The evidence shows first of all it was the finding of the general assembly that they were not generally available in religious or other nonpublic schools.
1974.73-1765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3566.519,3572.933,"On Marburger, is somebody one your side of the table is going to deal with Marburger?"
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3572.933,3576.608,Yes I will do it right now Mr. Justice Stewart.
1974.73-1765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3679.297,3696.284,"The biggest difference or at least a very substantial difference between this case in Marburger is that here you have a record of evidence and testimony and in Marburger you just have the bare bones of the statute aid by speculations and imagination, is that it?"
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3696.284,3707.785,That Mr. Justice Steward plus the fact that I think Marburger in no wise faithfully followed the decision of this Court in Board of Education versus Allen.
1974.73-1765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3707.785,3714.639,"Your brother is asking us to overrule Allen, and you're suggesting we overrule Marburger, is that it?"
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3714.639,3725.662,No I am not suggesting Marburger be overruled because I cannot read Marburger and I cannot read the mind of the Court in affirming Marburger.
1974.73-1765,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3764.094,3768.39,"We did, you are now cutting in to your colleague's turn."
1974.73-1765,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3768.39,3772.327,Thank you.
1974.73-1765,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3772.327,3777.009,"Mr. Blewitt, you needn't use very much your time."
1974.73-1765,2,29055,j_justin_blewitt_jr,,3777.009,3781.296,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1765,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3914.831,3923.841,Would you clarify for me at least your comment about the curtailment of the equipment loans.
1974.73-1765,2,29055,j_justin_blewitt_jr,,3928.462,3928.631,Yes you Honor.
1974.73-1765,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3928.631,3931.839,The slides and movie projectors that sort of thing.
1974.73-1765,2,29055,j_justin_blewitt_jr,,3931.839,3933.085,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-1765,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4023.597,4036.972,"Mr. Blewitt, are you familiar with an article in 79 Yale called Sectarian Books, the Supreme Court and the Establishment Clause of which was published after Allen?"
1974.73-1765,2,29055,j_justin_blewitt_jr,,4036.972,4040.461,"I have read it, but not recently Your Honor."
1974.73-1765,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4040.461,4042.94,So you have no comment about the article?
1974.73-1765,2,29055,j_justin_blewitt_jr,,4042.94,4046.37,I cannot offer one.
1974.73-1765,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4153.082,4164.904,I get at least part of Mr. Pfeffer's argument is that is not feasible to conduct monitoring of that to see that it is -- that the statute complied with.
1974.73-1765,2,29055,j_justin_blewitt_jr,,4164.904,4169.645,"But Your Honor, what we suggest is that no such monitoring is necessary."
1974.73-1765,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4174.067,4178.287,"But if it passes from his control, then doesn't it?"
1974.73-1765,2,29055,j_justin_blewitt_jr,,4178.287,4185.091,But what I am suggesting is that the material is not can not readily be used for religious purpose.
1974.73-1765,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4195.131,4210.024,Well I take it your point that you made earlier that the modification of the guidelines has taken care of these problems that is equipment which could be used either for secular or sectarian purposes is now out of the program?
1974.73-1765,2,29055,j_justin_blewitt_jr,,4210.024,4212.203,"Yes, that is --"
1974.73-1765,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4212.203,4215.429,"Mr. Blewitt, Why do you use the word loan?"
1974.73-1765,2,29055,j_justin_blewitt_jr,,4215.429,4216.357,I beg your pardon Mr. Justice?
1974.73-1765,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4216.357,4218.493,Why do you use the word loan?
1974.73-1765,2,29055,j_justin_blewitt_jr,,4222.809,4234.846,Well we consider it be a loan in a same -- the Act refers to the legal relationship as a loan and it is the same form of loan that was present before the Court in the Allen case.
1974.73-1765,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4267.842,4278.227,Well isn't that a fairly common in the public schools in Pennsylvania for students to be loaned textbooks and perhaps for the books to survive 2 or 3 or 4 years?
1974.73-1765,2,29055,j_justin_blewitt_jr,,4278.227,4278.412,Oh!
1974.73-1765,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4383.424,4395.204,We'll resume there at one o'clock.
1974.73-1765,2,29055,j_justin_blewitt_jr,,4395.204,4396.902,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1765,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4485.536,4491.708,"Thank you Mr. Blewitt, Mr. Reath."
1974.73-1765,3,27879,henry_t_reath,,4491.708,4494.714,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1765,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5170.341,5173.188,Thank you Mr. Reath.
1974.73-1765,4,46366,william_p_thorn,,5181.609,5185.68,Mr. Chief Justice and Court please.
1974.73-1765,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5255.065,5259.992,Well it must be state laws that authorizes the local school boards to do the same thing for public schools.
1974.73-1765,4,46366,william_p_thorn,,5259.992,5263.065,It mandates them that they do it.
1974.73-1765,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5266.069,5267.562,For public school children?
1974.73-1765,4,46366,william_p_thorn,,5267.562,5270.104,Provide -- yes.
1974.73-1765,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5270.104,5271.982,Well then there is no distinction?
1974.73-1765,4,46366,william_p_thorn,,5271.982,5273.409,Pardon me?
1974.73-1765,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5294.193,5299.139,What percentage of the school budget is provided by state funds?
1974.73-1765,4,46366,william_p_thorn,,5299.139,5301.241,Well that's very complicated formula.
1974.73-1765,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5305.601,5307.562,That'd be above average.
1974.73-1765,4,46366,william_p_thorn,,5307.562,5311.576,It's about 50% as I remember.
1974.73-1765,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5311.576,5319.391,Wouldn't you agree that it's constitutionally irrelevant as to where and how the financing comes from so long as it is we all agree for the governmental financing.
1974.73-1765,4,46366,william_p_thorn,,5319.391,5321.732,No I don't think so.
1974.73-1765,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5332.897,5351.69,Am I mistaken in understanding that this law here at issue gives to the students in private schools what is already and has been for a long time given to the students in public school?
1974.73-1765,4,46366,william_p_thorn,,5351.69,5352.699,That is correct.
1974.73-1765,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5352.699,5353.432,That is correct is it not?
1974.73-1765,4,46366,william_p_thorn,,5353.432,5357.494,That is correct but public schools do not initially --
1974.73-1765,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5357.494,5359.975,And both with public money?
1974.73-1765,4,46366,william_p_thorn,,5359.975,5366.202,"Yes except different taxation, different sources of funds."
1974.73-1765,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5501.821,5515.034,Mr. Thorn does the record show whether or not the private schools in Pennsylvania require their pupils to take the same standardized achievement tests that are required in the public schools?
1974.73-1765,4,46366,william_p_thorn,,5515.034,5521.795,"I don't believe the record shows that, but I believe that is true, is it not?"
1974.73-1765,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5521.795,5523.722,So the record this silent on that question?
1974.73-1765,4,46366,william_p_thorn,,5523.722,5526.018,The record is silent on that.
1974.73-1765,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5544.506,5551.646,"But no evidence in the record as to comparative test scores between students in the public and private schools, is there?"
1974.73-1765,4,46366,william_p_thorn,,5551.646,5565.099,"No only on hearing defects and I think speech defects there is some evidence in the record on those two things, yes."
1974.73-1765,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5667.448,5670.536,Does that tell us anymore than the statute tells us?
1974.73-1765,4,46366,william_p_thorn,,5670.536,5672.692,Well I think it tell us this.
1974.73-1765,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5734.307,5736.471,Very well Mr. Thorn.
