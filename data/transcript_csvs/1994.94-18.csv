1994.94-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.299,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-18, Antonio Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton."
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,13.431,17.514,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1994.94-18,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,219.845,233.625,"Mr. Harte, does the ultimate resolution of this case depend upon what it is the parties contracted to do with regard to this matter?"
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,233.625,237.058,"--It can be, yes, but--"
1994.94-18,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,237.058,240.888,"And in that regard, help me out a little bit."
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,272.401,282.576,"--Well, there was a reference made in the arbitrator's award that reliance was placed upon some papers filed by the Mastrobuonos."
1994.94-18,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,311.454,314.228,"Well, I wasn't asking you about preemption."
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,316.7,317.88,--Agreed--
1994.94-18,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,317.88,323.174,--provided in their agreement as a matter of contract interpretation.
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,323.174,324.634,--They would--
1994.94-18,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,324.634,332.389,Did they or did they not contemplate the award of punitive damages as a possibility?
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,332.389,341.725,"--It would be my view that necessarily they would have had to do that, and did, because the issues were all presented to them."
1994.94-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,354.303,357.897,But they also said they agreed to be bound by the laws of the State of New York.
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,357.897,362.288,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,362.568,366.963,And the laws of the State of New York do not allow arbitrators to award punitive damages.
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,366.963,375.499,--But what... the Garrity rule states that you do have punitive damages.
1994.94-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,377.238,377.809,"Well, but--"
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,377.809,380.24,"However, you cannot get them--"
1994.94-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,380.24,381.052,--just a minute.
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,381.052,381.733,--from an arbitrator.
1994.94-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,381.733,388.915,Are you questioning my statement that the law of the State of New York says that arbitrators cannot award punitive damages?
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,388.915,389.456,No.
1994.94-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,389.456,400.594,"Well, then, what difference does it make to rephrase it to say you can get punitive damages in a nonarbitrable forum, i.e., a judicial forum?"
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,400.594,401.705,Because--
1994.94-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,401.705,405.188,They've agreed to be bound by the laws of the State of New York.
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,409.61,410.361,--Yes.
1994.94-18,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,438.137,444.091,"Well, now, did the contract also provide that the NASD rules apply--"
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,444.091,446.043,--Yes.
1994.94-18,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,446.043,447.264,--to any arbitration?
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,447.264,447.945,Yes.
1994.94-18,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,447.945,454.579,"Now, under the NASD rules, is it clear that punitives can be awarded, or not?"
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,454.579,455.33,Yes.
1994.94-18,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,455.33,459.552,So there may be a conflict in the terms of the contract.
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,459.552,460.424,Yes.
1994.94-18,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,463.696,466.527,So it may become important to know what the parties intended.
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,466.527,468.848,--Yes.
1994.94-18,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,468.848,477.013,"Is it correct, Mr. Harte, that the NASD rules do not require punitives to be awarded, nor do they preclude it?"
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,481.176,482.468,That's correct.
1994.94-18,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,483.638,498.518,"So what we have is a juxtaposition of NASD rules which do not answer the question, they leave the question open, and a New York common law rule which does answer the question to the effect that an arbitrator may not, in fact, award punitive damages."
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,502.481,522.163,"--I would respectfully submit, Justice Souter, that if the NASD rules are interpreted themselves, they're interpreted by the manual and the manual addresses the arbitrators that they are permitted to grant punitive damages."
1994.94-18,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,522.163,523.015,But not required.
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,524.624,536.072,"Well, I assume that they are required if they're going to arbitrate any controversy, and one of the controversies was punitive damages."
1994.94-18,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,536.072,536.562,So you're--
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,536.562,538.684,"If it's given to them, they must--"
1994.94-18,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,538.684,544.5,--So you're saying on the point in question the NASD rules really are not agnostic.
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,550.581,552.764,"--Well, my position is that... no."
1994.94-18,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,579.312,582.023,Let me ask you a different kind of question.
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,592.818,593.429,Yes.
1994.94-18,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,593.429,606.998,"Isn't the question here, whether an arbitrator may or may not award punitive damages, an issue properly considered as one of the arbitrator's authority?"
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,606.998,610.2,Under the FAA?
1994.94-18,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,610.2,610.831,Yes.
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,610.831,620.678,"Under the FAA, it is my view that the arbitrators can, should, and must award punitive damages--"
1994.94-18,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,620.678,621.377,"No, but that's--"
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,621.377,622.358,--if it is a controversy.
1994.94-18,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,622.358,622.859,--Excuse me.
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,634.646,637.989,I do not believe that is an issue.
1994.94-18,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,642.251,645.032,Why isn't it an issue of the arbitrator's authority?
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,663.919,671.854,"--Respectfully, I believe the issue is resolved with the arbitrator's determination, and--"
1994.94-18,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,671.854,677.165,"So that there can never be an appeal to the courts on that issue, under the FAA."
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,677.165,679.296,--As to the authority?
1994.94-18,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,699.79,706.205,"Well, that... I think what you're telling me is the answer to the question if there is an appeal on that subject."
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,715.52,716.922,--The power--
1994.94-18,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,716.922,718.752,--judicial appeal under the FAA?
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,718.752,724.877,"--The power of the arbitrators, I would say yes, we have stated that that is an issue."
1994.94-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,746.091,748.664,"May I ask you this question, then?"
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,766.334,766.714,Yes.
1994.94-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,766.714,770.538,"It happens that their transaction occurs in New York, and the arbitrator applies New York law."
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,777.872,779.892,Yes.
1994.94-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,781.945,788.351,"All right, so your position, then, is that the FAA preempts the Garrity rule."
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,788.351,789.609,--Yes.
1994.94-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,825.493,837.16,"And so I take it it's your further position, or am I correct about this, that when the parties incorporate New York law in an agreement where they expressly refer to New York law--"
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,837.16,837.751,Yes.
1994.94-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,837.751,842.193,--they incorporate New York law subject to Federal rules of preemption?
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,842.193,850.498,"Correct, that it is the Federal law which applies to the comprehensive arbitration agreement--"
1994.94-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,850.498,851.43,How do you--
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,851.43,853.841,--and we state that... excuse me.
1994.94-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,853.841,858.184,--How do you reconcile your position with our decision in the Volt case several years ago?
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,858.184,867.441,"Well, the... if I can just continue a response... well, I will respond to Volt."
1994.94-18,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1084.064,1097.722,"Mr. Harte, may I... maybe I misunderstood your interpretation of this contract clause, but I thought you were presenting the simple case that when we have a choice of law clause, New York law... New York law permits punitive damages."
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,1097.722,1098.493,--Yes.
1994.94-18,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1098.493,1131.796,"And then we move on to the choice of forum clause, which is we're choosing arbitration under the NSAD rules, which are neutral, so you choose New York substantive law which permits punitive damages, you've chosen arbitration, the arbitration forum, which is governed by in this case NASD rules, not California rules, as in the other case, and that's... it's as simple as that, is your contract interpretation, I thought, but what I'm hearing is a little more complicated."
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,1131.796,1144.652,"Well, if you move into a requirement, and I simply state that the choice of law of New York adopts the law, that's not preempted by Federal law."
1994.94-18,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1148.547,1149.408,Because if all you had--
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,1149.408,1150.657,"That's what I'm saying, and that's preemption."
1994.94-18,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1150.657,1156.702,"--If all you had in this contract was a choice of law clause, then New York law permits punitive damages."
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,1156.702,1157.272,Yes.
1994.94-18,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1157.272,1160.414,And... but that would say nothing about the forum.
1994.94-18,0,45052,william_j_harte,,1168.428,1179.177,"Correct, but if... if it is said that you cannot get punitive damages in an arbitra... see, the Mastrobuonos get hit twice."
1994.94-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1199.09,1200.259,"Thank you, Mr. Harte."
1994.94-18,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1202.422,1216.641,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.94-18,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1326.202,1330.403,So in your view this is just strictly a question of contract interpretation.
1994.94-18,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1334.367,1337.579,--It's a question of contract interpretation subject to two caveats.
1994.94-18,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1356.523,1363.427,"But we don't know what those views are, because the arbitrator never said, this is what the parties agreed, and that's what I'm applying."
1994.94-18,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1363.427,1368.558,"--It's typically the case, Your Honor, that arbitrators will not give the reasons for their awards."
1994.94-18,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1390.153,1402.142,"But in those cases, Mr. Stewart, there was a great deal of talk about the law of the shop and that sort of thing, which is really peculiar to labor arbitration, and I don't think you have any factors like that here."
1994.94-18,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1402.142,1409.627,It's certainly true that some of the factors that this Court has relied on in the labor cases in stressing the difference owed to the arbitrator are unique to labor.
1994.94-18,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1437.166,1438.367,"Well, don't you have--"
1994.94-18,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1438.367,1440.109,There has to be some sort of gross or clear error.
1994.94-18,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1440.109,1441.438,"--Don't you have something more here, though?"
1994.94-18,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1449.613,1450.875,"Well, I don't think--"
1994.94-18,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1450.875,1455.296,"Doesn't the arbitrator in effect say, I'm remaking it my way?"
1994.94-18,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1455.296,1465.954,"--We would certainly agree that if the arbitrator said, I'm ignoring the contract and acting on the basis of my own views of justice, that award should not be sustained even if we could imagine a valid basis."
1994.94-18,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1465.954,1469.468,"Well, he isn't going to be quite that dumb, but he came close to that, didn't he?"
1994.94-18,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1469.468,1471.568,"I don't think, with respect, Your Honor, that that's what he said."
1994.94-18,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1501.508,1516.578,"Well, if a reviewing court isn't sure, and thinks maybe the arbitrator was just relying on some spirit or sense of justice, and not relying on the contract terms at all, what is the reviewing court to do--"
1994.94-18,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1516.578,1517.307,"--Well, I--"
1994.94-18,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1517.307,1519.01,--to send it back to the arbitrator?
1994.94-18,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1529.244,1532.357,"--Well, I guess there are about three different answers I should give."
1994.94-18,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1540.654,1542.334,But this one did give an explanation.
1994.94-18,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1542.334,1550.019,"--And the explanation was, I'm doing it for the reasons stated in the petitioner's brief, and I think probably the best indication... it's about a four-page brief."
1994.94-18,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1620.056,1637.808,"Mr. Stewart, may I just ask, going back before the First Options question, wasn't that spirit of the law sentence followed up in that same brief by what I thought was the plaintiff's interpretation... the petitioner's interpretation of the contract, that is, the choice of law clause governed only New York substantive law--"
1994.94-18,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1637.808,1638.657,--That's correct.
1994.94-18,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1638.657,1643.12,"--i.e., punitive damages are available, and arbitration was governed by the NSAD rules?"
1994.94-18,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1643.12,1643.661,That's correct.
1994.94-18,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1779.409,1781.55,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,1783.061,1793.008,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1994.94-18,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1849.885,1854.998,"Well, can I put my understanding of the argument before you and ask you to comment on it?"
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,1890.943,1904.12,"That arguably might foreclose the award of damages, because the claims sought to be brought under the FAA included claims for compensatory damages."
1994.94-18,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1947.219,1974.037,"Why isn't it a reasonable construction of this contract to say it's got a choice of law clause... ordinarily that means substantive law, punitive damages okay under New York law... it's got a choice of forum clause, that forum is arbitration governed by the NSAD rules, you read them compatibly to say, New York law says substantive damages, punitive damages are okay, NSAD procedural law says it's neutral, and so that's a reasonable construction of the contract?"
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,1978.327,1979.269,--I've several responses to that.
1994.94-18,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1995.961,2003.666,"So the parties could not have said, we want New York substantive law, and not New York arbitration law."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2019.486,2023.5,"--I think that would have been a terribly confusing way of going about the issue, had they done so."
1994.94-18,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2023.5,2025.251,"It's a question of what the parties mean, right?"
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2025.251,2025.781,Correct.
1994.94-18,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2025.781,2027.281,They can write their own law into the contract.
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2042.582,2046.695,But the NASD rules themselves are totally silent on the issue of punitive damages.
1994.94-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2047.166,2049.858,Which means they're allowed.
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2055.661,2068.42,"--To the extent... to the extent that the parties' agreement otherwise would prohibit them, and in this case the adoption of the New York choice of law provision, sweeping in the Garrity rule, makes that prohibition--"
1994.94-18,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2068.42,2069.37,"No, but--"
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2084.059,2084.76,--Well--
1994.94-18,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2084.76,2092.076,"If you had nothing but that first sentence, you'd go into a court, because you have no arbitration, the agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2094.417,2106.976,"--The submission itself, the submission of the dispute itself before the NASD contemplated in the submission... this is section 12 of the NASD Code of Arbitration."
1994.94-18,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2106.976,2108.596,Are you reading from somewhere in your brief?
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2108.596,2108.986,Yes.
1994.94-18,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2125.787,2127.319,"Now, where are you reading from?"
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2127.319,2134.173,"--I'm reading from the quote of the rule, actually, which is the block in indented quote on page 29 of the respondent's brief."
1994.94-18,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2134.173,2134.593,"Okay, go ahead."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2134.593,2139.397,It includes other material provisions in the contract of which the--
1994.94-18,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2139.397,2141.186,"Well, I don't... are you sure you're on page 29?"
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2141.186,2150.383,"--Yes, of respondent's brief, page 29."
1994.94-18,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2150.383,2152.975,And then tell us again where you're reading from.
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2152.975,2158.698,I was reading... I was paraphrasing section 12 of the NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure.
1994.94-18,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2158.698,2160.321,"Well, maybe that's what I didn't get."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2162.201,2162.541,No.
1994.94-18,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2164.072,2170.816,"Mr. Polizzotto, isn't the choice open to you something like this."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2195.523,2198.916,"Well, I would say this."
1994.94-18,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2219.9,2221.451,"Well, have each... I'm sorry, go ahead."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2251.911,2252.85,I guess I don't see the--
1994.94-18,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2252.85,2255.093,Has that been the case in all of those instances that you allude to?
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2255.093,2272.133,"--I guess I don't see the conflict, because the choice of law provision in our agreement is the preceding sentence to the dispute resolution provision, if you will, and I think for... a better and more appropriate construction is that they're one and the same, for this purpose."
1994.94-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.133,2281.938,"Mr. Polizzotto, do you think that th New York law at issue here has any existence except as something to be referred to by private parties?"
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2289.735,2293.508,"I think the answer to that question is probably yes, and let me explain why."
1994.94-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2325.649,2325.989,So in--
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2325.989,2328.521,So we disagree with the Government on that point.
1994.94-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2328.521,2352.867,"--So instead of declining to honor arbitral awards, which would violate the FAA as we've interpreted it, the States could instead render arbitral awards worthless by piece-by-piece saying you can't give punitive damages, maybe you can't give expectation damages, maybe you can give nothing but a declaratory judgment."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2355.749,2369.23,"Well, the FAA has preemptive force in the context in which people are attempting to derive or get access to the arbitral forum as an initial matter."
1994.94-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2369.23,2379.495,"Well, then, don't you think it means that the States cannot render the arbitral forum nugatory by simply saying, yes, we have a general law, but this law won't be applicable in an arbitral forum?"
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2380.647,2383.528,"It may mean that, Justice Scalia, but that's not this case."
1994.94-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2385.189,2398.148,"--It may be this case, because if this provision of New York law is totally preempted and is only there so it's a handy referral for a private agreement, which we've said can supersede the FAA, then maybe it's not New York law any more."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2415.699,2429.419,"I think there's an argument to suggest that the FAA does not have the type of preemptive force that would override the natural power of New York law, in an appropriate case."
1994.94-18,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2429.419,2430.469,But isn't this always--
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2472.726,2473.317,"Well, it's--"
1994.94-18,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2473.317,2475.959,And it seems to me that's what you have to say in order to win your case.
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2475.959,2484.684,"--Well, I think that's right to some extent, but that's because the animating policy and the animating preemptive force of the FAA is, what did the parties agree to in this case?"
1994.94-18,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2494.782,2504.468,"Mr. Polizzotto, on the question of what the parties could dispose of, these... the Mastrobuonos, as I understand it, brought this case in Federal district court, and you removed it, is that correct?"
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2504.468,2504.919,--Correct.
1994.94-18,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2504.919,2525.391,"So if they had brought this case in New York Federal District Court, or they brought it in Illinois Federal District Court and said, see this choice of law clause, shall be governed by the laws of New York, and so we want compensatory and punitive damages, suppose you had not asked to have the case dismissed because of the arbitration clause."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2545.995,2549.757,And assuming that the judge and jury would have agreed the same way--
1994.94-18,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2549.757,2550.237,Yes.
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2550.237,2550.868,--that the arbitrators did here.
1994.94-18,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2597.058,2600.441,So that's why I keep coming back to Justice Ginsburg's original question.
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2602.962,2603.413,Correct.
1994.94-18,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2603.413,2611.818,"In my agreement, it says they agree to be governed by the laws of New York, and then they also agree that any controversy will be settled by the NASD rules."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2628.277,2631.589,"The rules are... the manual are not the rules, first of all."
1994.94-18,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2632.561,2649.621,"But beside... that's... all I'm saying is, isn't it at least ambiguous as to what they meant, and once you find it even a little bit ambiguous, then doesn't the court... don't the courts have to follow the arbitrator's interpretation of the contract as to what they meant?"
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2657.468,2678.532,"I think the issue of arbitral power... I think to some extent you're underestimating the force of section 10 of the Federal Arbitration Act, which specifically gives to the courts... it's a directive to the courts that says, you are obligated to vacate awards to the extent that the arbitrators have exceeded their authority."
1994.94-18,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2678.532,2697.142,"Well, I mean, Misco says, yes, that's right, but don't ever do it, and that's in the labor area, so maybe we always used to follow it that way in the court of appeals, anyway, and now this isn't the labor area, so perhaps because it's not the labor area, it isn't true don't every do it, maybe sometimes do it, but at least there... there I'm exaggerating, but you see my point."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2697.142,2704.078,"But there seems to me to be a distinction, and a valid one, between the question of whether an arbitrator has the power to award such relief--"
1994.94-18,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2704.078,2705.167,Yes.
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2705.167,2710.844,"--and the question of whether, under the facts of a given case, the arbitrators correctly exercised that power."
1994.94-18,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2713.755,2722.852,"Yes, I know, but I'm trying to get your answer to the question specifically, isn't there at least enough ambiguity as to what they meant that we'd have to follow the arbitrator?"
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2732.876,2733.447,"Well, one--"
1994.94-18,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2733.447,2734.869,--why we don't have to follow the arbitrator?
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2734.869,2739.732,--One clear answer to that is the fact that this is not what the arbitrators were asked to do in this case.
1994.94-18,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2739.732,2744.296,"Normally we pay no attention to that, except in extreme circumstances, in a court of appeals."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2750.588,2751.389,Part of the record--
1994.94-18,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2751.389,2751.99,Why is this different?
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2751.99,2769.05,"--Part of the record in the district court was the submission made by the petitioners in which they urged the arbitration panel to disregard the law, disregard the authority and the constraints on that authority placed in the agreement that you signed."
1994.94-18,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2769.05,2774.303,"Yes, but the next sentence contradicted that, and the parties say all kinds of things in their brief."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2786.241,2794.528,"Except in this case the application, I believe, and I think Garrity's... a fair reading of Garrity indicates this."
1994.94-18,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2838.667,2841.038,--that means we don't look at their reason.
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2855.708,2860.149,"Well, I suppose I don't agree with your interpretation of the contract--"
1994.94-18,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2860.149,2861.501,"In other words, you're saying it's so clear."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2861.501,2864.273,--And I don't think the contract is... can be interpreted in that fashion.
1994.94-18,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2864.273,2865.953,Okay.
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2865.953,2877.723,I think to some extent the Court needs to focus more on the historic purpose of choice of law clauses generally.
1994.94-18,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2901.366,2911.254,"May I just point out this one problem with... it's the first sentence, of course, we're focusing on in the agreement, and it says, the agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2922.002,2931.007,"No, because this particular Federal court construed the agreement the same way."
1994.94-18,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2931.007,2933.481,"No, no, if the trial had been held in a Federal court--"
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2933.481,2934.089,Oh--
1994.94-18,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2934.089,2934.71,--if you had not removed it.
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2934.71,2936.462,--There's no question that--
1994.94-18,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2936.462,2943.296,"Then, applying the laws of New York, the agreement would have a different meaning than it was given in this case... than the court gave it in this case."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2943.296,2944.407,--But that's precisely the difference.
1994.94-18,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2971.967,2977.82,"It would be different if this first sentence had said, any proceedings held pursuant to this clause shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2987.465,2990.459,"--This is, however, a rather lengthy agreement, and I think the fact that these--"
1994.94-18,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2990.459,2992.24,Paragraph 13 isn't very long.
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,2992.24,2999.473,--these two thoughts are in tandem in the contract is of some significance.
1994.94-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2999.473,3006.138,"Well, it would still be governed by the same law, whether brought in Federal court or in arbitration, to wit, the law that you can't give punitive damages in arbitration."
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,3011.531,3012.212,Absolutely.
1994.94-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3012.212,3014.533,So it's not that two different laws would be applied.
1994.94-18,2,32371,joseph_polizzotto,,3014.533,3016.195,"No, that's correct."
1994.94-18,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3102.361,3106.263,"Thank you, Mr. Polizzotto."
