1965.619,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,137.305,142.194,Is it written for distribution in the same community or back home?
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,142.194,143.043,Back home Your Honor.
1965.619,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,143.043,143.74,Back home.
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,143.74,147.996,It was mimeographed and I believe it was to be sent primarily back home.
1965.619,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,157.499,161.992,It was distributed though in the community (Voice Overlap) --

1965.619,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,162.476,163.158,At least to an extent (Voice Overlap) --
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,163.158,166.038,-- it's our position that it was not distributed at all.
1965.619,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,166.038,170.258,"Well, it was -- some policemen got a hold of it, didn't they?"
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,170.258,170.964,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.619,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,176.905,181.085,"Then as a secret document, it was available in the community, was it not?"
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,181.085,182.403,It never got to that point.
1965.619,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,189.764,190.328,"Well, they --"
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,190.328,191.772,While in the person --
1965.619,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,191.772,197.485,"But they were -- but they were distributed at least to some people in the community, they're willingly or unwillingly on it (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,197.485,199.243,"To two or three policemen, yes, Your Honor."
1965.619,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,199.243,199.424,Yes.
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,199.424,201.131,That's correct.
1965.619,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,400.551,407.54,Was he -- was he tried for all of these articles in one trial?
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,407.54,408.655,There was one trial.
1965.619,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,422.048,423.756,Were those special verdicts?
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,423.756,424.702,No special verdict.

1965.619,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,604.066,605.086,That's a part of it.
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,605.086,609.552,"Yes, it begins at page 121 I believe."
1965.619,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,609.552,625.324,"Well, I'm just looking -- this is the court's (Inaudible) of the jury that criminal libel is defined (Inaudible) as any writing (Inaudible) public model of which any act which went on in this argument."
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,625.324,625.452,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.619,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,625.452,627.61,Is that the whole definition?
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,627.61,629.438,That is the whole of the definition.
1965.619,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.896,747.22,"Mr. London, do you feel that Kentucky has no constitutional power to make statements like that a crime under Garrison?"
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,747.22,748.816,"I think it has not, Your Honor."
1965.619,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,782.382,789.516,"In my state, a man was convicted for a criminal libel for calling George Washington a rascal."

1965.619,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,796.916,799.881,Just about that.
1965.619,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,799.881,805.223,Are there any statutes at all that make libel a crime?
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,805.223,805.951,In Kentucky?

1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,806.532,807.087,"No, Your Honor."
1965.619,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,811.096,814.658,Have there ever been any statutes that made libel a crime?
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,814.658,817.238,"In Kentucky, I believe not, Your Honor."
1965.619,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,821.721,823.119,That was the court.
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,823.119,824.446,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.619,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,824.446,827.542,Cong -- the legislative body has never made it a crime.

1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,857.424,860.631,"To my little knowledge of Kentucky law, I think the majority of crimes."
1965.619,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,860.631,860.908,-- Yes.
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,860.908,862.059,-- there are common law crimes.
1965.619,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,862.059,868.36,Yes.
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,868.36,880.112,"Now, the Attorney General of Kentucky concedes that very trifling personal abuse can be punished as a crime in Kentucky."
1965.619,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,903.394,908.678,Is there any provision in the Kentucky constitution with reference to libel such as it appears in the (Inaudible)

1965.619,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,951.234,955.62,You mean false in the sense that is to mean invidious or --
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,955.62,959.543,"False in the sense that it is untrue, that it's contrary to fact."
1965.619,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,959.543,960.765,That's all?
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,960.765,961.282,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.619,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,961.282,963.959,"In other words, that's a misstatement of --"
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,963.959,964.67,Misstatement of the facts.
1965.619,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,964.67,971.798,-- of being a fact but it's not actually a fact without regard to the motives or feelings of the person.
1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,971.798,972.338,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.619,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1065.875,1068.574,Is the law or the opinion said that?

1965.619,0,22695,ephraim_london,,1072.199,1077.573,May I read at page 20 of his brief.

1965.619,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2286.617,2289.772,"May I ask you, what is the population of that county?"
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2289.772,2291.65,Of the Perry County as a whole?
1965.619,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2291.65,2293.236,Yes.
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2293.236,2297.271,"I think it's about 39,000 something in that vicinity."
1965.619,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2297.271,2299.734,What's the population of the town in which the people --
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2299.734,2302.355,"Hazard, I believe, it was between 6000 to 9000."
1965.619,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2302.355,2305.319,Is that where (Inaudible) 6000 to 9000.
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2305.319,2306.249,Between that Your Honor.
1965.619,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2306.249,2308.081,That's where the Sheriff lives?
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2308.081,2310.518,"He live in Hazard, I think."
1965.619,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2310.518,2316.161,Did the record show whether he's run for office since that occurrence.
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2316.161,2318.55,I believe that his wife run for office.
1965.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2324.241,2324.421,Yes.
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2325.886,2327.925,"He cannot succeed himself, Your Honor."
1965.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2327.925,2331.331,"Oh, you say his wife ran for this place."
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2331.331,2332.793,Yes sir.
1965.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2332.793,2336.772,Elected?
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2336.772,2339.496,I do not know.
1965.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2339.496,2345.984,I don't know if it's material or not.
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2345.984,2351.916,The Sheriff did testify that he thought that he still had the support of the rich and poor in the county.
1965.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2443.556,2446.692,May I ask you this question?
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2518.8,2521.516,"Mr. Chief Justice, obviously, I cannot answer that question."
1965.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2531.148,2540.697,"Well, can we have a verdict if that's a -- this is inconclusive as that."
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2540.697,2555.115,The Court of Appeals had that question presented to it and decided that a verdict agreed upon by the petitioner in this case to be made on a majority vote could be sustained.
1965.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2555.541,2562.642,"But I know but they all have, do they not in your state all have to agree upon the same thing in others?"
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2586.772,2593.994,I think it is true Mr. Chief Justice that they could not have split up in that fashion but I don't believe that they did that.
1965.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2594.034,2594.938,How'd they know?
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2594.938,2603.666,They were required by the instructions to find these matters were libelous and false and known to be false as to all three of these parties.
1965.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2603.666,2615.705,"Were they told that they -- if they would have to agree, all of them on -- that each of them were libeled."

1965.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2629.378,2631.432,122 of the record.
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2631.432,2634.29,It's the principle instruction in the case.
1965.619,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2677.308,2678.685,What page was that?
1965.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2678.685,2679.268,122.
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2679.268,2683.631,"Trans for the instruction begins, Mr. Chief Justice, on page 122 of the record."

1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2703.434,2704.542,It's not in the alternative.
1965.619,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2704.542,2704.675,No.
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2704.675,2706.99,I think the requirement is the jury must find that all three of them --
1965.619,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2706.99,2708.096,All three are libeled.
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2708.096,2708.377,All three of them (Voice Overlap) --
1965.619,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2708.377,2710.691,"The indictment says that and that's what the instruction is saying, is that correct?"
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2710.691,2712.815,That's correct.
1965.619,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2712.815,2725.632,"So there's a -- you take words of their face value it means to the jury, these 10 members of the jury who convicted this man found that he libeled all three of them, is that right?"
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2725.632,2727.116,That's what they were required to believe.
1965.619,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2727.116,2729.723,That's -- they were required to find.

1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2823.095,2830.169,It is cited in my brief at page 7.

1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2832.997,2850.956,"In that initial case in 1888 there was a question raised by the defendant concerning the definition of the offense and after setting out the elements that I have just mentioned, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky held that this constitute a complete offense and apprise the defendant of every fact necessary to constitute crime."
1965.619,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2850.956,2852.439,What kind of a case was that?
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2853.83,2856.343,It was a libel of public officials.
1965.619,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2878.326,2882.324,"False libel of a judge and of a sheriff, is that it?"
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,2882.324,2885.999,Of a sheriff and a judge.
1965.619,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3034.865,3051.19,Do you think that there is a difference in Kentucky law or in constitutional -- applicable constitutional principles between a alleged libel of a public official and of a kind of person.
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,3051.19,3055.762,I don't think the common law of Kentucky makes any distinction Mr. Justice.
1965.619,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3065.604,3085.102,So that we're here -- we have to deal with this case in light of the proposition that the instructions of the law -- Kentucky law of a criminal libel to deal with that as if it were just a private individual involved.
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,3085.102,3088.114,"Yes, on the basis of individual reputation."
1965.619,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3125.74,3167.658,"May I ask Mr. Browning, I think your Court of Appeals analyzed the instruction as satisfying the standards that Sullivan and Garrison laid down but I'm looking at page 125, you pointed to the instruction beginning at 122 which as you say, charged not only as to the public officials but also as to the -- as Mrs. Nolan, not that -- it had to be -- the proof had to be that it is false and libelous, was so known to be false and libelous from -- published by the defendant."
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,3211.268,3212.573,Instruction 3 alone Mr. Justice (Voice Overlap) --
1965.619,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3212.573,3213.033,Would not --
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,3213.033,3214.384,-- would not have satisfied.
1965.619,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3214.384,3227.778,"Now, are we free to stay whether that strikes us as submitting an ultimate ground which would not satisfy Garrison and Sullivan and therefore that the -- or at least there has to be a new trial of this case."
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,3227.778,3232.456,"Mr. Justice, Instruction 3 should not have been given in this case."
1965.619,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3236.133,3237.488,"Well, that's what your court held."
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,3246.409,3246.8,And --
1965.619,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3246.8,3252.766,"I -- as I read your Court of Appeals the position you've taken is what it took, was it not?"
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,3252.766,3253.031,Yes sir.
1965.619,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3253.031,3258.828,If this was not an ultimate ground if -- just something additional --
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,3258.828,3258.918,It --
1965.619,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3258.918,3269.421,-- but in the context of a known to be false and so forth which just preceded it that it could not have misled the jury.
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,3269.421,3271.931,It is entirely superfluous.
1965.619,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3273.901,3292.601,"But can we really know that that may be obsolete but when the jury received the instruction, how are we to say that they could not rest their judgment on the conclusion that this writing was calculated to create disturbances of peace."
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,3307.219,3311.55,"Mr. Justice, if I might answer your question in this fashion."
1965.619,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3322.913,3323.893,"Yes, but (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,3323.893,3326.298,-- then proceeded to instruct further.
1965.619,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3383.875,3385.481,"Oh, you have indeed."
1965.619,1,29258,john_b_browning,,3388.507,3392.303,I would hope that you would agree sir.
1965.619,2,22695,ephraim_london,,3999.628,4000.287,May I just --
1965.619,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4000.287,4000.58,Well --
1965.619,2,22695,ephraim_london,,4000.58,4001.536,-- say one thing with respect to (Voice Overlap) --
1965.619,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4001.536,4002.431,Your time is up.
