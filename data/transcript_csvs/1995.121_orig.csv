1995.121_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,8.004,"We will hear argument in Number 121 Original, Louisiana v. Mississippi."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,13.224,15.26,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
1995.121_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,76.314,79.1,You say the river never found its main course?
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,81.968,86.856,"--When you say island, Justice Stevens--"
1995.121_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,86.856,88.006,Stack Island.
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,88.006,94.193,"--Well, the original Stack Island of 1881 was 6 miles northeast of that location."
1995.121_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,94.193,94.962,Right.
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,94.962,96.195,The boundary is sought to be drawn--
1995.121_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,96.195,98.58,Are you saying that the thalweg was never west of that island?
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,98.58,99.23,"--Yes, sir."
1995.121_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,149.112,166.907,"Mr. Keyser, I'm confused on that point, because I thought that Dr. Easterly testified in answer... there's this colloquy in the third supplemental transcript at 315, 313 to 15."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,178.112,180.628,Yes.
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,200.208,208.897,"Well, if we speak just in neutral terms about disputed territory, that will take care of that confusion, won't it?"
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,208.897,215.218,"Or the disputed areas, sometimes referred to the accretion along the west bank at Lake Providence."
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,215.218,240.602,"You said in your brief, I believe, that the line as the master has recommended that it be drawn now cuts through property which has been owned and farmed by Louisiana residents since I think the beginning of this century, and that statement was simply hotly disputed in Mississippi's brief as being a factual misstatement."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,258.664,268.436,"One place you would want to look is to the testimony of Albert Surles, who adjoins the property of Mr. Sam House, who is the sheriff of that parish."
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,291.468,292.135,Okay.
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,295.753,312.965,"I can't think of anything, except Robert... you have to recall that Mississippi really only had two witnesses, Austin Smith, who is their expert, and Robert Jarvis, who is the grandson of the Houston family."
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,334.378,346.455,"Well, that may be, but none of that indicates that a Louisiana family was farming the land since 1900, and I take it it's the Surles' testimony and that alone that you point to."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,346.455,350.924,"Yes, sir, and you'll see in the testimony there that there... in fact, the lease was introduced: to evidence."
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,350.924,351.774,Okay.
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,351.774,353.007,Thank you.
1995.121_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,363.148,374.872,"Before we leave the thalweg issue, whether it was west of the disputed territory or not, I confess to be totally at a loss to understand what's going on here."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,389.732,390.282,"--No, sir."
1995.121_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.755,400.488,"Well, I'm talking about the prepatent location."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,404.059,414.764,"--It was west of Stack Island before the New Madrid earthquake washed the island away in 1811, and it was west of Stack Island... another problem--"
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,414.764,418.901,"You're saying this isn't Stack Island, isn't that what causes all of this confusion?"
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,418.901,419.168,--Certainly.
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,424.37,446.902,"So if we accept the master's reasoning that in fact you can trace the... I'll call it the migration of this piece of land, whatever it's supposed to be called, from the Stack Island which was east of the boundary thalweg originally to the disputed area now, then your argument falls."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,453.056,454.241,--That's correct.
1995.121_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,454.241,464.947,"And then you do concede... that was the Dr. Easterly testimony that I read, that the boundary thalweg was west of Stack Island at its formation."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,464.947,472.203,"In 1811 or prior years, not at 1994, 1995--"
1995.121_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,472.203,485.694,"Well, we have just gone through that if this Stack Island continued in existence, then the boundary was west of Stack Island at the island's formation."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,485.694,488.313,--Dr. Easterly's not referring to the Louisiana levee.
1995.121_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,500.12,517.232,"And the boundary thalweg, unless Stack Island is washed away, will remain west of Stack Island for all times, unless it is eroded away, and Dr. Easterly confirmed that that was correct."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,517.232,525.088,"That's correct, but he's not referring to Lake Providence, he's referring to Mayersville, Mississippi."
1995.121_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,525.088,529.14,I thought he was referring to Stack Island.
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,529.14,529.323,No.
1995.121_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,544.482,558.89,"Maybe I have this mixed up, but I didn't think it was that complicated, so probably I do have it mixed up, but I thought once upon a time there was a place called Stack Island that used to be part of Mississippi, and there was a big river that flowed to the west of it."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,558.89,559.508,Correct.
1995.121_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,559.508,572.315,"And then that big river that flowed to the west of it began to change its channel and began to flow towards the east of it, and the law is that if the river changes like that, that Stack Island still stays part of Mississippi."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,582.505,583.357,I agree with--
1995.121_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,583.357,593.796,"So you're all arguing about whether this was one island called Stack Island, which has always existed, but the river changed course, or that there are three or four or five islands that keep coming back and forth and disappearing."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,593.796,595.081,--That's exactly correct.
1995.121_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,595.081,595.465,All right.
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,595.665,596.331,That's exactly what--
1995.121_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,596.331,618.696,"If that's correct, then looking through this, it seemed to me they made an awfully good case that there was just one island, because they trace it through on all the maps, and then they show that there were cottonwood trees there that are about 100 years old, or 80 years old or something, and they're still there, and it's pretty hard to see how all these trees could have grown on this island that was popping in and popping out, and you have some other evidence, but what is it, because I haven't found it."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,618.696,621.815,--Let me explain what that problem is there.
1995.121_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,644.931,663.825,"The only thing I found on your side, or my clerk found so far was that one of these maps, which always talks about Stack Island, had at one point marked through it a thing that said river, or channel, and if you assume there were 50 yards on either side or something it must go through... do you know what I'm thinking of?"
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,663.825,665.425,I think that was a survey--
1995.121_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,665.425,666.377,"Yes, right."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,669.213,670.613,--About what?
1995.121_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,670.613,674.95,That shows this island was popping in and out instead of just being one island.
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,674.95,680.085,One of the best things... quickest handles you can get on that is to look at Dr. Easterly's testimony.
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,743.277,772.696,"Mr. Keyser, when you say that it washed away, do you mean that there was on the surface of the river at that point no land showing, or do you mean that the level of the island in relation to the adjacent river banks dropped sufficiently low so that by the legal definition you employ it was not an island even though there was visible land of some sort there, whatever you might call it?"
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,781.052,783.671,"Both of those are true, both of those statements."
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,793.794,804.418,"Wasn't there also testimony that with respect to that time a given family was continuously farming the land, so that with respect to that, wasn't there disputed testimony?"
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,804.418,807.204,They filed affidavits... the island was surveyed--
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,807.204,809.387,"Well, but isn't that what their affidavit said?"
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,809.387,810.155,--Correct.
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,810.155,813.107,And isn't the master entitled to accept the affidavit?
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,813.107,817.575,I think he has to do so with a common sense comprehension of what was going on at the time.
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,817.575,827.867,"Well, if somebody says, there's nothing there, and somebody else says, we were farming that land there at that time, the master can't have it both ways."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,829.633,830.417,That's true.
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,830.417,838.989,"If he chooses yours, they're going to say, oh, gee... the other side is going to say, you've got to show common sense, and if he chooses the other side's testimony, that's what you're saying."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,844.643,851.297,Why would the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers draw hydrographic surveys that showed scour pools at the location of the island?
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,855.767,872.312,"I don't know, but if you want to say it's a choice between whether you're going to accept the testimony of farmers who said they were farming, and a Government agency that drew a map, I don't see anything irrational about saying I'm going to go with the farmers."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,872.312,877.531,"--Well, the island was surveyed in 1881, but it washed away in 1883."
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,878.05,881.002,"And the farmers say no, we were farming it."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,881.002,883.468,"--Well, in the hope that it would come back, which it did."
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,883.468,884.954,"Well, they weren't farming in hope."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,888.256,895.159,They may not have been accurately providing affidavit for the general land office--
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,895.159,898.611,"Well, somebody could always lie in testimony, that's true."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,912.337,924.012,"--With an island elevation of 20 feet and a water elevation of 50 feet, one might doubt the veracity of an affidavit that says there was an ongoing farming operation continuously from year to year."
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,942.256,945.808,"I don't know, but I'm concerned about 1883, and the master--"
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,945.808,946.241,"Well, that's--"
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,946.241,949.51,"--took the testimony of the farmers, and I still don't know why it's irrational."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,949.51,951.195,"--Well, he didn't take the testimony of the farmers."
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,951.195,952.428,Took the affidavit of the farmers.
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,952.428,957.949,"He took... there was an affidavit filed in an effort to kill a fault in a patent application, was what that was about."
1995.121_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,968.021,974.727,"In your view, when did this disputed area form?"
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,988.135,994.539,"According to the testimony of the Corps of Engineers chief hydrologist, it started forming in the 1930's."
1995.121_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1009.381,1016.47,"Your position is, it's 1930, or it's not 1930, when is it?"
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,1017.954,1020.272,--It's a gradual process of building on a river bank.
1995.121_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1041.353,1052.577,"--In the disputed area, roughly, in a 10-year period, or from 1930 if the record tells us, what period of time was it underwater?"
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,1052.577,1054.093,Every year.
1995.121_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1054.845,1056.379,For how long?
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,1056.379,1058.047,--During high water.
1995.121_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1058.047,1060.131,How long does the high water last?
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,1060.131,1062.516,It would depend on the melting of the snow up north.
1995.121_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1070.972,1074.324,So in some periods it would be underwater for 3 or 4 months?
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,1074.324,1076.693,"--Yes, or longer."
1995.121_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1083.949,1089.75,"In other words, there is... if I go to the place... what's... it's not a trick."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,1125.776,1127.076,Major treetops.
1995.121_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1128.81,1132.779,"So in other words, if we go there right now, there is no land."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,1137.916,1138.783,Depending on the water elevation.
1995.121_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1140.201,1146.289,"But no, is it that there is no land there at all, it's below the water, like feet, many, many feet below?"
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,1146.289,1151.324,I would imagine if conditions today on October 2nd or 3rd--
1995.121_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1151.324,1164.234,"And all the witnesses agreed, everybody said... I didn't get that from the report... they all went out to this place of what they're calling Stack Island, and there's no land, it's just water 3 or 4 months a year?"
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,1164.234,1166.184,--That is the nature of the river.
1995.121_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1166.935,1169.019,But is... am I right in saying that?
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,1169.019,1170.054,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.121_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1170.054,1175.708,"So there is no land there, there is just water 3 or 4 months every year, is that the case?"
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,1175.708,1177.324,It may be longer than 3 or 4 months.
1995.121_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1177.324,1178.41,"All right, but not shorter."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,1178.41,1179.643,It could be shorter.
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1179.643,1181.945,It's like the Nile Valley.
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,1182.478,1183.495,Correct.
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1186.497,1188.016,"May I go back, then, to my earlier question?"
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,1188.016,1188.849,"Yes, sir."
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1188.849,1204.126,"Part of your argument, if not your case, then, rests on your claim that this is not an island because it is not high enough in relation to the banks of the river to be called an island."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,1204.126,1204.609,Correct.
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1204.609,1220.587,"And you're saying that for that reason, even though during some parts of the year there's land here, and indeed there's enough land to have trees, the tops of which look like a forest, it's still not an island, and the island rule, or the island exception, rather, does not apply."
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,1221.887,1223.272,Yes.
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1223.272,1223.905,Okay.
1995.121_orig,0,25573,gary_l_keyser,,1223.905,1224.955,It wouldn't apply to this--
1995.121_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1224.955,1246.555,"Why... you in effect then are saying that the island exception should not apply to anything that does not... any body of land sometime above the river, which sometime is located above the surface of the river, which is not...

1995.121_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2940.835,2942.185,What do you think it really is?
1995.121_orig,2,38770,robert_r_bailess,,2943.203,2949.774,"The Corps of Engineers establishes a standard low water, which is then termed zero gauge."
1995.121_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2949.774,2950.407,Right.
1995.121_orig,2,38770,robert_r_bailess,,2950.407,2954.743,The top bank is in the neighborhood of 35 feet.

1995.121_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2992.868,2993.553,All right.

1995.121_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3010.931,3013.347,Is standard low water the same as zero gauge?
1995.121_orig,2,38770,robert_r_bailess,,3013.347,3013.883,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.121_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3013.883,3014.716,I want to be sure.

1995.121_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3054.858,3057.043,And top bank means what?
1995.121_orig,2,38770,robert_r_bailess,,3057.043,3077.973,"According to Dr. Winkley, it is approximately 35 feet above zero gauge which, to determine that, what he did in his testimony was, he took a period of time, and he plotted heights of the river during the 1870's to the 1880's."

1995.121_orig,2,38770,robert_r_bailess,,3132.81,3134.193,Top bank is what they say.
1995.121_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3134.193,3136.428,"--Yes, that Stack Island would qualify?"
1995.121_orig,2,38770,robert_r_bailess,,3136.428,3138.03,"That is correct, Justice Souter."
1995.121_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3138.03,3140.147,And qualified in 1881?
1995.121_orig,2,38770,robert_r_bailess,,3140.147,3142.999,"That is correct, and Dr. Winkley admitted that."

1995.121_orig,2,38770,robert_r_bailess,,3178.672,3180.357,That is absolutely correct.
1995.121_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3180.357,3180.924,Okay.
1995.121_orig,2,38770,robert_r_bailess,,3206.424,3208.374,Let me answer that in this way.
1995.121_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3217.33,3218.363,To the low water mark.
1995.121_orig,2,38770,robert_r_bailess,,3220.182,3220.948,It ought to be.

1995.121_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3257.288,3257.705,Okay.

1995.121_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3258.557,3258.84,All right.

1995.121_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3273.982,3276.016,Okay.
