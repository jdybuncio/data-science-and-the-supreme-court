2004.03-1237,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.394,We'll hear argument now in the Merck KGaA v. Integra Lifesciences.
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,10.793,13.866,"Thank you, Your... Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,50.387,56.43,"Well, would you just clarify something for me as we start to consider the case?"
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,74.878,75.95,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,81.816,84.978,Do you think it was properly stated in that instruction?
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,84.978,87.319,"--The core of the instruction, yes, Your Honor, was--"
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,87.319,88.294,That's as good as we could do.
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,88.294,94.165,"--Your Honor, I believe... the answer is, the core was as good as this Court can do, and--"
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,94.165,94.277,All right.
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,100.117,100.724,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,100.724,100.836,--from the evidence?
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,100.836,104.617,"It was entitled to a verdict as a matter of law, but let me just--"
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,104.617,122.141,"Okay, but the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit did not address the case in... by looking at the evidence and whether a directed verdict should have been given--"
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,122.141,122.615,"--Your Honor, the--"
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,122.615,123.052,--or not?
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,123.052,128.043,--the Federal Circuit did understand that this was a JMOL case but--
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,128.043,137.152,"No, but it seemed to decide the case based on its view of the statute as just applying to generic drugs or something--"
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,137.152,138.708,"--That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,138.708,141.445,"--So it didn't, in fact, come to grips with the evidence."
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,141.445,148.501,"It absolutely did not come to grips with the evidence, nor did it grapple with the alternative arguments that Integra was presenting--"
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,148.501,149.177,"Yeah, so--"
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,149.177,149.461,--so they--
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,149.461,156.106,--maybe all we have to do is deal with whether that court should have addressed the evidence.
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,156.106,165.86,"--That would be one answer, Your Honor, reverse and not addressing the alternative legal grounds, but I would urge this Court to address the alternative grounds, because they raise--"
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,165.86,166.218,All of them?
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,172.629,175.732,"--No, Your Honor, because the research tools problem was never presented--"
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.732,175.855,No.
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,175.855,179.07,--as an issue before the jury or before the District Court.
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,179.282,180.572,Or the Tripps Treaty?
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,180.572,181.259,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,181.259,181.744,No.
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,181.744,184.549,"In fact, that's not even raised by Respondents."
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.242,185.338,All right.
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,187.204,193.533,--I would... I would urge the Court not broach the subject of any of the questions that are not properly presented--
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.533,193.831,"--Okay, so--"
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,193.831,193.937,--to this Court.
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.937,195.88,--all we're doing is looking at the statute.
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,195.88,196.407,We're--
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,196.407,196.525,Thank you.
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,196.525,198.188,"--Yes, Your Honor, we're looking at the statute--"
2004.03-1237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,198.188,198.331,Okay.
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,198.331,217.386,"--but it is an... it is important, in answer to the very first question, to embellish a bit, because the lower courts need this Court's guidance, because every one of the theories on which Integra defends the judgement below raise exactly the same problems that the Federal Circuit's opinion raises."
2004.03-1237,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,228.437,235.674,What are the alternative grounds that you're discussing now passed on by the Federal Circuit?
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,235.674,278.937,"Your Honor, they were not passed on by the Federal Circuit, except perhaps to the extent that the Federal Circuit may have concluded that all... or that, excuse me... that safety is the only issue before the FDA when it is considering an Investigational New Drug application, or that a drug innovator may not harbor additional purposes in an experiment beyond the FDA exemption, or that the... excuse me... beyond FDA regulatory purposes... or, third, that the exemption does not cover efforts to optimize the drug candidate after it's identified and that candidate is, in fact, the lead candidate."
2004.03-1237,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,394.973,398.54,"Mr. Rosenkranz, just one piece of information."
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,413.142,421.696,"The IND, Your Honor, is not in the record, because it was excluded from evidence, which may be why the jury reached the wrong conclusion."
2004.03-1237,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,470.224,504.426,"Mr. Rosenkrantz, the items you listed earlier seemed to me to more narrow than what I took to be the point of your opening brief, which was that the decision below was wrong because the Federal Circuit simply excluded all consideration of materials prepared for purposes of the IND, as opposed to materials prepared for the... for the drug application, later on."
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,507.967,509.114,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,509.114,511.364,Because I don't read the opinion that way.
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,517.128,544.919,"Your Honor, there is certainly a way to read the Federal Circuit's opinion... and this is also in response to Justice O'Connor's earlier question... in which it did grapple with the very questions we're talking about now, and did answer the questions about whether it's just safety... and I believe the Federal Circuit believed that only safety data were relevant; that is certainly what it indicated in oral argument... and also that dual purposes are not permissible."
2004.03-1237,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,550.343,551.441,Have you answered my question?
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,560.73,561.141,--The--
2004.03-1237,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,561.141,562.511,--drug application.
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,562.511,563.759,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,596.942,626.525,"So your first answer, are you relying what the Federal Circuit said in its opinion... and it's in 10a of our cert petition appendix... that is, the Federal Circuit's statement of the question presented, whether the preclinical research conducted under Scripps Merck agreement is exempt from liability for infringement of Integra's patents."
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,626.525,627.101,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,642.678,664.832,"Yeah, but it... it's not at all clear in the opinion that the Court was using preclinical and clinical in the very technical sense that you were... that you use it, which means ""clinical"" is stuff submitted for the drug application, and ""preclinical"" is for the earlier application."
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,665.755,667.098,"Your Honor, it's not at all clear."
2004.03-1237,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,692.078,692.712,"Well, Mr. Rosenkranz--"
2004.03-1237,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,692.712,697.756,"A moment ago... a moment ago, you were reading from 12(a)."
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,700.285,716.151,"I believe it was the first paragraph, and I was reading from the end of that paragraph, Your Honor, the... which begins, ""Thus"", three lines... really two... the word ""thus"" is at the end of the third line from the bottom of that paragraph, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,716.151,716.957,Thank you.
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,716.957,732.508,"And so, I was saying earlier that a critical component of Integra's case revolves around the notion that the use may not have more than one purpose, and that purpose can only be FDA directed."
2004.03-1237,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,774.544,780.927,"Would that... would that... would that be explained by the research-tool doctrine, or not?"
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,780.927,782.382,"--No, absolutely not, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,790.104,794.84,"I guess what I was asking, Would you ever use the peptide as a research tool, was my... was my question."
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,794.84,795.442,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,899.434,915.753,"--Do you agree then that at whatever period, however you want to describe the period, at which the researcher is basically trying to figure out what drug to concentrate on, that that period is too far back in time to come within the exception?"
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,915.753,916.27,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,930.781,933.831,"Okay, here's what... here's the problem I have with your argument."
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,985.04,986.027,"Well, Your Honor--"
2004.03-1237,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,986.027,1006.266,"It seems to me that the law of the case, as to what the statute means for your case, is set by the instruction, and that is why I am reluctant to get into the issue that you raise here, because I think we're rather... you are limited, and we are tied in what we can do as a result of your agreement with the instruction."
2004.03-1237,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1006.266,1011.423,"--Your Honor... and I see my time is running out; I'd like to reserve it for rebuttal, so let me, just briefly."
2004.03-1237,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1059.091,1060.991,"Very well, Mr. Rosenkranz."
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1062.953,1082.341,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1237,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1120.765,1125.911,Do you have to have the FDA's permission to start clinical testing?
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1125.911,1133.778,"Yes, that's the purpose of an IND application, is... the whole... the only thing that FDA is looking at, at that point, is whether to permit human clinical trials to proceed."
2004.03-1237,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1163.845,1167.808,Would you state again what you say the second error was?
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1167.808,1178.815,"--The second error, we believe, is that the Federal Circuit indicated that only studies undertaken on the single compound ultimately submitted in an IND are protected by the exception."
2004.03-1237,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1185.273,1185.551,That--
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1185.551,1186.336,--which is the best to submit.
2004.03-1237,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1186.336,1194.735,--But that might well determine whether the research was relatively directly related.
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1214.084,1216.207,We would... we would look at it this way.
2004.03-1237,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1227.503,1229.129,"Yes, I understand all that."
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1229.636,1229.795,And the--
2004.03-1237,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1229.795,1234.824,"--I'm just saying that that is certainly one interpretation of ""reasonably directly""."
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1247.319,1249.793,"--Well, I think we would disagree with that, for two reasons."
2004.03-1237,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1262.689,1264.636,What's your position on the jury instruction?
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1266.742,1274.746,"We think that it's... if it's construed correctly, we think that it's correct, but just too general to be of assistance to the courts in addressing the more specific questions of the issue here."
2004.03-1237,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1308.745,1313.214,If in fact the jury instruction is too general.
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1319.316,1324.216,"--We think that the Petitioner should not, and is not, arguing inconsistently with the jury instruction."
2004.03-1237,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1326.873,1332.963,"The Petitioner said he agreed with the core of the instruction, whatever that is."
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1332.963,1335.891,--I think that's just with the general principles.
2004.03-1237,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1366.455,1375.323,Was the court below wrong in saying that the statute was enacted only to help generic drug development?
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1375.323,1375.882,--Yes.
2004.03-1237,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1397.342,1401.176,"Is that going to be your third point, the third error that the court supposedly committed?"
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1401.176,1410.972,"--No, the third is the error committed by the District Court and relied on by Respondents here, which is the statement that FDA only considers safety, and not efficacy, in determining whether to permit human clinical trials to proceed."
2004.03-1237,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1472.408,1481.201,What are the consequences if someone goes ahead and conducts a clinical trial without the approval of the FDA?
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1481.201,1483.042,--That's contrary to federal law.
2004.03-1237,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1488.806,1501.354,"Your time is short, so could you tell us how far back you think, under the statute, you can go and not... and be within the safe harbor?"
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1501.354,1502.852,Yes.
2004.03-1237,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1537.867,1540.101,Why isn't that basic research?
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1571.508,1573.007,--No.
2004.03-1237,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1625.368,1634.333,"Did the earlier process that you described, the basic research, is that within the common law research exemption?"
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1634.333,1636.732,--The... it would be if it was noncommercial.
2004.03-1237,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1636.732,1640.321,"How does the common law of research exemption figure into this case, if at all?"
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1640.321,1650.917,"It's not directly you, Your Honor, because Petitioner has not relied on it at all, and for good reason, which is that the courts have consistently held that the common law research exception applies only to noncommercial activity."
2004.03-1237,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1664.473,1671.395,"Does Scripps... is Scripps in the business, too?"
2004.03-1237,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1671.395,1677.955,"I see my red light is on, if I could answer the question."
2004.03-1237,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1686.103,1687.355,"Thank you, Mr. Joseffer."

2004.03-1237,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1809.568,1809.941,Exactly.
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,1830.601,1840.079,"--The precise holding and the reasoning of the Federal Circuit was, they found no error in what the District Court's--"
2004.03-1237,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1840.079,1843.551,Because they interpreted the statute in a particular way.
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,1846.495,1847.135,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1847.135,1847.811,--No?
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,1847.811,1859.618,The only interpretation of the statute that can be found in the District Court's order denying Merck's motion for judgement as a matter of law is the standard articulated in the jury instruction.
2004.03-1237,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.618,1866.636,"No, but I think... I think the Justice was asking whether it was the Court of Appeals that--"
2004.03-1237,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1866.636,1866.803,Yes.
2004.03-1237,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1866.803,1868.157,--that applied a particular standard.
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,1896.709,1911.284,"The question before the Federal Circuit was whether the District Court erred by not applying the rational predicate interpretation of section 271(e), which was the sole focus of Merck's appeal to the Federal Circuit."
2004.03-1237,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1911.284,1920.323,"Why should we say that's the question, when the Federal Circuit, itself, said what I read before from 10a?"
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,1920.323,1932.466,"We're... on page 10a, the Federal Circuit said, ""Thus""... and this is in the... the last sentence in the middle paragraph of the page..."
2004.03-1237,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1945.725,1948.226,That would answer that question?
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,1948.226,1951.677,It does not.
2004.03-1237,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1973.047,1988.524,"So they say that does not... the safe harbor does not reach, among other things, back down the chain of experimentation to embrace the development of new drugs that will be subject to FDA approval."
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,1998.15,2000.091,That is a correct statement of the law.
2004.03-1237,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2000.091,2001.244,That is a correct statement of the law.
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2024.299,2026.87,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2064.283,2077.284,"Mr. Flores, when I asked you about the sentence on page 10, I intended, not the one that you read, but an earlier one that precedes it, and that is,"
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2115.945,2118.925,"Your Honor, I disagree."
2004.03-1237,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2129.957,2131.967,That's the way I read it.
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2192.874,2194.372,Yes.
2004.03-1237,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2230.499,2238.22,"All right, this very dialogue makes me able to ask a question that I think will reveal better to you what I need an answer to."
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2285.905,2300.301,"--The reason it would not be appropriate for the Court to do so is because no standard, other than the Intermedics standard that was applied by the District Court, was ever suggested to the District Court."
2004.03-1237,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2303.826,2307.079,We're not reviewing the District Court's opinion?
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2327.084,2330.012,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2338.253,2348.151,"Well, don't you think that the Federal Circuit may have focused too much on generic drug applications?"
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2350.012,2359.851,"I think the Federal Circuit was right, as a factual matter, describing the impetus for Congress adopting section 271(e)."
2004.03-1237,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2359.851,2366.154,"Well, it seemed to be driven by its very narrow focus on generic drug development."
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2378.394,2380.208,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
2004.03-1237,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2380.208,2399.962,"See, I think there may be a difference there, because I think the other side thinks that how the drug is expected to work, in practice, and whether it, in fact, will attack a certain disease, is part of what the FDA looks at."
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2406.275,2407.032,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2421.062,2424.273,Can you repeat that 355 what?

2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2429.404,2432.892,--(B)(i) again.
2004.03-1237,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2449.297,2457.104,"Is this text that you're referring to, is it someplace... is the text someplace where we can look at it while you're explaining this to us?"
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2457.104,2460.811,"--No, Your Honor, it's not in the appendix, unfortunately."
2004.03-1237,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2468.661,2480.02,But does the... does the statute... is that the only place we would look to decide whether safety is the only consideration for the FDA?
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2480.02,2481.672,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2501.345,2501.963,But you do--
2004.03-1237,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2501.963,2502.208,What are you--
2004.03-1237,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2502.208,2508.923,"--you do agree, do you not, that the Government does not agree with you on this point?"
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2508.923,2511.108,"--The Government disagrees, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2511.108,2511.304,Right.
2004.03-1237,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2511.304,2512.51,--What are you reading from?
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2512.51,2518.973,Page 3a in the addendum to Integra's brief.
2004.03-1237,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2518.973,2519.752,Okay.
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2519.752,2526.184,That's 21 C.F.R. Section 312.22(a).
2004.03-1237,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2544.017,2547.084,"Okay, that talks about the primary concern."
2004.03-1237,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2585.323,2588.854,"In fact, that paragraph refers to effectiveness, as I read it."
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2588.854,2591.093,"Yes, it does, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2601.854,2607.346,But there is at least... there's got to be some way to tell whether it even addresses the disease.
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2610.513,2616.763,"The FDA statutes and regulations do not use the term ""efficacy"" to describe that."
2004.03-1237,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2627.39,2639.288,Congress described the need that there be some relationship between the consequences of taking the given drug and the disease which is supposed to be addressed by taking the drug.
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2642.146,2642.588,--They--
2004.03-1237,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2642.588,2644.898,"They used the word ""effectiveness"", which is pretty close."
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2644.988,2649.547,"--No, Your Honor, they used the word, in the statute,"
2004.03-1237,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2652.566,2653.697,That's important.
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2718.072,2723.416,The answer is that the FDA considers what information is available to it.
2004.03-1237,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2737.66,2741.643,But why wouldn't it have information about effectiveness on animals?
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2754.795,2760.027,--The FDA is concerned with safety in animals.
2004.03-1237,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2776.63,2792.102,"Yeah, but it's absolutely clear, I thought, that the FDA, at the end of the day in some of these drug applications, ends up looking at not only safety, but how effective it is."
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2810.341,2819.444,"--Your Honor, of course FDA is very concerned about efficacy, and it... but concerned about that after it gets data from human clinical trials."
2004.03-1237,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2821.487,2822.963,"Well, I'm not sure."
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2835.517,2853.446,"--If efficacy... or some information about what benefits the drug might have, is probably a better way to phrase it... is considered at the safety stage as part of the safety balancing, then it's got to be done under good laboratory practices, because--"
2004.03-1237,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2853.446,2858.258,"Suppose that we concluded... well, I don't want to cut you off."
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2860.983,2874.3,"--If... I believe the Solicitor General's point is that the safety decision is a practical one, and you've got to look at both sides of the ledger... potential harm, potential benefit... I don't believe it's proper to call that ""efficacy""."
2004.03-1237,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2898.235,2899.505,I don't... so what?
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2901.605,2912.964,"Well, Justice Scalia, let me say that I think that this whole discussion about the interpretation of the FDA law is really somewhat off the point here."
2004.03-1237,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2912.964,2915.61,"I was beginning to think that, too."
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2916.932,2926.82,"And the reason I say that is because we're not here to judge the legality of an FDA action in its discretion, saying we want to consider preclinical--"
2004.03-1237,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2926.82,2936.537,"Yeah, but the reason you brought it up is because the particular certificate that is for a safety-certified lab is not applicable to the lab that used this stuff."
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2937.96,2938.078,--That is correct.
2004.03-1237,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2938.078,2940.152,And I understand that.
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2990.812,2991.408,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2991.408,2992.009,Because?
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,2994.531,3020.429,"Well, Your Honor, there's numerous admissions in the record that Merck made which would indicate that they've... that the program carried out at Scripps was not reasonably related to the FDA, that the real FDA work was being done in Germany, that the majority of these experiments conducted by Scripps were conducted on chicken embryos, which Merck's own scientists agree have nothing to do with safety, and, by logical extension, they can't tell you much about efficacy, either."
2004.03-1237,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3033.523,3042.829,"Well, we don't... I hope we don't have to, at this Court, look at all the evidence and try to sort it out that way."
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,3054.386,3059.297,"--Your Honor, this Court does not have to get into Rule 50 review of the evidence here--"
2004.03-1237,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3059.297,3059.819,No.
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,3059.819,3062.847,--because there's no dispute about the legal standard.
2004.03-1237,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3068.782,3080.834,"Well, I thought the issue was whether the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit correctly determined the scope of the exemption."
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,3087.677,3093.031,"--Your Honor, the Federal Circuit didn't determine the scope of the invention."
2004.03-1237,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3095.216,3095.743,Exemption.
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,3099.909,3101.861,"--Yes, that's what I was referring to."
2004.03-1237,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3115.001,3151.608,"Well, but it's certainly... that the FDA considers only safety, and nothing else, that it was directed at generic drugs, not others, and that there was a cutoff point earlier than that argued by the Government and the Petitioner for what is exempt preclinical trial information."
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,3151.608,3161.71,"--The Federal Circuit's opinion, I believe... the Federal Circuit's opinion rejects the rational predicate theory."
2004.03-1237,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3167.171,3173.55,They spent about ten pages in the appendix trying to do that.
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,3173.55,3177.907,--But Federal Circuit didn't do that.
2004.03-1237,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3272.95,3280.934,"The dissenting judge did not... the dissenting judge, Judge Newman, did not read the Court's opinion the way you do."
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,3282.421,3283.935,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3283.935,3296.164,"Maybe we should take that into account, to some extent, that someone who participated on the bench had a different take on what her colleagues were saying?"
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,3296.164,3301.752,"That is certainly a consideration, but we disagree with Judge Newman on that point."
2004.03-1237,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3301.752,3312.104,Is there a difference between you and Merck concerning the scope and extent of the common law research exemption?
2004.03-1237,2,35846,mauricio_a_flores,,3314.025,3319.592,"That issue hasn't entered into the case, so there's been no differences articulated, Your Honor."
2004.03-1237,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3428.966,3432.625,"Thank you, Mr. Flores."
