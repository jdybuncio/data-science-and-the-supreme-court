1973.73-477,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,23.033,"We will hear arguments next in 73-477, Gerstein against Pugh."
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,47.783,52.403,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-477,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,433.251,443.071,"Mr. Mellon, I wonder if I can interrupt you to ask you if you can help me get cleared the chronology of how this happens."
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,471.222,476.027,"It occurs both ways, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1973.73-477,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,497.663,499.415,After the arrestee is in custody?
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,499.415,502.491,Is in custody that is right.
1973.73-477,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,502.715,504.118,Is there a time limit?
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,504.118,504.647,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-477,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,504.647,505.887,In which he must act.
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,505.887,506.579,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-477,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,562.154,574.243,"So, in that kind of a case, the arrest follows the issuance of the information and it’s by virtue of a habeas issued by the prosecuting official."
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,574.243,585.341,"Yes, the habeas issues in Florida, under the Florida rules, unless the man is already in custody or unless he is out on bond."
1973.73-477,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,594.868,599.13,By the same man who files the information presumably.
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,599.13,604.948,"No, Your Honor, the habeas is issued by the Clerk acting at the Court’s behest."
1973.73-477,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,604.948,607.257,"Acting in the prosecutor’s behest, isn’t it?"
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,607.257,615.073,The prosecutor indicates that if the rule provides that the habeas shall issue at the time the information was filed --
1973.73-477,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,615.073,616.885,"Right, issued by --"
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,616.885,624.742,Unless the prosecutor request that it be issued at some subsequent time.
1973.73-477,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,624.742,642.499,"And now that I have interrupted you can you tell me what determines, in Florida procedure, whether a prosecution is to be initiated by information or whether it is to be instituted by a grand jury indictment."
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,642.499,654.45,The only mandatory requirement in Florida is in the area of capital offenses that a grand jury indictment must hand it up.
1973.73-477,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,657.274,665.784,"And are they, in fact, prosecuted by information or are they sometimes prosecuted by grand jury indictment, other crimes?"
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,665.784,669.369,"Yes, other crimes."
1973.73-477,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,672.642,676.01,"Well, what determines that?"
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,679.666,682.048,"The grand jury, generally, makes that determination."
1973.73-477,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,707.807,713.056,Can the grand jury take up a case that the prosecutor doesn’t want them to take up?
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,713.056,714.062,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-477,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,716.244,717.527,How?
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,717.527,725.728,Simply by directing the prosecutor to bring that matter before them.
1973.73-477,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,725.728,730.647,"When you have this here before the prosecutor, are the witnesses sworn?"
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,730.647,732.319,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-477,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,740.425,743.169,And where is that in the statute?
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,743.169,743.778,Where is that in the statute?
1973.73-477,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,743.778,745.989,I didn’t see that in the statute.
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,760.319,768.24,"Your Honor, counsel for amicus will—it’s set out in the four rules of criminal procedure that the matter must be based on the --"
1973.73-477,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,768.24,772.434,"And you say that this is a detached person, the prosecutor?"
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,772.434,776.056,"At that juncture, yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-477,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,776.056,784.691,"And as I understand it, most mind-run criminal offenses are preceded against by information."
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,799.453,799.618,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1973.73-477,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,799.618,800.593,Do I understand that correctly?
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,800.593,801.85,That is correct.
1973.73-477,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,801.85,809.921,"Now is this case confined in Dade County, Florida or is this a statewide problem or question?"
1973.73-477,0,34878,leonard_mellon,,809.921,822.817,"It’s a statewide question, Your Honor, since we are dealing here with the problem about -- Dade County has a unique magistrate system which arose during the time this case was pending on appeal."
1973.73-477,1,39907,raymond_l_marky,,1686.807,1688.239,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-477,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1688.239,1691.772,Mr. Marky.
1973.73-477,1,39907,raymond_l_marky,,1691.772,1698.864,Three rulings that were decided by the Court of Appeals disturbs Florida in particular.
1973.73-477,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1831.326,1833.246,Who was the first appearance before?
1973.73-477,1,39907,raymond_l_marky,,1833.246,1834.645,"A magistrate, Your Honor."
1973.73-477,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1846.783,1853.099,But supposing that the prosecutor try and goes in on this first hearing and says “we do not contest the right to bail.”
1973.73-477,1,39907,raymond_l_marky,,1853.099,1857.607,"In that instance, Your Honor, we still have a rational classification."
1973.73-477,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1892.675,1900.235,"Well not involved here, as I understand it, but the people who are in custody as a result of grand jury indictments --"
1973.73-477,1,39907,raymond_l_marky,,1900.235,1908.474,"No, I am talking about the discrimination, Your Honor, of equal protection between the seven days and the three days."
1973.73-477,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1917.571,1919.783,You say this is done before a magistrate.
1973.73-477,1,39907,raymond_l_marky,,1921.059,1922.674,"No, that’s statewide, Your Honor."
1973.73-477,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1922.674,1923.726,Statewide?
1973.73-477,1,39907,raymond_l_marky,,1923.726,1933.859,"Which brings me to the third element of the Court’s ruling, Your Honor, under the old system, it was no good and I’ll stand here and tell you that."
1973.73-477,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1979.074,1993.591,"Yes, but the claim and that’s the issue in this case is that if he is in there within 96 hours with his information then the man stays in custody, if he cannot make bail, indefinitely without any hearing as to probable cause --"
1973.73-477,1,39907,raymond_l_marky,,1993.591,1994.944,That’s not --
1973.73-477,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1994.944,1996.928,"That’s what the issue is in this case, is it not?"
1973.73-477,1,39907,raymond_l_marky,,1996.928,2003.147,"Yes, but I am going to the problem, Your Honor, of this long detention before anything occurs."
1973.73-477,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2003.147,2004.454,"Well, but that’s not the issue in this case."
1973.73-477,1,39907,raymond_l_marky,,2004.454,2011.559,"But after the information is filed, a whole host of things happen including Florida’s criminal rules."
1973.73-477,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2036.388,2038.431,Is it one way of summary judgment?
1973.73-477,1,39907,raymond_l_marky,,2038.431,2039.831,Yes.[Laughter]
1973.73-477,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2039.831,2041.337,"It makes quite a difference, does it not?"
1973.73-477,1,39907,raymond_l_marky,,2041.337,2044.705,"It -- Your Honor, which brings me to the point."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2551.356,2554.33,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-477,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.576,2574.743,"Can I ask you at the outset, was Preiser against Rodgriguez cited at all or considered in the Court of Appeals?"
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2574.743,2577.623,"It was not, Your Honor, but it has no application in this case."
1973.73-477,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2587.53,2604.542,"If the custody was the only thing that was at issue in the sense that if there had been no pretrial incarceration and just a summons to come to court at a certain time, this case wouldn’t have arisen, I take it."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2604.542,2609.247,"It may still have arisen Your Honor, because the question of whether or not there is custody might still be a valid question."
1973.73-477,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2609.247,2612.002,"Well, I know, but if it wasn’t?"
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2612.002,2619.985,"It is true that this was a pure custody case, but my point is that all we’re asking is the District Court to compel there to be a preliminary hearing --"
1973.73-477,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2619.985,2621.051,Or release.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2621.051,2622.276,"No, sir, never."
1973.73-477,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.128,2634.211,Your object was never to be released.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2634.211,2635.279,"Only if there is no probable cause, Your Honor."
1973.73-477,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2635.279,2636.708,I know but—
1973.73-477,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2636.708,2643.623,"But even if you’re there under 1983, certainly, the District Court’s ruling on your action has got to be the only alternative."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2648.588,2657.22,"The decision of the District Court, in offering the alternative to the state and saying “this is the sanction,” whereas, a statement saying “release him.”"
1973.73-477,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2664.042,2668.68,"The question I asked is if Preiser had been considered it all by the Court of Appeals, and you say it was not."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2668.68,2682.643,"It was not and let me add one other thing regarding Preiser, it’s that even if Preiser has application in this case, state remedies were futile and Preiser makes it quite clear that there’s no need to attempt habeas corpus in State Court if it were to be futile and it is in Florida."
1973.73-477,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2682.643,2688.57,"I know, but the question is the form of your action in the Federal Court, whether it should be federal habeas corpus or not."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2688.57,2690.389,And if it should be habeas corpus.
1973.73-477,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2694.196,2700.834,Then we would have -- then you would certainly focus on and have the District Court’s judgment as to whether there was a local remedy.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2700.834,2701.481,"Yes, sir, but it’s quite --"
1973.73-477,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2701.481,2702.777,Which we do not have now.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2702.777,2703.708,"Yes, you do, Your Honor."
1973.73-477,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2709.391,2710.855,Did the District Court say so?
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2710.855,2711.469,"Yes, sir, and the Fifth Circuit said so."
1973.73-477,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2711.469,2712.612,What did they say so?
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2712.612,2719.732,"It said that, in Florida, once an information is filed, it is quite clear there is no way to test the termination of probable cause."
1973.73-477,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2721.296,2724.884,How about federal -- state habeas?
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2724.884,2731.815,"Futile, absolutely futile, because once the information is filed under Florida law you cannot go behind it to determine probable cause."
1973.73-477,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2739.452,2745.187,Do you disagree with your opponent here? He suggests that state habeas might be available.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2745.187,2748.246,"He suggested it, but he did not address the question of whether or not it would be futile."
1973.73-477,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2757.164,2763.774,"There’s a footnote, I think, in your brief or one of the briefs about what has happened to the respondent in this case."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2765.453,2770.443,"He has been convicted, Your Honor, and he is in jail in Belle Glade, Florida."
1973.73-477,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2772.612,2775.142,You are talking about the class action aspect.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2775.142,2782.352,"It is a class action, but it is also a problem of the low visibility of the criminal process, one which is “capable of repetition yet evading review.”"
1973.73-477,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2782.352,2789.716,"But you are not, then, seeking any relief with respect to the respondent but only to those who are similarly situated."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2789.716,2791.491,"Yes, sir, exactly."
1973.73-477,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2791.491,2796.271,And we have no named parties available now?
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2796.271,2799.097,"At the time this suit was filed, all the named parties suffered this exact deprivation."
1973.73-477,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2799.097,2800.711,I said now with --.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2800.711,2802.389,"No, sir."
1973.73-477,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2802.389,2805.578,"Well, how could he maintain a class action without a named party?"
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2805.578,2814.763,"Because at the time the class action was maintained originally in the District Court, he was a member of the class and so he had standing at that point and the class action survives him."
1973.73-477,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2818.546,2821.477,I think you should hasten because I don’t agree with you at all.
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2821.477,2827.322,"There’s a case called Bernie against Indiana, I think, that probably cuts the other way from what you just told us."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2827.322,2827.754,I am sorry.
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2832.684,2833.824,Yes.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2833.824,2842.106,The point is that this issue would never be litigated in the 30 or 60 or 90 days in which that custody is deprived.
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3017.623,3023.426,"Well, by definition, hasn’t there in this case been an arrest on probable cause?"
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3023.426,3025.57,"Yes, sir, on Fourth Amendment probable cause."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3043.445,3053.792,"Well, you don’t get a motion to suppress -- I mean, these procedures in the states vary but sometimes that doesn’t happen until the actual trial that you are allowed the motion to suppress."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3054.723,3055.889,I’m not sure about most states.
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3074.279,3083.171,"Well, but here there has been, as I understood you to agree, a taking into custody on probable cause."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3083.171,3085.863,Fourth Amendment probable cause.
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3085.863,3087.143,For arrest of the person.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3087.143,3088.941,"For arrest, yes, sir."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3093.985,3098.795,"Of course, the basic element test comes in the trial of the criminal offense, doesn’t it?"
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3098.795,3103.21,"Well, the basic element of the test at that point, of course, if a --"
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3103.21,3104.307,The ultimate test.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3104.307,3110.929,"It’s the ultimate test, but it is of no benefit to a person who’s been incarcerated for 60 days and shouldn’t be there in the first place."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3126.537,3133.663,Isn’t this procedure very similar to the procedure under Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure?
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3133.663,3135.011,"No, it is not."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3156.311,3166.196,"Well, when is a defendant in a federal trial first told of his right to be indicted by grand jury before he’d be tried?"
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3175.363,3176.167,And a waiver?
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3176.167,3180.842,"Yes, when in the federal system is the defendant first given his opportunity to waive?"
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3180.842,3185.211,"I think, probably at the commissioner hearing, the first appearance hearing, he might be told that."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3185.795,3188.569,There’s no requirement under Rule 5 that he’d be told that.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3188.569,3188.809,"No, sir."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3204.221,3205.743,You often wouldn’t have counsel.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3209.187,3219.475,"And in felony cases, it seems since they’re going to be determining bail and other issues, at least the practice in Florida and the Southern District of Florida to appoint counsel at that time."
1973.73-477,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3219.475,3239.216,"I understood from prior argument that there were two types of arrests that were involved primarily, arrest made in the field by an officer to bear witness to crime or there were accident circumstances justifying arrest."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3273.196,3274.443,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-477,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3281.671,3297.162,"Well, the next question I was going to ask you is that you accept or you agree that there is probable cause there even though the state's attorney is not an impartial officer."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3297.162,3300.376,What we have there is a very practical kind of consideration.
1973.73-477,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3395.232,3410.675,"In Morrissey against Brewer, do you really think we went that far to say he must be neutral and detached or did we way that it must be a probation officer other than the one who has been supervising his release?"
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3410.675,3414.63,"Yes, those were the words in Morrissey versus Brewer and we respect those words."
1973.73-477,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3414.63,3423.59,That doesn’t necessarily make him neutral and detached anymore than in Goldberg and Kelley you had neutral and detached.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3428.574,3430.722,Or will not have a future connection with the case.
1973.73-477,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3443.066,3452.385,It might not be the same prosecutor anymore than it would be the same probation officer or the same agent in the Welfare Office.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3452.385,3459.801,"But we are talking about the Head of the Office, the state attorney, and everyone working under him are Assistant States Attorneys so he’s --"
1973.73-477,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3459.801,3461.238,"Benjamin Rodriguez, is that true for him?"
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3461.238,3461.971,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3513.538,3521.464,Would you have any reason to suppose that basic practice is very much different in the federal system with respect to informations?
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3521.464,3522.052,"No, sir."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3537.693,3558.089,"Alright, in the federal system if there has been an arrest with a warrant and the person is brought before a magistrate whose only function, if the arrest has been with a warrant, is to advise him of his rights which is like the first hearing in Florida."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3558.089,3559.294,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3559.294,3579.967,And he is then in custody and there has to be a preliminary hearing within 10 days except that the preliminary examination shall not be held if the defendant is indicted or if an information against the defendant is filed before the date set for the preliminary examination.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3579.967,3581.398,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3581.398,3593.363,"And then if an information is filed, then he comes up before the District Court and not until then does he have an opportunity to be told of his right to be indicted rather than be informed against."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3593.363,3599.575,"Well, he would have no right to be indicted because it would have to be a misdemeanor, and he could be informed against it."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3600.27,3601.984,"No, I’m talking about a felony now."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3616.758,3620.269,"And the question is, Your Honor, whether or not that person would have a right to preliminary hearing."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3620.269,3634.474,"Well, I’m just suggesting that that federal system is basically the same as the Florida system and it doesn’t mean that it’s valid but it does mean that these rules annunciated by this Court are unconstitutional if you’re correct."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3634.474,3635.113,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3637.691,3650.72,"On the other hand, in the federal system, if the arrest has been without a warrant, then the magistrate has the duty of finding probable cause."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3655.292,3666.776,I believe that the Assistant US Attorney could file an information after the arrest in a misdemeanor case and then there would be no preliminary hearing conducted by the magistrate.
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3666.776,3681.304,"No, when he comes before the magistrate, if the arrest has been without a warrant, it’s the magistrate’s duty to find probable cause and if he doesn’t find it, the man is released, as I read Rule 5 of the federal system."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3681.304,3682.425,Under the federal rule.
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3682.425,3686.05,"Yes, and that makes it different."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3688.268,3691.66,"Without warrants, Your Honor."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3691.66,3697.611,That would differentiate the two systems.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3697.611,3706.554,"There would be a distinction to that extent between the two systems, but I think there’s another distinction that has to be raised and, that is, that we’re talking about people who were in custody prior to trial."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3706.889,3710.53,While they’re in custody as a result of valid arrests.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3710.53,3711.291,"Yes, sir, but --"
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3711.291,3712.299,They’re not --
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3712.299,3723.761,"There needs to be an opportunity to test whether or not that is a valid arrest and not keep a man, unless he’s been indicted, awaiting trial for 60 or 90 days only to find out that there was no probable cause to hold him during all that time."
1973.73-477,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3730.112,3741.409,"You’re saying that every time a person is arrested there must be a prompt, without defining that now, a prompt determination of probable cause by a neutral agency."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3741.409,3741.781,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-477,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3741.781,3748.637,"Whether it’s in laying aside what the crime is, whether warranted or unwarranted arrest."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3748.637,3751.656,"If he is in custody, yes, sir, except for indictments."
1973.73-477,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3753.776,3757.593,But it does involve arrests on a warrant.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3757.593,3757.943,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-477,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3762.818,3763.936,I understand.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3766.675,3783.878,"And of course, the question that was raised regarding misdemeanors takes us to our misdemeanor argument which is that in Florida they have a classification which totally excludes misdemeanors from the possibility of ever getting a preliminary hearing, even if the state attorney was willing to tolerate one."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3815.904,3829.422,"Well, perhaps I’m being repetitious and perhaps I don’t understand your point but thousands of times everyday in this country people’s liberty is taken away when they’re arrested by law enforcement officers on probable cause."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3829.422,3829.638,Yes.
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3829.638,3831.294,They’re taken down to jail and locked up.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3831.294,3833.511,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3833.511,3839.549,"Now, what is your -- are you attacking that, that there cannot be an arrest and a custodial arrest on probable cause?"
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3839.549,3846.338,"No, we’re saying there can be a custodial arrest on probable cause but there must be a subsequent review."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3846.338,3847.618,When?
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3847.618,3849.752,"The Court of Appeals said, adapted to the Florida --"
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3849.752,3850.558,What do you say in your argument?
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3850.558,3851.436,Four to seven days.
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3872.084,3879.963,"If it’s constitutionally valid for 24 hours, why isn’t it valid for 36 hours or 48 hours?"
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3879.963,3881.433,The line has to be drawn somewhere.
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3882.58,3886.708,"You can see that it’s valid for a period of time after a lawful arrest, can’t you?"
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3886.708,3896.342,"I can see that because as a practical matter, it has to be because there is no other way in which the state can carry out its obligation to arrest people who possibly have committed crimes."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3896.342,3897.856,"Well, this isn’t possibly."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3901.435,3908.064,"Yes, sir, untested probable cause but probable cause, which, we concede is sufficient for the arrest."
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3918.475,3923.641,"Well, the point of an arrest warrant is to test the probable cause, isn’t it?"
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3923.641,3923.883,Not --
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3923.883,3925.828,Before a neutral and detached magistrate.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3925.828,3926.146,But there’s --
1973.73-477,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3926.146,3926.889,A warrant.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3926.889,3928.207,But there’s an opportunity to be heard.
1973.73-477,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3955.396,3963.915,"Well, but for the Florida cases to the contrary, wouldn’t this all be handled by a writ of habeas corpus in the State Court?"
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3963.915,3967.802,"Yes, sir, if the State Court had permitted us to test probable cause through habeas corpus --"
1973.73-477,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3967.802,3968.723,You wouldn’t be here.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3968.723,3969.691,"No, sir, we would not."
1973.73-477,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3970.873,3973.649,"That’s your real complaint, isn’t it?"
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3973.649,3977.82,That Florida law absolutely forbids an inquiry into probable cause when an information is filed.
1973.73-477,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3978.611,3979.911,By habeas corpus?
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3979.911,3984.112,"By any means, because information stands for probable cause."
1973.73-477,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3984.112,3988.876,"If you could raise it on habeas corpus, you wouldn’t be here."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3988.876,3989.553,That’s right.
1973.73-477,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3993.201,3995.62,I’m not talking about successfully.
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3995.62,4002.356,"Well, I say successfully only because the habeas corpus will be dismissed in Florida right away because the issue that would be raised --"
1973.73-477,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4002.356,4013.089,"My point was, if it could be raised and could be cited and the Judge sitting on habeas corpus could inquire into it, you would have no complaint."
1973.73-477,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,4013.089,4013.802,Absolutely.
