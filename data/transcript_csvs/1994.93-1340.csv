1994.93-1340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.872,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-1340, United States v. Gary Mezzanatto."
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,60.789,67.894,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1340,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,194.708,211.003,"So in your view the Government, as part of its standard plea bargain form, asks the defendant to waive its... his right not to have the testimony used in the Government's case on direct, for all purposes?"
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,211.003,221.895,"We think that so far as the waivability of the rule goes, Justice Kennedy, which is really a question about whether the right is personal, the answer to that is yes."
1994.93-1340,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,227.964,237.07,"Well, let's suppose he really wanted a plea bargain discussion and the Government says, now, one of the things you are waiving here is your self-incrimination privilege."
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,245.176,258.067,"Justice Kennedy, if he makes that judgment knowingly, it's no different from the judgment that criminal defendants made every day... excuse me, make every day concerning whether they wish to confess to the crime."
1994.93-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,273.41,297.043,"But of course the difference is they don't waive the rule before they've committed the crime, and here, the... you're asking for the waiver before presumably... the Government is asking for the waiver presumably before the misstatement is made, and before the defendant is faced with, in effect, deciding whether to accept the consequence of the waiver."
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,297.043,299.478,"Well, that may be true, Justice Souter--"
1994.93-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,299.478,301.513,"Maybe that shouldn't make a difference, but it is a difference."
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,301.513,306.381,"--Yes, it is a difference, and it should not make a difference for the following reason."
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,396.455,397.089,"Well, that--"
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,402.793,404.311,"No, it does not."
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,404.311,407.93,"I take it this defendant could be prosecuted for perjury, under your view of the facts."
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,407.93,411.732,"Under our view of the validity of the waiver, yes."
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,413.417,415.036,He couldn't be prosecuted for perjury?
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,415.036,415.453,No.
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,437.116,442.353,"No, but the statement for which he'd be prosecuted would be his trial testimony, which would have been made under oath."
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,442.353,461.898,"--Yes, but then we would have a... a) that statement would not be covered by the rule in any event, because that statement is not a statement made during plea discussions, his own testimony as to what the underlying facts were, and b) there would be some--"
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,461.898,463.517,I see.
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,463.517,467.402,--difficulty showing to a second jury--
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,467.402,470.254,"You don't have these people take an oath when they talk to you, then."
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,470.254,478.526,"--No, we don't, and that, of course, wouldn't do the whole trick, because it would have to be on the record, and there is a fair--"
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,478.526,480.478,"You do make a record, don't you, of your interviews?"
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,480.478,492.136,--We make a record in terms of having an agent who is at the interview and who will prepare a report who is then furnished to the defendants for discovery.
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,494.655,497.405,What do you think that subparagraph (ii) contemplates?
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,503.927,507.796,I don't think that Congress gave this part of the problem that much thought.
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,523.488,526.34,"Well, he couldn't be prosecuted for perjury for pleading guilty."
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,528.126,538.815,"--Well, if he pled guilty and in the course of his plea allocution made statements of fact that were later proven to be false, and he--"
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,538.815,564.549,"Oh, you don't... I see, you think this starts... well, which does this refer to, trial proceedings, or the proceedings in the plea bargain, in your view, subparagraph (ii) of the rule, little (ii), where it says in (i) of the... such statement is admissible to, (i) in the... where, to clarify it... and (ii) is, in a criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement if the statement was made by the defendant under oath, on the record, and in the presence of counsel."
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,570.619,582.511,"--As the exception was contemplated, Justice Stevens, it refers only to a statement made in court as part of the part of the rule that makes--"
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,582.511,589.848,"All right, so that if he then testifies falsely in court later on, you can indict him for perjury, and prove the perjury by what he said at the interview."
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,589.848,591.032,--It would not--
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,591.032,591.566,That's what this says.
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,591.566,594.984,--It would not normally cover his testimony at trial.
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,612.113,613.546,I understand.
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,613.546,624.421,"In addition to making inadmissible statements made during plea discussions with the prosecutor, this rule also makes inadmissible statements made in connection with a plea of guilty that was later withdrawn."
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,624.421,632.443,"In the Rule 11 proceedings... that's subparagraph (iii), but the however language at the end of the rule with the two subparagraphs in it refer back to all four--"
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,632.443,637.613,"Yes, it does, and I'm not saying that it should not."
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,644.084,647.869,--You'd think it was primarily intended to refer to the Rule 11 proceeding.
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,647.869,648.369,Yes.
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,648.369,658.408,"But it surely doesn't say that, and it seems to me that it would protect the Government's right to prosecute for perjury if there's a conflict between trial testimony and the testimony in the plea bargain discussion."
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,660.677,686.577,"Except that then the evidence that would prove that the trial testimony was false, Justice Stevens, would still likely be inadmissible under the strict reading of the rule, because the statements made to the prosecutor were not on the record, and I think that is the reading of the rule that is more or less required by its plain language."
1994.93-1340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,687.344,698.385,--That's because you say it's customary for prosecutors not to put a defendant under oath and not to make a record such as is spoken of in (ii)?
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,698.385,702.687,"--That is right, Mr. Chief Justice, and there are many reasons for that."
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,715.93,727.654,"That may be, but the language of subparagraph (ii), prosecution for perjury or false statement if the statement was made by the defendant under oath, that sounds to me like the statement... the later statement in court."
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,730.023,730.506,--Justice Stevens--
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,730.506,731.99,You can't use the statute for that purpose.
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,731.99,732.323,--If... if he--
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,732.323,733.14,It surprises me.
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,733.14,748.75,"--And again, maybe it is I who is not explaining this very well, but if he testifies as he did here, we could prosecute him for the perjury that he committed in the courtroom."
1994.93-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,756.771,759.057,"And you would argue it would be, would you not?"
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,763.609,766.544,"It is exactly what the purpose is, Justice Stevens."
1994.93-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,770.046,770.781,"Well, we disagree on that."
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,778.102,779.304,"--That is right, Justice O'Connor."
1994.93-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,779.304,785.541,"And if it was... if those three things are met, then yes, it's admissible in the subsequent perjury."
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,785.541,803.919,"That is right, Justice O'Connor, and all I was saying is that in the usual case that raises the facts that we brought to this Court, that will not be true, because these tend to be meetings in the U.S. Attorney's offices where there is not a court reporter, and where the defendant is not placed under oath."
1994.93-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,803.919,804.836,Do you have the--
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,831.754,857.304,"Well, the usual fact is that... I mean, in cases where this ends up being a problem, is that he will say something in his own trial under oath that is false, and will say something in the meeting with the prosecutor, something else in the meeting with the prosecutor that is false, but it is true that the situation that you describe can come up fairly often, too, and that is one of our points."
1994.93-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,903.368,923.346,"Is the consequence of this, Mr. Estrada, going to be that, at least so far as the use of the statements for impeachment... perhaps not as far as Justice Kennedy's hypothesis suggested, but so far as the use of the statement for impeachment is concerned, that if you prevail, there really will never be any application of the rule to exclude a statement?"
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,929.5,935.673,"--That is not really true as a practical matter, Justice Souter, for the following reason."
1994.93-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1000.781,1019.077,"Well, I mean, you're in effect saying the rule doesn't apply in the charge bargaining situation simply because the defendant isn't there, and what you're... if I understand you, what you're saying is that in cases in which the defendant is there and is talking, as a practical matter, if this exception is allowed, the exception will swallow the rule."
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1019.077,1019.777,--It is not--
1994.93-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1019.777,1020.827,Or become the rule.
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1020.827,1030.949,"--It is not true as a general matter that in the charge bargaining situation the rule wouldn't apply because the lawyer is the agent of his client for the purpose, and--"
1994.93-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1030.949,1034.968,"Well, you're not going to impeach the client later on based on the word of his lawyer."
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1034.968,1038.436,"--Well, that generally would not be the case, that is true."
1994.93-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1038.436,1038.872,No.
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1062.82,1063.404,Well--
1994.93-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1063.404,1070.141,"--that in talking to us you waive inadmissibility protection, however they phrase it, of rule 410."
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1070.141,1071.01,--I don't have any--
1994.93-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1071.01,1071.926,So that's going to be the rule.
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1071.926,1084.817,"--I don't have any hesitation in conceding, Justice Souter, that as to the class of cases that involve cooperation we would normally ask for a waiver, and that would not be a consequence of what happens in this Court."
1994.93-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1093.173,1095.208,That may not be what Congress wanted.
1994.93-1340,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1121.859,1122.342,That is right.
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,1590.396,1597.966,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-1340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1668.229,1678.518,"How about a stipulation that something be admitted in evidence, not stipulating as to provable fact, but just stipulating as to particular testimony or a document being admitted into evidence?"
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,1678.518,1683.156,"Again, the same rationale applies, Your Honor, and that is that it's a time-saving device."
1994.93-1340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1692.378,1700.033,That has nothing... I would think a stipulation as to admissibility of evidence has nothing to do with a fact that's not material.
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,1708.021,1717.662,"Yes, but the purpose, the underlying rationale is that it's pointless to go through the exercise of proving it, the parties don't contest it, and that's always, always what stipulations have always been."
1994.93-1340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1717.662,1719.445,I don't agree with you on that.
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,1735.373,1743.294,"The way I would distinguish that, Your Honor, is that there are proper stipulations, and there are not proper stipulations."
1994.93-1340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1743.294,1744.979,"The kind I entered into were improper, actually."
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,1745.629,1747.181,"Well, I'm not sure about that, Your Honor."
1994.93-1340,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1794.86,1797.645,I'm going back to your starting premise.
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,1805.668,1807.018,Right.
1994.93-1340,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1820.694,1828.866,"Isn't that true about our legal system generally, that we are... we follow the party control principle, as distinguished from other systems that don't?"
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,1828.866,1832.418,"No, I don't believe so, Your Honor, and let me explain why."
1994.93-1340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1869.258,1878.883,"Are you saying, nothing, nothing can be waived unless the provision, whether it be a statute or a rule, contains a phrase such as, absent agreement?"
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,1878.883,1882.768,"What I'm saying is that rules that have a public function cannot, such as this--"
1994.93-1340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1882.768,1889.989,"Well, all rules have some public function, I assume, if only to assure a just outcome to the trial."
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,1894.058,1902.046,--I think that there's some helpful guidelines that the Court can use to determine whether a rule has a public function or is a personal right.
1994.93-1340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1903.914,1907.3,"I suppose there are two... that's a dichotomy, in your view?"
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,1914.056,1919.274,"One that strictly has a personal benefit and no further, Your Honor, like constitutional rights, because they're just personal rights."
1994.93-1340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1920.21,1920.976,But you can--
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,1938.771,1940.137,"--No, I wouldn't go that far, Your Honor."
1994.93-1340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1961.453,1968.207,"Well, but until the speedy trial statute that Mr. Estrada quoted was enacted, the speedy trial had always been waivable."
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,1971.809,1972.726,"The right, Your Honor?"
1994.93-1340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1972.726,1973.677,Yes.
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,1973.677,1976.212,But the time provisions of the act are not--
1994.93-1340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1976.212,1979.062,But the act--
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,1979.062,1980.547,"--and what I'm saying is, Congress has treated--"
1994.93-1340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1980.547,1981.997,--The act specifically so provides.
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,1983.699,1996.958,"--There is legislative history, but the courts that have considered the issue have said that the reason it's not waivable, Your Honor, is because society has an independent interest in seeing that cases are moved along irrespective of what the parties believe--"
1994.93-1340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2046.522,2084.48,"Well, one response to the continuum argument I suppose is Mr. Estrada's response, and that is, if you assume that the public function is to facilitate, indeed to promote, plea bargaining, this, the so-called waiver rule that he wants is going to have no effect in most plea bargaining situations at all, because a plea bargain is normally simply a deal which is made between a prosecutor and defense counsel, and the first time the defendant has anything to say is when he stands in front of the court and answers the questions about factual basis, and so on."
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2096.222,2113.499,"My response, Your Honor, is that Congress thought long and hard about how to create exclusion, and in creating exceptions to it, it believed, and the legislative history supports, that by this exclusion, it would encourage and promote frank and open candid plea discussion."
1994.93-1340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2115.451,2119.57,"No, but Mr. Estrada's point is that plea discussions normally just don't even implicate the rule."
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2121.772,2137.365,"--I'm saying that Congress included a broad distinction that applied to both contexts, and just because there is... Estrada's distinction of cooperation or more cooperation type agreements from ones that are more classical bargain type agreements is creating a distinction that Congress didn't make in the rules."
1994.93-1340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2140.4,2149.006,"Justice Souter can protect his own question, but I'm interested in the same point, because frankly it had not occurred to me until I heard the Government's argument."
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2187.564,2191.683,"--I'm not so sure I can generalize that, Your Honor."
1994.93-1340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2250.907,2267.999,"Isn't your correct response that we don't know how many cases there are without lawyers and how many with the defendant there, but whatever the number, Congress obviously thought it sufficient to justify the promulgation of a rule dealing with that category of cases, however big it is, whether it's 10 people or 10 million?"
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2274.439,2275.689,"I would agree, Your Honor."
1994.93-1340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2275.689,2277.155,Would you stipulate to that?
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2346.451,2349.736,"I just... no, I don't, Your Honor, and let me explain why."
1994.93-1340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2400.05,2433.973,"Mr. Lippman, suppose the Government doesn't get a waiver in the negotiations, and they enter into discussions for cooperation, then later at the trial, despite its not having gotten a prior waiver, the Government introduces evidence of what was said in those discussions, and there's no objection on the part of counsel and a conviction occurs, is that reversible error?"
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2433.973,2446.547,"Well, it would be reviewed under a plain error standard, Your Honor, under the forfeiture analysis set forth in United States v. Olano, but again, forfeitures and waivers are two different animals, as this Court laid out pretty clearly in United States v. Olano."
1994.93-1340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2446.547,2449.416,"So you think it can't be done prior, but can be done at the trial?"
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2449.416,2450.733,No.
1994.93-1340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2487.358,2498.998,"Is there any other example of... well, look, as I look through Rule 11(e), it seems like most of it tells judges what they are supposed to do, and it seems aimed at protecting... at courts."
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2524.363,2535.504,"Well, Rule 7(a) is considered nonwaivable, Your Honor, the indictment requirement that I cited that... I believe Smith v. United States is the indictment--"
1994.93-1340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2535.504,2542.258,"I can understand not waiving things that have to do with courts, which have to do with how the court is supposed to behave."
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2550.347,2557.601,"--Well, the... as a rule of procedure, Your Honor?"
1994.93-1340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2557.601,2561.821,"Any rule, a rule of evidence, a rule... a rule of admissibility."
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2561.821,2563.321,"The Fair Labor Standards Act would be one, Your Honor."
1994.93-1340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2566.023,2568.058,A rule of admissibility in court.
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2568.058,2569.475,"Oh, you're saying rule of... I'm sorry, you said--"
1994.93-1340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2569.475,2571.094,"Yes, any rule that has to do with evidence."
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2577.264,2579.2,"--Well, I consider the time... sure."
1994.93-1340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2581.752,2582.402,--Right.
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2583.218,2600.197,"Again, I don't believe that Rule 24(c), and I think in the concurring opinion with Justice Kennedy indicated so."
1994.93-1340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2612.505,2613.671,"They're waived every day of the week, aren't they?"
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2613.671,2618.825,"--Yes, but it's a stipulation, Your Honor, and I'm trying to create the distinction between a stipulation and a waiver."
1994.93-1340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2618.825,2621.443,Just by failing to object to hearsay--
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2623.177,2626.062,"You forfeit it, Your Honor, and there's a distinction... U.S. v. Olano."
1994.93-1340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2626.062,2629.014,"Well, you somehow give up, whatever you want to say."
1994.93-1340,1,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2631.882,2634.684,"Between a forfeiture and a waiver, Your Honor, or--"
1994.93-1340,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3179.405,3182.023,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.93-1340,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3245.531,3247.133,"I'm not clear on one thing, though, Mr. Estrada."
1994.93-1340,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3252.585,3254.304,"--That is right, Justice Stevens--"
1994.93-1340,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3254.304,3255.637,The Congress thought that was acceptable.
1994.93-1340,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3255.637,3259.089,"--Yes... well, no, not acceptable, Justice Stevens."
