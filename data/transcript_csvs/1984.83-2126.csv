1984.83-2126,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.824,We will hear arguments next in Oklahoma against Castleberry and Raineri.
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,74.881,106.852,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the issues in this case which primarily arise under the principles announced by this Court in United States versus Ross are as follows: first, whether there was probable cause to believe that the defendants' vehicle in this case contained contraband, and secondly, assuming there was such probable cause, whether the police acted properly in searching without a search warrant three suitcases in the trunk of the car and the bandaid box which was found on the dashboard of the car."
1984.83-2126,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,165.955,173.211,"Didn't the informant add a little more, that they were carrying this material in suitcases that were a particular color?"
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,173.211,184.499,"--Yes, Your Honor, the informant specifically told the officer that some of the narcotics was in a blue suitcase which was... which the informant stated that he had observed in the last ten hours."
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,425.088,425.821,"Mr. Lee, may I ask--"
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,425.821,426.588,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,426.588,428.707,--what happened after the events you have just described?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,428.707,443.217,"They stated that... their testimony was that when they... after they found the money, the items were taken inside the motel room, and it was in the motel room that they found that... they counted $2,700 and found the methaqualone."
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,443.217,444.633,Then what happened?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,444.633,449.621,Then they arrested the defendants and they took them to the police department.
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,450.254,452.073,What did they do with the suitcases at that time?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,454.025,454.925,--I believe they did.
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,454.925,458.81,"So they kept all the stuff together, and took it down to the department at the time they arrested them?"
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,458.81,459.86,I believe that is correct.
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,459.86,466.082,"So at the time they made the searches, would they have had sufficient probable cause to do all that without opening the suitcases?"
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,466.082,467.198,At the time they made the search?
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,467.198,467.698,Yes.
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,467.698,468.95,To arrest the defendants?
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,468.95,469.434,Yes.
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,469.434,481.858,"I believe, based particularly on the information given by the informant, and particularly when Officer Taylor approached the car and detected the odor of marijuana coming from the trunk of the car, certainly they would have had probable cause to make an arrest."
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,481.858,484.044,And to take the suitcases to the police station?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,484.044,484.294,Yes.
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,484.294,484.994,As they did later?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,484.994,486.496,"Yes, as they did."
1984.83-2126,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,486.496,488.762,"And the car, too, I suppose."
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,488.762,497.018,"Yes, the car could have all been taken, and the officers testified that they made an inventory search of the car at the police department."
1984.83-2126,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,497.018,500.054,What happened to the suitcase in the back seat?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,500.054,501.506,That is not mentioned in the record.
1984.83-2126,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,505.724,506.591,And what about the package?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,506.591,507.509,Excuse me.
1984.83-2126,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,535.493,539.195,What about the package that was thrown in as they lay on the ground?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,539.195,541.264,"--Yes, we think that that--"
1984.83-2126,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,541.264,542.666,Is that the bandaid box?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,542.666,543.566,"--Yes, sir."
1984.83-2126,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,543.566,544.316,"Oh, I see."
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,544.316,544.799,It is the bandaid box.
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,782.898,784.766,"Mr. Lee, may I ask one other question about the facts?"
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,784.766,785.116,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,785.116,791.337,"In addition to searching the suitcases and the bandaid box in this case, how extensive was the search of the vehicle."
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,793.706,795.391,There is no record of that.
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,809.817,813.352,Was there anything found any place except in these various containers?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,813.352,815.971,"The record doesn't reflect that, Your Honor."
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,825.093,832.247,"What would your view be if they had brought all these things out and set them down right beside the vehicle, and the officer then accosted them?"
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,836.468,844.538,"That is a question that is going to fall somewhere between the cases of this Court, in the Place case, and the Mendenhall, and the Jacobson case, where--"
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,844.538,847.656,I just wondered what your view is in your submission to the Court in connection with this.
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,853.227,856.862,"--Yes, I think the fact that it was placed into an automobile is the critical distinction there."
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,856.862,864.451,"And would you therefore concede that under Chadwick and Sanders, had they not been placed in the vehicle, they could not have been opened and searched?"
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,864.451,865.185,Yes.
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,875.176,878.461,"Well, suitcases which they had probable cause to believe contained a lot of drugs."
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,878.461,881.763,"Yes, I think the Court made clear in Place that they have got to get a search warrant."
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.518,892.018,Let me ask you another question.
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,900.141,902.576,"--No, I don't believe so, because--"
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,902.576,907.73,"In other words, the justification for searching the car rests entirely on placing these containers in the car?"
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,907.73,908.364,--Yes.
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,940.701,942.82,How do you distinguish this case from Sanders?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,942.82,953.443,In Sanders there was no probable cause to believe that the drugs were in any other place other than the suitcase which the police had surveilled and watched them place--
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,953.443,954.795,You just agreed that was true here also.
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,954.795,956.978,"--No, I think we have a lot more in Sanders."
1984.83-2126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,966.518,968.852,Those are two inconsistent answers.
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,971.904,972.839,"Well, I don't think it is."
1984.83-2126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,978.993,986.747,There would still have been the possibility you have just mentioned that meanwhile they have removed some of the drugs to the car.
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,986.747,994.67,"--It is possible, but here we have a situation where the officer observed the individuals place four containers in the car."
1984.83-2126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,994.67,1005.894,You think we should judge this case then on the basis that there was no probable cause to search the car other than the fact that these suitcases were in the car?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1005.894,1015.349,"Well, plus the odor of marijuana coming from the trunk of the car, plus the actions of the defendant Castleberry and the third party as the officers approached the car."
1984.83-2126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1015.349,1016.316,You can't have it both ways.
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1028.426,1045.769,"Well, I am saying that... and I believe Justice Stevens' hypothetical was, if the only thing he would have known was, he pulls up and sees Castleberry with a suitcase getting ready to get into the car, I am saying that would probably fall more into the Place, and in your concurring opinion in the Jacobson situation."
1984.83-2126,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1077.507,1086.013,How much do you rely on the resistance and flight of the people involved?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1086.013,1097.903,"Certainly resistance generally reflects a consciousness of guilt, and we think that the actions of Castleberry... we don't think a law abiding citizen who was not doing anything would react this way when he was approached by a police officer."
1984.83-2126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1143.765,1155.907,Do you think the officers had probable cause to search the vehicle had the suitcases not yet been put inside it in this case?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1155.907,1164.013,"If they had not been placed inside the car, and if there had not been a detecting odor of marijuana by the officer--"
1984.83-2126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1164.013,1170.667,"Well, let's say they do detect the odor of marijuana, and all the other facts that exist in this case."
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1170.667,1195.032,"--I think that your decision in the Johns case would allow them to search the entire vehicle, because in that case all they had was a situation 50 miles from the Mexican border where there was a plane that landed, and trucks pull up to the plane, and then as the officers approach the trucks, they stated that they detected the odor of marijuana, and then your holding in that case was that the officers had probable cause to search."
1984.83-2126,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1212.725,1219.311,"Mr. Lee, will you tell me once again what you think you answered to Justice Stevens."
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1219.311,1253.218,"In response to his hypothetical, if the police had had nothing more than if they had arrived at that motel and seen Castleberry with the suitcases, and he had not placed the suitcases in the car, and he had not taken any evasive action, and they had not detected the odor of marijuana coming from the trunk, I think this case would require them to get a search warrant for the suitcase, just as though they are always required to get a search warrant any time there is a handbag or suitcase at an airport, like in the Place case."
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1270.013,1272.313,"Mr. Lee, may I just refresh my recollection?"
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1287.558,1288.641,That's correct.
1984.83-2126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1293.462,1296.83,"I asked both sides, and I think you are entirely consistent in your answer."
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1312.94,1318.224,"No, Your Honor, Officer Taylor just testified that he detected a strong odor of marijuana coming from the trunk."
1984.83-2126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1324.128,1330.449,Did this odor become apparent to him after the suitcases were in the trunk?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1330.449,1331.251,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1331.251,1338.405,So you simply can't tell from his testimony as to whether it was necessarily traceable to the suitcases?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1338.405,1339.305,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-2126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1356.45,1367.324,"Well, however all this might be, what you really also want us to perform a small operation on Ross."
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1368.074,1371.276,"No, I think this falls flat within the holding of Ross, Your Honor."
1984.83-2126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1371.276,1378.298,"Well, I know you do, but do I understand you to... is that all you are asking in your brief?"
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1378.298,1385.969,"No, I think that the case of Ross controls this case, and it is reaffirmed by what this Court said in the Johns case."
1984.83-2126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1385.969,1390.44,You don't want either one of those modified to any extent?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1390.44,1391.856,I think that they control this.
1984.83-2126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1401.847,1411.019,You don't agree with... aren't there some amici in this case that suggest we modify Ross/+/.
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1411.019,1414.905,"--Well, I think that it is right on point with Ross, Your Honor, and Johns."
1984.83-2126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1450.394,1477.146,"--Mr. Lee, though, you just answered Justice Stevens' questions in a way to put this squarely within the statement in Ross distinguishing Chadwick and Sanders on the ground that in those cases the police did not have probable cause to believe the entire vehicle contained contraband, and you said here they didn't have probable cause to believe that."
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1489.936,1490.405,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-2126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1493.007,1506.898,"Well, you have been asked about it two or three times, and everything I have heard indicates that you have focused exclusively on the suitcases, and therefore Ross wouldn't save you."
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1506.898,1518.556,--The fact is that the officer suspected of locations of contraband does not mean that they should be... that there is not probable cause to believe that there is contraband outside those suitcases.
1984.83-2126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1520.324,1527.311,"Well, we asked you that question, whether there was probable cause to search the entire vehicle if the suitcases had been outside."
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1527.311,1532.048,"--Yes, I was assuming there was nothing more other than the suitcases being outside."
1984.83-2126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1532.048,1537.702,"Assuming the facts of this case, but the suitcases hadn't been put in the vehicle."
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1537.702,1540.904,"With or without the smell of marijuana, Your Honor?"
1984.83-2126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1550.926,1561.983,"I am talking about the facts of this case, everything they knew from the informant, the timing, everything they knew except the suitcases hadn't been put in the vehicle."
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1561.983,1568.071,"--I think there is still probable cause to search the car, based on the odor of marijuana coming from the trunk of the car, Your Honor."
1984.83-2126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1574.075,1579.293,"Can you really give that dogmatic an answer, that positive an answer?"
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1617.585,1623.306,The officer would not have known specifically which container contained the marijuana.
1984.83-2126,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1655.46,1658.745,Don't you have a lot more than the smell of marijuana in this case?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1658.745,1659.162,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2126,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1659.162,1664.566,"Maybe I am arguing your case, but you seem to me to be putting your entire case on that smell."
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1701.424,1702.191,"Well, of course, the question--"
1984.83-2126,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1702.191,1702.858,Or not?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1702.858,1710.53,"--in Ross is, you balance the privacy interests of the individual versus the administrative inconvenience to the police in getting a warrant."
1984.83-2126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1745.87,1752.524,"Mr. Lee, you said you have no quarrel with Ross."
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1760.88,1761.313,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1761.313,1766.165,I take it you wouldn't have any great objection if those were even further cut back than they have been.
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1766.165,1766.616,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-2126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.437,1775.087,But how many times can they be distinguished and still have--
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1775.087,1797.303,"Well, I think if there was a situation where there was no reason to believe that the contraband could have been anywhere other than in the suitcases, and the suitcases are placed immediately right in the car, I think that Ross and Sanders still apply."
1984.83-2126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1811.312,1827.822,"--I take it you wouldn't say that if you had independent probable cause to search the car, every hubcap, every piece of upholstery in it, if you also had probable cause to search a specific suitcase that was in the car, I take it your position is, you couldn't search the suitcase."
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1827.822,1829.172,"No, you could."
1984.83-2126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1829.172,1830.488,Under Ross?
1984.83-2126,0,21121,david_william_lee,,1830.488,1832.024,"No, I think Ross allows that."
1984.83-2126,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1895.882,1902.97,Mr. Cox.
1984.83-2126,1,18634,charles_foster_cox,,1902.97,1919.432,"Mr. Justice Burger, and may it please this honorable Court, respondents' position in this matter is that the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals was entirely correct in their analysis of the law and their application of the law to the facts of the case."
1984.83-2126,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1992.175,1994.46,Then how do you know he has never been used before?
1984.83-2126,1,18634,charles_foster_cox,,1994.46,1997.479,"--Because the officer admitted so on the stand, Your Honor."
1984.83-2126,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2033.169,2044.06,"Weren't the results rather perfect, the color of the car, the two different colors of suitcases, the time of the checkout, the location of the man, and his name?"
1984.83-2126,1,18634,charles_foster_cox,,2051.197,2057.637,"The clerk of the motel knew every one of those facts, and the clerk may never have been in the hotel room."
1984.83-2126,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2061.171,2069.61,What fact that was given by the informant to the police was not corroborated as the picture unfolded?
1984.83-2126,1,18634,charles_foster_cox,,2069.61,2076.681,"I am not saying, Your Honor, that the facts were not corroborated, but I am saying that those facts by themselves--"
1984.83-2126,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2076.681,2080.65,Isn't that quite important in the probable cause area?
1984.83-2126,1,18634,charles_foster_cox,,2080.65,2089.772,--It is our position there was never sufficient probable cause even to justify the officer taking out his weapon and placing the defendants under arrest.
1984.83-2126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2089.772,2093.56,Then you don't agree with the Oklahoma Court of Appeals' analysis of the case?
1984.83-2126,1,18634,charles_foster_cox,,2093.56,2096.178,Not entirely as to probable cause.
1984.83-2126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2102.998,2107.569,"For purposes of this argument, don't you concede that there was probable cause to search the suitcases?"
1984.83-2126,1,18634,charles_foster_cox,,2107.569,2109.485,"I have never conceded probable cause, Your Honor."
1984.83-2126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2109.485,2112.204,Okay.
1984.83-2126,1,18634,charles_foster_cox,,2147.194,2164.506,"I think not, Your Honor, and the reason for my answer is that in the very practical context of police enforcement, and particularly drug enforcement, very seldom do you see a police officer dressed in uniform step out of a marked vehicle and say, I am a police officer, pay me heed."
1984.83-2126,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2195.358,2200.745,"Now, what you are telling us, is that the testimony of Castleberry and his friend?"
1984.83-2126,1,18634,charles_foster_cox,,2200.745,2203.614,"--Castleberry and Raineri did not testify at trial, Your Honor."
1984.83-2126,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2203.614,2204.983,I did not think they had.
1984.83-2126,1,18634,charles_foster_cox,,2211.72,2227.896,"I am suggesting, Your Honor, that those are common facts in law enforcement, and although the record in this particular case does not speak to those issues, and perhaps I should not go that far--"
1984.83-2126,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2227.896,2240.054,"Well, as Justice O'Connor suggested, were not the immediate responses of Castleberry and his friends exactly the responses of criminals engaged in drug trafficking, if you want to engage in speculation?"
1984.83-2126,1,18634,charles_foster_cox,,2240.054,2248.576,"--I think they were equally consistent with, one, he wanted to protect his privacy interests and property."
1984.83-2126,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2248.576,2259.618,What is your position if there was probable cause to search the car but also probable cause to search specific containers?
1984.83-2126,1,18634,charles_foster_cox,,2259.618,2261.736,I think that under Ross--
1984.83-2126,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2261.736,2264.021,That you could search the car but not the containers?
1984.83-2126,1,18634,charles_foster_cox,,2264.738,2278.781,"--Well, I think under Ross, under the decision in Ross, if they had probable cause independent of any other matter to search that vehicle for contraband, under Ross they could search that vehicle and anything they found there--"
1984.83-2126,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2278.781,2282.999,Even if they had probable cause to search also a container?
1984.83-2126,1,18634,charles_foster_cox,,2282.999,2286.268,--Yes.
1984.83-2126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2286.268,2292.272,"Mr. Cox, does the record tell us whether the officer, Taylor, I guess his name was, was in uniform or not?"
1984.83-2126,1,18634,charles_foster_cox,,2292.272,2295.89,"I am sure it does, Your Honor."
1984.83-2126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2298.259,2299.276,Was he or wasn't he then?
1984.83-2126,1,18634,charles_foster_cox,,2299.276,2299.626,--Pardon?
1984.83-2126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.626,2300.659,Was he in uniform?
1984.83-2126,1,18634,charles_foster_cox,,2300.659,2301.544,"No, sir, he was not in uniform."
