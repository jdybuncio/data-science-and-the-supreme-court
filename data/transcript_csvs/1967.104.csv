1967.104,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,38.341,"Number 104, Alexander Tcherepnin et al., Petitioners, versus Joseph E. Knight et al."
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,40.16,47.036,"Mr. Chief Justice, Justices may it please the Court."
1967.104,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,255.728,258.43,What is the relevance of that date?
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,258.43,277.41,"The only relevance of the date is that all of the investors who were there prior to July 24, 1959 were investors prior to 1957 because in 1957, the association had been closed by the State of Illinois and then reopened."
1967.104,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,438.291,440.126,Do you have a remedy under the state law?
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,440.126,440.773,Pardon me?
1967.104,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,440.773,443.362,Do you have a remedy under the state law?
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,443.362,445.603,Not at least.
1967.104,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,445.603,445.893,Why not?
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,445.893,454.179,"The withdrawal remedy that they talk about the fact they say that we have the right to withdraw, number one, that the practical remedy was nonexistence because since 1959 --"
1967.104,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,454.179,460.13,But they have a right to sue for Fraud?
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,460.13,463.255,"I believe that under the state act, we would not be able to do."
1967.104,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,463.255,464.214,Why not?
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,464.214,465.002,Because the --
1967.104,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,465.002,467.786,That’s unusual isn’t it?
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,467.786,472.111,The -- your rights are limited for a period of one year first of all.
1967.104,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,572.724,574.902,That wasn’t quite my question.
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,574.902,575.678,I’m sorry.
1967.104,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,575.678,587.177,My question regarded simply the state law provides a remedy here against the person who had committed this and named as a fraud.
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,587.177,595.566,There is a State Securities Act and the Securities Act does provide remedies.
1967.104,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,614.326,615.754,I don’t want to take a lot of your time.
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,618.256,634.261,"All right, the City Savings Association is an Illinois chartered association."
1967.104,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,791.039,793.986,Are these products traded on exchange.
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,793.986,795.517,They are not traded in on exchange.
1967.104,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,878.679,883.498,To what extent has it been trading over the market in this type of security?
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,883.498,899.252,"Well in 1934, immediately after passage of the Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission was asked to and did grant an exemption to trading in this type of security from the operation of the 1934 Act."
1967.104,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,919.744,921.623,We don’t need to go way back there --
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,921.623,922.3,Right now --
1967.104,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,922.3,924.972,-- to what extent is the trading over-the-counter now?
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,924.972,935.654,"Well for seven years, City Savings Association was on a restricted payout phase because ever since they got into trouble back in 1957 up to the date they closed."
1967.104,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,955.06,958.011,You got to go very fast and you don’t need to take that much time --
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,958.011,958.303,I’m sorry.
1967.104,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,958.303,963.539,"--you only got to tell me to what extent, to what extent there is trading all over the market and I won’t --"
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,963.539,975.507,"To the extent is that anybody who has a share who dispose -- who wants to dispose of it and is unable to get his money from the Savings and Loan Association, there’s no alternative but to sell it over-the-counter."
1967.104,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,975.507,977.105,To what extent has that been done?
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,977.105,981.335,There are no figures on that but it is done necessarily widely in City Savings Association.
1967.104,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,981.335,983.411,"Is it done widely or not, that’s what I want to know."
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,983.411,989.766,It occurs wherever an association does not pay out.
1967.104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.827,1112.832,In a normal liquidation do the holders of this kind of a certificate take after creditors?
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1112.832,1113.608,Yes they do.
1967.104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.608,1115.06,In an ordinary liquidation.
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1115.06,1117.036,They are -- because they are the shareholders.
1967.104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1163.41,1168.919,Alright.
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1168.919,1172.943,"Well, we’ll assume that there was a material fraud shown in the complaint."
1967.104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.943,1177.942,What was the cause of that?
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1177.942,1188.939,"Since the court held, there was no cause of action stated and the -- one of the respondents has raised the question as to whether or not we state the cause of action here that’s in night brief."
1967.104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1587.11,1590.193,"Well, broker, dealers will be regulated by --?"
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1590.193,1592.486,The broker in these securities?
1967.104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1595.904,1597.594,With respect to these securities?
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1597.594,1608.009,Those who specialize -- there are specialists who specialize in this type of security and contrary to the statements made by respondent that this just started after this case was filed.
1967.104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.771,1621.825,Of course that doesn’t make it --
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1621.825,1622.722,It’s an interpretation.
1967.104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1622.722,1624.044,"Well, I know what it is."
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1637.692,1649.282,In the case of S.E.C. versus Archer which went up to the Court of Appeals in the Eight Circuit in the name of Archer -- this Archer’s appeal. We mentioned that in our briefs and I believe the S.E.C. does also.
1967.104,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1785.098,1788.17,The savings account and the savings bank have security?
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1788.17,1789.1,Pardon me?
1967.104,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1789.1,1793.471,Does the savings account and the savings bank has security by your reasoning?
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1793.471,1799.98,I would think not for the simple reason that the shareholder here bares the investment risk.
1967.104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1823.729,1825.839,You have a fix interest don’t you?
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1825.839,1828.312,In a bank savings account.
1967.104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.312,1829.546,You have dividends?
1967.104,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1829.546,1834.501,"Here, we only get dividends if they’re earned."
1967.104,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1840.214,1843.14,"Okay, Mr. Loomis."
1967.104,1,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,1843.14,1848.906,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1967.104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2057.692,2062.083,"Mr. Loomis, can you enlighten me a little bit."
1967.104,1,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2069.909,2071.422,I don’t believe it is.
1967.104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2077.991,2090.016,"Savings and loans, are they sometimes called Building and loan society, that I suppose they are the same or they’re different or were an import from Germany largely or central New York in the 19th century into this country?"
1967.104,1,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2120.493,2122.029,That’s right.
1967.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2134.562,2137.955,Speaking as though they’re generically all of them are treated alike --
1967.104,1,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2137.955,2151.841,"I’m thinking about this particular type of association, this characteristic is that as far as I know, it didn’t issue any kind of shares except one class of withdrawable shares and maybe certain loans that it made."
1967.104,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2169.114,2177.752,"Mr. Loomis, the various federal insurance available to this type of savings and loan association."
1967.104,1,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2177.752,2179.406,Provided it qualifies where --
1967.104,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2179.406,2184.642,I understand that and what does that cover in terms of the shareholder?
1967.104,1,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2202.612,2208.744,"Well, as I understand it and I’m not an expert in savings and loan insurance and I may be wrong."
1967.104,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2234.821,2236.709,"Pay him what, how much?"
1967.104,1,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2236.709,2237.667,The base amount?
1967.104,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2237.667,2239.04,That’s the interest?
1967.104,1,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2239.04,2240.592,I’m not sure how they handle interest.
1967.104,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2242.788,2249.229,Well perhaps the Savings and Loan council will tell us.
1967.104,1,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2249.229,2263.318,"As I was trying to say, these interests with this particular -- involved in this particular case seemed to me to be so clearly securities for purposes of the securities act that it seems to be almost conceded."
1967.104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2266.31,2275.541,"It’s also conceded that if indeed they are securities for purposes of the 1933 Act, they are explicitly exempted from the registration requirements for that statute."
1967.104,1,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2275.541,2275.823,That’s right.
1967.104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2275.823,2277.79,Is that true?
1967.104,1,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2277.79,2283.071,That is true and the same is true incidentally as to the registration requirements in the Securities Exchange Act.
1967.104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2283.071,2283.926,Of the ‘34?
1967.104,1,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2283.926,2284.671,The ‘34 Act.
1967.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2710.885,2715.436,If the state provides (Inaudible)
1967.104,1,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2715.436,2716.041,No.
1967.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2727.328,2729.825,(Inaudible)
1967.104,1,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2729.825,2731.981,It depends on what the state law is.
1967.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2731.981,2734.017,(Inaudible)
1967.104,1,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2734.017,2737.72,"Well, I haven’t made any great study of the state law."
1967.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2743.882,2746.341,But we’re talking about prior to that --
1967.104,1,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2746.341,2761.663,That is right but I don’t think you have to reach all of that question yet because you’re really asked whether this is a security.
1967.104,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2761.663,2770.215,Mr. O'Laughlin.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,2770.215,2775.769,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2797.872,2807.41,I’ve had a little trouble gathering just what is this particular animal that we’re dealing with and then how -- and how rare it is or how common it is.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,2807.41,2810.425,It’s indeed Your Honor a rare beast.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2853.314,2858.455,(Inaudible)
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,2858.455,2863.881,Certainly would not be binding upon this Court under any consideration.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2870.798,2879.604,What is the usual savings and loan underlined basic documents.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,2879.604,2883.239,"The philosophy -- Your Honor, I think this."
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2883.239,2890.281,A very rare bird -- is there any kind of a common bird in the savings and loan business?
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,2890.281,2892.894,May I address that in a big picture.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2909.069,2910.512,Passport?
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,2910.512,2912.274,Passbook.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2913.907,2914.981,Which statute?
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,2914.981,2917.353,The Illinois Savings and Loan Act.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2935.088,2938.725,It has no capitol at all (Inaudible)
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,2938.725,2940.161,That is very correct Your Honor.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2940.161,2943.286,That is the difference.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,2948.927,2951.076,It may have peripheral effects.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3078.976,3082.49,It’s like a callable stock isn’t it?
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3082.49,3086.519,"Well, callable stock --"
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3086.519,3088.833,"I mean it is callable, it’s still a stock."
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3088.833,3092.797,It’s still a stock but it’s generally a unique type of stock.
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3128.755,3143.812,Where in this record is there a statement of what the rights and privileges are of a person who buys one of these things whatever they are?
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3143.812,3147.418,"Your Honor, it’s a matter of the Illinois Savings and Loan Act."
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3147.418,3155.504,Is that set out in any of your briefs or does it appear anywhere in all of these documents we have before us?
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3155.504,3157.105,What -- the specific character?
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3157.105,3157.209,Yeah.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3157.209,3173.896,I think Your Honor in the brief we submitted that is on behalf of the City Savings Association and the liquidators we have set out in quite a great detail what the unique provisions of --
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3173.896,3182.498,"Well, I could guess -- need very much if you would tell us just exactly what this is."
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3192.081,3193.169,I must have missed all.
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3202.6,3206.307,"Oh, but this is a typical savings and loan transaction."
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3206.307,3208.438,I would think it was very typical.
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3208.438,3219.074,"Now, what rights does a man – when a man goes out on a -- let’s say pays a $100.00 then he gets a passbook is that right?"
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3219.074,3219.572,Right.
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3219.572,3223.805,-- which shows that he has paid them a $100.00.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3225.753,3226.016,Well --
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3226.016,3237.506,"What are his rights with respect to capital or his rights with respect to dividend or participation, what are his voting rights and what are his rights on liquidation?"
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3237.506,3242.757,"Normally speaking he signs a proxy at that moment, the moment he opens his account."
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3251.823,3255.949,In a sort of round about way that he has got to vote.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3265.264,3279.165,He has a vote which I’m confessing that he has but I say it’s very limited because it’s normally not exercised because of the nature of the proxy.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3318.031,3331.41,"Unlike a bank which pays savings account interest with a guaranteed rate, we people get so called earning at a non-guaranteed rate although there’s an advertisement of the current --"
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3331.41,3340.122,Right and I would say Your Honor that it need not be earnings for the specific period it’s covered. Not all the earnings need to be paid out.
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3341.176,3343.469,But what are his rights of principle.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3343.469,3344.301,Principle?
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3362.484,3373.437,"If there are any unpaid dividends when he applies for withdrawal, does he have a right to get that with bonus?"
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3373.437,3374.834,"Yes Your Honor, he does."
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3374.834,3377.675,"All right, now upon liquidation what happens?"
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3377.675,3390.301,"Your Honor, the Illinois statute provides for two types of liquidation and I might point out that the Federal Bankruptcy Act specifically provides that the Federal Bankruptcy Act is not applicable."
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3423.636,3429.837,I understand that but let me try to get at the ultimate simplicity again.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3442.101,3443.161,Yes Your Honor.
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3443.161,3443.626,Is that right?
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3443.626,3444.471,Yes Your Honor.
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3444.471,3445.318,And then he’d get --
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3445.318,3447.697,I might say he need not apply.
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3450.195,3451.013,All right.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3464.476,3475.348,That question Your Honor I think is a matter of state law and I might say has given us pause as to the relationship between the withdrawable share accounts and the creditors.
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3475.348,3476.929,Whether he is on the parity or the insurance --
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3476.929,3477.421,Yes Your Honor.
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3477.421,3478.332,-- to coordinate.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3478.332,3479.621,Yes.
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3479.621,3480.455,Alright.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3480.455,3488.135,Can these shares ever be sold on the market or that’s their value above their base amount?
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3488.135,3492.581,My answer to that is unequivocally no Your Honor and may I explain.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3499.127,3500.675,It is assignable.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3500.675,3512.35,It is assignable which of course means the assignee stands in the shoe and stands the defenses if any which may be urged against the assignor.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3518.099,3519.821,Is that material?
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3519.821,3536.579,"Yes Your Honor, I think it is particularly when you read the preamble to the 1934 Act, it specifically states that the Act was designed to be passed to meet fluctuations on market – over-the-counter market."
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3536.579,3547.273,On what appropriate deal would that (Inaudible)
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3547.273,3549.907,I share that question with Your Honor.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3549.907,3551.361,But that must be because of someone --
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3551.361,3565.091,"Your Honor, I might say this that this is one of the SEC in all due difference dips into its file and comes out with -- I believe in the opening brief is said to be 13 or 14 registration statements."
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3567.039,3573.666,No broker would come and register (Inaudible) possibility of trading --
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3573.666,3576.237,"Your Honor, I --"
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3576.237,3576.869,Nobody?
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3577.594,3588.767,"I’m speculating Your Honor but I would say this, if he were doing other activity subject to the ‘34 Act, he might say also soliciting savings on loan accounts."
1967.104,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3759.455,3765.811,You made (Inaudible) --
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3765.811,3766.792,Yes Your Honor.
1967.104,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3766.792,3776.807,"-- do you think that that more, on this act (Inaudible)?"
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3776.807,3789.635,"Your Honor, the questions which you address to Mr. Loomis and I share some of the same lack of information as to the practice of the industry as a whole."
1967.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3834.196,3852.339,"Mr. O'Laughlin, what about the jurisdiction of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, it seems to me they had a rather broad dispensation to -- perhaps to issue rules with respect to the issuance of the shares just like we’re talking about."
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3852.339,3853.65,Yes Your Honor.
1967.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3853.65,3862.994,Or prescribing reports that a bank may have to make to its non-security holding.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3862.994,3867.092,I wholly agree and not only do they have that right but they have to exercise that right.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3867.092,3873.121,Did anybody asked them of their view of this case?
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3873.121,3875.857,We have talked to them informally.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3877.38,3879.52,But they haven’t been represented in any of these proceedings?
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3879.52,3889.194,"They represent 96% of all the deposits and Your Honor, I know that the -- as a matter of fact do provide for registration of those soliciting accounts."
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3892.317,3904.435,"What about reports to security owners or the interest owners, isn’t that -- that’s covered by the ‘34 Act too isn’t it?"
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3904.435,3907.666,I can’t answer that question Your Honor.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3907.666,3911.008,I gather you suggest that there could be dual or conflicting --
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3911.008,3913.579,"Overlapping, overlapping."
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3914.463,3926.849,"Well, I suppose the bank board could prescribe by regulation what it is these that each association must tell its perspective investors."
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3926.849,3928.287,Yes under the registers --
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3928.287,3932.163,"And then for violation of that, this might still be a 10(b) violation I might admit."
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3932.163,3933.804,It could be.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3933.804,3937.582,Maybe that’s the answer here then that’s why the board isn’t here.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3946.192,3946.371,Your Honor --
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3946.371,3948.156,Is this a cause of action for fraud?
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,3948.156,3968.249,"I think so far as federal -- so far as regulation is concerned in general, there is a detailed state proceeding of liquidation and I might say this in the trial court, there was a motion made to appoint a federal district court receiver for this association."
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4001.813,4006.836,"Well, has the Home Loan Board in any way ousted state court --"
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4006.836,4011.344,You see this was not a state or this was not a federally insured association.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4011.344,4014.78,"Well even so, doesn’t the Federal Home Loan Board have some --"
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4014.78,4017.775,Only if it were insured Your Honor is my understanding.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4017.775,4020.143,Well then what’s it got to do with this case?
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4020.143,4039.378,"What I’m saying is this, 96% viewing the overall position and whether there is need from a policy basis to have the SEC participate in this sort of thing, it would be applicable at most only 3% of the deposits in the Federal Savings and Loan Associations that the field is already preempted substantially by --"
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4039.378,4045.617,But your Federal Home Loan Board bank argument I gather is its no good as to your association --
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4045.617,4047.272,That’s right.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4047.272,4055.72,"But if it’s a security -- but if this is ought to be a security for purposes of ‘34 Act, it will be a security for those purposes with all the other association."
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4055.72,4057.212,Right.
1967.104,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4080.579,4085.762,Do you think that the state remedy takes it out from the jurisdiction of the SEC?
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4085.762,4088.479,I think it takes it out from the need.
1967.104,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4088.479,4088.998,From the need.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4092.31,4110.184,"Well, I think whether this SEC has jurisdiction Your Honor is a matter of Congressional intent and whether or not there is state court jurisdiction as such, I think that in gauging what the intent of Congress is, the availability of state remedy, state procedure, state administration is a factor which this Court might well take into consideration."
1967.104,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4110.184,4121.515,Did it not provide something about being maybe in addition to that that the state remedy should not be considered exclusive and it’s something that I get in here.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4121.515,4125.215,I’m not prepared to answer that question --
1967.104,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4125.215,4127.346,Well that -- what is the answer Mr. --
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4127.346,4129.148,I’m not prepared to answer that question.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4129.148,4136.301,"Well, there is no problem in the VALIC case that there was state administration of the insured --"
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4136.301,4138.404,That was the question of insurance.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4138.591,4142.127,I know but what’s the difference here?
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4146.947,4147.319,No.
1967.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4182.621,4192.453,You don’t concede I take it that this interest as a security even for the fraud provisions of the ‘33 Act?
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4192.453,4202.687,"No Your Honor, I do not and I join with the court below that the evidence of indebtement omission is significant."
1967.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4202.687,4205.017,Well that’s Act ’34.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4205.017,4208.036,"Well, the ‘34 or the ‘33 Act has but the ‘34 Act does not."
1967.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4208.036,4213.488,"That’s right but for the ‘33 Act, do you agree that it’s the security that there’s interest in the security?"
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4213.488,4223.21,"No, I do not."
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4313.25,4323.052,"In other words, that is -- it would mean there was a priority only if these petitioners should succeed in their action for recession, then they would get a hundred cents on every dollar."
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4323.052,4324.0,That’s what they contend --
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4324.0,4332.992,If it were available and presumably this would leave less or maybe nothing for the pre-July 1959 depositors.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4332.992,4333.949,Yes Your Honor.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4333.949,4339.802,"And there are 15 million post July 1959 depositors and 20 million pre of that date deposit, is that right?"
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4339.802,4341.476,Roughly speaking.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4341.476,4346.347,"And how about in terms of amount of deposits, about the same ratio?"
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4346.347,4350.748,"Well, I’m -- when I’m answering that question it is as to amounts."
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4350.748,4351.517,That is to amounts.
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4351.517,4352.513,That is to amount.
1967.104,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4353.372,4353.862,Right.
1967.104,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4353.862,4366.046,Do you ever think there hasn’t been (Inaudible)
1967.104,2,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,4366.046,4375.813,When you tie it up Your Honor with the Bankruptcy Act which provides it that the administration should be only under state law.
1967.104,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4407.679,4409.336,Mr. Perlman.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,4409.336,4412.709,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1967.104,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4461.412,4471.752,"Mr. Perlman, isn’t it normal to have the defrauded stuff over to occupy different positions from none defrauded stuff over."
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,4481.779,4483.674,They would sue as the way I see it.
1967.104,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4483.674,4485.428,Let’s assume they got judgment.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,4485.428,4488.877,If they got judgments they would get it against the ones who defrauded them.
1967.104,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4495.567,4497.798,It would be against the association wasn’t it?
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,4497.798,4499.024,For the association?
1967.104,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4500.39,4502.238,And then it would be a charge against the assets of the association.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,4502.238,4516.229,They get charge against the assets as well as the directors as you wouldn’t have and other derivative actions where you would have the directors who afre really the primary liable for the acts -- for their acts.
1967.104,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4793.799,4797.321,Do you know why there are brokers who trade in this?
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,4797.321,4818.688,"Your Honor, I’m on the impression that there are solicitors not brokers and by that I mean the solicitor is really a person who writes to an individual and they say that he would like to get you to deposit your money and association where you could get perhaps 5% like in California."
1967.104,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4818.688,4821.698,"Well, why does he register with the S.E.C. if --"
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,4821.698,4834.897,This is beyond me and I believe that the S.E.C. -- there has been no virtually no regulation by the S.E.C. of this broker but there has been excessive regulation by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board of these brokers or whatever you want to call it.
1967.104,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4863.448,4870.611,Am I correct -- your argument on behalf of the state that one reason these are not securities as if they’re not tradable.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,4870.611,4871.901,That’s exactly right Your Honor.
1967.104,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4871.901,4875.57,But in fact we know there are brokers who do register as trading.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,4875.57,4876.542,They don’t trade in it.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4911.279,4919.182,"Well, one of these brokers are dealers -- what do they get out of it even at the issuance, do they get an underwriter’s fee of some kind or underwriter’s commission?"
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,4919.182,4938.777,"They do Your Honor and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board as I cited in my brief has a very restrictive regulation on this particular solicitors and I -- again, this is out of the record but I have been told that there are very little activity after this regulation because it was the Federal Home Loan Bank Board who restricts these people."
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4978.085,4980.041,"Well, that’s an original issuance I should --"
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,4980.041,4981.69,Exactly Your Honor which is under --
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4981.69,4982.86,Under ‘33 Act.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,4982.86,4984.089,Exactly Your Honor.
1967.104,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4998.484,5014.701,"Well, if there is -- if this is a security and if Mr. A is soliciting persons to purchase this security and it’s not astounding to me that Mr. A is regarded as a broker."
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5016.523,5024.074,He maybe regarded as a broker but not under the terms of this Act because this is not the type of interest that is traded.
1967.104,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5024.991,5027.963,It is traded if bought and sold.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5043.394,5045.764,"It’s an issuance Your Honor, it’s not a trade."
1967.104,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5045.764,5046.876,But it’s a trade.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5083.116,5099.306,"Your Honor, it’s correct and in the sense of the solicitors who seek to have you -- they issue these accounts and this is specifically regulated under the ‘33 Act and as I say, these individuals are really regulated very much so by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board because they’re the ones who really --"
1967.104,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5099.306,5111.425,"But do you agree that ‘33 Act -- the fraud provisions in ‘33 Act applies to this kind of instrument, security or whatever you may call it."
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5111.425,5123.192,"From the reading of the legislative history, I am inclined to think that it does apply because the legislative history specifically says that these people did come to seek this exemption for these type of transaction."
1967.104,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5123.192,5134.049,"What difference would it make in terms of state interest whether that person had thought he was defrauded, brought action under the ‘33 Act or under the ‘34 Act?"
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5134.049,5137.733,We firstly say that the -- we must look to Congressional intent.
1967.104,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5138.57,5139.908,That’s not -- that is not --
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5139.908,5141.225,And then we say that the two --
1967.104,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5141.225,5144.547,(Voice Overlap) this event so far as the state is concerned.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5147.906,5168.353,"In this particular case, the fraud provisions of the 1933 Act would come under Section 12(2) and possibly Section 17(a), and in those particular provisions, the Congress has specifically provided certain provisions of that Act relating thereto."
1967.104,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5234.328,5245.524,I could assume that your agency would be happy if there has been fraud here to have people who were the victims of fraud to have a remedy.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5245.524,5246.825,"That’s correct Your Honor, we do."
1967.104,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5246.825,5248.461,What is the remedy?
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5251.454,5253.696,"Well, as Mr. --"
1967.104,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5253.696,5275.392,"Mister -- your preceding counsel said that a suit has been brought in chancery against the person who is responsible for the fraud if that’s not the same thing, that is say these particular individuals claim that they individually were victimized, is that right?"
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5275.392,5276.954,Correct Your Honor.
1967.104,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5276.954,5281.844,And is there something -- is there some other -- some alternative remedy that they have.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5288.965,5291.624,"No, I say they do have it done under the ‘33 Act."
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5336.606,5348.201,"That state action in chancery as I have understood was on behalf of all the depositors for mismanagement of the institution, am I wrong about that?"
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5348.201,5349.275,Excuse me.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5349.275,5356.611,I thought this action in the state chancery court to which reference has been made and I thought so because I guess so.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5361.083,5361.709,That’s correct.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5361.709,5364.369,Alleging mismanagement of this institution --
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5364.369,5365.517,That’s correct Your Honor.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5365.517,5374.743,-- which is my Brother Fortas points out as quite a different cause of action from one by a purchaser against the seller of a security for fraud and the sale of that security.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5374.743,5375.856,That’s correct Your Honor.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5573.809,5583.974,Are those early associations unless I’m mistaken also the lenders -- the only people who borrowed from the association were members.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5583.974,5585.168,Same thing here Your Honor.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5587.281,5588.766,I mean borrowers.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5588.766,5591.555,Borrowers are members under our statute.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5594.973,5596.829,Do you have to be a prior member?
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5598.212,5600.053,"No, no."
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5600.053,5603.032,But that was true about the earlier associations if I’m not mistaken.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5603.032,5622.055,"I believe that -- essentially, not really that much difference, it maybe so that there was this concept that only members who were investors in the association could borrow but under our law, a borrower who may take out a mortgage on this house does not necessarily have to be a depositor."
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5622.055,5634.692,Was this -- are these institutions under Illinois Law and was this institution limited and how it could lend money with limited to mortgage loans on residential real estate?
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5634.692,5635.616,"Well, yes Your Honor."
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5644.935,5646.574,"Well, now how are they limited?"
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5646.574,5649.119,"Well, usually, the concept --"
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5649.119,5650.873,Mortgage loans on real property?
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5650.873,5651.909,"Yes, mortgage loans."
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5651.909,5653.081,That first than the --
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5653.081,5654.687,"Normally, it’s set forth in the statute."
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5663.657,5670.265,"Well, everybody has -- ordinary commercial banks have limitations but what I’m trying to get at is what kind of limitations?"
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5670.265,5671.695,"Well, the percentages."
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5671.695,5676.673,The kind I’m talking about mortgage loans or residential real property or was it nothing like that?
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5676.673,5677.616,Pardon?
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5677.616,5679.912,Or what is the limitation -- anything like that.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5679.912,5687.919,Yes there are in the statute -- you say you could only borrow up to 80% of the price value with the property and this is regulated by the Commissioner.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5701.296,5706.705,"Yes, but may Savings and Loan Association loan money on any property except residential property."
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5706.705,5707.513,No.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5707.513,5710.213,Not on apartment houses.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5710.213,5711.141,It may.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5711.141,5711.871,They may --
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5711.871,5712.605,Yes.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5712.605,5713.598,I see.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5716.834,5717.613,Yes.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5755.615,5764.675,Are shares in commercial bank securities under the meaning of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act?
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5764.675,5766.671,"As a matter of fact they were traded Your Honor, yes."
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5768.902,5775.595,"And certainly a commercial bank unless it’s a national bank is under the strictest kind of state regulations, is that it?"
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5775.595,5776.475,That’s right Your Honor.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5776.475,5781.464,So this argument for whatever its worth certainly shouldn’t -- isn’t conclusive is it --
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,5781.464,5785.131,Not necessarily conclusive although Congress was looking to this in this intent.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6023.511,6039.511,"Mr. Perlman, are we in this particular case at least talking about regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, aren’t we really just talking about a private right of action in the federal court for fraud or for recession for -- based on fraud?"
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,6039.511,6040.013,That’s correct Your Honor.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6040.013,6043.261,We’re not talking about regulation by this commission?
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,6043.261,6046.705,"Well, if there is found that there are these --"
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6046.705,6054.047,"-- assigned bureaucratic federal commission in competition with the sovereign state of Illinois, we’re not talking about that in this case are we?"
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,6054.047,6061.306,No Your Honor but its possible if these was found to be a security under the Exchange Act.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6088.35,6110.385,But what we’re talking about is a right of action in the federal court by a purchaser of one of these things by an investor against this company because he said I was defrauded and I want my money back and that’s all we’re talking about whether or not there is such a right of action in the federal court.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,6110.385,6111.057,That’s correct Your Honor but --
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6111.057,6114.157,By reason of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act --
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,6114.157,6115.365,That’s correct.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6116.223,6119.196,We’re not talking about regulation by any commission.
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,6119.196,6147.398,"But Your Honor in the cases before this Court -- in this case, true but the thing is this Court has discussed the concept of Securities Acts and the regulation not only in terms of intent of Congress but has said that in its opinions in Variable Annuity case and the majority opinion, in the concurring opinion and recently it was discussed that the state regulation was of primary importance and that’s when the Securities Act become less relevant."
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6147.398,6163.369,"Well, in VALIC -- in those cases, there was an issue as to -- because there, as the case was decided the way in fact it was decided, there was competitive regulation because of the registration requirements of the 1933 Act."
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,6165.525,6166.18,No.
1967.104,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6187.703,6189.923,"Well, that’s a different point and I understand it."
1967.104,3,41859,stuart_d_perlman,,6189.923,6216.545,"Yeah, but this is why the state is quite concerned about this -- because if they would prevail, they will get this $15 million lump sum as opposed to virtually nothing for the approximately 12,000 depositors, 7,000 depositors will get nothing and constantly our office of the attorney general of the city -- the commissioner of savings and loan receives letters daily crying out for these people to get their money and they would get their money now but for this case."
1967.104,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6238.116,6240.41,Mr. Shure.
1967.104,4,16984,arnold_i_shure,,6240.41,6250.946,I would like to respond to appeal of the unanswered questions and with regard to the regulations that Mr. Perlman is speaking of now.
1967.104,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6341.086,6342.606,But you’re complaining about that many of --
1967.104,4,16984,arnold_i_shure,,6342.606,6347.531,"Well, this is -- but the answer is -- the answer he gave was wrong, it’s the reverse of the fact."
1967.104,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6544.993,6547.65,Did you see any difference between the coverage under the two Acts?
1967.104,4,16984,arnold_i_shure,,6547.65,6550.344,Not one I ought to.
1967.104,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6580.319,6582.193,What did you say then?
1967.104,4,16984,arnold_i_shure,,6582.193,6590.616,I say that the liquidators have brought an action there's these people who claim to be lawful --
1967.104,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6590.616,6591.762,(Inaudible)
1967.104,4,16984,arnold_i_shure,,6591.762,6593.097,That’s the state chancery action.
1967.104,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6600.639,6609.321,Now what they’re seemed to be in favor of is you’re getting your money ratably with all of the investors in the institution.
1967.104,4,16984,arnold_i_shure,,6609.321,6610.731,That is what they say they want.
1967.104,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6610.731,6616.389,They don’t want you to get a 100% on the dollar and the other investors to get zero on the dollar.
1967.104,4,16984,arnold_i_shure,,6616.389,6617.544,That is correct.
1967.104,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6715.528,6717.063,That’s all right.
1967.104,4,16984,arnold_i_shure,,6717.063,6722.039,I’m looking at my papers and not at the light.
