1994.93-768,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.684,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 93-768, the Milwaukee Brewery Workers' Pension Plan v. Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,11.809,15.401,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
1994.93-768,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,173.071,177.913,"Well, isn't the question even more simply stated as the question of how much interest?"
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,177.913,184.66,"I think the question, Your Honor, is, in total how much was Schlitz required to pay?"
1994.93-768,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,195.515,198.201,"And that's the point on which the courts of appeals disagree, is it not?"
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,198.201,198.888,That is correct.
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,298.005,300.63,May I ask you a question about that schedule?
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,319.636,329.43,"Justice Stevens, I believe that the interpretation of the proper application of the prepayment provision would provide the answer to that question."
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,331.007,332.492,And what is the answer to the question?
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,332.492,339.379,--The answer... the plan submits that the answer is that interest would have accrued from--
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,339.379,339.972,"In other words, your answer is yes?"
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,339.972,340.738,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,340.738,355.092,"And the reason... and even though the payment is made in full, there's been no arrearage, it's all done in one simple payment, nevertheless you'd charge them 1 year's interest and treat that as the amount of the unfunded liability."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,355.092,381.924,"I think in the instance in which the first payment actually occurred, or payment in full actually occurred prior to the first day of the plan year after withdrawal, that interest would be charged only for the period from the last day of the plan year, the day on which the amount of the unfunded vested liabilities are fixed, and the day that the full actual payment is made."
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,381.924,384.08,"In other words, January 1st to August under the hypothetical."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,384.08,385.955,"Under your example, that's correct, Justice Stevens."
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,385.955,386.205,Yes.
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,386.205,392.56,And in order... that would be done in order to fully fund the amount of the--
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,392.56,406.837,"Even though, if there had been no withdrawal, say, as, you know, they just had gradually had lesser participation, they had stayed in the plan, paid that amount, that discharged their liabilities and everybody could go home, they'd still... you have to add on the interest because they're withdrawing."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,406.837,416.317,"--I think that Congress has essentially said, we are going to, for sake of convenience and ease of calculation, eliminate--"
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,416.317,418.41,But one isn't any easier to calculate than the other.
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,424.799,445.039,"--I agree that the... the ease of calculation, if you use either accrual of interest from the date that the amount is fixed, the date of... the last day of the plan year before the withdrawal, or the first date that the presumed payment is made, that those two schedules are equally easy to calculate."
1994.93-768,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,445.039,455.832,"--Mr. Bruton, may I ask if ease of calculation is the reason why you are not urging, as Central States is, the Easterbrook position as a fallback?"
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,460.878,478.839,"We carefully looked at the statute, and we could find no support in the statute for Judge Easterbrook's position that in some way a portion of the interest during that period could be charged to the withdrawing employer."
1994.93-768,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,493.818,508.046,So the choices as you see it are only the two on which the Fourth Circuit and the Third Circuit divided?
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,508.046,510.108,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.93-768,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,549.623,557.681,"Even if the withdrawal occurred on that... in fact occurred on that very last day, so that the employer had made all the contributions for that year?"
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,557.681,560.305,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.93-768,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,648.66,655.142,"Before we get too far away from Justice Stevens' question, I want to make sure I understand the answer."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,676.838,677.445,Correct.
1994.93-768,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,716.414,725.3,"I don't see how that doesn't undercut your position that the interest has to be included as if the payment isn't made until January 1, '82."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,725.3,731.033,Congress provided that an employer--
1994.93-768,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,731.033,737.264,"I'd say that's perfectly sensible from a financial standpoint, but it seems to me to undercut your theory in this case."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,737.264,748.198,"--It does not, because the prepayment provision is entirely separate from the provision that is utilized to calculate the number of longterm payments, so to speak."
1994.93-768,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,748.198,764.316,"But why is it that interest is not charged if there's a full discharge at once, but it is not if the full payment is made, say, on the first payment date?"
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,764.316,771.611,Interest would accrue up until that first payment date.
1994.93-768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,775.67,801.223,"Yes, but isn't the... all right, isn't that if the calculation is made on the assumption in effect on your theory that the debt becomes due on December 31 of the previous year, and that the first payment is made on January 1 of the year following the withdrawal, so isn't there always going to be 1 year's accrued interest whenever you make the first payment, even if you prepay it?"
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,803.753,827.744,"The scenario, as I understood the hypothetical question, was that the 23.3 million dollars would be the amount tendered at the first full payment, and it would be our position that that would be insufficient, because by that point in time, at least a portion of the first year's worth of interest will have accrued."
1994.93-768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,827.744,834.804,"Yes, but I thought the payment schedule... I mean, first there's a calculation as to the unfunded liability."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,879.536,894.936,"The prepayment provision, which is set forth at page 25 of the red brief of the respondent, specifically says what must be prepaid in order to comply with this statute, and it is somewhat counterintuitive."
1994.93-768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,907.587,914.959,And doesn't that annual withdrawal liability payment include on this conventional calculation basis a year of interest?
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,914.959,916.006,It does.
1994.93-768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,916.006,916.49,Okay.
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,921.598,934.951,"The statute goes on to say that they should also pay accrued interest, if any."
1994.93-768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,934.951,947.821,"Yes, but I thought your answer... I thought your interpretation of that provision was that accrued interest there refers to interest which accrued on any payments as to which the employer was delinquent."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,976.277,980.495,"Yes, Justice Souter and, in fact, while it is not--"
1994.93-768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,980.495,981.276,Is that your answer now?
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,981.276,981.947,--It is.
1994.93-768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,981.947,982.4,Okay.
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,982.4,1007.938,"And in fact, while it is not an issue in this case, I think that taken to its logical extension, the entire amount, that some total of all of the required payments in this presumed schedule, in our case 31.1 million, is the amount that would be due if there was a prepayment at any time, and there--"
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1007.938,1021.465,"And you get that conclusion out of the word ""amortize"" in this section, and it's puzzling to me how an amortization of a single payment for the full amount of principal due would contemplate interest being paid on that amount if you pay it promptly."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1021.465,1029.882,--The purpose for the amortization is to fully fund this amount which was calculated.
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1029.882,1032.193,"If you paid it in full on the date due, it would fully fund."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1032.193,1033.162,If it was--
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1033.162,1041.454,"If they'd made the payments up to August, as currently, then they make the full payment of the unfunded vested liability in one single payment, that would fully fund it."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1041.454,1051.594,"--If the amount that was being funded was calculated as of the date that the first payment was made, I agree it would fully fund--"
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1051.594,1058.137,"It was calculated as of the January date, but the employer has made payments from January to August under the old schedule."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1058.137,1059.793,--And Congress has said--
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1059.793,1068.242,"And the presumption is that when he withdraws, the amount calculated as of the first of the year will remain the correct amount, without further fiddling with the figures."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1068.242,1069.383,--Congress has said that--
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1069.383,1073.27,"You're saying that the word ""amortize"" mean it's that amount plus the year's interest."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1073.27,1074.38,--Correct.
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1079.081,1083.252,"Normally, when you amortize a single payment, do you toss interest on top of it?"
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1086.016,1093.045,"--Well, if the payment is made on the same day the debt arises, there would be no interest."
1994.93-768,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1094.919,1098.402,And incidentally... and that's your... you stick with your answer to me on that point?
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1115.004,1125.5,"--Your Honor, I believe that the prepayment provision would require full payment of the total amount--"
1994.93-768,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1125.5,1127.249,The 23.3?
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1127.249,1133.153,--The 31.1... 31.1.
1994.93-768,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1142.805,1147.914,"All right, so then, a full year's interest must be paid."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1147.914,1148.6,--Right.
1994.93-768,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1148.6,1161.251,"No matter if it's paid on the date of demand, and even if that date of demand is before the first required payment under the statute?"
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1161.251,1163.829,Correct.
1994.93-768,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1163.829,1167.203,So that's a different answer than you gave me the first time.
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1167.203,1170.529,I apologize if I initially was confused.
1994.93-768,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1173.061,1180.635,I had thought you conceded in your brief that no interest would be due under that... under that hypothetical.
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1181.854,1195.316,--I believe that the prepayment provision is one that could take briefing and argument and debate and discussion in another case.
1994.93-768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1241.518,1260.463,"Because annual is calculated on the assumption that the debt begins to run on the date that the amount of the debt is calculated, and that no payment is made until a full year has elapsed, so therefore the annual payment implies, by definition, a year of interest."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1260.463,1261.276,That is correct.
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.41,1316.58,Isn't the assumption that the actuaries used realistic interest rates?
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1320.939,1322.094,"That is correct, Justice Stevens."
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1325.171,1337.339,"No, but a prepayment, in all our hypotheticals we're assuming that you fix the unfunded liability as of December 31, 1980, and in my hypothesis the company decides to pay it in full on January 1st of the following year."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1340.884,1342.586,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1342.586,1348.333,"--in order to make the fund whole, but that more than makes the fund whole, the plan whole."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1348.333,1366.045,"There are... there will be instances, there is no question that there will be instances in which, on a purely actuarial analysis the withdrawing employer will pay something more than is necessary to make the plan whole."
1994.93-768,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1366.607,1372.558,"This is such a case, isn't it, because they made contributions through August, and then they paid interest from August on?"
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1372.558,1374.308,"--Not necessarily, Justice Stevens."
1994.93-768,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1386.692,1388.239,"Yes, but that's always true."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1425.006,1426.631,I think that I--
1994.93-768,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1426.631,1427.24,"I mean, is it right?"
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1427.24,1429.098,--I don't believe that that is correct.
1994.93-768,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1447.762,1470.971,"I didn't see one full year, because it seemed to me the way this works is, 23 million is what would be necessary to make the plan whole as of, let's call it day zero, and then the statute says, how many payments of 4 million dollars, because that's their normal payment... say how many payments of 4 million dollars will it take to raise that 23 million if the first payment was made on day 366--"
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1470.971,1471.643,--That is correct.
1994.93-768,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1471.643,1477.516,"--right, and what you don't know is, do they mean, including the interest for that year or not."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1477.516,1478.266,That is correct.
1994.93-768,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1478.266,1479.469,Frontloaded or backloaded.
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1518.562,1531.667,"The amount that's fixed as of day zero, however, is not impacted by what occurs between day zero and day 365."
1994.93-768,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1561.936,1565.856,"No, there won't be if the employer is making a monthly payment during that whole period."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1570.041,1581.458,"--That regular monthly payment, however, did not relate to, in any way, the 23.3 million that was calculated as of day zero."
1994.93-768,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1589.065,1594.469,"Since they may or may not have, shouldn't we assume that they will be sufficient to keep the plan where it was left?"
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1594.469,1609.745,"No, because Congress said, we want to amortize the amount calculated as of day zero, and that is the goal and the purpose of this whole schedule, to fully amortize that amount."
1994.93-768,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1609.745,1611.79,"Where does it say, as of day zero?"
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1615.133,1620.536,It is not included in the section 4219(c)(1)(a).
1994.93-768,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1631.36,1634.077,"Amortize says spread out, but it doesn't say, starting when."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1634.077,1647.072,--It contemplates that in each payment there will be both an interest component and a component attributed to reduce the amount of the unfunded benefits.
1994.93-768,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1704.94,1706.72,"Very well, Mr. Bruton."
1994.93-768,0,35460,michael_g_bruton,,1706.72,1707.142,Thank you.
1994.93-768,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1707.142,1708.391,"Mr. Willard, we'll hear from you."
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,1708.391,1716.747,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1994.93-768,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1739.472,1749.311,"Mr. Willard, did the Pension Benefit Board adopt a position on the proper rule to be applied in this situation?"
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,1749.311,1755.731,"Your Honor, they did in an amicus brief filed in the Third Circuit in the Huber case, which agreed with our position."
1994.93-768,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1767.555,1773.646,"And the corporate view supported your interpretation, I gather."
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,1773.646,1774.881,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1994.93-768,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1931.521,1955.588,"Well, except that the... I mean, the counterargument there is that the entire set of calculations is being done on a set of conventional assumptions, and one conventional assumption is that the date... that the debt, rather, comes into existence on the date it's amount is calculated, so that if literally you paid at any time after that date, the December 31 date, some interest would have run."
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,1955.588,1965.288,"--Well, that is the position that the plaintiff has taken, although it's a little unclear how much interest they claim would arise and how it would be calculated, but--"
1994.93-768,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1965.288,1966.819,"Well, is it unclear after the argument?"
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,1970.817,1971.223,--Right.
1994.93-768,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1971.223,1971.817,--is going to be added on.
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,1972.864,1975.738,I believe his position was 8 years of interest would be added on.
1994.93-768,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2010.707,2046.818,"Under their interpretation, as I understand it, the word, ""interest"" preceding ""if any"" would refer to interest on delinquent payments, because their argument is that interest... the interest that is implied by the concept of amortization is, in fact, never expressly referred to in the statute, and that when the statute does speak of interest, it's referring to interest on delinquency, so I'd like to know your response to that, but isn't... to begin with, isn't their view, at least internally, consistent?"
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2046.818,2064.029,"--There's one problem with their view, Justice Souter, and that is that the subsection (6), which appears at page 9a of the appendix to our brief, refers to the interest that's used in calculating the amortization schedule as an exception to the normal interest accrual rule."
1994.93-768,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2111.135,2129.752,"But before you get off the prepaid interest statute, it does seem to me that you can explain the ""if any"" consistently with the position that Schlitz takes, save and except that it is entitled to all of the accrued interest."
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2153.507,2160.599,"Justice Kennedy, that was the explanation that the Third Circuit in Huber gave to the ""if any"" language."
1994.93-768,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2166.285,2166.503,Yes.
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2166.503,2184.402,"--on the same day, that that would be treated as two separate payments, but normally, at any point after the amortization schedule begins, there would be some accrued interest at that point, and so if you were to prepay at any point after the amortization schedule starts, there would be some amount of accrued interest."
1994.93-768,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2238.35,2243.411,I agree that that lump sum thing cuts in your favor.
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2264.635,2271.383,"The record shows in this case that the valuations were generally done about the middle of the year, May, June, July."
1994.93-768,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2271.383,2271.727,All right.
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2304.057,2310.149,"Well, I think we should look at the facts of our case to try to illustrate that."
1994.93-768,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2316.099,2316.677,That's why I'm speaking typically.
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2316.677,2317.099,--That's right.
1994.93-768,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2427.165,2432.209,How soon can they do the calculation if they really want to do it as quickly as possible?
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2432.209,2436.05,"If the valuation is done, then it should just be a matter of a few days."
1994.93-768,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2447.5,2452.403,Is it correct that that calculation is made every year regardless of whether anybody withdraws or not?
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2452.403,2453.872,"That is correct, Justice Stevens, it is."
1994.93-768,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2453.872,2455.075,And that's part of the routine accounting in front.
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2455.075,2462.337,"That is part of the routine accounting, and I should note also that the allocation here, and in fact this whole issue, is a dispute among employers."
1994.93-768,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2485.233,2491.106,"You're not suggesting that the petitioner, here, is not a legitimate litigant?"
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2491.106,2492.278,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not."
1994.93-768,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2505.975,2509.084,"Well, maybe they have their own theories about how that should be looked at."
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2509.084,2510.725,"--I understand, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.93-768,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2510.725,2513.927,"Mr. Willard, but on your theory there would always be some gap period."
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2516.956,2527.139,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg, there will always be some gap, in this case a few months only, whereas under the petitioner's view, they would always assess 12 months' interest, even though the gap is much shorter."
1994.93-768,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2527.139,2548.724,"But if there is a gap... either way you move, there's going to be one side or the other disadvantaged, so why don't we fall back on the beneficial purpose of this whole plan, this whole scheme?"
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2548.724,2563.234,"Well, first of all, if the statute is silent on the issue of charging interest of this withdrawal here, period, then we believe that the courts do not have the authority on their own to impose that liability."
1994.93-768,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2586.99,2593.284,"You're stressing the difference between ambiguity and simply making no provision, is that it?"
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2595.362,2603.406,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg, and our position is, there's not room... this is not an ambiguous statute that could be read to allow the imposition of interest."
1994.93-768,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2717.298,2724.154,"Mr. Willard, can I ask you a question about your understanding of what it is in the statute that imposes any interest obligation at all?"
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2751.831,2758.359,"Well, I understand, Justice Stevens, and initially I thought maybe there wasn't any provision for statutory interest."
1994.93-768,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2783.896,2784.646,"I'm sorry, I lost... what you quoted--"
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2784.646,2784.896,"--Yes, sir."
1994.93-768,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2784.896,2785.271,--to me was where?
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2785.271,2788.552,"Paragraph... page 9a in the appendix to our brief, bold face."
1994.93-768,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2813.276,2813.495,I see.
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2813.73,2816.76,"So it's hidden in there, and I don't know why."
1994.93-768,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2893.275,2897.914,"Well, they wouldn't in these fat years, but whatever rule we come up with is going to be a rule for the lean years, too."
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,2908.379,2918.485,"I understand, Justice Souter, but what I'm pointing out is, actuaries generally try to err on the conservative side, so it's not a situation where it's equally likely to be wrong one way than another."
1994.93-768,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2956.531,2959.265,"In your legislative history, I had this slight question."
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3009.605,3018.163,"Well, I think it's fairly clear they didn't because it was originally backloaded and they changed it to frontloaded."
1994.93-768,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3018.834,3019.287,Did they?
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3019.287,3019.74,--it may have--
1994.93-768,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3019.74,3021.287,Is there strong evidence they changed it to frontloaded?
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3023.988,3024.207,--Right.
1994.93-768,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3024.207,3025.05,--but you characterize.
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3025.05,3025.269,Right.
1994.93-768,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3043.512,3043.856,"Well, just tell--"
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3043.856,3044.153,--but I will--
1994.93-768,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3044.153,3047.104,--I can look it up later.
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3047.104,3064.3,"--It is... we cite in this appendix both the original PBGC bill, then we include in here in italics in brackets the language of the first markup, and then we include the language in bold face as finally enacted, and the... here we go, here."
1994.93-768,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3065.237,3066.627,What page are you on?
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3066.627,3081.762,"--Page 3a of the appendix to the red brief, and in the very middle of it, two i's... this would be... italicized paragraph in the very middle of the page."
1994.93-768,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3120.341,3121.231,Where was that change made?
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3121.231,3125.105,--That change was made after the initial markup--
1994.93-768,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3125.105,3125.87,In the... in a subcommittee?
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3125.87,3126.198,--In the subcommittee.
1994.93-768,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3126.198,3126.855,In a subcommittee.
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3126.855,3128.026,Before the full committee report.
1994.93-768,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3128.026,3129.198,Before the full committee report.
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3129.198,3130.384,So it was after the subcommittee--
1994.93-768,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3130.384,3131.025,So we can assume that--
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3131.025,3131.494,--before the full committee.
1994.93-768,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3131.494,3132.899,--Who had this idea in mind?
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3132.899,3133.555,Well--
1994.93-768,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3133.555,3135.632,How many members were on that subcommittee?
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3135.632,3138.491,"--I don't know, Justice Scalia."
1994.93-768,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3138.834,3141.302,"What, as many as 10?"
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3141.302,3141.677,--Right.
1994.93-768,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3147.8,3152.377,But what they did is not change to the first day of the year when due.
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3155.688,3156.437,That's right.
1994.93-768,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3156.437,3163.7,And so that's totally consistent of their thinking of this sum as if the sum had been due a year before.
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3163.7,3165.355,But at that time--
1994.93-768,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3165.355,3167.792,Particularly if there's no evidence they intended any change by it.
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3167.792,3171.461,"--But at that time, the actuarial valuation date was not a year before."
1994.93-768,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3171.461,3172.196,It wasn't?
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3172.196,3173.149,It was not.
1994.93-768,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3253.776,3255.65,"You mean, the subcommittees of Congress thought."
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3256.025,3258.681,"Yes, Justice Scalia, the people who were drafting that."
1994.93-768,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3258.681,3260.087,"And if each subcommittee changed it, it thought."
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3260.087,3261.6,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1994.93-768,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3287.184,3303.443,"Mr. Willard, do you know why Judge Easterbrook thought the case that created the split really didn't, because at the end of his opinion he says that he thought it doubtful that Huber actually held the employer must pay interest from the valuation date."
1994.93-768,1,40682,richard_k_willard,,3303.443,3330.947,"As I recall in Huber, Justice Ginsburg, the withdrawal occurred at the outset of the plan year, and so it was a little hard to tell whether the court in Huber meant that interest should accrue from the date of withdrawal or from the end of the prior plan year, since they were so close together in time, and in fact one later district court case which we cite, which was affirmed by the Third Circuit without opinion, seemed to have thought that it was accruing from the withdrawal date and not from the end of the prior plan year."
1994.93-768,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3358.701,3360.155,"Thank you, Mr. Willard."
1994.93-768,2,35460,michael_g_bruton,,3362.748,3365.309,Thank you.
1994.93-768,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3400.904,3406.605,"Why does the PBC... how do they explain their position, if they say they can't find the answer in the statute?"
1994.93-768,2,35460,michael_g_bruton,,3406.605,3408.588,"Justice Stevens, they don't."
1994.93-768,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3423.348,3424.551,"Thank you, Mr. Bruton--"
1994.93-768,2,35460,michael_g_bruton,,3424.551,3425.051,Thank you.
1994.93-768,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3425.051,3426.551,--the case is submitted.
