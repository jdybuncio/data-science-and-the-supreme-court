1986.85-303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.939,"We will hear arguments first this afternoon in No. 85-303, Missouri against Blair."
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,11.506,14.174,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,136.42,145.125,"xxx station house on the parking warrant charge, would her palm print have been taken or not?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,145.125,164.254,"--The testimony in the case is that on a parking warrant arrest, the usual procedure is to take simply a right index finger, although the detention facility officer testified that when told to do so by the ID department of the police department, they sometimes take a full set of prints, including a palm print."
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,168.808,180.116,"And I suppose there's no claim in this case, is there, that it would have been unconstitutional to take the palm print just on a parking warrant arrest?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,180.116,183.568,I don't think there's any claim in this case to that effect.
1986.85-303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,184.968,194.625,"Mr. Riederer, a parking warrant issued in this case, is that a situation where a person gets a parking ticket and fails to pay it?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,194.625,198.76,"--In this case, Your Honor, she was issued a ticket which she failed to pay."
1986.85-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.516,218.138,"Mr. Riederer, you don't contest, do you, that the reason that the full print was taken was in order to obtain... in order to investigate the murder?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,218.138,219.554,"No, not at all, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,228.927,235.481,Does the record show how long the arrest warrant for the traffic offense had been in the possession of the police?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,235.481,240.933,The record shows that the arrest warrant was issued on the 8th of January.
1986.85-303,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,261.613,266.167,"Does that... well, let me put it this way."
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,274.037,279.991,"The traffic warrant, as a piece of paper, was never in the possession of the police."
1986.85-303,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,279.991,282.426,In the possession of the department.
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,282.426,297.619,"The notification... the traffic warrant would have been in the police department's computerized records as of January 8th, 1982; which was two weeks before she became a suspect, and four weeks before she was arrested."
1986.85-303,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,297.619,302.173,What is the policy... what was the policy with respect to the disposition of these warrants?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,302.173,320.218,"There is some testimony in the record that arrest warrants on parking tickets are sometimes cleaned up, so to speak, where the officers go out to the homes of the people involved; although that is not necessarily the case done in all parking warrants."
1986.85-303,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,326.805,328.324,So no consistent policy?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,328.324,330.692,"It does not appear from the record, Your Honor, no."
1986.85-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,330.692,350.571,"Mr. Riederer, what is at the time of the arrest of the respondent, the arresting officers had been ignorant of the existence of a traffic warrant, but nonetheless, it had been outstanding?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,355.974,361.628,"Well, I don't know that our position would be the same in this case, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,374.019,377.637,"And if they did not have any knowledge of it, you wouldn't be here making this argument?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,377.637,378.554,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,378.554,387.077,"Is it enough for the arresting officers to merely know of the warrant, or must they rely on it in making the arrest?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,387.077,399.717,"I think that to sustain our position, the officers would have to at least know of the arrest warrant."
1986.85-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.717,403.419,"It's enough to know about it and not rely on it, in your view?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,403.419,405.588,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,407.24,413.727,What if the respondent had made a full confession following her arrest?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,413.727,416.012,--Then I think that confession would have--
1986.85-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,416.012,417.746,Would that have been admissible in your view?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,417.746,431.189,"--I think then the court would have been called upon to examine whether or not that confession, independently of the arrest, was voluntarily given."
1986.85-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,445.198,459.273,"But had she done so, in your view, even though technically an arrest for homicide was without probable cause at that time, in your view, the confession would be admissible as well?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,459.273,468.981,"In my view, the confession would have been admissible, because I don't think there's anything that prevents the police from talking to the respondent about another crime, once she's lawfully in custody on the parking warrant."
1986.85-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,475.801,484.574,"And you think she was lawfully in custody on the warrant not because they relied on it, the traffic warrant, but because they knew about it?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,484.574,490.41,"Well, in this particular case, I think that she was lawfully in custody on the warrant because they knew about it and relied upon it."
1986.85-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,499.25,502.368,"Was that the finding of the courts below, do you think?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,502.368,518.312,"--The... it's my belief that although there were no findings of fact or opinion in the court below, the respondent's position, according to her pleadings and her argument at that time was that there was an arrest on the parking warrant, but that it was pretextual and therefore illegal."
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,540.743,542.862,What about the trial court?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,542.862,544.895,The trial court in this case--
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,544.895,548.497,Did the trial court find the arrest was for homicide?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,548.497,552.385,"--The trial court made no findings of fact, and in fact, did not issue an opinion."
1986.85-303,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,575.75,577.95,"Counsel, where is the defendant now?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,577.95,582.587,"--The defendant is free, out of custody."
1986.85-303,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,582.587,583.22,She's at large?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,583.22,583.854,Yes.
1986.85-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,612.538,622.795,"Mr. Riederer, may I go back to one of the questions that I guess Justice Powell may have asked a similar question but, I think you said the warrant... I'm talking about the traffic warrant... that the warrant was in the computerized records."
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,631.834,638.471,"--There was a physical piece of paper, which is the actual court copy of the parking ticket originally issue."
1986.85-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,638.471,639.387,The ticket.
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,639.387,649.16,"Which appears on pages 5 and 6 of the supplemental legal file in this record, and which, the face of it, the front of it is the ticket, and the back of it is the court record."
1986.85-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,657.599,661.9,"And is there a separate piece of paper that is the bench warrant, or is it just the notation on the back of the ticket?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,661.9,673.708,"The way I understand is how it works is, that when the judge makes that notation, then that is put into the computer, which is operated jointly, or at least they have access jointly, between the city and the police department."
1986.85-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,673.708,679.612,"And then if an arrest is made pursuant to such a warrant, does the officer take that ticket with him, or does he take another piece of paper?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,679.612,690.32,"He generally... well, he might take a piece of paper that indicates simply that there is an arrest warrant; not the actual arrest warrant."
1986.85-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,697.76,705.829,"And, of course, it's your view as a matter of Missouri law it's a proper arrest on a misdemeanor like this, even without actually having the warrant in the officer's possession?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,705.829,706.448,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,721.625,724.16,The city limits being Kansas City?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,724.16,725.177,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,760.083,770.272,"Should we look, in determining what is reasonable, at what the reasonable action would have been absent suspicion of homicide?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,770.272,772.558,I think that in--
1986.85-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,772.558,773.691,Is that what we should look at?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,773.691,792.471,"--In determining what was reasonable for the officer to do in this arrest, it seems to me that the Court has already indicated that it is not a proper inquiry to look at the subjective state of mind or motivation of the officer at the time."
1986.85-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,792.471,806.195,Should we look at what is objectively standard and reasonable for the officers to have done in connection with executing a traffic warrant on the assumption that the homicide was not involved?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,812.635,815.67,I think that the--
1986.85-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,815.67,817.12,Is that what we do?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,817.12,819.872,--that the Court should look at what--
1986.85-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,819.872,821.255,Yes or no?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,821.255,825.692,"--Yes, you should look at what the reasonable practice is."
1986.85-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,825.692,839.802,"And you will tell us again, will you, exactly... if there had been no suspicion of homicide here at all, what would the standard procedure in that community have been on execution of a traffic warrant?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,839.802,842.154,"On the execution of a traffic warrant, when--"
1986.85-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,842.154,844.604,And whether to execute it at all.
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,844.604,867.269,"--If a citizen unsuspected of homicide were brought in a similar parking warrant, they usually would have simply a right index finger taken, a print of the right index finger taken, although the detention officers will take a full set of fingerprints if they're told to by some other part of the police department, if it's wanted for some other reason."
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,867.269,872.506,And then immediately put on the street?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,872.506,875.291,And then given opportunity to make bond--
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,875.291,876.075,Immediately?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,876.075,878.677,"--Correct, Your Honor, immediately."
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,878.677,881.462,Just like eventually happened here.
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,881.462,882.212,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,882.212,887.83,How do you justify keeping her overnight before she was asked to respond to the arrest warrant?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,887.83,895.186,"I don't think that the detention of this respondent over night is justified, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.497,917.349,"I see, you took the fingerprints... you took the palm print before she was held overnight?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,917.349,920.567,--They did get her palm print before she was held overnight.
1986.85-303,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,927.657,934.661,"Respondent was booked on a homicide charge before the fingerprints had been matched, wasn't she?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,934.661,936.311,"Yes, Your Honor, she had been."
1986.85-303,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,943.833,946.284,In the absence of probable cause?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,946.284,949.07,"In the absence of probable cause, yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,989.128,1000.003,"Well, wasn't she, when she was first brought in, and just before her palm print was taken, she was booked for homicide?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1000.003,1001.705,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1001.705,1007.525,"Well, why was she booked for homicide if she was arrested on the parking warrant?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1007.525,1009.525,"Well, it's clear on the--"
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1009.525,1012.577,"What does it mean, booked for homicide?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1014.345,1015.745,--It does not mean that she's charged with it.
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1020.547,1028.719,"Well, it's pretty clearly... what does it indicate to you, when the officers book her for homicide?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1030.67,1040.776,"--I think it indicates that the officers, just like Officer Stewart testified, they were in fact not only interested in her because of the parking warrant, they were interested in talking to her about this homicide."
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1049.316,1061.69,"So you... I guess you say, as Justice O'Connor was inquiring from you, if she's booked... just arrested on the parking warrant, brought in and given a... and one fingerprint is taken."
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1079.418,1080.351,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.117,1084.319,"You have to go that far at least, don't you?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1084.319,1085.019,--Yes.
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1089.29,1096.377,And then some officers who really had only a vague suspicion could then question her before she was released?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1096.377,1100.063,"--That's correct, Your Honor, because she was already within the lawful custody of the police."
1986.85-303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1100.063,1106.716,"But I gather she would not have been detained overnight if she had not been booked, would she, on the homicide charge?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1106.716,1109.684,It's likely that she would not have been detained overnight.
1986.85-303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1109.684,1113.238,"You said earlier that as soon as she made bond, she was free to go out on the street."
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1113.238,1114.555,"Right, if she--"
1986.85-303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1114.555,1116.607,"So it's rather obvious that she was detained, wasn't she?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1116.607,1117.474,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1117.474,1118.726,Only because she'd been booked?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1118.726,1119.642,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1119.642,1122.928,And although you had no probable cause to charge her with any homicide?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1122.928,1123.761,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1123.761,1128.932,Was she also booked for violation... failure to appear on the traffic summons?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1128.932,1137.021,"She was booked on the failure to appear on the traffic summons the next morning, Your Honor, and that time given an opportunity to make bond, which she did about two hours later and was released."
1986.85-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1137.021,1138.721,Why wasn't she booked for that at the same time?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1138.721,1140.237,"Well, that I don't know."
1986.85-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1149.891,1150.441,"Well, I understand that."
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1155.128,1160.199,"--Well, either the arresting officer or the detention officer, or somebody who tells the arresting officer."
1986.85-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1160.615,1160.832,"Well, doesn't that go--"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1160.832,1171.888,--I think the booking slip is simply a bookkeeping device which at least the detention unit has to have in order to know where this defendant is while she's in their custody.
1986.85-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1171.888,1176.375,"--Well, doesn't that go to the point that you were responding to Justice O'Connor on earlier?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1190.115,1205.042,"Well, Officer Stewart's testimony, I think, is clear that the reason that he went to arrest her was on the parking warrant and in connection with this pick-up order indicating that the police had wanted to talk to her about the homicide, because they had reason to believe she was involved in it."
1986.85-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1205.042,1208.827,--But he comes back and doesn't book her on the parking violation.
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1208.827,1215.231,He comes back and tells the detention unit to hold her both for the crimes against persons unit and the warrant service unit.
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.35,1221.902,"May I ask, is that... well, the detention unit holds her for that."
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1225.955,1233.275,"Why the officer put on there, booked for homicide... well, that is simply, as I say--"
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1233.275,1234.275,He didn't do it out of the air.
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1236.161,1239.113,"--That is correct, and I think it indicates--"
1986.85-303,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1239.113,1242.381,You keep talking about this bookkeeping.
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1254.106,1256.891,"--There is no such law, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1256.891,1260.427,"Well, what right does a policeman have to do that?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1262.212,1267.198,The law in Missouri would be that if a person is arrested on a charge--
1986.85-303,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1267.198,1269.298,Did you ever hear about taking them before a magistrate?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1269.298,1270.4,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1270.4,1271.984,Is that the law in Missouri or not?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1271.984,1272.367,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1275.119,1276.388,"Well, why wasn't it done here?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1276.388,1282.542,"--It's required... well, it's because it's required to be done either within 20 hours or as soon as is practicable."
1986.85-303,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1284.91,1286.61,"Well, what was practical this time?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1286.61,1302.354,"--Well, this defendant was... this respondent was arrested on the parking warrant on the afternoon of the 5th, and then she was held overnight but was released within the 20 hours mandated by the statute."
1986.85-303,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1314.596,1318.648,And you can be held in jail overnight on a parking ticket?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1318.648,1322.266,"If she had not made bond, she would have been held overnight."
1986.85-303,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1322.266,1325.135,But you said the bond hearing was the next day.
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1327.068,1328.754,And in this case--
1986.85-303,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1328.754,1330.32,I'm talking about when she was arrested.
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1334.741,1336.257,"--That I don't know, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1338.776,1339.025,"Well, shouldn't you know?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1339.025,1340.376,--I assume that it--
1986.85-303,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1340.376,1341.477,Shouldn't you know?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1341.477,1343.596,"--Yes, Your Honor, I should."
1986.85-303,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1343.596,1345.446,"Well, give me any reason why not?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1345.446,1349.131,Because the police had wanted to talk to her in connection with the homicide.
1986.85-303,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1349.131,1350.0,That's the only reason?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1350.0,1350.983,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1350.983,1352.702,And that's why she was held overnight?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1352.702,1353.435,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1353.435,1355.487,So they could talk to her about the homicide?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1355.487,1356.087,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1373.18,1385.606,"Why should we differ with the decisions of the... as I read what was written below, it was accepted that the arrest was for a homicide."
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1385.606,1390.974,"The court talked about the arrest for homicide, but actually, the decision--"
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1390.974,1392.026,"Well, why shouldn't we accept that?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1392.026,1394.292,--The court below didn't make that finding.
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1396.125,1398.16,"Well, how about... is this wrong?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1421.792,1422.575,--The--
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1422.575,1426.327,"Now, is that an accurate description of what occurred at the police station?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1426.327,1433.333,"--It's an accurate description, first of all, that they did file this report, which is the Exhibit No. 3."
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1446.725,1460.667,"Well, and also, the Supreme Court seemed to me... they said that the... on the conflicts of the evidence, one of which was, what was the person arrested for, the trial court resolved the conflicts in favor of the defendant."
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1470.756,1472.708,--The trial court did not make any such finding.
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1472.708,1478.046,"It had... what did... in order to sustain the suppression motion, it had to find that."
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1478.046,1490.42,"In order to sustain the suppression motion, actually Your Honor it had to find that there was an arrest on the parking warrant which was invalid because it was pretextual, because that was what the respondent was arguing at that time."
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.42,1494.222,"Well, if it's pretextual... if it's pretextual, it's because they really arrested her for homicide."
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1494.222,1495.24,That's--
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1495.24,1499.525,That's the only... I don't know what difference that makes.
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1499.525,1511.083,"--The Supreme Court then went on to say that assuming that there was an arrest for the parking violation, and then goes on to the holding in the case, that it was pretextual and therefore invalid."
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1511.083,1521.391,"Well, the claim in the trial court was that this palm print was the fruit of an illegal arrest for homicide."
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1521.391,1525.693,The claim in the trial court was that it was the fruit of an illegal arrest--
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1525.693,1526.243,For homicide?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1526.243,1526.943,"--Well, no."
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1534.616,1536.282,"Well, I know, but that's the same thing."
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1541.686,1544.305,Our response was then--
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1544.305,1546.238,--Was that we arrested her on the parking warrant.
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1546.238,1547.307,--We arrested her on the parking warrant.
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1547.307,1547.99,Yes.
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1547.99,1551.226,"And having had her in custody, we were entitled to her prints."
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1552.328,1565.135,I don't know how the order... the suppression order... the suppression motion could have been sustained and the evidence suppressed without the trial court concluding that this was not a valid arrest for homicide?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1565.135,1577.193,--Because the trial court apparently bought the respondent's argument that the motivation of the police at the time was part of the determination of whether or not the arrest was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1577.193,1584.03,"Well, the Supreme Court certainly read the trial court as having resolved the conflict this way."
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1588.334,1603.76,"Well, I think that if the... if the respondent's position and the court below's position is taken, then that means that a state of mind is part of the determination of reasonableness, which it seems to the State flies in the face of this Court's decisions in--"
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1603.76,1610.58,"Well, it is important to decide whether the arrest was for the homicide or not?"
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1610.58,1612.214,"--Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1612.214,1612.497,All right.
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1622.722,1624.488,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.488,1627.19,And you say that's not the way to proceed?
1986.85-303,0,16857,albert_a_riederer,,1627.19,1639.314,"I say that the motivation behind it... the officer said, I arrested him on the parking warrant, but admitted that the motivation was to get evidence in an unrelated homicide investigation."
1986.85-303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1642.283,1644.318,"Thank you, Mr. Riederer."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,1646.42,1654.157,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1691.865,1692.448,0 xxx.
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,1706.256,1706.839,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1706.839,1720.08,"Now, there's a difference between saying there was no arrest whatever on the parking ticket, and saying, there was an arrest on the parking ticket but the police were really doing it not to get this person for the parking ticket but to get her on the homicide."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,1720.08,1720.746,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1720.746,1722.93,"Now, it seems to me that what the Supreme Court was saying was the latter."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,1722.93,1723.698,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1737.24,1738.958,But it isn't clear on which basis.
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,1749.397,1757.419,"--I think at the point in the Supreme Court of Missouri's opinion, when they're talking about the evidence, they're not talking about pretext."
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1763.973,1766.125,"You can't put it that way, whether she was legitimately arrested."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,1766.125,1767.727,"--Well, whether she was arrested."
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1767.727,1775.881,"She's not legitimately arrested, under their opinion, if... if... although she's arrested on the parking ticket, it was pretextual for something else."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,1775.881,1776.6,The first--
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1776.6,1778.417,How do you explain that sentence that I read?
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,1783.153,1798.596,"--I explain that by the fact that they reach... they give an opinion about the pretextual nature of this arrest only secondary to the fact that this was an illegal arrest from the beginning, and there was no arrest on a parking ticket."
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.423,1815.292,Where do you find that in the language of the Supreme Court's opinion?
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,1815.292,1815.808,Of Missouri?
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1815.808,1816.225,Yes.
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,1816.225,1818.244,There opinion states--
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.244,1819.91,Could you turn to a page?
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,1819.91,1834.504,"--Yes, Your Honor, A5 and 6 of the joint... of the petition for certiorari specifically states that... the Supreme Court of Missouri starts out saying that there was a conflict in evidence--"
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1834.504,1835.237,Where are you?
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,1844.776,1846.359,"--At that point, they analyzed the evidence."
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1908.349,1923.026,"But is it clear that when the Court says, the conflicts thus raised were for the trial court to resolve, is it clear that they're talking only there about the conflict as to whether the arrest was on the parking ticket or not?"
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,1965.0,1983.081,"Well, I think you're not... I think, Your Honor, you have to look at what the Supreme Court of Missouri said at the bottom of page A5, when they say, specifically, the evidence conflicts on this issue, the evidence conflicts of whether the officers arrested the defendant on the outstanding parking violation warrant."
1986.85-303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2006.011,2011.581,"Do you object to us reaching it if we want to, and if it doesn't hurt you at all?"
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2015.552,2025.158,I think that the evidence was abundantly clear that there was no arrest on a parking warrant.
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2025.158,2028.027,Mr. Loscascio?
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2028.027,2028.36,Yes.
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2028.36,2033.079,"What do you mean when you say there was no arrest, quote, on, close quote, a parking warrant?"
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2033.079,2041.75,"Well, I'm saying that if you look at the exhibits that were filed, Exhibit 3, the arrest report, doesn't say that the arrest was for a parking ticket."
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2053.558,2058.545,"How do you decide whether a person was arrested on, close quote, a particular warrant?"
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2058.545,2064.533,I think that the only way to decide that is to look at the objective facts to determine--
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2064.533,2066.068,What's the legal test?
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2070.52,2074.139,"--Well, I certainly think he must have to know, not only--"
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2074.139,2079.309,"Well, suppose there's an outstanding warrant against someone for robbery."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2093.735,2104.527,"--I think under those facts as you've given me, yes, it's unlawful, precisely because the actions he took were not justified by the Fourth Amendment."
1986.85-303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2121.738,2149.972,"Yes, but you do, in the end, have to decide, as the Chief Justice says, that whether... if the... if the officers had otherwise a perfectly legal reason for talking her palm print, the palm print must nevertheless he excluded, because the reason they took it for was invalid."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2179.991,2184.895,I'm saying that this Court doesn't have to get into an analysis to decide--
1986.85-303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.895,2194.768,"Well, they could... it wouldn't have... if they had arrested her on the parking violation, it would not have been unconstitutional for them to take her palm print."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2194.768,2200.088,"--Well, that is our... that's a matter of perspective, I think."
1986.85-303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.104,2202.654,"Well, it's a matter of law, isn't it?"
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2202.654,2207.175,"--Well, there is law that says that they have a right to fingerprint to identify an individual."
1986.85-303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2215.681,2216.898,"Well, I know, but that's the local practice."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2216.898,2217.8,That's true.
1986.85-303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2217.8,2222.917,So it's not... it wouldn't have been unconstitutional if their practice was to take a full set of prints?
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2222.917,2227.421,"Well, presumably, when they wrote their local practice, they determined what their needs were."
1986.85-303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2234.809,2238.796,"Yes, but all that goes to is what they really arrested for in the first place."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2252.537,2262.828,--Because... they didn't... because that's not the purpose for which they acted.
1986.85-303,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2267.613,2275.1,"Does the inevitable discovery doctrine of this Court have a bearing on that at all, do you think?"
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2275.1,2279.069,--I don't think in this case there was anything inevitable about this palm print.
1986.85-303,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2280.754,2283.789,"Well, let's put Justice White's question another way."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2300.95,2301.967,--No.
1986.85-303,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2303.467,2304.0,No Why not?
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2304.0,2317.893,"--Well, in that situation that you have given me, then this Court would be talking about reaching my second point, which is that it's unlawful and a violation of the Constitution to use the power that you have primarily for ulterior purposes."
1986.85-303,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2317.893,2341.525,"Well, don't you think that cases of this Court, such as Scott v. United States and Mr. LaFave and his treatise and so forth all talk about the fact that the Court should disregard the underlying intent of the officer if the objective realities provide a better way of dealing with it?"
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2341.525,2347.912,"When I say, primary purpose, that doesn't necessarily mean subjective purpose."
1986.85-303,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2374.061,2387.054,"On my example, they clearly, objectively, would have been entitled to have the index print, and could have had it in any event on the traffic warrant, and why isn't that perfectly all right?"
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2387.054,2392.541,"Well, it wouldn't be all right if she's booked for murder because of a traffic warrant?"
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2392.541,2393.958,What's wrong with that?
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2393.958,2403.497,"Well, it's precisely because this woman is subjected to the most humiliating and frightening and intrusive experience that a person could be without probable cause."
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2403.497,2406.884,What follows as a result of her having been booked?
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2406.884,2410.003,"Well, she certainly has a permanent record for homicide."
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2410.003,2412.955,"Well, all we're talking about is whether the palm print should be suppressed."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2430.583,2435.201,Precisely because they obtained the palm print as the fruit of an unlawful detention.
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2435.201,2441.022,"But it's conceded that she could have been detained for the traffic violation... traffic warrant, couldn't she?"
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2441.022,2443.157,But that's not what happened here.
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2443.157,2447.426,"Well, then we're back to what did the Supreme Court of Missouri mean and that sort of thing."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2447.426,2449.561,Right.
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2455.865,2462.368,"But, of course, to say, whether she was lawfully detained on a parking warrant begs the factual question."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2462.368,2466.756,Whether or not--
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2466.756,2468.006,There are two questions.
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2478.647,2479.03,--Right.
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2501.993,2515.753,"Well, Mr. Locascio, what if the Kansas City police department, of the Jackson County police, had had a policy if palm-printing every tenth person who was brought in a traffic warrant, and just fingerprinting the other nine."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2528.411,2532.512,I think the only objection I would have at that point would be that the procedure was arbitrary.
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2536.416,2542.051,And you think anything that strikes you as arbitrary is excludable from a criminal trial?
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2542.051,2549.557,"I think that anything that's arbitrary, and is not obtained by probable cause, that it violates the Fourth Amendment."
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2549.557,2556.294,Do you think that you have to have probable cause to take a fingerprint of someone who is lawfully detained?
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2556.294,2561.282,"No, no, you have to have... whose lawfully detained?"
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2561.282,2565.4,"Assume the person is lawfully detained, do you think you have to have further probable cause to take a fingerprint?"
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2565.4,2566.519,"No, of course not."
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2574.355,2580.343,"And I take it if you were to palm-print everyone who was brought in on a traffic warrant, that would be all right, in your view?"
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2580.343,2584.897,"I think you arguable have a Constitutional question of the need to palm-print, because--"
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2584.897,2590.651,"Well, if there's no requirement for a need to fingerprint, why should there be a Constitutional requirement for a need to palm-print?"
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2590.651,2597.038,--Because that's not what was meant when you fingerprint an individual for purposes of identification.
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2605.227,2611.464,"Well, what is it that is Constitutionally different between taking a fingerprint and taking a palm print?"
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2615.082,2620.153,What I am suggesting is that what happened in this case is exactly--
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2620.153,2622.605,"Well, I want a... I'd like an answer to my question?"
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2622.605,2624.974,--What's wrong with it in this case?
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2624.974,2626.957,"No, I'm not asking, what's wrong with it in this case."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2634.663,2642.686,"There is just the... in that example, the only argument that you would have is that there was no probable cause to take a palm print."
1986.85-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2645.552,2649.84,But you don't need a demonstrated need or probable cause to take a fingerprint?
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2649.84,2656.409,"Well, not if it's Constitutional to fingerprint for purposes of identification."
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2678.423,2680.291,Maybe fingerprints are unconstitutional.
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2684.076,2693.449,"--You know, the question that you ask really gets... no, that's not where we're at now."
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2719.999,2729.955,"Mr. Locascio, let's come to your secondary submission, because the primary one, we got into that discussion, it depends, you agree, upon the meaning of the Supreme Court's opinion."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2790.476,2794.88,--I think under your example that you do have to look at the purpose.
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2823.048,2824.649,"I don't know what you mean, the objective factor."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2844.445,2846.628,"--Of course not, you don't have to throw that out."
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2860.205,2863.74,And you think the primary motive here wasn't--
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2863.74,2875.964,"I think just looking... not even getting into subjective intent now on this second point, the objective facts alone tell us that their primary motive was to investigate homicide."
1986.85-303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2946.06,2967.89,"--What did you say... what was your reason, I'm not sure I understood it... that, suppose it's conceded the arrest was for homicide, but that the police had a perfectly valid outstanding warrant for robbery, under which the person could have been arrested and held and a palm print taken."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,2972.258,2980.928,"Well, if... I assume then... under your example, I will assume that they did not know about the arrest warrant at the time they conducted the arrest."
1986.85-303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2980.928,2984.399,"Exactly, they never found it out until they got to the stationhouse."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3002.943,3005.745,"Under your example, Your Honor, then the--"
1986.85-303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3005.745,3007.162,And taken her palm print right then.
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3007.162,3017.72,"--Under the example, would be that oftentimes when police officers do perform illegal arrests, there's probable cause out there somewhere, that if they'd only investigate the case, they'd find it."
1986.85-303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.989,3024.874,"Well, you don't... you know, you can arrest a person on probable cause."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3036.398,3038.95,That's true.
1986.85-303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3072.188,3075.14,"All right, they bring her back to the stationhouse and take the palm print."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3083.71,3087.78,"Well, that's what happened in Hayes v. Florida in 1985."
1986.85-303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3087.78,3088.33,"Well, all right."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3088.33,3092.499,That's exactly what this Court held to be a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
1986.85-303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.711,3111.996,What happened in Hayes?
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3113.931,3116.633,"--Sure, they took some statements."
1986.85-303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3118.149,3122.869,Statements that they might not have gotten if they'd have made a valid arrest.
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3122.869,3127.004,"--Of course, but they brought him down to the police station without probable cause."
1986.85-303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3136.094,3137.094,The difference here--
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3153.889,3161.726,"--Well, under that example, there's certainly no prohibition to arrest the fellow."
1986.85-303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3161.726,3166.463,"And then if the sergeant said, well, there's no use taking his palm print again; we've already got one."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3166.463,3169.315,"Well, see, but that's not the facts of our case."
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3188.377,3205.239,"Leaving aside the argument over whether you could take a palm print if you can take a fingerprint, assuming that they could take a palm print under a simple traffic violation arrest, really nothing happened to your client that couldn't lawfully be done to her?"
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3205.239,3206.472,In this case?
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3206.472,3214.344,"In fact... in fact, the police had the authority to arrest her on the traffic... on the parking warrant, and she was arrested."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3236.341,3237.474,Not really.
1986.85-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3261.973,3262.425,I understand.
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3270.162,3275.547,What we claim is that the palm print was the fruit of that illegal action.
1986.85-303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3289.374,3297.361,xxx you say that they couldn't have picked her up and brought her down on the parking ticket thing?
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3297.361,3298.277,Of course not.
1986.85-303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3298.611,3299.211,It was a bench warrant.
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3299.211,3300.396,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3300.396,3304.431,And they would have brought her to the same place and done the same thing.
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3304.431,3305.898,"No, Your Honor, they would not have."
1986.85-303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3305.898,3307.3,What would they have done with a bench warrant?
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3307.3,3312.454,"They would have taken her to her local precinct, which is just a few blocks from where she lives."
1986.85-303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3312.454,3313.037,Right.
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3313.037,3317.156,The would have filled out the form that they eventually filled out in this case.
1986.85-303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3317.156,3318.139,And taken a fingerprint.
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3318.139,3321.976,"Taken an index fingerprint, and allowed her to sit there until her relatives posted bond."
1986.85-303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3321.976,3324.226,"Well, the only difference... the only difference is they took her to a different station."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3324.226,3325.761,And they booked her for murder.
1986.85-303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3325.761,3333.432,"No, no, I'm talking about... they said they had no... you said they had no right to bring her there in the first place on a traffic ticket."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3333.432,3334.283,I'm saying--
1986.85-303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3334.283,3336.466,"It wasn't a traffic ticket, it was a bench warrant."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3336.466,3337.568,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3337.568,3339.77,"And for your information, those are different animals."
1986.85-303,1,31450,joseph_locascio,,3339.77,3340.553,I agree.
1986.85-303,2,16857,albert_a_riederer,,3434.147,3437.165,"Yes, Your Honor, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-303,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3507.995,3517.184,Can you tell us quickly why... what you have to support the proposition that the arrest was at least facially on the parking violation?
1986.85-303,2,16857,albert_a_riederer,,3517.184,3518.053,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3557.094,3560.88,"It's not clear that the Supreme Court of Missouri agreed with that, though, is it?"
1986.85-303,2,16857,albert_a_riederer,,3560.88,3563.082,The Supreme Court of Missouri apparently did not agree with that.
1986.85-303,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3565.95,3574.39,"So that even if we agree with you on the pretextual point, the most we could do is remand to the Supreme Court of Missouri to have them make clear how they come out on the other part."
1986.85-303,2,16857,albert_a_riederer,,3575.856,3578.007,"--I think that this Court should make the judgment, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3578.007,3581.792,"Thank you, Mr. Riederer."
1986.85-303,2,16857,albert_a_riederer,,3581.792,3581.942,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1986.85-303,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3581.942,3583.465,The case is submitted.
