2007.07-308,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.494,"We'll hear argument next in Case 07-308, United States versus Clintwood Elkhorn Mining Company."
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,11.633,22.691,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent sought and received a full refund of the tax they paid on exported coal for the full three-year period permitted them by the tax-refund statute."
2007.07-308,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,36.624,39.296,It might help if you raise that lectern a bit.
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,39.296,40.138,--Hang on.
2007.07-308,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,44.622,45.527,"Yes, thank you."
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,45.527,46.104,Thank you.
2007.07-308,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,66.097,76.844,"Mr. Jay, is the government running with the fox and chasing with the hounds?"
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,101.349,116.343,"Well, we think, Your Honor, that the interest provision is in fact a key part of the tax-refund statute and so Respondent's attempt to invoke the tax-refund judgment interest provision is inconsistent with their theory, that they're proceeding outside the scope of the tax--"
2007.07-308,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.343,123.338,"Oh, yes, they make the same mistake, but that doesn't justify your making the same, the same mistake."
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,123.338,124.259,"--Well, we think, Your Honor--"
2007.07-308,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.259,128.193,"I mean, it's either, you know, they're both in one pot or they're both in the other pot."
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,133.177,145.343,"--Well, we think the whole case is in the Title 26 pot, Your Honor, that the whole case should proceed under the provisions of Title 26, meaning that Respondents have already received the full tax refund to which they are entitled."
2007.07-308,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,205.599,207.943,Can you explain one thing to me?
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,219.922,221.217,That's right.
2007.07-308,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,221.217,224.184,"Now, what they want is they want three years before that."
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,224.184,224.921,That's right.
2007.07-308,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,224.921,227.105,And they're too late under Title 26.
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,232.431,237.321,"Well, on the interest, Your Honor, we're saying that they were entitled to the interest on the three years."
2007.07-308,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,237.321,241.131,I'm saying for three years they're home-free.
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,266.12,267.901,"It is the former, Your Honor--"
2007.07-308,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,267.901,268.525,Okay.
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,268.525,279.038,"--because we're saying that because Respondents waited for 21 years while paying the tax without... without filing a refund claim, that they're limited to the three years immediately preceding the refund claim--"
2007.07-308,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,279.038,279.506,Right.
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,290.082,290.752,--No.
2007.07-308,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,302.951,303.357,I see.
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,303.357,309.711,--then there is no provision in Title 28 or anywhere else that provides the required express provision--
2007.07-308,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,309.711,310.133,Right.
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,310.133,312.801,--of interest that's necessary to award interest against the government.
2007.07-308,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.801,313.144,Right.
2007.07-308,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,313.553,321.956,But why shouldn't it be a suit contesting the constitutionality?
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,348.582,375.683,"In the context of the coal tax, Your Honor, and the Export Clause claim, the purpose of requiring exhaustion, requiring Respondents to proceed before the IRS, is that the coal tax is exempt from taxation under the Constitution only if the coal at the moment the tax is imposed, which in this case is when it's first sold by the manufacturer, the mining company, if at that moment, the coal was in the stream of export."
2007.07-308,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.61,475.956,Plus interest.
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,475.956,477.781,"Plus interest, that's right, Your Honor."
2007.07-308,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,526.654,533.727,"Could the IRS say that the statute... or Congress, I guess, say the statute of limitations is one month?"
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,533.727,537.287,"To file a timely refund claim, Your Honor?"
2007.07-308,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,537.287,541.959,"Yes, and anything after that, any constitutional violation after that, is just not remediable?"
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,541.959,548.191,"Well, the constitutional violation would have taken place before in Your Honor's hypothetical."
2007.07-308,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,548.191,549.66,Five weeks before.
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,549.66,562.997,"In the McKesson case, Your Honor, the Court outlined a number of the options that taxing authorities have to respect their strong fiscal interest in the stability of their tax revenues while providing appropriate relief."
2007.07-308,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,572.82,575.428,We're talking about... we're talking about the Constitution here.
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,582.677,588.284,"--Well, Your Honor, in McKesson the Court pointed to another alternative, which is requiring that the tax be paid under protest."
2007.07-308,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,633.827,641.389,Do you think there are any circumstances in which a taxpayer can bring a claim under the Tucker Act for the refund of an unconstitutional tax?
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,641.389,651.977,"Well, we think... I want to clarify, Your Honor, that any lawsuit, whether it's on Respondent's theory or on our theory, any lawsuit that's filed is in fact under the Tucker Act."
2007.07-308,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,651.977,659.755,"Well, any situation in which such a suit can be brought without having filed a claim previously with the IRS?"
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,659.755,677.217,"If the only... if the only basis for the taxpayers' recovery is that the taxpayer has paid a tax and the tax was illegally or erroneously assessed because it was unconstitutional, we think that section 7422(a) and the associated time limits provide the procedure for recovering under the Tucker Act."
2007.07-308,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,687.025,690.257,"Just to be clear, so your argument is not limited to the Export Clause."
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,696.365,703.191,"--Well, the Congress has made no distinction in the statute between one type of constitutional claim and another, or indeed one type of illegality or another."
2007.07-308,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,741.364,746.296,"Do you know, what happened before the Tucker Act with inverse condemnation claims?"
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,761.915,773.879,"Before there was the Tucker Act, Your Honor, when the government took property and was obliged to pay compensation, the claim was presented to Congress; and Congress could legislative relief by a private bill."
2007.07-308,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,929.828,931.579,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.07-308,0,45148,william_m_jay,,931.579,932.703,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-308,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,932.703,936.594,Ms. Millett.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,936.594,958.864,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a question of statutory construction and the problem, as this Court's precedent has made clear in Enochs versus Williams Packing, is that if government... if the government wants to enjoy the special, extraordinary protections of the tax-refund scheme, it has to assert a plausible basis for tax liability."
2007.07-308,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,980.483,987.072,"Ms. Millett, if it was... if it was that obvious, why did it take so long for the coal companies to realize that the government owed them money?"
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,987.072,1000.237,"--Justice Stevens, that's because my clients are not Fortune 100 companies, and I don't think the Constitution or the Congress imposes a tax or tax code that require that sort of level of scrutiny."
2007.07-308,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1034.864,1040.332,"Were there any other cases where they said, well, it's not in the stream of commerce yet, and there was an intermediate broker, or anything like that?"
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1042.345,1063.09,"Justice Kennedy, there is a statutory definition, 26 U.S.C. 4221, that deals with stream of commerce and it mirrors this Court's decision in the A.G. Spalding case, which says that either the direct sales or if your manufacturer doesn't sell directly to the exporter or it has the broker, so one or two steps, is stream of commerce, and after that it's not going to be."
2007.07-308,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1072.428,1075.521,But in none of these cases did they have those sorts of problems?
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1075.521,1076.27,--Not in these cases.
2007.07-308,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1115.893,1134.01,"If 7422(a) had said any... any Internal Revenue tax, including a tax imposed in alleged violation of the Export Clause, that would cut... cut out the six-year statute of limitations, right?"
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1143.306,1146.429,I think it would clear up an awful lot.
2007.07-308,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1168.373,1181.463,"Nothing different from what it is now, but just Congress makes clear that a tax and alleged violation of the Export Clause falls within the term ""any Internal Revenue tax""?"
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1181.463,1193.13,"Then I think my position would be that it does not, because this Court has held for half a century without Congress changing it that any tax means a tax that the government asserts is valid."
2007.07-308,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1199.673,1204.248,I'm not certain it was valid if this coal was not shipped overseas.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1222.54,1226.646,"--The problem in this case, Justice Scalia, is that there were two statutes."
2007.07-308,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1251.322,1266.379,"Your point is that you don't have to go through the refund requirements of 7422 if the government was... although it did ask for the money as a tax, they are really out to lunch?"
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1322.637,1327.075,The authority is this Court's unanimous opinion in Enochs versus Williams--
2007.07-308,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1327.075,1327.637,Okay.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1327.637,1338.71,--which said that if... we are dealing with the same language... no suit shall be maintained for any tax in any court.
2007.07-308,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1347.41,1351.314,"What about the ""any sum"", ""in any manner""?"
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1352.534,1354.219,"Again, the key language--"
2007.07-308,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1354.219,1358.326,"""Any sum in any manner wrongfully collected. """
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1358.326,1358.75,--Right.
2007.07-308,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1393.733,1394.185,No.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1405.587,1414.241,This Court said in Enochs that you don't... that tax... the whole point of the Tax Exemption Act is to funnel everybody in for tax refund procedure.
2007.07-308,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1431.015,1436.202,"So why do you... I take it, though, that you concede the six-year statute of limitations under the Tucker Act, right?"
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1451.243,1451.805,--No.
2007.07-308,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1464.298,1465.643,Why aren't three years enough?
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1465.643,1466.252,--I'm sorry?
2007.07-308,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1466.252,1467.765,Why aren't three years enough?
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1467.765,1469.688,Because it's a question of statutory construction.
2007.07-308,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1479.448,1486.307,"So... so, the rhetoric in your brief how this is a constitutionally based prohibition is not pertinent?"
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1492.351,1498.817,"We don't... to the Export Clause, right, distinguishes between three years and six years in its own right."
2007.07-308,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1516.356,1521.153,"Why is the Export Clause so, so significant?"
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1548.343,1558.121,--Because we don't... under the Constitution the government hasn't done anything wrong unless... until... unless and until it actually effects a taking and doesn't pay for it through process.
2007.07-308,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1592.373,1594.526,Volenti non fit injuria.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1620.844,1627.672,Congress eliminated in the early 1920s any prepayment protest requirement under the tax law.
2007.07-308,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1641.211,1644.178,I'm not saying it has to be made at the moment they pay their taxes.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1652.239,1652.691,That's right.
2007.07-308,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1680.631,1682.647,I thought you didn't have to pay--
2007.07-308,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1682.647,1684.367,Here there was a payment.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1684.367,1685.194,Yes.
2007.07-308,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1685.194,1689.397,It's different than if you try to enjoin the collection at the outset.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1689.397,1690.068,It's only--
2007.07-308,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1690.068,1691.784,So that argument doesn't work.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1691.784,1704.687,"--It's only different in the sense that government's interests are less, and the government's interests are most acute in having people pointed to the tax-refund scheme, this Court has said time and again, before... to pay first and fight later."
2007.07-308,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1707.841,1709.042,"--Well, what about the deficiency procedure?"
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1718.585,1721.303,--There... there's nowhere for them to go for this particular tax.
2007.07-308,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1722.976,1723.693,Why not?
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1723.693,1727.488,Because tax court doesn't apply to excise taxes for the most part.
2007.07-308,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1743.032,1747.309,"Well, but if we... if we accept your view in this case, they can go in a district court and enjoin them."
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1750.355,1752.136,--The... the--
2007.07-308,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1752.136,1755.993,And... which is just what Justice Ginsburg's questions point out.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1761.429,1764.147,--I--
2007.07-308,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1764.147,1766.05,So it seems to me there is a distinction.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1768.69,1769.131,--I know.
2007.07-308,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1769.63,1772.222,If they tried... if they tried... do you think they could enjoin the collection of a tax refund?
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1772.222,1790.963,"--No, they couldn't because in addition to showing the government's imposition of the tax is legally indefensible, you still have to show entitlement to an injunction, and unless you can establish irreparable harm just by paying money, which I'm not aware of any coal company that could have, you could have gotten an injunction."
2007.07-308,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1791.416,1794.087,"But, I mean, in your argument you say it is absolutely... that it doesn't apply."
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1795.195,1797.71,--You can't get an injunction just because something is unlawful.
2007.07-308,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1801.473,1804.803,"Well, then we'll invent the hypothetical company that is going to go broke and all that stuff."
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1804.803,1806.534,"But I mean, it's not a question of inventing."
2007.07-308,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1832.65,1833.617,But you can't have it both ways.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1838.07,1838.881,--It's the government that--
2007.07-308,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1838.881,1842.863,"And the same with your answer, what I thought was your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question."
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1842.863,1844.988,--It's the government that wants to have it both ways.
2007.07-308,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1856.67,1860.371,"In looking at your argument, I see it now, I think, if I'm right."
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1924.612,1932.953,"I have two responses: One, it's going to have far less effect on this situation, in the post-payment situation, than it did in Enochs, where it wasn't limited to the Export Clause."
2007.07-308,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2015.278,2024.555,"--What do you want to do about your argument, as I hear it, has nothing to do with the nature of the claim that you're asserting to get the money back."
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2055.966,2058.59,"--I'm not saying that ""any tax"" means anything different."
2007.07-308,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2061.273,2077.362,"Well, if it doesn't mean anything different and then if the very far-out claim to a tax is so far out it isn't a tax, that would be true in the regulation context, in the statutory context as well as the constitutional context."
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2079.208,2085.313,"--No, because you have to have a money-mandating claim under the Constitution to fall within the Tucker Act."
2007.07-308,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2135.024,2137.041,But you're saying it's both.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2177.432,2187.833,"--One can get... there is nothing in the tax administrative scheme where one when shows up to file a tax refund where you say if I go by this route, I'm waiving all others."
2007.07-308,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2194.002,2201.78,"In other words, what were you just telling us is that this is not a refund claim; this is a constitutional claim."
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2210.792,2214.103,--It's a constitutional claim to get your tax money back.
2007.07-308,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2222.693,2224.035,Plus you get interest.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2224.035,2225.193,--Yes.
2007.07-308,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2228.192,2231.456,You're saying you get interest too in either way.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2250.181,2250.602,--Right.
2007.07-308,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2290.994,2293.213,Is the interest the same in amount in either case?
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2293.213,2301.632,"Yes, because in 2411 it cross-references the... well, let me clarify."
2007.07-308,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2308.222,2314.391,2411... 2411 is what you use in the court when you have a straight tax refund claim.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2344.987,2351.03,--This is all on page 4a of the Government's brief if you want to see where it cross-references the Internal Revenue interest provisions.
2007.07-308,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2357.703,2365.369,"But... the use of any Internal Revenue tax, and your whole argument is this isn't an Internal Revenue tax."
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2377.66,2380.113,"--I'm sorry, I misunderstood your question, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-308,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2422.676,2436.934,"But you don't agree in your basic claim that if the government is treating it as an Internal Revenue tax, which it certainly didn't, you'd say that works only for the interest, not--"
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2436.934,2437.638,--Only... I'm sorry.
2007.07-308,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2533.847,2537.034,You give all of this up when it comes to the statute of limitations.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2560.118,2564.568,"But the Tucker Act doesn't use the word ""any tax"" in defining the statute of limitations."
2007.07-308,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2587.338,2600.037,We say just as unanimously a couple of things last year on... term as well in Jencks and certainly the Federal circuit's decision wouldn't have come out the same if they had had Hinck's term of trust on the books.
2007.07-308,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2600.037,2603.099,--I'm not sure... I'm not sure it would have come out differently.
2007.07-308,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2749.849,2751.491,"Thank you, Ms. Millett."
2007.07-308,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2754.427,2767.327,"--Mr. Jay, I hope in the 15 minutes, you will state what the government's position is on this Enochs case that's been mentioned at least a dozen times."
2007.07-308,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2767.327,2768.856,"I'll be glad to, Your Honor."
2007.07-308,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2816.259,2818.445,Wait what very narrow exception?
2007.07-308,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2819.931,2834.219,"--As the Court was preserving, I think, in dicta, though, because... because the Court ultimately denied the exception in that case and in each case since, preserving the holding in Standard Nut and Margarine, a case from the 1920's."
2007.07-308,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2897.126,2899.517,Don't the two go together?
2007.07-308,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2904.671,2918.792,"Well, if you can satisfy the requirements for injunctive relief... and Williams Packing, the taxpayer, couldn't; and in the cases since the taxpayer couldn't... then the court can enjoin the collection of the taxes applied to you."
2007.07-308,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2918.792,2921.07,"Well, that's what she is saying."
2007.07-308,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2935.938,2938.313,I think I have three responses to that.
2007.07-308,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.909,2977.64,"Well, you could say the same about the tax on oleomargarine."
2007.07-308,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2990.59,3018.031,"--But if one of these coal companies had sought to enjoin the tax, the government would have pointed to the provision in Williams Packing that says that whether the tax is defensible is to be determined on the basis of the information available to the government at the time of suit until the taxpayer demonstrates that the coal is actually in the stream of export, which is precisely what's done during the refund process that the taxpayers used in this case to show that their coal was in the stream of export when they obtained the refund."
2007.07-308,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3116.6,3117.192,Right.
2007.07-308,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3140.949,3145.027,"I don't think that we need to go beyond the first clause, Your Honor."
2007.07-308,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3145.027,3147.98,"So when I decide this case, I should forget the words ""any sum""?"
2007.07-308,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3147.98,3160.847,"I mean the Court construed a similar provision in Flora versus United States in 1960, which explained that ""any sum"" is a cumulative provision."
2007.07-308,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3169.157,3177.343,"But it means that if, in fact, it is not within the scope of the word ""tax"", then it is not within ""any sum""?"
2007.07-308,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3177.343,3178.357,No.
2007.07-308,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3188.086,3200.049,"In Enochs... she is quite right, your opposing lawyer... it says the exaction is merely in the guise of a tax."
2007.07-308,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3231.21,3238.689,"Well, my specific response, Your Honor, first is that in this case the tax simply was not in the guise of a tax."
2007.07-308,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3416.648,3417.21,"Thank you, counsel."
