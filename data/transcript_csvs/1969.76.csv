1969.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.925,"Number 76, Welsh against the United States."
1969.76,0,33293,j_b_tietz,,9.724,12.656,Mr. Chief Justice and gentlemen of the Court.
1969.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,529.782,536.122,"Counsel, may I suggest to you that you used about one-third of your time and really haven't got to the issue yet."
1969.76,0,33293,j_b_tietz,,541.044,550.169,And the point I may make turn back now is that he has exactly the same situation as Seeger did.
1969.76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.565,568.052,Was this one of the questions you present here?
1969.76,0,33293,j_b_tietz,,568.052,584.627,"The three that there's a constitutional point, that there is a security questionnaire point and that the man meet the base of all have been briefs that this point I'm arguing now that he qualifies has been briefed thoroughly and curiously enough."
1969.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,680.804,691.329,"Well, are you arguing now that his -- the case is based on religious belief and conviction or that it is not and it doesn't make any difference?"
1969.76,0,33293,j_b_tietz,,691.329,695.809,"I say both of them, but I'm arguing now the former for this reason."
1969.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,816.942,818.334,Thank you.
1969.76,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,825.473,828.314,May it please the Court.
1969.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1058.978,1072.814,"But before you do Mr. Solicitor General, if this man had come within the statute as defined in Seeger, what would've happen to him?"
1969.76,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1082.329,1102.267,"If his draft board had found that he team within the statute and there was not evidence on which it could have found otherwise, then he would've been entitled to one or the other of two classifications either 1-A-O or 1-O."
1969.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1134.157,1146.957,And are they assigned either 1-A-O or 1-O and obligated to serve at the same point in time as they would've been obligated to serve in the military at the remaining 1-A?
1969.76,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1146.957,1148.842,"Yes exactly, Mr. Justice."
1969.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1157.462,1158.912,But assuming he'd otherwise have been a --
1969.76,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1158.912,1181.12,"(Voice Overlap) 3 for independency but if they get classified 1-A then they can contend that they are entitled to 1-O or 1-A-O Indeed, they can contend for that before they are classified 1-A, and if they are so classified, they are ordered to serve but in the alternative capacities."
1969.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1186.779,1203.092,And there is no exemption statutory or regulatory -- no exemptions from all together from compulsory service for one who would be in 1-A except that he is a conscientious objector as defined by the (Voice Overlap)?
1969.76,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1203.092,1204.33,"No, Mr. Justice."
1969.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1558.967,1562.589,I don't find that in my record.
1969.76,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1562.589,1574.483,"It's a -- has a great cover like all government documents, it is called the supplement to brief for the United States and I hope that it is made --"
1969.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1574.483,1576.599,The supplement is in the supplement.
1969.76,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1576.599,1581.641,It's called supplement to brief for the United States.
1969.76,2,33293,j_b_tietz,,2790.413,2806.012,It's my belief that Seeger definitely decided the question that there is to be no distinction between internally derived belief and external derived belief.
1969.76,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2838.821,2840.646,"I think we'll hear you that if you stay closer to the mike, Mr. Tietz."
1969.76,2,33293,j_b_tietz,,2840.646,2842.372,"Oh, sorry."
1969.76,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3050.431,3052.039,That comes pretty close to saying --
1969.76,2,33293,j_b_tietz,,3052.039,3052.669,I beg your pardon?
1969.76,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3052.669,3066.301,That comes pretty close to saying Judge Hamley's opinion helped the petitioner understand the basis of his claim?
1969.76,2,33293,j_b_tietz,,3066.301,3070.305,"Oh, the cart is before the horse, Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.76,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3070.305,3077.673,But you just suggested I thought I misunderstood you that he didn't articulate this position till after he had read Judge Hamley's opinion?
1969.76,2,33293,j_b_tietz,,3077.673,3079.174,"No, no and that's why I used the --"
1969.76,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3079.174,3080.128,"Well, then I did misunderstand."
1969.76,2,33293,j_b_tietz,,3080.128,3082.77,-- a rather crude expression that cart before the house.
