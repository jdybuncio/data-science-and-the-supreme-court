2008.07-1223,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.635,"We'll hear argument next in Case 07-1223, Bell versus Kelly."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,6.57,21.163,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The problem at the heart of this case is construing subsections (d) and (e) of 28 U.S.C. 2254 together in a way that makes sense."
2008.07-1223,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,62.74,66.208,"Mr. Bress, before we get into that, could I just ask you a threshold question?"
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,89.391,90.158,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,99.647,103.983,I didn't hear the -- the last part.
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,103.983,109.887,"--The State court refused to permit the evidence to be fully developed, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,111.787,112.606,What do you mean by that?
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,114.489,119.827,"Specifically, Your Honor, the State provided 120 days to develop the State habeas petition."
2008.07-1223,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,153.098,158.135,But that really does not present the question that you asked the Court to decide.
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,158.135,164.206,"--Well, Your Honor, if you read it that way, it would not, but I don't read the question presented that way."
2008.07-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,209.67,213.639,Why wouldn't he have brought that new evidence to the attention of the State court first?
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,216.824,218.859,"He didn't have the new evidence, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,218.859,223.578,"Well, he could have a post-conviction proceeding in the State court."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,223.578,224.596,"Actually, no, he couldn't, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,224.596,225.362,A State habeas.
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,225.362,225.979,I'm sorry.
2008.07-1223,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,242.474,248.128,"Well, weren't the facts merely cumulative evidence of his claim that was before the State court?"
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,248.128,249.928,"No, they weren't, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,319.224,323.776,"Well, I think that supports my suggestion, which is that the evidence was cumulative."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,328.497,336.084,"Well, it's not more evidence, Your Honor; it's just that a dispute over the facts where credibility is at issue shouldn't be decided on the papers."
2008.07-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,336.084,346.041,"But the Virginia Supreme Court, on habeas, said we are going to accept as true all the facts as the Petitioner alleged them."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,352.945,357.183,"And if they had done that, Your Honor, I think that we'd be in a different position."
2008.07-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,357.183,358.933,They said they did.
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,358.933,376.745,"They said, on the one hand, they did, and yet, on the other hand, when they were looking, for example, at Joanne Nicholson's testimony, they said she could have been effectively impeached by other statements that she had made, that in their household, she had never seen Bell be physically abusive to her daughter."
2008.07-1223,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,404.062,416.555,"Well, your argument is dependent on the proposition that the claim that was advanced in the Federal habeas proceeding is a different claim from a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in the State court?"
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,416.555,417.072,"That's right, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,417.072,449.526,"And if that's the case, I don't understand why your adversary is not correct that it will always be possible in capital cases for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim that has been adjudicated on the merits in the State court to be advanced and get de novo review in Federal habeas, where every aspect of the defendant's life that is potentially favorable can be advanced as a basis for mitigation."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,466.488,476.01,"I'd like to answer that question, Justice Alito, in two ways: One very practical, which is that the Ninth and Tenth Circuits have adopted the rule that we advocated for years."
2008.07-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,503.244,515.902,I don't get the diligence part because the whole ineffective assistance of counsel is the client isn't expected to do any of this; it's counsel that's been ineffective.
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,515.902,521.471,"--Your Honor, I'm referring to Michael Williams, which talks about diligence by the State habeas counsel."
2008.07-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,521.471,537.315,"So, it doesn't translate into ineffective assistance of counsel because the client is not the one -- the lawyer has been -- has not been diligent, but there is nothing that the client could do."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,539.167,539.583,Well--
2008.07-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,539.583,550.391,--how you could talk about the diligent -- the diligent client bringing up the ineffectiveness of his lawyer.
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,550.391,571.721,"--Your Honor, we understand and appreciate the diligence of habeas counsel is not any kind of excuse and can't be -- statutorily it can't be, actually under 2554, but what we are talking about is whether the prisoner and his counsel were diligent in seeking to develop the facts for their claim when they were on State habeas."
2008.07-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,612.215,622.071,"But you use the -- to say that it's a new claim, because that's what it has to be, right, but it's such an extraordinary use of ""claim""."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,636.081,643.834,"Your Honor, I appreciate that it's not ""claim"" as it's used ordinarily in the Rules of Civil Procedure or when you're talking about making claims in that sort of a complaint."
2008.07-1223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,664.664,665.933,All right.
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,667.802,668.452,Yes.
2008.07-1223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,668.452,674.939,"And it seems to me that the way it's supposed to work -- have you read, by the way, the facts of the case for December in Bell v. Cohen?"
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,761.292,762.561,"Okay, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,780.773,781.773,That's the first step.
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,784.141,784.791,--Right.
2008.07-1223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,818.998,824.885,"Well, why wouldn't you say right off the bat, new claim, go present it to the State court, and exhausts it?"
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,824.885,827.004,Well this couldn't have been presented in the State court.
2008.07-1223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,827.004,827.42,Why not?
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,827.42,832.538,"Well as the State argued below, it would have been procedurally deficient."
2008.07-1223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,832.538,832.822,"No, no, no."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,855.487,880.369,"Well, Your Honor, according to the warden at least, in this case if you took let's say the facts of Banks v Dretke, which this Court decided, where when you were in front of the State court, what you knew was that the girlfriend of the prisoner had said that one of the witnesses was particularly close to law enforcement, and on that basis they made a claim, a Brady claim in State court."
2008.07-1223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,898.349,906.603,"Well, you must have been assuming then that the State would not give that person a -- a new opportunity to consider the new evidence."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,906.603,909.805,"--Well, that's absolutely true here as well, Your Honor, the state statute--"
2008.07-1223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,909.805,910.855,Suppose it were really new.
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,910.855,912.59,--The State statute is unequivocal.
2008.07-1223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,912.59,921.094,"Yes, but so is it in Tennessee, and in Tennessee there is an exception where you could bring the thing up because you couldn't possibly have gotten hold of it."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,921.094,922.863,"Your Honor, there is no exception here in Virginia."
2008.07-1223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,922.863,939.49,"So in Virginia a person discovers for the first time, 140 days later looks at the D.A.'s files, and discovers something that shows the whole trial was a farce -- I mean, something unbelievable, and there is no way for the person under Virginia law to bring that up in a State court?"
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,939.49,940.724,Not in this sort of a claim.
2008.07-1223,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,942.474,954.365,"Mr. Bress, your -- you're argument that this can't be brought up assumes that it is a new claim rather than the same claim, right?"
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,961.553,966.172,"If it's the same claim for 2254(d) purposes, yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,966.172,966.539,Right.
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,982.384,983.734,"Yes, it did, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,988.121,997.311,"And if fact you got more than you were entitled to, because it did look at the new evidence, albeit through the guise of deference, but it shouldn't have even looked at that at all."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,997.311,997.894,Your Honor.
2008.07-1223,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1004.464,1014.42,"So if we think that they were right -- and we are, I think we are getting away from the question presented -- if we agree that they are right, that this is the same claim and it's just additional evidence, then you lose."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,1014.42,1016.856,"--No, not necessarily, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1031.298,1033.65,"--Mr. Bress, may I ask you a question--"
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,1033.65,1034.4,And if that's true--
2008.07-1223,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1034.4,1040.887,"--May I ask you a question which sort of goes to the utility of raising that issue here, and it's a preliminary, not a doctrinal question."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,1041.337,1041.821,--Sure.
2008.07-1223,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1041.821,1057.349,"--my understanding is that in the United States District Court on the Federal habe -- the district court made a -- drew a conclusion based on the evidence before it, no deference to the State court, that in fact your client did not demonstrate prejudice."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,1066.988,1076.91,"Your Honor, what the district court found, as the Fourth Circuit saw it and as we see it, was that the State court's finding of prejudice was not unreasonable."
2008.07-1223,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1085.0,1085.283,No.
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,1085.283,1124.827,"However, when you look at what the State court wrote in its written ruling, what it says is there is a colorable claim that the State court was unreasonable, on -- in application of law to the facts and development of the facts, and then it said that they will -- that the court would not decide this issue yet, until it has a hearing; and so the Fourth Circuit looked at what the district court wrote and presumed that consistent with what it had written, it then confronted this issue, the issue of reasonability, orally; and it didn't require that when a judge is saying something orally, as opposed to putting it in a written opinion, that it dot every i and cross every t."
2008.07-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1131.481,1134.183,I that what it was saying is there is legitimate -- this is a Strickland question.
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,1182.246,1185.714,"Your Honor, consistent with the Fourth Circuit, we don't read him to say that."
2008.07-1223,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1204.259,1205.442,"Oh, that may be."
2008.07-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.383,1219.602,"Mr. Bress, this case involves Section 2254(d), right?"
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,1222.787,1224.739,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1224.739,1226.356,"I mean, it's a central thing the case is about."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,1235.547,1250.823,"If I may return to the Chief Judge's -- Chief Justice's question from earlier, there are other new claims, new facts here that are equally important in deciding whether this is a new claim."
2008.07-1223,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1256.294,1263.031,"I know, but they're -- your underlying theory is that if you get a lot of new evidence, that somehow changes the claim."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,1288.229,1291.115,"--Mr. Chief Justice, two responses to this."
2008.07-1223,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1334.127,1337.745,"All right, well just -- we've got two but just to stop you on one."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,1351.237,1365.829,"Well, if what they are talking about is -- if that includes the ability when you are in State court -- assume, for instance, House versus Bell, just if can take that as an example."
2008.07-1223,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1367.014,1368.514,I've gotten over it.
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,1368.514,1382.708,"I don't know, but if we can -- if we can just look at the facts of that case briefly: Assume that in State court, despite diligent a effort, they were able to come up with some of the evidence but not all of the evidence that they later came up with in terms of the blood spattering, the DNA, and such."
2008.07-1223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1415.679,1418.714,"I might say the new claim -- okay, so it's a new claim."
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,1473.148,1473.731,"Well, Your Honor--"
2008.07-1223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1473.731,1475.983,I mean that's not an obvious answer to that one.
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,1475.983,1480.62,"--I -- I think that in -- in that case, by the way, you still have to defer to the State factfinding."
2008.07-1223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1483.822,1488.374,What it's going to do is it's going to be finding facts on the basis of certain evidence.
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,1503.368,1512.073,"Well, I think that, again, you have to defer under (e)(1) presumably to particular fact findings and find that by clear and convincing evidence you've disproved those facts."
2008.07-1223,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1584.852,1586.721,May I just ask one quick question?
2008.07-1223,0,38746,richard_p_bress,,1600.128,1600.797,"--That's precisely it, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1601.863,1603.23,"Thank you, Mr. Bress."
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,1609.967,1624.409,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The claim in Bell's case is the textbook example of a claim that the effective death penalty intended for 2254(d) to apply to."
2008.07-1223,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1747.957,1771.49,"Well, what about the point that Mr. Bress made that there wasn't enough time in the Virginia Supreme Court on habeas to develop everything that was later put before the district court; that there was a very short time to get the petition in, and there were many issues other than ineffective assistance of counsel?"
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,1771.49,1779.31,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, there were approximately 12 issues in this case that the district court disposed of in a very lengthy opinion."
2008.07-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1808.179,1810.865,Did he make any request from the State court for more time?
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,1810.865,1814.317,"Your Honor, I don't -- I don't--"
2008.07-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1814.317,1815.317,Your brother is nodding yes.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,1815.317,1823.606,"--He may very well have, but the point is that there was nothing that he presented to the Federal court that he didn't also present to the State court."
2008.07-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1848.771,1855.975,If we had -- if we had -- and I -- I emphasize I'm -- I'm not suggesting this is your case.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,1911.645,1929.339,--I think my answer to that has to be that it depends because the statute before the effective Death Penalty Act in 1996 had clearly had what we would call the Chandler v. Dane factors in which would you look at the adequacy of a State court process.
2008.07-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1946.468,1978.772,"But if you don't -- I guess what I'm getting at is if we don't in that circumstance recognize that there is a legitimately different claim which is not, for the reason I suggested to Mr. Bress, not subject to further exhaustion requirements because they tried and the State court wouldn't let them do it -- if we don't in that case recognize that there is a claim that can be litigated in the Federal court, which will not be subject to deference to State court findings, then there is a very clear hole in the law, and I assume Congress didn't mean to leave it."
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,1985.962,1993.866,"--Justice Souter, we don't believe so and here's why: Because it is true, Congress did not change the procedural default doctrine."
2008.07-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2017.614,2019.683,I think you're right in the main.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2079.922,2083.459,Justice Souter -- and I agree that's not this case.
2008.07-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2116.18,2120.815,"But I don't, I don't think this Court understood the implication of it when you get into the Brady issue."
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2127.303,2132.122,--And I -- I agree with Your Honor that it's not this case.
2008.07-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2144.047,2145.264,I understand your position.
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2145.264,2147.966,I'm still trying to understand the statute.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2177.235,2179.901,"--Well, what I'm saying--"
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2179.901,2186.257,"You mean you're saying that (d)(2), ""unreasonable determination of the facts"", means the factual outcome."
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2194.178,2194.947,"--Well, no."
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2195.53,2196.047,No?
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2197.981,2205.468,"--I believe that (d)(2) very clearly -- yes, I think I'm agreeing with you that (d)(2) addresses the actual facts which underlay the State court decision."
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2205.468,2207.484,And not whether their procedures are correct?
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2207.484,2207.818,Correct.
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2207.818,2208.251,Okay.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2208.251,2208.67,Correct.
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2208.67,2209.103,Okay.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2232.618,2238.355,"Justice Breyer, I'm not sure they they've argued those exceptions (a)(2) at (i) and (ii)."
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2239.572,2241.557,They're arguing due diligence.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2241.557,2248.711,--My reading of their brief is they are saying: We are Michael Williams and all Michael Williams dealt with was the opening sentence of (e)(2).
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2248.711,2249.794,(I).
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2251.461,2252.413,Of (e)(2).
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2252.413,2253.779,--(E)(2).
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2253.779,2255.631,"""If the applicant has failed to develop. """
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2260.167,2260.519,Okay.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2317.038,2319.005,"Yes, Your Honor, and this Court has recognized that--"
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2319.005,2320.473,"No matter what, it's goodbye?"
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2320.473,2325.811,"--Yes, and here's why: Because Virginia has twin statutes that would bar any further applications to State court."
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2332.531,2332.948,No excuse?
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2333.481,2333.915,--That's correct.
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2333.915,2334.4,--Okay.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2334.4,2335.183,And this Court has--
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2335.183,2338.269,"So they are right about, they are right about the exhaustion being futile."
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2338.269,2340.435,"--It is defaulted, yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2350.91,2359.515,"The first time he discovers DNA evidence in the DA's file that shows he couldn't have done it, there is no way to get relief under Virginia law?"
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2359.515,2360.415,Not in State court.
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2360.415,2361.615,Not in State court.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2361.615,2361.967,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2361.967,2363.234,"Okay, then they're right about that."
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2363.234,2364.034,That's correct.
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2375.525,2378.144,"Okay, then let me ask you on the merits."
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2391.737,2394.17,That's not this case.
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2401.759,2402.209,Okay.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2406.996,2407.796,"--Well, I think not."
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2407.796,2408.896,But there's certainly an argument--
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2408.896,2409.865,The argument is--
2008.07-1223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2409.865,2412.583,"--If it's really a new claim, you're going to say they applied--"
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2412.583,2427.16,"--Well, our argument is that, Court, don't use this case to say that, because if the Court uses this case to say that it will be putting its imprimatur on what the district court did in holding a hearing when we don't think it was appropriate."
2008.07-1223,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2427.16,2432.112,"The Fourth Circuit -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but the Fourth Circuit didn't decide that question either."
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2432.112,2432.731,They did not.
2008.07-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2436.266,2440.3,"How do you want us to dispose of the case that doesn't, that doesn't do that?"
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2442.502,2447.371,--I think the Court could dismiss this as improvidently granted.
2008.07-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2447.371,2448.206,That's it?
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2448.206,2450.106,I think the Court could do that.
2008.07-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2450.106,2456.429,"May I ask you, so I understand your position on the underlying question if we don't dismiss."
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2467.385,2473.539,"Justice Stevens, there was never any showing, there was never any showing of diligence."
2008.07-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2473.539,2475.241,Why did the -- why did the Federal court grant a hearing?
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2475.241,2480.878,The Federal court simply announced that he was going to hold a hearing on this claim and decide later--
2008.07-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2480.878,2487.782,Wasn't he only entitled to do that on the basis of a showing that there was more evidence that the State court did not consider?
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2487.782,2488.515,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2490.567,2503.724,"So maybe the district court was dead wrong, but the assumption I think we made when we took the case was that there was a body of evidence that had not been available in the State proceeding that might be available in the Federal proceeding."
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2503.724,2505.076,--I think that was the misunderstanding.
2008.07-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2505.076,2508.461,And if that were true -- I know you disagree with that and I understand your argument.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2523.471,2529.625,The way I read the statute is that that is the first thing that the judge was required to do.
2008.07-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2534.013,2534.613,All right.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2544.534,2549.836,"He can -- I think -- I think then we are talking about what I was just saying, new facts, new claims."
2008.07-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2549.836,2550.319,That's what we're talking about.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2551.104,2560.977,"And then the judge has to go through the determination, before he can decide whether he can look at it, of whether these new facts or new claims meet cause and prejudice or actual innocence."
2008.07-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2560.977,2561.227,All right.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2573.867,2577.671,I don't think just -- I do not believe the judge can do that--
2008.07-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2577.671,2579.121,Then what's the point--
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2579.121,2583.909,"--just simply to say I'm going to look at just the correctness of the decision first, and then decide whether it's correct."
2008.07-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2583.909,2586.444,--What you're saying is the correctness of decision based on the State court record.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2593.198,2602.787,"Well, I think it is, unless -- unless there are actually new matters that are presented to the Federal court that the Federal court now is going to--"
2008.07-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.787,2603.822,It's the same claim.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2603.822,2604.722,--Yes.
2008.07-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2605.639,2609.107,Then it seems to me the statute has constructed a pointless procedure.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2609.107,2612.242,"Your Honor, I -- I don't see that at all."
2008.07-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2629.788,2649.034,"Why shouldn't the district judge in light of the new evidence decide whether the judgment of the State court was -- would have been reasonable if it came out the same way, including this new evidence in the -- in the consideration?"
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2650.184,2652.636,"--It could do that, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2652.636,2653.103,I know it could.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2654.421,2658.89,I think -- I think that doesn't really fit with the statute -- with the statutory language.
2008.07-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2658.89,2662.861,"Well, it seems to me the statute certainly contemplates that the States have the first--"
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2662.861,2663.927,Yes.
2008.07-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2663.927,2665.896,"--the first cut at this thing, right?"
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2667.679,2667.963,Yes.
2008.07-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2700.534,2702.069,So the Federal court is supposed to do what?
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2702.069,2710.842,"The Federal court is supposed to first look at the claim that was presented to the State court, under 2254(d), and the claimants before it."
2008.07-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2721.214,2721.816,Okay.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2721.816,2722.2,Okay.
2008.07-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2735.207,2748.633,"Now -- but the road map that you are now saying could be followed is the same road map implied by -- in your earlier answer to Justice Scalia, your reference to the new claim as being a defaulted claim."
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2748.633,2749.133,Yes.
2008.07-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2749.133,2765.327,"But we are concerned -- I think we are all concerned with the -- with the claim in which it is not defaulted, in the sense that he is at fault in any way for failing to get it into the Federal court -- I'm sorry -- get his entire presentation now into the State court then."
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2796.781,2807.256,"If implicit in your question is -- yes, implicit in your question is that the Petitioner has demonstrated cause; and he may or may not have depending on the facts."
2008.07-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2807.256,2811.473,"Well, he -- I agree with you on the -- on the cause part; but the -- up to this point."
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2833.989,2834.639,It may be.
2008.07-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2837.625,2839.458,--I'm -- I'm not asking to you stipulate--
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2839.458,2840.143,Right.
2008.07-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2840.143,2840.877,--that it's this case.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2842.845,2843.295,It may be.
2008.07-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2843.295,2853.05,"If that is -- this Court -- that's why I'm saying it's a very established law as to what cause is, and external impediments."
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2904.583,2908.371,And that may -- and that may very well constitute an external impediment--
2008.07-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2908.371,2908.987,--Okay.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2908.987,2910.304,--to him being able to present it.
2008.07-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.304,2918.643,"Having established cause, he would then in your view not have the Federal court decide the matter de novo."
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2923.214,2924.464,Correct.
2008.07-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2924.464,2934.854,"That is to say, whether -- but for the error, any reasonable factfinder would find by clear and convincing evidence that he was innocent--"
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2934.854,2935.371,Correct.
2008.07-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2935.371,2935.821,--right?
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2935.821,2936.788,Correct.
2008.07-1223,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2937.306,2943.544,In that instance is there room for the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing?
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2943.544,2947.829,"--Well, I think then you get -- that's -- I think it's actually a separate matter."
2008.07-1223,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2969.26,2993.477,"Can you envisage circumstances in which an ineffective counsel assistance, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim was presented in the State court and then there is a second ineffective assistance in counsel's claims or a further supplemental ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on new evidence that the district court might hear?"
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,2994.643,2996.512,"I think it can happen, certainly."
2008.07-1223,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3009.987,3022.912,"So you think there could be instances, we might imagine, in which there could be two ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the second of which could be heard in the district court with evidentiary -- with an evidentiary hearing?"
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,3022.912,3024.346,I think it's certainly possible.
2008.07-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3034.554,3042.624,"I guess the State court can say, you know, 60 days after the trial is -- is doomsday."
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,3057.25,3059.085,"Well, no, Your Honor, I don't believe it is."
2008.07-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.971,3063.804,Right.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,3106.4,3106.766,Right.
2008.07-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3117.374,3118.591,That's the fallacy in my -- in my reasoning.
2008.07-1223,1,33768,katherine_burnett,,3129.016,3129.699,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3139.454,3142.387,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1223,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3142.387,3144.056,I'd like to start where--
2008.07-1223,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3144.056,3146.191,You have three minutes remaining.
2008.07-1223,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3146.191,3147.308,--I'd like to start where the General left off.
2008.07-1223,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3238.551,3243.521,What is the test for determining whether the addition of new evidence is sufficient to make it a new claim?
2008.07-1223,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3243.521,3250.525,"Your Honor, I think the test really ought to be whether an objectively reasonable jurist could find it important in the overall mix of information."
2008.07-1223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3268.97,3270.339,"It's a materiality standard, really."
2008.07-1223,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3270.339,3271.189,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3271.189,3281.646,"So, it's a new claim if it is one on which you would have prevailed, but it's the same claim if the result would be the same."
2008.07-1223,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3281.646,3284.514,"I don't -- I don't think it necessarily has to be that way, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3323.806,3328.46,"Well, you know, it does read -- 2254(e) -- it does read,"
2008.07-1223,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3339.249,3349.957,"And I agree completely, Your Honor, that (e) says you can hear it, but the Attorney General says you can't because under (d), she'd say, you'd already be foreclose because the State court has already adjudicated your claim on the merits--"
2008.07-1223,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3349.957,3351.007,I think she said--
2008.07-1223,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3351.007,3351.774,--and these new facts don't count.
2008.07-1223,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3351.774,3359.313,--she answered -- the answer that I wrote is the same thing that you could have on the Brady claim you could also have for ineffective assistance of counsel.
2008.07-1223,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3363.299,3369.352,"Your Honor, I think she said that what you would have to look for, I think, is whether ""wholly new matter"" means ""new evidence""."
2008.07-1223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3389.416,3397.688,"Mr. Bress, I want to apologize to you for accusing you of not printing 2254(d) and (e) in your brief."
2008.07-1223,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3398.338,3399.824,"Well, thank you, Your Honor."
2008.07-1223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3400.307,3402.759,I'm grateful for your not throwing it in my teeth.
2008.07-1223,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3404.108,3405.108,"Thank you, counsel."
