1979.65_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,57.768,We will hear arguments next in Texas v. New Mexico.
1979.65_orig,0,20658,douglas_g_caroom,,61.398,65.177,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.65_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,123.94,127.838,"We have never adopted it either, have we?"
1979.65_orig,0,20658,douglas_g_caroom,,127.838,128.996,You have not adopted it.
1979.65_orig,1,40584,richard_a_simms,,1528.027,1531.369,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.65_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1763.793,1765.624,Alamogordo is up by Fort Sumner?
1979.65_orig,1,40584,richard_a_simms,,1765.624,1767.499,That is correct.
1979.65_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1846.556,1867.625,"General Simms, I understand that -- I think everyone agrees that had the true facts been known and been reflected on the chart here the net effect would have been favorable to New Mexico rather than Texas, which I guess is the burden of what you are saying, if they had not made mistakes in some of their estimates and projections and so forth."
1979.65_orig,1,40584,richard_a_simms,,1880.442,1882.608,The purpose of the routing study was twofold.
1979.65_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1904.858,1918.45,"But why, for example, did they extrapolate as to what they thought the conditions were in 1905 and 1906, thought those conditions would have been if the physical developments that were in place in 1947 had been in place earlier."
1979.65_orig,1,40584,richard_a_simms,,1924.781,1939.749,"They did it first of all because all of the engineer advisors thought it would be unwise to predicate this Compact on what is called a schedule, that is, you know, so much water coming in up here that means that so much water has got to go out here."
1979.65_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1998.954,2008.272,Looking backward they felt would give them some added capacity to predict as to the future behavior?
1979.65_orig,1,40584,richard_a_simms,,2008.272,2011.44,That is correct.
1979.65_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2100.426,2107.392,Is it correct that this Exhibit 8 of the Master's report is a part of the report of the Engineering Advisory Committee?
1979.65_orig,1,40584,richard_a_simms,,2107.392,2107.817,It is.
1979.65_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2111.277,2111.613,Right.
1979.65_orig,1,40584,richard_a_simms,,2119.236,2129.886,"The second sentence reads, I believe, the term 1947 Condition means that situation in the Pecos River Basin as described in the report to the Engineering Advisory Committee."
1979.65_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2129.886,2131.831,"No, the next sentence."
1979.65_orig,1,40584,richard_a_simms,,2141.42,2142.077,That is true.
1979.65_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2142.077,2143.502,"Now, he is not doing that, is he?"
1979.65_orig,1,40584,richard_a_simms,,2143.502,2143.744,No.
1979.65_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.404,2553.638,Is that --
1979.65_orig,1,40584,richard_a_simms,,2553.638,2555.35,"Yes, it is."
1979.65_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3159.447,3163.641,Do you think the '47 Condition referred to a certain day?
1979.65_orig,1,40584,richard_a_simms,,3163.641,3181.601,It did not refer to a certain day but the engineer advisors and the Commission itself in doing the review of basic data used all of the '47 Condition -- or I mean all of the 1947 data that actually became available when they did the final review --
1979.65_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3181.601,3183.509,So you think it is December 31 --
1979.65_orig,1,40584,richard_a_simms,,3183.509,3184.068,That is right.
1979.65_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3184.826,3185.783,-- '47?
1979.65_orig,1,40584,richard_a_simms,,3185.783,3187.179,Not through the water year.
1979.65_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3201.013,3209.313,"If you took the view that it is an artificial condition as defined in the report, the date really is immaterial."
1979.65_orig,1,40584,richard_a_simms,,3209.313,3210.758,"I am sorry, I did not hear the question."
1979.65_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3210.758,3211.247,I am sorry.
1979.65_orig,1,40584,richard_a_simms,,3220.497,3221.066,That is correct.
1979.65_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3221.066,3221.59,Yes.
1979.65_orig,1,40584,richard_a_simms,,3221.59,3228.447,"Then all the errors, the erroneous description and everything else as it were is the Compact."
1979.65_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3374.395,3377.534,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Caroom?"
1979.65_orig,2,20658,douglas_g_caroom,,3377.534,3380.971,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.65_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3501.781,3506.509,I take it that the Special Master was aware of these factors.
1979.65_orig,2,20658,douglas_g_caroom,,3512.347,3513.529,He was.
1979.65_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3612.86,3623.922,That by the way is the only matter attached to the Master's report that has any 1947 data in it.
1979.65_orig,2,20658,douglas_g_caroom,,3627.903,3630.271,There are two documents attached to the Master's report.
1979.65_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3630.271,3630.934,Yes.
1979.65_orig,2,20658,douglas_g_caroom,,3630.934,3639.714,The first is the summary of operations under the original river routing study by the engineers in 1948.
1979.65_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3650.163,3653.388,Yes.
1979.65_orig,2,20658,douglas_g_caroom,,3661.189,3662.064,That is correct.
1979.65_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3662.064,3666.194,And that is primarily why he chose the first of the year?
1979.65_orig,2,20658,douglas_g_caroom,,3666.194,3666.957,That is correct.
1979.65_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3672.641,3673.54,Right.
1979.65_orig,2,20658,douglas_g_caroom,,3673.54,3680.07,And the condition was agreed upon without it.
1979.65_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3733.236,3733.831,"Thank you, gentlemen."
