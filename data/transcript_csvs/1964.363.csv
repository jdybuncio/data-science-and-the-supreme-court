1964.363,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,32.189,"Number 363, Lucy C. Simons, Petitioner, versus Miami Beach First National Bank."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,35.09,38.819,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.363,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,85.333,91.03,"Counsel for that, do you mind if I state to you what my problem with your case is?"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,91.03,92.522,No sir.
1964.363,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,92.522,97.589,"When did you present the federal -- this federal question, this full faith and credit?"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,97.589,101.99,"I think the problem has been presented at all stages of the proceedings, Your Honor."
1964.363,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,101.99,102.262,I wasn't able to --
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,102.262,104.143,-- the District Court of Appeals --
1964.363,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,104.143,104.227,I hope --
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,104.227,105.814,-- and by the assignments of error.
1964.363,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,105.814,111.752,"And I hope it was presented in the petition for rehearing before the Court of Appeals, but was that the first time?"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,111.752,115.609,"No sir, I think it was presented in the original assignments of error."
1964.363,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,117.584,121.694,"Well, could you help -- help me find those and -- not this minute I say --"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,121.694,121.887,Yes sir.
1964.363,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,121.887,123.822,-- but during the course of your argument.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,123.822,124.974,Yes sir.
1964.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,179.292,203.806,"My -- my problem is this Mr. Ward, and again, I -- I leave it to you that to answer in the course of your argument if you cannot right now but even if the wife had done that, then the Florida Court would have said, “Alright yes, you know you've told us about this separate -- the separate maintenance decree, and we recognized it and we ordered the husband to keep paying you.”"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,215.638,229.292,"Well, what could have been gained, Your Honor, is the rights that have been established by the New York decree that the wife is -- that this woman was to remain the wife of this man and to participate in his estate."
1964.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,229.292,232.02,I don't understand that that was what that decree provided.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,241.183,241.687,No sir.
1964.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,241.687,246.093,"And in New York, this could -- this could have been followed by an absolute divorce, could it not?"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,246.093,254.056,"On -- by the wife or by the husband on separate grounds, not on the grounds that were adjudicated in this particular course of action."
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,311.228,323.086,You're arguing that Mr. Simons (Inaudible)
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,323.086,324.002,Yes sir.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,324.002,335.097,(Inaudible)
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,335.097,338.817,"Well, Your Honor, from the outset Mr. Justice Goldberg, let me explain this."
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,355.124,355.706,(Inaudible)
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,355.706,356.01,No sir.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,356.01,356.837,(Inaudible)
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,356.837,357.477,Yes sir.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,357.477,367.46,"In other words, the lower court includes the (Inaudible) leaving you the rest of the standard here."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,367.46,367.969,Yes sir.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,367.969,368.625,Is that true?
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,368.625,369.381,Yes sir.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,369.381,371.818,Court of Appeals never decided that.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,371.818,372.229,No sir.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,372.229,375.652,Whether (Inaudible)
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,375.652,376.623,No sir.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,376.623,386.897,"In other words, in order for us to reach (Inaudible) it's necessary for us to decide the residence question."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,386.897,387.529,"That's correct, sir."
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,387.529,393.594,(Inaudible) in the court remain disputed.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,393.594,394.2,That's right.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,395.365,398.321,"Now, the facts have been adjudicated in here."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,398.321,398.79,That's correct.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,398.79,409.096,(Inaudible)
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,409.096,410.086,Yes sir.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,410.086,417.303,"Now, the (Inaudible)"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,417.303,418.414,No sir.
1964.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,540.005,542.138,It's not the same.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,547.94,548.765,Yes sir.
1964.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,548.765,554.97,"That nevertheless, he was sufficiently obliged, so that is -- that she would assert a dower."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,554.97,567.112,"Yes sir, she was of that same sufficiently his wife to assert the dower claim as this Court has ruled, she had sufficiently his wife to assert an alimony claim subsequent to an ex parte --"
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.112,575.247,"Are you saying that the Court had jurisdiction to grant -- jurisdiction of the case now in Court, and they made a mistake in granting the divorce."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,575.247,575.317,No sir.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,575.317,585.809,"Well, I thought you -- I thought you said they weren't entitled to grant the divorce in that jurisdiction but they made a mistake, namely they didn't -- they -- they shouldn't have granted a divorce on the ground they did."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,585.809,588.506,"No, Mr. -- I'd say this."
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,588.681,599.064,"But a while ago, you said a while ago that the Florida Court was not entitled to grant a divorce on the ground that it used because that ground was precluded by the -- by the New York --"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,599.064,603.141,"That is correct, insofar as it affected her marital rights."
1964.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,606.369,608.848,But you did it insofar that it affected her property rights.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,608.848,609.68,"Property rights, yes sir."
1964.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,609.68,616.026,You're claiming that they have a right to sever the relationship of husband and wife per se.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,616.026,616.182,Yes sir.
1964.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,616.182,622.519,But the other statement is to give full faith and credit to any property judgment.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,622.519,625.051,That's correct.
1964.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,625.051,630.611,Whether they -- whether they would have to give it to the separation or not.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,630.611,640.136,"I'm saying this, Your Honor, that insofar as Florida is concerned and we're not here concerned with whether New York would have to give full faith and credit to the Florida decree at all, that was not involved."
1964.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,697.987,704.391,But now what -- I just want to make sure I understand you correctly.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,714.96,716.736,"I would assume so, yes sir."
1964.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,716.736,727.675,What you -- what you're saying is that he -- his first wife was still sufficiently his wife that that continued her right to assert dower on his death.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,727.675,733.064,"That property right, yes, the same that she has the property right to assert -- to make him pay alimony."
1964.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,733.064,747.858,"Because he's not his wife, (Voice Overlap) of -- of fining him if remarry, guilty of any crime, but she is his wife sufficiently have retained whatever property rights you say she's got."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,747.858,749.274,She has retained her property rights --
1964.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,749.274,755.119,"How do you let yourself get into that situation, sufficiently his wife --"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,755.119,755.727,"Well, I know --"
1964.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,755.727,763.555,Does she had to be sufficiently his wife and does she -- might she have the right because of the law whether she's his wife or not his wife.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,763.555,765.089,"I would agree with you, Justice Black."
1964.363,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,782.983,793.25,Estin was the case where -- is that a court decree if taken literally would have wiped out the prior New York alimony decree.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,793.25,793.913,That's correct.
1964.363,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,793.913,801.384,And there's no prior New York decree of any kind that would be affected by here or by anything that Florida did.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,801.384,802.594,Yes sir.
1964.363,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,803.764,809.689,So that Estin was -- is merely an illustration of your point but it isn't quite applicable.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,809.689,810.097,No sir.
1964.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,818.966,830.267,"But Mr. -- Mr. Ward, certainly, (Inaudible) first year of the lawsuit, that dower is a right that's attached to surviving widows, isn't it?"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,833.173,833.933,Yes sir.
1964.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,833.933,834.765,Alright.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,834.765,835.625,And what I'm talking about is that --
1964.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,835.625,840.814,"And when they say sufficiently his, wife I don't think it's -- I don't think it's an act of (Voice Overlap)."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,840.814,859.273,"What I'm -- what I am talking about is that the New York court has decreed in a litigated two-party proceeding where both people who were before the Court, that this woman was entitled to live separate and apart from this man and that he wasn't entitled to live separate and apart from her or to get a divorce from her."
1964.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,860.388,864.118,"But did that touch do -- dower interest, that New York decree?"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,864.118,885.052,"Inherently, yes sir because inherently it is said that she has the right to live separate and apart from him but -- and -- and to receive support from him but she has the right to re -- if nothing else would have happened, if this divorce hadn't been entered, she would have obviously had the right to assert a dower claim against his estate."
1964.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,885.052,890.252,"But there was nothing in that decree that said, “Neither one of you can ever bring suit for divorce?”"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,890.252,891.164,"No sir, I don't think not --"
1964.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,891.164,895.616,"There was nothing in there saying, “You have to stay married to each other until the first one of you dies?”"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,895.616,896.197,No sir.
1964.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,896.197,902.424,"Well that's -- so since there wasn't, then that could have been followed as it was followed by a divorce."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,902.424,907.661,It could have been if it was based upon different grounds.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,907.661,912.23,"Well, this is what I asked you a while ago."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,915.662,915.707,No.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,915.707,916.285,-- which is by the lower court.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,916.285,917.336,"No, Justice White."
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,928.664,932.937,So Florida -- the Florida Court should not have granted a divorce on those grounds.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,933.079,934.114,That's correct.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,934.114,938.422,"Well, that's exactly -- that's absolutely contrary to what you've said a while ago to me."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,938.422,938.725,No sir.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,940.897,945.091,"Well, should or should not the Florida Court have granted a divorce from the grounds that it did?"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,945.091,947.403,I think originally if she would have gone in --
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,947.403,952.605,"Well, how about if you answer the question, should it -- should it have granted a divorce from the grounds that it did or not."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,952.605,953.688,No.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,953.688,955.607,Those grounds were not available to the New York or Florida Court.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,955.607,958.072,They had been adjudicated by the New York separation decree.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,958.072,960.802,"Well then, there was no divorce."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,960.802,961.747,"If you take it that far, yes."
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,961.747,964.627,This full faith and credit ground is good.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,964.627,964.78,It was res jud --
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,964.78,965.885,That there was no divorce.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,965.885,967.951,It was res judicata on the issues presented to the Florida Court.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,967.951,970.059,And the full faith and credit?
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,970.059,971.004,Yes sir.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,971.004,972.54,And so there was no divorce?
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,972.54,973.32,That's correct.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,973.32,974.143,Is that your point here?
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,974.143,974.865,Yes sir.
1964.363,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,974.865,979.773,Does your case depend on this finding with you on that point?
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,979.773,1001.689,"Well Your Honor, my case depends upon this Court extending the doctrine of divisible divorce to determine what Florida did was this, they have ruled that this woman cannot later, after this man dies and when this right of dower then becomes choate cannot come in and assert the New York decree."
1964.363,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1001.689,1003.439,I understand that.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1016.482,1023.862,It was not a proper divorce insofar as it affected her property rights in her husband's estate.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.862,1026.957,But he would still be bigamist when he remarry?
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1026.957,1029.99,"If you recognized the doctrine of divisible divorce, no sir."
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.99,1036.422,"Well yes, but you're saying that this ground was not available before the Court to use it as -- as a divorce."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1040.825,1041.362,That's right.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1041.362,1043.848,And if the Florida Court shouldn't have entered a decree at all.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1043.848,1044.107,That's right.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1044.107,1046.881,Would you tell them they shouldn't have entered -- entered a decree?
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1046.881,1047.25,No sir.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1047.25,1056.526,That if a counsel have -- did -- did you say to the -- the Florida courts that this ground was unavailable on res judicata in full faith and credit ground?
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1056.526,1061.259,That was what was asserted in this last suit that's before the Court now.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.357,1082.079,"And so you didn't -- and -- and you didn't commit on that divorce suit at all, did you?"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1082.079,1083.682,No sir.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.682,1091.996,And which was your -- but you concede there was residence.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1091.996,1095.085,"On the disputed issues, I can -- I don't -- I cannot dispute it."
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1098.846,1109.248,"Assuming the court has jurisdiction, it got waiver of full faith and credit ground, could it come to that court and assert your --"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1109.248,1110.994,I don't believe so --
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1110.994,1126.824,"(Inaudible) with the Court having jurisdiction lost it, and suddenly here you got ruled."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1136.505,1136.648,That's correct.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1136.648,1137.752,You'd have jurisdiction with the man with the residence.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1137.752,1138.625,That's correct.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1138.625,1144.444,(Inaudible)
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1144.444,1145.589,That's correct.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1145.589,1147.194,(Inaudible)
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1147.194,1148.234,"The Court had no knowledge of it, that's correct."
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1148.234,1150.879,(Inaudible)
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1150.879,1151.17,Right.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1151.17,1151.797,Possibly.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1151.797,1151.982,Right.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1151.982,1152.764,The man of residence.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1152.764,1154.109,Yes sir.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1154.109,1172.381,"Your argument in this Court is that the full faith and credit was on the Constitution here, divorce attacked upon their judgment of any kind, you know the court has jurisdiction (Inaudible) in the statute and the facts of it has been (Inaudible)"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1172.381,1177.538,Insofar as it asserts a right that was not adjudicated by the Florida Court.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1184.192,1185.997,That's an assumption.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1197.893,1198.388,That's correct.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1198.388,1205.093,"Assuming Florida law is that (Inaudible)that if you get a divorce, the property is cut off the way it's done."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1205.093,1205.875,That's correct.
1964.363,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1205.875,1209.037,"Well, don't you have any explicit adjudication in Florida?"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1209.037,1209.477,No sir.
1964.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1218.958,1230.829,"Well, Estin against Estin says that, if I understand it, that Florida couldn't have cut off the separate maintenance payments and that Florida could in fact was silent, the Florida Court didn't know about that New York."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1236.24,1236.663,Yes sir.
1964.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1236.663,1241.106,So that would satisfy the Estin case in the other two Vanderbilt and the other one.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1243.108,1243.709,That's correct.
1964.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1245.229,1254.882,"And that -- and the Florida Court granted a -- an absolute divorce, that settled the question of dower because only a will gets dowers, isn't that correct?"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1254.882,1260.159,"Well, it didn't settle anymore than the New York Court settled it because the New York Court had said --"
1964.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1260.159,1262.929,That wasn't -- that question wasn't before the New York Court.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1262.929,1263.164,Well --
1964.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1263.164,1267.811,Dower -- the question of dower only arises after the husband dies.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1273.13,1297.205,"But -- but if one court establishes in a -- in an adversary proceeding, her right to remain a wife and to assert this right in an adversary proceeding, the question is, can another court based upon the same set of facts on an ex parte proceeding take that right away from her?"
1964.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1297.205,1307.227,"I didn't understand that the -- that's what because of a continuing trouble, if the New York Court had decided that she had a permanent right to remain his wife."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1307.227,1308.253,On the set of fact that was --
1964.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1308.253,1313.269,That court decided was that she had a right to be separated from him and to get payments from him.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1313.269,1315.154,That's right.
1964.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1315.154,1317.473,Not that she had a right to remain his wife.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1333.308,1338.563,It was the kind of decree that she sued for separate maintenance.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1396.022,1401.493,"Yes, but the judgment in Court B -- Court B, the court has jurisdiction."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1415.341,1415.708,That's right.
1964.363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1415.708,1422.546,"Once that agreement is being entered in the case, you might -- you may be bound by res judicata."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1422.546,1425.07,"Well, how can we be bound by res judicata in a --"
1964.363,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1425.07,1429.469,You may answer that after -- after recess.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1432.773,1436.058,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1964.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1477.08,1484.974,"Would you mind -- would you mind telling me in very short framing, just precisely what that decree was."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1484.974,1511.236,"It was a decree of separate maintenance awarded to the wife decreeing that the husband had been guilty of extreme cruelty, cruel and inhuman punishment or treatment to the wife and that she was entitled to live separate and apart from him and to receive from him, I think it was $400 a month that the appellant court ult -- ultimately set as alimony or separate maintenance."
1964.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1516.524,1518.588,Which point of it are you relying?
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1518.588,1533.271,"I'm relying upon the determination by the New York Court of the issues before it, that is who was guilty of extreme cruelty to whom because the decree in the Florida Court filed by the husband was also based --"
1964.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1533.271,1536.452,What difference would that make on your point?
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1536.452,1565.958,"Well, it would make this different that if -- if -- that if the decree in New York had not been based upon the same ground as the Florida decree then Florida decree would not in -- in this instance, the New York decree would not been entitled to full faith and credit under the decisions of this Court and -- and most every court."
1964.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1582.769,1585.706,"Well, are you attacking a divorce on that, do you?"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1585.706,1592.194,I'm attacking the divorce insofar as it's enforceability against the wife to affect her dower rights.
1964.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1594.249,1594.858,If -- your --
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1594.858,1595.162,When --
1964.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1595.162,1597.505,-- claim is based fully on dower.
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1597.505,1602.007,"Yes sir, her property right to participate in this man's estate."
1964.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1602.007,1607.337,"Was the district glad that you would be entitled to dower rights, the New York judgment?"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1607.337,1611.315,"No sir, it would -- it would flow from it as long as they remain husband and wife."
1964.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1611.315,1615.229,What if they remain husband and wife at trial?
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1615.229,1629.627,"But as long as they are never separated for cause that's created by the wife and as long as the grounds upon which the -- the Florida decree was based, it had already been ruled upon adversely to the husband."
1964.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1629.627,1637.223,"You're treating this just exactly as though it was a judgment made the New York Court, the litigation between the husband and wife."
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1647.101,1648.909,"No sir, not completely."
1964.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1662.467,1665.985,"Well if that's true that would bar a divorce somewhere, couldn't it or would it?"
1964.363,0,40702,robert_c_ward,,1667.37,1668.233,Yes sir.
1964.363,1,36680,marion_e_sibley,,2243.435,2244.592,Mr. Chief Justice --
1964.363,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2244.592,2246.9,Mr. Sibley.
1964.363,1,36680,marion_e_sibley,,2246.9,2256.183,"Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, I have with me, my partner, Mr. Irwin Levenson of the Florida Bar."
1964.363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.245,2337.863,"What kind of service, would you mind repeating?"
1964.363,1,36680,marion_e_sibley,,2337.863,2343.746,"Substituted service, bad publication but the complaint was forwarded to those required by our statute."
1964.363,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2355.179,2363.67,She also did advise not hear what he said and she admit that the husband have to ignore her and he told her it was appearing.
1964.363,1,36680,marion_e_sibley,,2363.67,2364.806,That is true.
1964.363,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2372.281,2373.033,He didn't believe it?
1964.363,1,36680,marion_e_sibley,,2373.033,2382.274,He didn't believe and I think he would justify it in so doing and that I believe is a fact that he must assume exist in this case.
1964.363,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2503.011,2531.882,"You did not however -- full faith and credit was not given to (Inaudible) indication of the New York Court and out of that, the wife has justified living separate and apart from each other because the (Inaudible) which is the same type of conduct in which the New York Court held that the wife is (Inaudible)"
1964.363,1,36680,marion_e_sibley,,2531.882,2544.938,"In all candor, Mr. Justice Goldberg, I would have to concede on that very parts -- small segment of the record in New York that that grounds were closely alive."
1964.363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2577.221,2580.608,"And if they were used, that doesn't affect your case."
1964.363,1,36680,marion_e_sibley,,2580.608,2584.946,"Not in the slightest, Your Honor pleases, not in the slightest."
1964.363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2623.539,2634.524,It'd different if -- if at this point she did question the residence of the husband in Florida and the jurisdiction of work.
1964.363,1,36680,marion_e_sibley,,2634.524,2640.087,"Well, in the Williams case, if Your Honor pleases, the right --"
1964.363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2640.087,2641.771,I think that they mean --
1964.363,1,36680,marion_e_sibley,,2641.771,2649.424,The right to reexamine the question of residence was preserved to another court.
1964.363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2674.955,2684.6,"But on the ground on which the divorce was obtained, this is independent of the question of the power of the court to grant a divorce."
1964.363,1,36680,marion_e_sibley,,2690.765,2692.514,It is conceivable that she might.
1964.363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2694.608,2694.738,No --
1964.363,1,36680,marion_e_sibley,,2694.738,2694.797,I don't --
1964.363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2694.797,2698.618,"-- but that if she had, then I take that she'd remained his wife."
1964.363,1,36680,marion_e_sibley,,2698.618,2701.065,"If she had unsatisfied, she'd remained his wife and he would --"
1964.363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2701.065,2702.465,And then she would have a dower point.
1964.363,1,36680,marion_e_sibley,,2702.465,2704.441,And we wouldn't have been here today.
1964.363,2,40702,robert_c_ward,,3792.303,3797.225,"Mr. Chief Justice, I only have one or two remarks to make in rebuttal."
1964.363,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3813.855,3821.422,I may think -- I may say to you that I think it's a wholly improper designation to put on it by people who didn't like it.
1964.363,2,40702,robert_c_ward,,3821.422,3822.734,"Well, I would say that --"
1964.363,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3822.734,3824.982,That this confuses me for it to be used.
1964.363,2,40702,robert_c_ward,,3824.982,3829.3,"Alright, I will eliminate it from you, sir, any further."
1964.363,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3900.384,3902.464,We're talking on the New York case.
1964.363,2,40702,robert_c_ward,,3902.464,3905.805,On the New York case.
