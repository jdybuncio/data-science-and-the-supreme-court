1994.94-562,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.567,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94 562, Leslie Wilton v. Seven Falls Company."
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,37.806,44.76,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.94-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,168.51,169.882,May we just go back to that.
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,212.97,224.239,"--Yes, Your Honor, I agree with you, and I agree that that's what Mr. Borchard's understanding of the remedy was as well, is that a new Federal remedy was being created."
1994.94-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,271.038,285.889,"But isn't... doesn't it make sense to infer that there is a derivative or implicit discretion to determine whether to go ahead and have a trial on the issue, because let's assume we apply Colorado River, Moses Cone, or any other set of criteria."
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,308.322,311.645,"Your Honor, I agree with you that that is a sensible way."
1994.94-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,326.314,326.564,Well--
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,326.875,327.235,--question.
1994.94-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,327.235,329.086,--May I just ask one other?
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,372.254,403.004,"Well, Your Honor, beginning with the Brillhart case, which essentially is the respondents' touchstone in this matter, which seemed to give very wide discretion to the district court on the very threshold issue, the very next term, in the Winter Haven case, this Court said that you can decide these... you can abstain or use discretion, but it's only in, I believe the words were, the extraordinary case, or the exceptional circumstances, and so in the very--"
1994.94-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,403.004,404.785,Was that a declaratory judgment case?
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,404.785,407.987,"--Yes, Your Honor, the Winter Haven case was a declaratory judgment case."
1994.94-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,407.987,408.708,With no other relief sought?
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,408.708,412.891,I believe injunctive relief was sought in that case as well.
1994.94-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,412.891,426.36,"Has this Court ever said what you're contending, that you must exercise the jurisdiction but when you go through the whole trial you stop because you have discretion with respect to the remedy?"
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,428.38,433.933,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe the Court has said that, and that's... I want to make it clear, that is not our position in this case."
1994.94-562,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,444.902,445.163,Well--
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,451.855,461.663,"Not from the literal sense of the word ""abstention"", which I take to mean dismissal, Your Honor."
1994.94-562,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,461.663,476.912,"Well, it seems to me that in your argument so far you have talked about the discretion not to grant declaratory relief as if it were abstention, and it seems to me those are very different things."
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,520.6,526.605,"Again, Your Honor, I do contend that it is a threshold question."
1994.94-562,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,555.022,565.19,"To follow up on Justice Kennedy's question, does your answer suggest that the court should treat a dismissal as exactly the same way as staying?"
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,565.19,566.652,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-562,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,590.526,598.402,"Well, I suggest to you again that the court did not say, and I don't think you can interpret its opinion as saying, that it was abstaining."
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,598.402,622.098,"The court... unfortunately, Your Honor, what's happening is the lower courts, the circuit court opinions as well as the district court opinions, do terribly confuse just the very pure abstention doctrine versus the prudential deference, as some of the cases refer to it as, in the Colorado River Moses Cone analysis."
1994.94-562,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,648.916,653.337,Do you want us to say there is an unflagging obligation to grant declaratory relief?
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,653.337,654.539,"--No, Your Honor."
1994.94-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,673.53,676.772,I think we're back where we started.
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,689.501,692.824,"That... yes, Your Honor, I agree, because that is what the Colorado River--"
1994.94-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,692.824,694.054,So what do you gain by that?
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,694.054,695.025,"--Well, that is--"
1994.94-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,695.025,708.686,"You gain simply the statement we... instead of saying, we don't think this is an appropriate case, get out of here, the court must say, we think this is an appropriate case for us to take jurisdiction, but not to grant relief, get out of here."
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,710.956,728.968,"--Your Honor, the practical effect of telling the lower courts, though, that they may simply elect not to take a declaratory judgment case for any reason at all as long as it's not bias or prejudice, means that we have effectively done away with a declaratory judgment--"
1994.94-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.968,732.769,"--Well, I thought that answer just contradicts what were you telling Justice Souter."
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,741.825,743.287,"--I'm sorry I was confusing, Your Honor."
1994.94-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,752.363,754.333,But maybe a summary judgment process.
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,771.524,801.194,"--No, Your Honor, I do not believe so, because as this Court did, as Judge Hittner did, we had to have a hearing, an oral hearing on the motion to dismiss, and all that the petitioners are requesting herein is that at such time as the district court takes up the motion to dismiss, that he consider that he has a virtually unflagging obligation to accept the jurisdiction, but that in exceptional circumstances he may either abstain completely or defer to the State court."
1994.94-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,801.194,820.117,"To what extent is what you're saying inconsistent with the statement, there is nothing automatic or obligatory about the assumption of jurisdiction by Federal court in a declaratory judgment action even if the parties are proper and the jurisdictional amount is present."
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,835.327,848.435,"Well, I do agree from the standpoint that we're not asking the Court to make an initial ruling on the merits when considering whether or not to defer or abstain."
1994.94-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,871.48,902.881,"Why must you go through a checklist, instead of saying, here's a case where the insurer is suing first, and then you have another case where the insured is coming into court, there's no Federal question, there are more parties in the State court action, and the one thing that you shouldn't have is wasting judicial resources by having two courts deal with the same matter at the same time, so one court should defer to the other, right?"
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,906.372,926.848,"--Well, the main reason that you do force some sort of guidelines onto the district court is because if you do not do that, Your Honor, then essentially you have unfettered discretion, and that's our big squabble today, is that we contend that the district courts should not have unfettered discretion."
1994.94-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,926.848,940.605,"Do you agree that a fundamental point is, you should not have two lawsuits over the same matter going on at the same time, unless there's extraordinary reason for that?"
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,940.605,942.376,"Yes, Your Honor, I would--"
1994.94-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,942.376,949.792,"All right, and then the decision has to be made which of the two lawsuits, and what are the... we have two lawsuits going on now."
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,961.378,970.245,"--Your Honor, the... our contention is that the Colorado River Moses Cone analytical framework should be used in precisely that fashion."
1994.94-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,996.151,1016.394,"But you say that the district judge can say what you've just said, we should go forward, but then can immediately say, having gone forward we find that all things considered it's better for the State court to proceed than it is for us to proceed, and therefore on the merits we decline the declaratory judgment."
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1016.394,1017.866,"No, that's not what--"
1994.94-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1017.866,1018.086,No.
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1020.799,1025.861,"--I believe that, Your Honor, the Moses Cone decision was purely a jurisdictional--"
1994.94-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.861,1026.492,Right.
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1033.417,1037.448,--That... those facts aren't presented by this case--
1994.94-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1037.448,1037.789,"Well, but--"
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1037.789,1039.188,"--Your Honor, so--"
1994.94-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1039.188,1044.944,"--But... yes, I assume not, but let's... is it the same standard as Moses Cone?"
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1044.944,1046.805,"--No, I don't believe so."
1994.94-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1047.214,1051.657,"It's a lot more restrictive of the Federal court than Moses Cone, isn't it?"
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1051.657,1053.139,"--I believe so, Your Honor."
1994.94-562,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1079.636,1079.987,And even--
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1099.949,1110.876,"--Not on that alone, Your Honor, only because that would have been just one of the factors that the Court has said in the Colorado River and Moses Cone analysis that should be looked at."
1994.94-562,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1111.447,1120.171,"So you're saying the district court has to go through the whole Moses Cone list, even though it's a declaratory judgment?"
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1120.171,1123.905,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is precisely the position that this case--"
1994.94-562,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1123.905,1128.617,How does the fact that it's a declaratory judgment affect the Moses Cone calculus?
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1128.617,1164.501,"--It affects it in the sense that this Court's decision just about, I guess 6 years ago in the NOPSI, a shorthand rendition of the New Orleans Public Service case, that was a declaratory judgment case as well, and the Court, although it didn't go through the Colorado River Moses Cone abstention analysis because it presented a different type of abstention, the Court was having to look at the Burford and Younger abstention doctrines, that was a declaratory judgment case, and it just so happened it presented Federal--"
1994.94-562,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1164.501,1172.946,"My question was, how does the presence of a declaratory judgment request affect the Moses Cone analysis?"
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1176.52,1186.206,"--Well, Your Honor, I guess it doesn't change... our position would be that it does not change the Colorado River Moses Cone analysis at all, that the same factors--"
1994.94-562,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1186.206,1189.379,In spite of the discretion granted by the statute itself?
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1189.379,1198.853,"--Yes, Your Honor, because the discretion that's granted by the statute itself is the discretion to decide the merits of the case."
1994.94-562,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1242.913,1250.267,"Mr. Orlando, now Moses Cone, that was not a declaratory judgment action, was it?"
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1250.267,1250.697,"--No, Your Honor."
1994.94-562,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1250.697,1259.373,"And I thought after Colorado River, wasn't there that case of Will v.... what was it?"
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1259.373,1259.714,Calvert--
1994.94-562,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1259.714,1260.705,Calvert--
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1268.57,1269.271,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-562,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1269.271,1272.013,And so why shouldn't we adhere to that?
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1279.907,1310.168,"The Will v. Calvert case, Your Honor, which was decided just a couple of years after... it was in between Colorado River and Moses Cone, there were four justices that were led by the chief justice in the plurality opinion which sent the case back down, as I recall, but the fifth justice, Mr. Justice Blackmun, voted with the other four justices to state very specifically that the Colorado River analysis should apply."
1994.94-562,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1321.965,1326.237,"Well, maybe it's time to declare that Brillhart sets the standard."
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1326.237,1329.899,That is the precise question before this Court--
1994.94-562,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1329.899,1335.763,"Exactly, and I would like to know why that doesn't present the better point of view."
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1335.763,1338.695,--It doesn't present the better point of view for a couple of reasons.
1994.94-562,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1349.134,1355.927,Congress gave the judicial branch some discretion in the Declaratory Judgment Act.
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1358.177,1368.524,"--Yes, Your Honor, the Congress did give discretion, but again, I would reemphasize that our position is that that discretion was to grant the relief, not to accept jurisdiction."
1994.94-562,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1407.691,1427.944,"You know, one of the ironies of the issue is, we talk about Colorado River as unflagging obligation, and of course they didn't retain jurisdiction in that case itself, and one of the factors that Justice Brennan mentioned in the... in his opinion under all these unflagging factors is desirability of avoiding piecemeal litigation, citing Brillhart."
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1453.469,1478.137,"--Part of the problem with that approach, Your Honor, is that if this Court does not give some guidance to the lower courts as to which factors should or should not be looked at by the district court, then in essence the Court is granting unfettered discretion, and what is or may happen is the district court may simply look at his docket and say, my docket is overcrowded with criminal cases--"
1994.94-562,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1478.137,1487.092,"Well, supposing he looks at the docket and says, if I take... keep this case, I'll be able to try it in about 30 months, it will probably go to trial next week in the State court, and that's the only factor I look at."
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1488.672,1491.644,"--If that's the only factor, then I would say no, Your Honor."
1994.94-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1504.294,1523.087,"Mr. Orlando, you answered Justice O'Connor that that is indeed the issue here, whether we should use as a jurisdictional issue what we have said to be the basis for a merits determination under declaratory judgment actions, but is that really the issue?"
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1527.257,1529.208,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1994.94-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1543.77,1548.442,"Where did you get it, it's on B 2, B 1 of the cert petition?"
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1548.442,1548.782,Yes.
1994.94-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1548.782,1555.037,"I think I'm a fair reader, and I can't... it says, B 2,"
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1580.533,1594.241,"But it is... I agree that is the wording, but there was no consideration of the merits of the proceeding, and that's really the basis for my position, Your Honor, is in the motion to dismiss hearing he didn't talk about merits."
1994.94-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1594.241,1594.481,What is the merits?
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1607.33,1621.018,"Well, the merits of this case would have had to address the propriety of whether or not the insurer should be defending the underlying litigation, which was the principal... one of the principal issues--"
1994.94-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1621.018,1636.57,"But all that could be done in the State court, and I think you agreed with me that one... the fundamental thing that we start with in these days of overcrowded courts, even without that, you should not have two courts proceeding in the same matter at the same time."
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1668.96,1683.7,"--Well, those... Your Honor, there are perhaps three or four of the other Colorado River Moses Cone factors that the court should have considered and the court should have balanced those factors in favor of accepting jurisdiction."
1994.94-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1683.7,1689.384,"What factors, other than 1) there should be one lawsuit; 2) the State court is not going to relinquish this case."
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1697.578,1701.462,"Just, we contend none, other than the Colorado River's--"
1994.94-562,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1701.462,1716.802,"Well, counsel, suppose that the State of New York, I don't know if this is true or not, has a statute which is exactly parallel to the Federal declaratory judgment suit, and this action were brought in the State of New York to enjoin the parties... to declare the rights of the parties."
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1726.5,1729.771,"--No, Your Honor, I don't believe there would be any--"
1994.94-562,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1729.771,1733.302,It seems to me that this case is no different than that.
1994.94-562,0,36424,michael_a_orlando,,1750.973,1760.932,"--Yes, Your Honor, I would agree with that, but I would also point out to Your Honor the NOPSI decision, which came just a few years ago, was a declaratory judgment case."
1994.94-562,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1760.932,1762.492,"Thank you, Mr. Orlando."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,1765.875,1771.989,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1840.033,1840.954,Did he say that?
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,1844.428,1848.148,"I believe he does use the term ""jurisdiction"" in the opinion."
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1848.148,1858.576,"Well, maybe, but he might have said, as the Court here said, jurisdiction to grant the... this is very subtle, but that's what we're talking about, isn't it?"
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,1858.576,1864.269,"It is very subtle, and picking up on a point that was made earlier, it may be that we're talking semantics more than anything else."
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1864.269,1864.5,Maybe.
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,1864.5,1873.536,"Is the decision not to exercise jurisdiction to grant the relief no different than saying, I'm exercising my discretion not to grant relief?"
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.536,1873.856,Right.
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,1873.856,1879.94,"Justice... Judge Hittner in his opinion was, I thought, very artful in the way he drafted his opinion."
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1879.94,1883.831,"Well, although he ended up... I'm afraid I misled counsel, saying he dismissed."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,1906.697,1907.198,Indeed.
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1913.62,1914.382,Down the road apiece.
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,1914.382,1916.343,And see what happens in the State court.
1994.94-562,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1919.455,1920.797,"May I ask... it's just a stay, not a dismissal."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,1927.693,1935.827,I believe that the court of appeals treated it as a final judgment in that it was for all practical purposes concluded with the stay.
1994.94-562,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1935.827,1937.738,But the case was still pending in the district court.
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,1937.738,1938.419,That is an intriguing--
1994.94-562,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1938.419,1948.613,"I suppose any time the district court decided to, he could have just said I think I'll... I find out that the proceedings have been delayed interminably over in the States, and I think we ought to go ahead with this trial."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,1951.545,1957.569,"--I think that is a fair point, and perhaps does argue that perhaps abstention analysis is at play here to some degree."
1994.94-562,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1961.913,1964.195,Maybe that's why they didn't want to publish their opinion.
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,1964.455,1966.378,That may very well be the case.
1994.94-562,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1978.624,1979.074,"No, but they affirmed."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,1980.256,1980.777,--That is true.
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.666,1983.947,"What did Moses Cone do, do you remember?"
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,1997.707,2000.168,"Your Honor, I do not know the answer to your question."
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2001.55,2002.99,"They're quite different things, really, aren't they?"
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2002.99,2003.601,"--Well, they are."
1994.94-562,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2044.097,2050.17,"In Colorado River, as I read the opinion we affirmed the order dismissing the complaint."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2053.463,2061.478,That's correct.
1994.94-562,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2129.622,2139.099,"Isn't it just the difference between 12b(1), which would be subject matter jurisdiction, and 12b(6) doesn't state a claim for relief?"
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2139.099,2140.471,I think so.
1994.94-562,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2181.068,2201.069,"Maybe the stay result in the district court is like if you grant a motion, a forum non conveniens motion when the forum is broad and the district court wants to make sure that that other litigation really goes forward before dropping the case."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2207.945,2222.154,"I think so, but I'm not so sure you have a statute of limitations issue with a declaratory judgment action in this case, but that would be... that is typically one of the reasons for staying instead of dismissing, is to avoid any kind of statute of limitations bar."
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2222.154,2229.518,"How did the... Justice Stevens and I were just speculating, how does a stay get to be appealable as a final order?"
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2238.934,2253.874,"If memory serves, and I always hate to pull a case out of the top of my head, but doesn't the Landis case speak to a situation where a trial court abuses its discretion by manipulating its docket in such way as to, in essence, never reach judgment on a case?"
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2253.874,2256.315,It sounds right to me.
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2256.315,2258.766,"I think that's the case, but that's--"
1994.94-562,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2258.766,2260.979,Did you ask for an injunction?
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2260.979,2261.509,--No.
1994.94-562,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2263.561,2265.392,"Well then, 1292, or did the... pardon me."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2267.054,2268.984,"Absolutely not, simply a declaratory relief."
1994.94-562,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2268.984,2271.225,Then 1292(a) doesn't work.
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2271.225,2271.796,No.
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2271.796,2280.951,"Gee, maybe the case doesn't belong here."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2281.202,2283.103,We've traveled a long way.
1994.94-562,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2284.374,2286.946,"Well, let's go ahead on the assumption it does, yes."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2286.946,2289.808,We must get an opinion on this.
1994.94-562,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2412.567,2414.189,Where is Winkler County?
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2414.189,2416.15,"It's in West Texas, Your Honor."
1994.94-562,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2416.15,2418.562,In... how large is the county seat?
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2418.562,2425.917,"Well, Your Honor, I don't know how large the county seat is, but it's a relatively rural area."
1994.94-562,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2425.917,2430.239,Is there any reason why all this litigation was brought there rather than somewhere else?
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2430.239,2436.242,"In the underlying litigation... this, of course, does not involve any of the insurance carriers."
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2447.48,2473.128,"The statements you were just making about this being premature as a declaratory judgment action, assume... and about race to the courthouse assumes that the Declaratory Judgment Act was not meant precisely to permit what occurred here, to permit an out of State defendant who does not want to have to be subjected to State courts to file first in order to avoid that."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2473.128,2476.67,"Justice Scalia, I will take issue with that, if I may."
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2476.67,2479.542,"Well, I'm not... I'm saying... I'm just saying what you assumed."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2481.573,2500.724,"Well, the purpose of a declaratory judgment action, as I understand it, is that before a party breaches a contract, before they engage in conduct that might be a breach of contract, and thereby expose themselves to the damages that flow from that, that they would go to court to seek a declaration of what the contract... contractual rights and duties are."
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2573.363,2574.562,"Well, that was their mistake, then."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2583.128,2583.849,--Well--
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.849,2588.284,It's easy enough for an insurance company never to make up its mind categorically until the action is filed.
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2588.284,2600.992,"--I think we would have had a truer application of a DJ action if... if upon giving notice to the carrier, the carrier had come in and defended the lawsuit and simultaneously sought a declaration of rights."
1994.94-562,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2603.402,2604.172,Why--
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2625.347,2641.407,"Well, at the risk, of course, of heresy to the Constitution, I will say there is something that many State courts find offensive, at the concept that a State court is somehow biased simply because a foreign interest is before the bar, and... but aside from that--"
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2641.407,2642.286,That's not our thinking.
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2643.397,2643.948,"--Yes, I know, but--"
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2643.948,2644.479,"I mean, blame it on them."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2648.23,2666.152,"--But by the same token, by the same token Congress has repeatedly distinguished between Federal jurisdiction... I mean, diversity jurisdiction and Federal question jurisdiction, making it much easier for litigants to petition a Federal court for relief than for purely diverse parties to seek Federal relief."
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2676.761,2689.828,"I'd say you've nicely avoided that by including another party in the State action, which is a party, a Texas party, so that removal in this case will not be possible, and as I recall they say that occurred after they filed the declaratory judgment."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2689.828,2691.1,"--Well, two responses to that."
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2722.031,2723.49,It seemed like a nice argument to me.
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2723.49,2724.151,"--Well, it's a nice argument."
1994.94-562,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2747.337,2758.703,"But how can they remove, because as I understand it, the State court suit doesn't have complete... there isn't complete diversity, and there's no basis that you could... one defendant could get out and get into Federal court."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2758.703,2763.305,"And the answer to that, again, is in the Framers of the Constitution and in the Congress."
1994.94-562,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2873.982,2882.567,"You would not say it would be an abuse of discretion for a Federal district judge to say, well, that's a pretty complex proceeding over there in the State court."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2894.625,2898.708,I think under the law he would probably have the discretion to do that.
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2936.683,2940.494,"Well, that's surely true when the State action is filed first, but here it was filed second."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,2969.074,2973.305,I think that is why the discretion feature is given to the district court.
1994.94-562,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2990.316,3001.224,--But that's very far afield from your case where the Federal action was reinstituted after you gave notice that you were bringing a suit in State court.
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,3001.224,3008.778,"Indeed, and in this case, of course, very little water had been tread before the State order was entered."
1994.94-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3058.051,3061.383,"In fairness, though, they agreed to dismiss it because they thought it was moot."
1994.94-562,1,45805,werner_a_powers,,3064.465,3088.721,"--I don't believe that there's anything in the record to suggest that, and I might say, there's been a lot of things outside the record in the briefing, and I haven't pointed that out in opening, but much of the arguments that they make that the Hills have engaged in forum shopping themselves is really outside the record, and... but anyway, that did not exist there."
1994.94-562,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3094.014,3101.671,The case is submitted.
