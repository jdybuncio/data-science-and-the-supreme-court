1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,22.298,26.842,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1959.436,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,351.981,356.606,"By that, do you mean a label or some kind on the motor?"
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,356.606,362.253,"Well, the -- the label is what I would call nominal horsepower reading."
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,466.939,467.961,That can be what?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,467.961,468.789,"Rated, R-A --"
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,468.789,469.163,Rate.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,469.163,470.367,"Rated, yes."
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,578.464,581.82,Is the NEMA rating the normal or the -- the
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,581.82,583.046,"That's the standard, yes."
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,583.046,585.803,That's -- that's the actual?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,585.803,592.295,That's -- that's the -- that's the -- the industrial standard rating.
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,626.875,629.372,"May I ask this, why -- why the difference?"
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,640.399,645.42,"Well, it's really a question of interpreting rather the revenue rulings."
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,658.549,663.074,Was that normally for tax purposes?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,663.074,685.91,"Well, for -- the fact of the matter, Your Honor, is this is a new case as far as tax purposes are concerned because I don't believe its ever -- there's ever been a -- a contest where it appeared that the label, that is the nominal horsepower rating, was inconsistent with the NEMA standard rating."
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,696.209,697.834,What was the actual horsepower?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,697.834,699.982,The actual horsepower is more than 1 horsepower.
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,699.982,701.176,How much more?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,701.176,703.28,"Oh, a couple of points more."
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,703.292,705.587,"Well, not -- not substantially."
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,705.587,706.157,"No, not substantially."
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,706.157,706.964,Yes.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,706.964,715.834,"There's a pretty close correlation between the rating standards they just do it in a different way, the NEMA rating standards and the actual horsepower."
1959.436,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,715.834,725.338,"Well, do I understand you, Mr. Rothschild, that the purposes of the tax, if the tax is exacted it, it's under 1 horsepower."
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,725.525,726.608,That's correct.
1959.436,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,726.608,732.276,"That is if it's 1 horsepower precisely or more, then there's no tax?"
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,732.276,732.807,That's right.
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,737.299,748.33,"Is that what your test case is about?You talked a lot about what this record shows, but I understood you to say at the beginning, this was a test case to determine some point of law."
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,748.33,767.021,"Well, the -- was -- simply, the -- the test case was to determine whether there are some 50,000 air conditioners on which the Commissioner has levied assessments.We haven't paid the tax on those because we say they're not taxable because they're 1 horsepower units."
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,795.293,800.722,What is the -- what is the point of law you are trying to get determined?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,800.722,801.931,The point of law?
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,801.931,804.231,Yes.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,804.231,822.91,"Well, the point of -- the principle point, Your Honor, is that the point of law that was passed on by the District Court is one that was agreed to by the Government, that is that the NEMA standards applied that these were -- these -- these units were exempt under the NEMA standards."
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,870.323,872.457,Whether it's -- whether it's one (Voice Overlap)
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,872.457,874.024,"Whether it's one, two, three --"
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,874.024,874.452,-- two or three.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,874.452,875.796,-- or -- that's right.
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,876.881,879.647,And that -- that is your main point of law?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,879.647,879.99,"Well, our --"
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,879.99,890.515,I'm -- I'm not talking now about what would decide this particular case on the basis that the Government started off one way and then stepped over and took another and then took a third.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,890.515,897.101,"Well, our point of law in our original brief, Your Honor, was the Court of Appeals was wrong in its decision even assuming that it -- that it --"
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,897.101,899.816,What did it hold with reference to that point?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,899.816,902.811,The Court of Appeals held that the rulings were void.
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,921.515,925.901,The statute simply provides for tax on household appliances.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,925.901,925.974,Well --
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,925.974,926.481,What now to --
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,926.481,929.058,self -- self-contained air conditioning units.
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,929.058,932.851,Self-contained air-con and didn't -- doesn't say anything at all about what size?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,932.851,933.251,That's right.
1959.436,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,959.283,963.13,"Well, how did household type get into this, it's a regulation?"
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,966.207,967.939,The statute is self-contained air conditioning --
1959.436,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,967.939,969.961,It says nothing about horsepower rating.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,972.608,974.128,Not -- not in so many words.
1959.436,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1019.7,1023.379,"Now, what's the Government position now, that it -- there's no limitation at all?"
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1023.379,1023.873,That's right.
1959.436,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1023.873,1026.702,Either horsepower or household or anything else?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1026.702,1027.305,That's right.
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1027.305,1030.829,"Now, where is the statute if you don't find it at all?"
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1030.829,1031.392,"Well, the statute --"
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1031.392,1034.319,Would you mind pointing out the language of the statute?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1034.319,1047.585,"The language of the statute appears in -- well, in our -- we have in our appendix page 39 of our main brief both and -- that's --"
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1047.585,1048.922,Which part --
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1048.922,1049.458,-- that's the --
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1049.458,1049.833,-- which part --
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1049.833,1053.639,-- original of 1939 Code.
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1053.639,1055.984,Which part of that on page 39?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1055.984,1058.602,You have to go down to C.
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1058.718,1059.913,C on page 40?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1059.913,1063.184,"C on page 40, yes."
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1063.184,1065.063,Is that the whole definition?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1065.063,1066.629,That's all there is.
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1084.163,1084.216,But what --
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1084.216,1086.527,"Well, is there any difference in the language?"
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1086.527,1089.671,"Except for the subheading, no."
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1095.464,1095.563,"Well, is that --"
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1095.563,1096.121,Let's see if I understand --
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1096.121,1096.988,I beg your pardon.
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1096.988,1097.185,No.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1097.185,1097.534,Yes.
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1097.534,1102.639,Is that stipulation that you speak of a stipulation of fact or of law?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1102.639,1106.758,The stipulation of -- of the -- that the -- the --
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1106.758,1108.023,About the household?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1108.023,1110.062,"Oh, that it -- it implied the household types?"
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1110.062,1110.237,Yes.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1110.237,1112.734,That was a stipulation of law.
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1112.734,1120.336,"Well, then, it's your position that they stipulated themselves out of court by their legal concessions, is that right?"
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1120.336,1121.364,That's right.
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1122.213,1128.396,"If this is a test case, should we abide by that if they're wrong?"
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1128.396,1131.308,"Where is that stipulation, Mr. --"
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1131.308,1134.24,The stipulation appears in the briefs.
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1139.828,1142.36,I'd like to see them before I find out whether they were repudiated.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1142.36,1147.325,"All right, the first stipulation, Your Honor, is the one that was made in the trial court."
1959.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1178.52,1178.623,Correct.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1178.623,1180.335,"-- rating, I'm interpolating there."
1959.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1215.904,1217.575,And how did the Government construed it?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1218.167,1225.719,"Oh, the Government construed it in the language of the attorney that I read before as incorporating the NEMA's rating standards."
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1232.853,1233.576,May I --
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1233.576,1234.293,"I'm sorry, sir"
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1234.293,1235.562,May I ask you?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1247.586,1248.605,(Voice Overlap) --
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1248.605,1253.758,-- as to how that statute can be construed or as to what the regulations were?
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1254.733,1255.469,"Well, it's the stipulation as to what --"
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1255.469,1256.32,I don't know it.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1257.577,1260.263,"It's a stipulation as to both acts, Your Honor, and --"
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1260.263,1266.312,"The stipulation and as the Chief Justice asked as to what the statute, how the statute is to be construed, is that it?"
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1266.312,1266.771,That's right.
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1281.168,1283.159,That's the ultimate question of law.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1291.901,1292.274,"Well, there -- there's also --"
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1292.274,1293.381,Let me remind you -
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1293.381,1295.741,"There's also a question of fact, Your Honor, which is this."
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1295.741,1305.896,"I can understand if they're agree to tell me that by this stipulation, you were cut off from putting in witnesses or making claims of --"
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1305.896,1305.958,Of course.
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1305.958,1307.033,"-- otherwise, you would have made it."
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1307.685,1310.402,"Of course that -- yes, Your Honor, that's exactly what I'm saying."
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1349.022,1350.469,"Then, tell me this."
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1374.905,1384.292,"Well, I'm asking you to do more of the latter than the former because I -- I admit that this Court is not bound by a stipulation of law."
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1395.492,1400.887,And it might be irrelevant to have fair determination of the legal question.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1402.652,1406.893,"Which might be, except that the Government was perfectly cognizant of everything they've raised right now."
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1406.893,1410.487,What I mean it -- which might be from the point of view of this Court --
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1410.487,1410.879,Yes.
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1410.879,1421.019,-- as a matter of law.If you are shut off from putting in defenses or making claims and to study by the way in which you could sustain presumably --
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1421.019,1421.738,Yes.
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1421.738,1425.556,-- by a position of the Government took on which the Court acted --
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1425.556,1425.647,Yes.
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1425.647,1429.678,-- and this Court cannot say that that is irrelevant to the issue.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1432.411,1432.734,Yes.
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1432.734,1435.746,You are entitled to get to that chance.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1437.963,1438.446,That's right.
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1451.832,1454.757,"But why, because we made the stipulations to law?"
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1454.757,1459.81,"Because they tried the case on different issues and the trial court and they're trying it on this Court, Your Honor, and therefore it's --"
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1459.81,1465.375,That may be a good reason for sending it back but it isn't a good reason for this Court to give a wrong constructions of the statute.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1465.375,1467.859,I don't think Your Honors have to do that.
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1470.948,1471.664,"Well, I mean --"
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1471.664,1476.073,"-- but -- but I'm assuming that it is, yes."
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1476.524,1484.199,I didn't want to know what it is that you may properly press upon this Court for a decision.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1515.076,1515.359,"Well, I -- I --"
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1515.359,1524.358,"Certainly, you're not putting to the Court that we must give a construction to the statute because the Government misconceived the scope of the statute."
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1524.358,1559.489,"No, I am suggesting that -- to the Court that the Government be tried -- that the Government try the cases and have this -- this Court review the issues that were presented to the trial court and the issue that was presented to the trial court was not the issue that was presented either to the Court of Appeals or to this Court, and this Court has held many times that this Court will not consider, regardless of the merits of an issue, will not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal and certainly issues raised for the first time after the filing of a petition for certiorari."
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1559.489,1562.586,"But in the Swift case, which is somewhere around 278 US --"
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1562.586,1563.009,"Yes, I'm aware."
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1563.009,1566.765,-- this Court held on its own notion --
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1566.765,1566.903,Yes.
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1566.903,1568.739,-- sua sponte from the bench --
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1568.739,1569.129,That's right.
1959.436,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1569.129,1581.722,-- that the whole theory on which the litigation was conducted is to be swept aside because conflict between them put up a litigation to this Court which did not represent what the litigation should have been.
1959.436,0,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,1581.722,1583.174,"Well, I'm aware of that, Your Honor."
1959.436,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1984.339,1988.028,"Yes, sir."
1959.436,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1988.028,1989.113,So that -- could I interrupt you?
1959.436,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,2003.122,2007.504,"Oh, I think it -- it may present the issue of how do you --"
1959.436,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2007.504,2019.634,"I don't -- don't you know what they -- when you say they may present, what, in your views, are the issue which you think this Court should adjudicate in this case on this question, not what it makes?"
1959.436,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,2019.634,2023.559,I say may because I think there are alternative issues here.
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4708.192,4708.72,"I won't, Your Honor."
1959.436,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4708.72,4715.935,"You took your time, but I want to ask you the case because I want to know before we adjourn."
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4719.725,4721.033,That's correct.
1959.436,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4721.033,4762.237,"Did you pass a tax on to your -- to your purchasers and collected on the theory that you are going to pay it to the Government and now seek to -- to deprive the Government of the right to collect that tax and to keep that money or did you, relying upon the regulations and rulings of the Department, failed to pass that on to your -- to your purchasers in which event you would now owe the Government a million dollars or so out of your own pocket?"
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4763.417,4764.73,"The latter, Your Honor."
1959.436,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4764.73,4765.584,The latter is true?
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4765.584,4766.292,Yes.
1959.436,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4769.694,4769.755,Yes.
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4769.755,4770.716,-- may I state just one thing?
1959.436,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4770.716,4772.957,"Yes, yes, you may answer that question rather boldly."
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4772.957,4773.379,That's right.
1959.436,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4778.411,4783.285,"Yes, but that is your answer that you would now be stuck for a million or so dollars --"
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4783.285,4784.779,That's right.
1959.436,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4784.779,4786.713,-- that you have not passed on to your customers.
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4786.713,4787.002,And that is the -- that is the point.
1959.436,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4787.002,4792.649,"And as -- as to this two -- the two -- the inferences in the litigation, what is that fact there that you (Voice Overlap) --"
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4792.649,4794.082,On these two units?
1959.436,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4869.366,4870.354,Tell me this.
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4886.799,4904.119,"No, because the only -- the only similarity, Your Honor, and the only reason that -- that we stipulate it was because these suits in these air conditioners, the 50,000 in physical content, in size, in horsepower were the same as the two and --"
1959.436,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4904.119,4910.275,"But -- but there was all the difference in the world and in the one case, you wouldn't be out of pocket and in the other cases, you would be."
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4910.275,4911.819,"Well, we'd be out of pocket."
1959.436,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4915.156,4916.154,"Well, I know but -- but --"
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4916.154,4917.529,But --
1959.436,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4917.529,4923.589,"-- if a case is a test case, then presumably it has the same ingredients as those for which it is a test case."
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4923.589,4925.688,"Well, it's a test case for one purpose, Your Honor."
1959.436,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4936.399,4941.087,"But suppose you were wrong in your law, you could still recover for the 50,000."
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4941.087,4945.953,"If we're wrong in our law, Your Honor, and we are -- and here's -- here's what will happen."
1959.436,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4974.934,4978.083,But you just said to the Chief Justice that you haven't -- that you didn't (Voice Overlap) --
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4978.083,4979.872,"Well, I've got to prove that in 50,000 cases."
1959.436,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4979.872,4981.347,All I'm saying is if it does strike (Voice Overlap) --
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4981.347,4982.828,I mean it's not in the record.
1959.436,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4982.896,4983.32,It just strikes me.
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4987.594,4990.402,"Well, that's the only act that we have, Your Honor."
1959.436,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4993.676,4998.786,-- based out a very important basis on which you could recover a million dollars.
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,4998.786,5001.755,"No, we couldn't possible recover it on that basis --"
1959.436,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5001.755,5002.694,"Now, Mr. --"
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5002.694,5003.089,-- on this procedure.
1959.436,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5003.089,5005.379,"-- Rothschild, may I ask you one -- just one more --"
1959.436,2,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5005.379,5005.575,"Yes, sir."
1959.436,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5005.575,5006.172,-- more question?
1959.436,3,27167,howard_a_heffron,,5014.676,5015.254,That is right.
1959.436,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5015.254,5016.754,-- of these units.
1959.436,4,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5019.431,5020.66,Yes.
1959.436,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5020.66,5025.664,If that -- if that stipulation had been -- not been made by the Government --
1959.436,4,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5025.664,5025.929,Yes.
1959.436,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5025.929,5037.674,-- would there have been any issues available to you in this lawsuit that were -- that were actually foreclosed by reason of this stipulation?
1959.436,4,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5037.674,5039.468,"Well, certainly, Your Honor."
1959.436,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5115.574,5115.758,Thank you.
1959.436,4,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5115.758,5116.379,That's true on both.
1959.436,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5116.379,5117.085,Let me ask you one question --
1959.436,4,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5117.085,5117.355,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.436,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5117.355,5119.05,-- about that issue of fact.
1959.436,4,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5123.012,5124.135,They are room units.
1959.436,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5124.135,5128.75,"Well, why -- why do you say there'd be a question as whether or not they were household appliance?"
1959.436,4,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5128.75,5133.423,"Because the larger -- and this -- the evidence shows this, Your Honor, in the record."
1959.436,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5136.878,5137.497,There is an arbitrary line --
1959.436,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5137.497,5139.538,I'm not talking about the horsepower question.
1959.436,4,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5142.071,5147.135,"Well, that's -- that's the principal distinction between household and commercial is size."
1959.436,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5147.353,5152.124,"Do you mean when it get above -- you -- when it get above one ton, they are not household?"
1959.436,4,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5152.124,5160.781,"When you get up to one or one and a half, you will find their primary use is -- is not in house -- and that was certainly true when the regulation was passed in 1948, the -- there's consumption."
1959.436,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5160.781,5162.111,"Now, I want to ask you one other question."
1959.436,4,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5162.111,5162.692,Yes.
1959.436,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5162.692,5164.068,Curiosity maybe.
1959.436,4,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5164.068,5165.312,Yes.
1959.436,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5165.312,5168.878,Doesn't that tax go up on June the 1st?
1959.436,4,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5168.878,5170.159,"No, Your Honor, unless I'm wrong."
1959.436,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5170.159,5172.975,On the household units?
1959.436,4,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5188.571,5190.259,"Oh, no, I think it's still 10%."
1959.436,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5192.857,5193.876,That means this case is done.
1959.436,5,27167,howard_a_heffron,,5193.876,5197.884,That reference is probably to the applicability of the new regulations.
1959.436,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5197.884,5199.245,"Oh, the new regulations."
1959.436,5,27167,howard_a_heffron,,5199.483,5199.755,(Voice Overlap) --
1959.436,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5199.755,5200.597,-- is being talked about.
1959.436,6,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5200.597,5206.177,All would impose the tax on units which had (Inaudible) not been taxable under the rulings.
1959.436,7,27167,howard_a_heffron,,5206.177,5207.239,"Well, yes."
1959.436,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5207.239,5208.387,On June the 1st.
1959.436,7,27167,howard_a_heffron,,5208.387,5209.31,"Well, that -- that must be --"
1959.436,8,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5209.31,5217.609,"Oh, that is in effect already but it only applies to units which were sold by the manufacturer subsequent to a given date."
1959.436,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5217.609,5219.093,Subsequent to the time this --
1959.436,9,27167,howard_a_heffron,,5219.093,5220.028,That's right.
1959.436,10,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5220.028,5220.356,This new regulation --
1959.436,10,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5220.356,5220.995,-- ruling (Voice Overlap) --
1959.436,10,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5220.995,5222.126,-- that came out.
1959.436,10,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5230.031,5230.678,"Thank you, Mr. --"
1959.436,10,23005,edwin_a_rothschild,,5230.678,5231.481,Thank you.
1959.436,10,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5231.773,5237.267,-- Mr. Rothschild.[Laughter]
