1980.79-404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.107,We'll hear arguments first this morning in the United States against Cortez.
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,13.042,15.62,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,259.223,265.143,"Mrs. Etkind, this is a fairly remote and deserted part of Arizona, is it not?"
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,265.143,265.955,"Yes, it is, sir."
1980.79-404,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,268.127,270.64,"Let me continue, while you are interrupted."
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,277.03,278.576,--Yes.
1980.79-404,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,291.226,291.976,But that's all?
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,292.945,295.178,"--Yes, yes."
1980.79-404,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,303.081,304.284,From the east or from the west?
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,305.549,306.314,--Yes.
1980.79-404,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,306.314,308.658,Taking them back to the east?
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,308.658,309.391,Yes.
1980.79-404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,312.124,317.216,But how could they tell from the footprints that it took 6 to 8 hours and that they walked in the dark?
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,317.216,320.293,"--I'm sorry, 8 to 12 hours that they were walking in the dark."
1980.79-404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,320.293,321.449,"Oh, 8 to 12, that's right."
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,321.449,337.366,"Well it was an approximately, 27-mile journey, and the officers, from their previous experience, estimated that forced marches of this type take two and a half to three miles per hour, so from that, they came to 8--"
1980.79-404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,337.366,340.208,"So that really wasn't just based on the footprints, it's based on their experiences?"
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,340.208,351.875,"--Also on their experience, yes, but on the fact that the footprints indicated a forced march, there weren't stops, no evidence of snacking along the way or taking breaks."
1980.79-404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,351.875,352.437,I see.
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,352.437,362.278,"Based on these facts and inferences Officer Gray and his partner, Ronald Evans, made the following arrangements in an attempt to capture the Chevron."
1980.79-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,645.444,656.564,"It is not contended in this case, is it, Mrs. Etkind, that this stop was, the locus of this stop was the border or its equivalent?"
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,656.564,658.688,"The border or its, i'm sorry, I didn't--"
1980.79-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,658.688,659.281,Or its equivalent?
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,659.281,660.703,"--No, it is not contended."
1980.79-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,720.664,721.46,Mrs. Etkind?
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,721.46,721.928,Yes.
1980.79-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,721.928,728.051,Here the Court of Appeals majority reversed the finding of the District Court.
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,742.109,746.888,Well I think the ultimate question of whether founded suspicion exists is a question of law.
1980.79-404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,752.87,755.932,"Mrs. Etkind, may I ask you another question about founded suspicion?"
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,766.491,768.785,--I think--
1980.79-404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,768.785,769.457,"And if so, where?"
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,769.457,773.58,--I think the words in Brignoni-Ponce may be reasonable suspicion.
1980.79-404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,773.58,774.815,"That's the way I read it, too."
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,774.815,775.549,Oh--
1980.79-404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,775.549,780.703,Do you think it's a different test than the test of Terry against Ohio?
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,780.703,785.45,"--No, I don't think so."
1980.79-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,792.558,794.9,Terry v. Ohio was--
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,794.9,797.133,I think--
1980.79-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,797.133,805.257,"--a decision that limited... that is justification for a frisk for a weapon or a gun, wasn't it?"
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,805.257,806.083,--That's true.
1980.79-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,806.63,807.833,That's not this case?
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,807.833,809.034,"--No, that's not this case."
1980.79-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,813.83,814.86,Brignoni-Ponce is the case?
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,814.86,816.079,"--Yes, it is."
1980.79-404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.641,825.841,"But your, the government's position is that the founded suspicion test is the same as the Terry test?"
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,825.841,835.633,--The Brignoni-Ponce test--
1980.79-404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.633,836.821,Because that's reasonable suspicion?
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,836.821,838.46,--Yes.
1980.79-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,838.46,850.564,"Well you can only slice a cheese so thin, from probable cause to founded suspicion to reasonable suspicion."
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,874.758,875.321,I think that's right.
1980.79-404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,876.743,879.788,You're not asking us to slice the cheese any more thinly than--
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,879.788,883.458,"--Oh, I certainly am not, and in fact, the case certainly would not require that."
1980.79-404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,891.642,897.0,"--Of course, you may have been only paying some deference to the language that this Court has used?"
1980.79-404,0,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,906.933,910.885,--It is the language that the Court of Appeals used in this case.
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1155.644,1159.659,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1214.356,1227.412,"Actually, in Martinez-Fuerte, the term is that rational inferences from those facts that reasonably warrant suspicion, is it not?"
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1227.412,1228.74,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1228.74,1238.392,"And again, if you want to make fine points about distinctions, you consider that slightly different than reasonable suspicion?"
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1238.392,1241.079,Founded suspicion?
1980.79-404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1309.848,1332.855,"Well what about the situation you have here where you have a divided panel of the Court of Appeals and the dissenting member is from Arizona and the District Court has found, presumably on the eyewitness testimony before him that there is articulable suspicion."
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1342.194,1347.254,In this case the District Court made no finding; the court simply heard the evidence.
1980.79-404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1386.614,1394.548,Are you saying... are you telling us that they may not take judicial notice of the geography of the area?
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1394.548,1396.501,"Generally,... the Court can do that."
1980.79-404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1408.214,1423.551,"And there's also a rule that if a defendant on trial for a particular offense wishes to suppress evidence, the burden is on the person moving to suppress, is it not?"
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1423.551,1424.051,"Yes, that's correct."
1980.79-404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1448.761,1465.753,"Well, supposing there's been no warrant and the government is operating on a theory that there was founded suspicion or whatever one wants to call it, the defendant claims there is none."
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1483.746,1484.512,"--Yes, yes."
1980.79-404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1521.543,1525.855,Well did the defendant object in the trial court on Fourth Amendment grounds?
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1525.855,1526.744,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1550.249,1568.915,"Couldn't the government, by statute or regulation, or the Bureau, declare that any vehicle over 5 tons, 4 tons, within 25 miles of the border or 15 miles of the border, should be stopped and searched?"
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1568.915,1572.773,--I don't believe so.
1980.79-404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1580.206,1593.108,"Well how do the states then get by, to use the vernacular, with having these pull-off areas and requiring every truck over a certain tonnage to stop to be checked and weighed?"
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1593.108,1607.54,The Court has taken the position that those types of intrusions are made as a regulatory matter that the public has the ability to know that if they are driving these types of vehicles that there will be these checkpoints.
1980.79-404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1613.787,1624.719,"Well that's my hypothesis, that every truck, every vehicle over X-tons, let's make it 2 tons, may be stopped."
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1624.719,1630.796,"But in this particular case, there's no rational basis for that, and there's no notice to the public--"
1980.79-404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1630.796,1631.546,"No, no."
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1648.944,1650.303,--I don't believe so.
1980.79-404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.81,1675.965,Well can a state require that all trucks be stopped?
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1675.965,1678.995,--The Court hasn't--
1980.79-404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1678.995,1681.072,"Every state does it, doesn't it?"
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1681.072,1683.087,--I'm not aware of whether every state does it--
1980.79-404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1683.087,1685.773,"Well, at a border when a truck is going through the state?"
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1685.773,1686.913,--The state does not do that.
1980.79-404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.194,1697.815,"Well certainly, going from Arizona to California or California to Arizona, both states stop trucks and cars as well."
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1699.425,1701.095,--For purposes of inspecting fruit.
1980.79-404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1701.095,1702.267,Oh.
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1712.246,1717.448,"Yes, but the Court has... has two ways of looking at this."
1980.79-404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1785.452,1791.231,"But In Ybarra nobody was on the move, the people were simply standing around the bar."
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1794.963,1802.054,"--In this case, let me make an even closer case then, that would be... in this case there's no crossing a state line."
1980.79-404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1848.957,1850.051,"Mr. Velasco, we have a round trip here."
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1850.051,1854.142,"Your Honor, without more, and that's all."
1980.79-404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1855.017,1856.111,It's fairly significant isn't it?
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1856.111,1857.142,--It might be--
1980.79-404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1857.142,1868.043,"In a deserted area, unless, I mean, you did suggest maybe they were picking up astronomers or something like that, but at this hour of the night it's not totally without reason to assume it has some connection, is it?"
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1868.043,1874.587,"--Well, it's not reasonable to seize the person, but it might be a basis for focusing suspicion."
1980.79-404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1895.767,1910.057,Well are you suggesting that perhaps the regulation could have been met by following that vehicle to its destination and watch the illegal aliens disgorge from the camper?
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1910.057,1910.901,Well certainly--
1980.79-404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1910.901,1911.572,Is that the way to do it?
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1911.572,1913.541,"--Certainly they could have done that, Your Honor."
1980.79-404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1920.038,1923.053,How many illegal aliens were in the camper?
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1923.053,1927.566,"There were six in this camper, they expected 8 to 20, at least."
1980.79-404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1969.925,1978.843,What deference do you think the Court of Appeals was required to give to the findings of the District Court in a case like this?
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1978.843,1987.417,"The Court, the Ninth Circuit has adopted the clearly erroneous test, where the Court, the lower court makes findings."
1980.79-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1987.417,1991.181,"Well that's the standard of Rule 52(a), that's the Ninth Circuit."
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,1991.181,1993.868,But that's the standard.
1980.79-404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2002.584,2010.283,Well isn't there a presumption that when denies a motion it makes every finding that is necessary for the denial of that motion?
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,2010.283,2015.218,That may be the case.
1980.79-404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2034.351,2045.316,"Can you point out which of the suppositions that the officers were making in reaching their total conclusion, proved to be untrue?"
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,2052.61,2059.153,"Well that's, in a hindsight evaluation, that's... it's not possible."
1980.79-404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2059.153,2060.934,"Well of course, it is hindsight now."
1980.79-404,1,18125,bernardo_p_velasco,,2065.728,2067.072,Well of course.
1980.79-404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2108.446,2114.085,Mr. Minker.
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2114.085,2122.331,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-404,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2202.956,2206.548,"Two questions, Mr. Minker."
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2215.857,2231.538,"I think basically, in the practical day-to-day experience of the District Courts, the Defendant who has been seized without a warrant, simply comes forward and says I have been seized without a warrant, my constitutional rights have--"
1980.79-404,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2231.538,2233.96,"Well yes, he has to first say that, and that gives him--"
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2233.96,2234.35,--Yes.
1980.79-404,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2234.35,2234.913,"--a burden, doesn't it?"
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2234.913,2235.912,Yes.
1980.79-404,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2237.459,2254.983,"Generally, when the government seeks to introduce evidence, or proposes to introduce evidence, according to whether it's a motion to suppress or objection to the introduction evidence, the person who makes the motion to suppress or the person who objects to the introduction of the evidence has the burden, doesn't he?"
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2254.983,2256.513,That is correct.
1980.79-404,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2256.513,2259.793,"Not the government, not the prosecution?"
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2259.793,2280.769,"Well, all you really do is make the motion, the prosecution, as happened in this case, the transcript clearly shows the government proceeds on to make its case, the government started its case, the government called its witnesses Agent Rayburn and Agent Gray and the other agent and this is what happens in all of these cases."
1980.79-404,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2289.578,2290.719,"Well he has to do more than just say that, doesn't he?"
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2290.719,2294.155,"--Well, he files a memorandum pointing out why he feels--"
1980.79-404,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2294.155,2299.965,"First of all, that the search or the seizure was without a warrant, doesn't he?"
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2299.965,2300.152,--Yes.
1980.79-404,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2300.152,2307.039,"Without probable cause, and in the Ninth Circuit without founded suspicion."
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2316.754,2326.36,"No, I believe it was born in the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit has said that they are using that phrase the same as reasonable suspicion."
1980.79-404,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2342.197,2356.519,"Well Mr. Minker, I have some trouble with the printed appendix here, in that, it seems to be solely a hearing on a motion to suppress."
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2365.827,2374.59,"No, there was a trial, in the case of Mr. Cortez, there was... there were two trials, the first ended in a hung jury, and in the second, there was a conviction."
1980.79-404,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2379.37,2382.197,And what was the verdict in the Hernandez case?
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2382.197,2385.586,On the second trial he was found guilty.
1980.79-404,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2385.586,2387.414,And how about--
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2387.414,2388.942,Did you say in Hernandez or in Cortez?
1980.79-404,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2389.442,2390.52,--I said Hernandez.
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2390.52,2391.864,--He was guilty.
1980.79-404,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2478.613,2483.203,"Was it not a series of hunches, rather than one?"
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2483.203,2516.269,"--Well, if you call their profile one hunch and there's no question that the agent said I had a profile here, and he says it at page 78 and 79 of the joint appendix, he is questioned, and he says I have a profile, the profile is based on the fact that any car, virtually any car but a sedan... and excluding linen trucks, for some reason commercial vans, that's capable of carrying 8 to 20 aliens fits my profile."
1980.79-404,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2528.825,2530.09,But that... wasn't all over the state.
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2530.09,2531.106,--I beg your pardon?
1980.79-404,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2531.106,2534.401,They didn't stop every truck in the north end of the state--
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2534.401,2535.728,Well I said south--
1980.79-404,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.728,2538.461,--That was going east or west at a certain time.
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2543.335,2544.585,--Highway 86.
1980.79-404,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2544.585,2551.567,"interstate 86, it's way south... it's south of I-10, very close to the Mexican border."
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2551.567,2554.144,"It is Highway 86, and to--"
1980.79-404,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2554.144,2558.142,And not just anywhere on Highway 86.
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2558.142,2560.751,"--Well, in our opposition we attached a map."
1980.79-404,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2617.929,2623.616,"But no one would take 86 from Phoenix to Tucson, they'd take I-10."
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2623.616,2626.192,"Well, I respectfully disagree."
1980.79-404,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2636.329,2638.345,Well but--
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2640.032,2645.904,Only if I'm hoping for a very pretty daybreak.
1980.79-404,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2807.777,2814.338,Or that it wasn't equipped with shock absorbers that could be pushed up.
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2814.338,2816.071,Well--
1980.79-404,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2816.071,2820.648,"Which you can see in any store, any day, right?"
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2820.648,2822.787,--Well I assume that--
1980.79-404,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2822.787,2825.615,"And you can pump them up, you pump up the shock absorber."
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2825.615,2827.083,--That can be done.
1980.79-404,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2834.424,2851.7,"Now when, take that episode now, down and back in 90 minutes, do you say that the inferences which the officers drew from that and all the other circumstances, was reasonable or was it irrational, or totally unfounded?"
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2851.7,2856.165,It was not sufficient for the following three reasons.
1980.79-404,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2886.763,2892.558,"Well maybe your way would be better and maybe they should do it your way, but we have to deal with it the way it is here."
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2900.304,2906.334,"--Those inferences do not, in and by themselves, do not equal a founded suspicion."
1980.79-404,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2909.129,2909.692,That wasn't my question.
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2912.628,2914.908,Do not equal a founded suspicion.
1980.79-404,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2914.908,2917.907,And you say that's not... that's irrational?
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2917.907,2920.14,I say that is not founded suspicion.
1980.79-404,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2984.333,2991.737,Does the record show how many innocent travelers were interfered with in the course of this search?
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,2991.737,3001.514,"The record shows that they saw 10 to 15 vehicles go by them in a westerly direction, five of which basically meet their profile but they didn't stop those five."
1980.79-404,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3004.046,3009.231,"So they stopped only this vehicle, in other words?"
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,3009.231,3014.336,The other vehicle that met their profile had not come back as of the time they stopped this vehicle.
1980.79-404,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3028.44,3032.861,"So, what your complaint is, they should have stopped more vehicles, not less?"
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,3032.861,3034.891,--I beg your pardon.
1980.79-404,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3055.945,3060.053,"Well and if it makes a round trip too, which not many did."
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,3072.815,3084.793,I personally have had a relatively significant number of cases where I've even had written opinions on founded suspicion or probable cause cases.
1980.79-404,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3091.041,3092.602,"Oh, I see."
1980.79-404,2,41752,s_jeffrey_minker,,3095.274,3098.054,This winter he did not choose to go out.
1980.79-404,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3102.584,3104.021,Very well.
1980.79-404,3,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3109.019,3110.314,"A couple of points, Your Honor."
1980.79-404,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3110.314,3110.689,All right.
1980.79-404,3,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3110.689,3123.402,"With respect to the interference to innocent travelers, just to clarify it the only vehicle that was stopped during that entire five-hour surveillance period was the Respondents' camper."
1980.79-404,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3163.823,3166.494,Very well.
