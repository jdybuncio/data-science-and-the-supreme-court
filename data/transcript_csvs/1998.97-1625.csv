1998.97-1625,0,38294,peter_m_sfikas,,52.195,55.609,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,154.608,156.731,"Would you just remind me, counsel?"
1998.97-1625,0,38294,peter_m_sfikas,,163.066,173.855,"If the Court please, I've searched the record and I come to the conclusion that the Kansas City Area Hospital Association was not a 501(c)(3)."
1998.97-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,173.855,186.372,Do you recognize that there might be some 501(c)(6) organizations that would fit the definition of carries on business for the profit of its members?
1998.97-1625,0,38294,peter_m_sfikas,,186.372,187.142,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,188.804,195.608,"So, you're distinguishing among 501(c)... you're not saying all nonprofits are out."
1998.97-1625,0,38294,peter_m_sfikas,,195.608,196.389,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,196.839,204.544,"And so, now you're going to tell us why, say, the Dental Association is different from the Real Estate Board."
1998.97-1625,0,38294,peter_m_sfikas,,204.544,205.335,Yes.
1998.97-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,247.983,254.068,"Well, how about a trade organization that's there to promote, say, eggs?"
1998.97-1625,0,38294,peter_m_sfikas,,258.692,271.482,"--Well, Your Honor, in the Seventh Circuit case involving egg nutrition, they made a... the trial court... and it was affirmed in the Seventh Circuit... made a specific finding that they were organized for the profit of the Egg Commission."
1998.97-1625,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.641,292.643,"Well, I guess there are some benefits, though, for the dentists to belong to the Dental Association: better insurance vehicles and other benefits that the organization may provide to its members."
1998.97-1625,0,38294,peter_m_sfikas,,292.643,292.993,--Well--
1998.97-1625,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,292.993,297.098,Do you say that the organization provides no benefits to its members?
1998.97-1625,0,38294,peter_m_sfikas,,297.098,306.955,"--Oh, no, I wouldn't... I wouldn't say that because the... the membership dues for the tripartite membership in dentistry is over 1,000 dollars, and I think they get their... their membership benefits."
1998.97-1625,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,329.9,340.208,"Wasn't there a finding someplace that the value of the membership to each dentist was worth... I don't know 20,000 dollars or something?"
1998.97-1625,0,38294,peter_m_sfikas,,340.208,342.018,"That was... that was not a finding, Your Honor."
1998.97-1625,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,377.577,392.777,But I read section 44 to say an organization which is organized to carry on business for its own profit or for the profit of its members.
1998.97-1625,0,38294,peter_m_sfikas,,401.723,405.443,"Well, if the Court please, that turns on the definition of profit."
1998.97-1625,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,405.443,406.124,Yes.
1998.97-1625,0,38294,peter_m_sfikas,,406.124,415.15,"And the Community Blood Bank case said that that's the excess of revenue over expenses, either paid or contemplated to be paid."
1998.97-1625,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,419.184,421.806,"No, but it says, or the profit of its members."
1998.97-1625,0,38294,peter_m_sfikas,,437.837,438.548,Well--
1998.97-1625,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,438.548,442.341,--in the business of... the profession of dentistry.
1998.97-1625,0,38294,peter_m_sfikas,,442.341,455.008,"--If the Court... well, no, Your Honor, not in the... not in the sense of the profit, the way that term is defined in the Blood Bank case and in a legion of cases that define the term profit, Your Honor."
1998.97-1625,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1778.364,1786.91,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
