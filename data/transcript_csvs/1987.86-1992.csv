1987.86-1992,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.179,"We will hear arguments next in Number 86-1992, Immigration and Naturalization Service against Antolin Punsalan Pangilinan, and consolidated case."
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,60.612,87.379,"Mr Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether the Ninth Circuit was correct in ordering citizenship for the 16 respondents, all Philippine veterans of World War Two, under a statute that expired in 1946."
1987.86-1992,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,276.204,280.448,And you say that despite the language of the statute.
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,280.448,282.869,"The language of the '40 Act, you mean?"
1987.86-1992,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,317.964,321.106,"We have naturalized a lot of them, though, over there, didn't we?"
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,321.106,329.371,"We did, that's true, and in fact that serves to undermine respondent's argument that there was something invideous about what was being done."
1987.86-1992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,475.383,477.086,Maybe I don't really understand your argument.
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,480.098,483.03,We are saying at the time the statute was enacted--
1987.86-1992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,483.03,483.641,Which was when?
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,483.641,485.073,--1942.
1987.86-1992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,485.073,488.636,And what was going on in the international world at that time?
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,488.636,491.557,We would concede that there were battles--
1987.86-1992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,491.557,494.948,Wasn't the main fighting by the American forces at Bataan at that time?
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,494.948,497.332,"--There was significant fighting there, but one--"
1987.86-1992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,497.332,497.822,Significant?
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,502.616,514.253,"--That is correct, but it is simply... there is no reflection in the legislative history that we have found or that respondents have found that Congress was acting to reward those individuals the 250,000 people."
1987.86-1992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,514.253,515.155,"Well, who were they rewarding?"
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,515.155,524.642,"They were rewarding, there were some 80,000 people who were naturalized around the world, in Iceland, England, members of the--"
1987.86-1992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,524.642,526.585,You think they are the people Congress was thinking about in early 1942?
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,526.585,528.025,--We think so.
1987.86-1992,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,571.157,576.22,"Well, what if we disagree and think it was intended to apply to the Philippines?"
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,576.22,580.344,Then we still think for several reasons that that is not dispositive.
1987.86-1992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,724.821,726.051,"That is a different Congress, of course."
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,728.815,732.536,"That is true but it is very close in time, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-1992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,808.7,811.919,"Maybe you will touch it, but why was the '46 law passed?"
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,811.919,813.622,--The '46 law?
1987.86-1992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,813.622,814.052,Yes.
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,814.052,823.89,"In part it was passed, Justice Marshall, because of a concern by Congress about various kinds of monetary benefits going to--"
1987.86-1992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,823.89,825.131,They didn't want the Philippinos to get it.
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,825.131,826.292,--They didn't want the--
1987.86-1992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,826.292,828.404,So it was aimed at to get rid of them.
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,828.404,829.645,"--No, I don't think so."
1987.86-1992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,836.32,839.803,"That just in case they might get it, they are going to make sure they don't get it."
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,841.973,850.918,"--But what Congress was focusing on, Justice Marshall, was the fact that their enactments were premised on membership in the United States armed forces."
1987.86-1992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,902.545,905.798,"Let's not discuss Senator Hayden, please."
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,905.798,907.298,--Let's not--
1987.86-1992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.298,909.028,Let's not discuss it here.
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,912.932,917.997,--I am not sure what Your Honor is--
1987.86-1992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,917.997,918.114,Right.
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,918.465,920.788,--I was responding--
1987.86-1992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,920.788,921.697,You were answering my question.
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,921.697,923.349,"--Yes, I was responding as to what was behind--"
1987.86-1992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,923.349,925.331,And I am trying to tell you that that won't help me.
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,925.331,927.902,--Let me--
1987.86-1992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.902,929.394,"Let me ask you this, Mr. Klonoff."
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,937.941,940.826,"--That was in large part, but what I am saying is--"
1987.86-1992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,940.826,945.167,"I mean, it would have been very, very expensive to add this additional group of veterans to that entitlement."
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,945.167,947.611,"--Well, the statute was worded in a very open-ended fashion."
1987.86-1992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,949.22,951.132,"I mean, wasn't that the central purpose of it?"
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,951.132,966.253,"--That was, and all I am pointing out is that a later remark about one of the purposes of the statute being to make clear that for purposes of the citizenship program members of the Commonwealth Army were not to be treated as in the armed forces."
1987.86-1992,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1267.047,1279.415,"Mr. Klonoff, then it is your submission that the 1948 act cut off the claims of some people who had made application to the earlier act and would have qualified under the earlier Act?"
1987.86-1992,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1279.415,1280.687,--That is exactly our submission.
1987.86-1992,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.701,1833.494,"Thank you, Mr. Klonoff."
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,1835.176,1844.904,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there are three things I hope you will do when you decide these cases."
1987.86-1992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1887.672,1892.204,Are you asking us to overrule a part of Hibi?
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,1892.204,1896.888,I am asking you to take another look at the facts in Hibi.
1987.86-1992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1943.9,1946.334,"It not only seemed to conclude, it did conclude."
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,1946.334,1949.847,"Well, that is not the way the majority characterized what happened."
1987.86-1992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1983.58,1994.769,"But our opinion in Hibi concludes as the Solicitor General has reminded us saying that the respondent's claim must fail, and yet the Ninth Circuit has gone back and said, no, it need not fail."
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,1994.769,2010.518,"Well, in Hibi the majority said it must fail because there was nothing more than neglect, and it was obvious from the opinion that the majority considered it nothing but a matter of neglect because the Hibi decision was based upon the old Utah Power and Light case."
1987.86-1992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.518,2017.623,Do you think it is open to a lower court to recanvass facts that have been characterized by this Court in a particular way?
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2017.623,2022.696,I don't think this Court characterized that in the way that the court below saw it.
1987.86-1992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2030.022,2034.867,Were there new facts presented to the Ninth Circuit that had not been presented earlier?
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2034.867,2035.956,"--No, the facts are identical."
1987.86-1992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2047.275,2053.741,"Yes, but ordinarily when the Ninth Circuit analyzes a case one way and we analyze it another, we prevail."
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2055.751,2070.821,"--Well, I think it is important how perception of what happened determines how one analyzes the case, and the majority in Hibi perceived the case as nothing but mere neglect, whereas the true facts were much more than mere neglect."
1987.86-1992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2087.35,2097.729,Is the Solicitor General correct or incorrect in saying that the Ninth Circuit did not pass on these constitutional issues?
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2097.729,2098.54,"No, he is correct."
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2227.158,2228.769,Or that he was authorized to do it.
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2228.769,2229.47,I beg your pardon?
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2229.47,2237.675,"All that that necessarily acknowledged was that he had the authority to do it, not that he was obliged to do it."
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2237.675,2239.538,I think it is more than just--
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.538,2241.248,It doesn't necessarily prove that he was obliged to do it.
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2241.248,2265.834,"--Well, he looked upon it that way, and I think certainly the language of the statute said he is authorized to do this, but in the context of the statute, the purpose being to naturalize veterans overseas, Congress certainly made that intention clear, and since they set up this mechanism for doing it, it seems to me it was apparent that he had to follow and implement the statute by following that mechanism."
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2265.834,2266.966,Other things being equal.
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2277.535,2277.845,Right.
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.175,2279.046,But the statute was not mandatory.
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2283.059,2295.488,--I think there is a difference between saying that he didn't have to send an examiner to a particular country because he didn't have the fund or he didn't have the manpower or because of the exigencies of war he couldn't send people to certain parts of the world.
1987.86-1992,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2313.379,2315.031,"Mr. Ungar, I dropped a stitch somewhere."
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2320.015,2320.515,Yes.
1987.86-1992,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2320.515,2326.519,"Well, the Solicitor General constantly refers to the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines."
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2327.891,2337.188,"Well, there are two segments of the armed forces insofar as it applied to Philippinos who were residing in the Philippines."
1987.86-1992,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2343.081,2344.764,Were your veterans in the Philippine Scouts?
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2344.764,2346.344,Some were and some weren't.
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2418.476,2435.417,"It was argued in Hibi, was it not, although it doesn't appear in our opinion, the argument was made that it was unlawful for the Attorney General not to station these officers in the Philippines?"
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2436.108,2439.31,The argument was made that it was unlawful for him to withdraw the officer--
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2439.31,2439.54,--Right.
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2439.54,2447.456,"--for the avowed purpose of preventing people who were entitled to be naturalized, for the avowed purpose of preventing them from being naturalized."
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2447.456,2450.579,And that was the basis for the Ninth Circuit's holding that time around.
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2450.579,2454.422,That was the Ninth Circuit's... in addition the Ninth Circuit's--
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2454.422,2455.951,So it is not a new legal point you are bringing up.
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2464.449,2466.102,"--Well, you can also remedy it--"
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2466.102,2467.711,Is there any new legal issue that is before us in this case?
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2467.711,2468.593,"--I am sorry, I missed the last--"
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2468.593,2477.359,Is there any new legal issue that is before us in this case other than the difference between estoppel and equitable discretion?
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2477.359,2485.346,--I think there is a difference between estoppel and equitable discretion perhaps on the one hand and due process arguments on the other.
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2485.346,2486.538,The due process argument.
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2487.339,2499.748,"I think there is a difference there, and I think that is an important difference, because if you are considering the due process violation, this issue of affirmative misconduct is irrelevant."
1987.86-1992,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2827.692,2846.312,"Mr. Ungar, would you comment on your opponent's argument that they could not have been prejudiced if none of them even knew about the program?"
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2846.312,2864.285,"Well, the government suggests that none of these people were injured because we don't know whether they ever would have found out about their opportunity to apply had the examiner remained on duty in the Philippines during that particular period of time."
1987.86-1992,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2894.695,2897.236,"Well, didn't the government have a duty to tell them?"
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2897.236,2901.801,"I think so, and I think there was an obligation to do that."
1987.86-1992,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2901.801,2906.553,So that is like the guy that was charged with murdering his parents and pleading he was an orphan.
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2914.11,2920.725,"Yes, I think it is significant there, too, because other soldiers elsewhere were notified of the opportunity of applying."
1987.86-1992,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2923.299,2926.273,"That is a pretty hard argument to make in light of Hibi, isn't it?"
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2926.273,2929.786,--It is a hard argument under that... I agree with you in that respect.
1987.86-1992,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2951.631,2953.892,They were on a march across the island.
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2953.892,2954.824,--I beg your pardon?
1987.86-1992,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2954.824,2956.805,They were on a march clean across the island.
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2956.805,2957.255,That's correct.
1987.86-1992,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2957.255,2959.146,"No food, no anything."
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2959.146,2959.486,They certainly were.
1987.86-1992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2984.192,2988.816,"But, Mr. Ungar, Congress itself changed its mind in 1948, didn't it?"
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2988.816,2989.186,That is true.
1987.86-1992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2989.186,2991.449,It is not as if this had always been on the books.
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2998.384,3011.203,"Well, first of all, that was another Congress, and secondly, this was 1948, and I think there is no evidence in this record to show that Congress knew that the Attorney General had violated his duty under the 1942 Act."
1987.86-1992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3023.982,3036.521,"Well, but if the Solicitor General is correct, I would think maybe that isn't right because I understood him to say that those whose applications were pending and qualified, some of them were cut off under the 1948 Act."
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3036.521,3044.197,"--That is true, and it is interesting also, Your Honor, that Mr. Klonoff refers to the Category Two veterans and Category One veterans."
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3119.859,3122.531,"Of course, the whole thing might have been a mistake from the beginning."
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3129.196,3141.694,"One could have made that interpretation, I suppose, and if they had made that interpretation I guess we wouldn't be here today, but the fact is that that was the interpretation that the Attorney General made in 1945."
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3141.694,3153.903,"I understand, but it makes the injustice, if that is what it was, seem a little less acute when it was a dicey question whether that language would have been interpreted to include Philippinos in any event."
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3153.903,3155.953,"Well, that question has never really--"
1987.86-1992,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3155.953,3162.338,"To... one group of people on the basis of race and denied them something, I don't know what else you can call it."
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3162.338,3165.36,--I think that is also true.
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3171.766,3172.057,Yoi can't make it... paint it over.
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3180.032,3180.253,I don't think that is true at all.
1987.86-1992,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3188.521,3190.871,"--These people all served under General McArthur, didn't they?"
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3190.871,3191.482,"Yes, they did."
1987.86-1992,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3278.502,3288.359,"May I ask, is there any evidence as to whether there is any publicity in newspapers, even in Army papers, you know, the GI... I can't remember the name of it now, but this program wasn't discussed?"
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3288.359,3296.306,There is no evidence at all that I could find to show that these people in the Philippines were notified about their opportunity to apply for naturalization.
1987.86-1992,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3348.341,3354.706,"May, I ask one other question that goes to the remedy matter?"
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3358.649,3360.389,"No, we really don't know."
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3444.483,3447.815,"I assume that is irrelevant to our decision, of course."
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3447.815,3451.178,"--Well, I think it is relevant perhaps in the sense of balance."
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3451.178,3451.889,"I mean, whether we will provide justice to a lot of people or just a few people."
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3451.889,3452.831,I beg your pardon?
1987.86-1992,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3452.831,3458.946,"I am not sure it is, when you weigh the equities in a case like this, I think one might consider the public consequences."
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3460.017,3460.498,That is the point I was going to make.
1987.86-1992,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3460.498,3461.449,On the remedy issue.
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3461.449,3465.062,It may be relevant in a balancing of equities situation.
1987.86-1992,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3473.207,3473.778,What about the children?
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3473.778,3475.821,--The children are not going to benefit.
1987.86-1992,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3496.366,3506.524,"I suppose, but if they had had a chance to qualify and be naturalized way back when, then the children would have--"
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3506.524,3509.797,They would have been born in this country and they would be natural born citizens.
1987.86-1992,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3510.866,3511.046,--Yes.
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3513.75,3516.871,Persons who were born in the United States?
1987.86-1992,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3517.532,3528.72,Persons... children of these aging men who if they had been naturalized way back when would have been citizens of the United States.
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3528.72,3529.44,--That is probably true.
1987.86-1992,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3529.44,3531.613,Why won't equity protect them?
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3531.613,3536.856,"Well, it is another step forward, and I think it would be a much harder argument."
1987.86-1992,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3536.856,3537.577,That would be the next case.
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3541.458,3543.13,"Well, they could only come to this country--"
1987.86-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3543.13,3545.392,You are going to tell them you can leave the Philippines so long as you leave your family there?
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3545.392,3549.505,"--At that time, if they were still young enough and these people were naturalized they could have come."
1987.86-1992,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3560.334,3561.383,"Well, as of today the law is expired."
1987.86-1992,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3561.383,3573.801,"--I think the law may have expired, but for the reasons I have indicated, the Court has the authority to remedy the wrong that was done to these people either on constitutional or equitable principles."
1987.86-1992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3614.949,3616.762,"Thank you, Mr. Ungar."
1987.86-1992,2,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3619.065,3638.187,"Very briefly, on the Hibi point I would just refer the Court to Page 3 of our reply brief, in which it is quite clear that the arguments made in Hibi by the respondent in the memorandum in opposition, which was the pleading before the Court since it was summarily reversed are identical to the arguments made here, the characterization of the case."
1987.86-1992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3638.187,3652.596,"Mr. Klonoff, on the equitable discretion point, how did these Class One veterans who had applied but not yet been naturalized, how did they get in if there is no equitable power to ignore the subsequent repealer of the law?"
1987.86-1992,2,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3652.596,3654.388,That is a very good question.
1987.86-1992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3666.188,3669.619,You mean the executive has that equitable power but the courts don't?
1987.86-1992,2,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3669.619,3671.662,"Well, the executive doesn't rule on naturalization."
1987.86-1992,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3683.76,3684.982,"Thank you, Mr. Klonoff."
