2015.14-7505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.245,"We'll hear argument next in Case No. 14-7505, Hurst v. Florida. Mr. Waxman."
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,7.245,23.94,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under Florida law, Timothy Hurst will go to his death despite the fact that a judge, not a jury, made the factual finding that rendered -- rendered him eligible for death."
2015.14-7505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,95.15,105.985,"Is there ever a case in which the jury found aggravators and recommended the death sentence, and the judge reversed that finding?"
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,105.985,108.14,There may well be.
2015.14-7505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,114.21,116.48,"Well, I mean, either -- either way, is -- is there -- is there --"
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,116.48,116.79,Yes.
2015.14-7505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.79,122.015,"-- is there ever a case in which the jury did not find an aggravating circumstance, but the judge did."
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,122.015,128.43,"Well, we don't ever know what the jury found about any of the specified aggravating circumstances."
2015.14-7505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,135.67,135.76,Right.
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,139.09,140.24,"Well, no."
2015.14-7505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,149.81,150.235,All right.
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,150.235,155.625,But the Florida Supreme Court -- and this is a -- this is a -- another Ring problem here.
2015.14-7505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,168.96,171.715,"Well, that's a common feature, though, of jury deliberations."
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,201.62,219.35,"Mr. Chief Justice, Florida -- and, Florida is the only State -- the only death penalty State and therefore the only State that does not require or permit the jury to be told that it has to agree."
2015.14-7505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,229.29,234.345,"Well, but isn't that true -- I mean, taking it even out of the death penalty context, that's true with every jury determination."
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,254.87,254.96,It --
2015.14-7505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,254.96,261.81,-- have to be agreement by the jury on a -- on the particular basis for their verdict.
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,261.81,265.31,"We're talking here, Mr. Chief Justice, about elements of the crime."
2015.14-7505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,307.96,308.74,I'm not sure.
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,309.14,310.81,-- a premise like that.
2015.14-7505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.81,322.635,"Are you sure that -- that if you have a crime that can be satisfied by various elements, the jury has to agree upon the specific element that satisfies it?"
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,322.635,354.49,"The jury -- if they are distinct elements, and this -- this implies the Schad point that the State is raising: If the State, consistent with long historical tradition and a finding of equal culpability, chooses to permit a particular element in Schad, it was premeditation, or the mental state to be satisfied either by premeditation or by felony murder, that's fine. But that is not the Florida system."
2015.14-7505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,416.04,436.17,"I -- I -- I would think that the -- I would think just the opposite, that --that the necessity of finding the elements of the crime goes all the way back into the mists of history. And this necessity of finding an aggravating factor, we made it up, right? I mean, that's just recent Supreme Court law."
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,436.17,436.48,Just --
2015.14-7505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,436.48,457.425,"And so if -- if even one of them should be satisfiable by simply finding the generic conclusion rather than agreeing upon the -- the particular species at issue, I would think it's -- it's -- it's the latter, rather than the former."
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,457.425,483.765,"Justice Scalia, I'm reminded of your separate opinion -- I think it was in Walton v. Arizona -- where you were choosing between two things that you didn't particularly like, and one of them was the fact that the court had made, recently or not, had made a finding of a -- beyond a reasonable doubt, a factual finding of a specified aggravating factor an element of the crime."
2015.14-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,514.14,514.74,Mr. Waxman --
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,514.74,517.625,"-- ability, opposite of the predicate of Schad."
2015.14-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,517.625,534.73,"Could I ask you this about Ring? I wasn't on the Court at the time of Ring, so could you tell me if Ring is entitled to greater weight as a precedent than, let's say, Gregg v. Georgia and the other cases upholding the constitutionality of the death penalty?"
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,534.73,544.72,"Oh, I'm not -- I -- I wouldn't be prepared to say -- to assign weight to either of them. I think Ring is certainly predicated on Gregg, to Justice Scalia's point."
2015.14-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,560.475,579.915,"Do you think this scheme, assuming we agree with Justice Scalia, that you don't really need unanimity, would this still be good law under Apodaca -- Apodaca --"
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,579.915,580.99,Well --
2015.14-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,580.99,591.41,"-- the case that said that we -- we needed a unanimous jury, but, you know, nine out of twelve is okay? Do you -- do you think seven out of five is okay?"
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,591.41,595.41,I hope it was clear from our brief that we think --
2015.14-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,595.41,595.66,It's not.
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,595.66,597.3,-- nine out of five is not okay.
2015.14-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,600.735,602.52,We're not required to do anything.
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,605.41,605.55,Well --
2015.14-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,605.55,607.05,-- but is it still good law.
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,607.05,607.64,"Well, six --"
2015.14-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,607.64,609.305,Shouldn't we overrule it?
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,609.305,613.855,"I -- we think, for the reasons stated in our brief, you should overrule it."
2015.14-7505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,644.43,649.555,"Well, wait a minute. They -- they -- they require unanimity for the -- for a conviction, right?"
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,649.555,650.34,Yes.
2015.14-7505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,650.89,654.48,Just -- just -- just they don't require unanimity on the sentence.
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,655.57,656.03,Justice --
2015.14-7505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,656.03,658.095,-- from whether the person committed the crime or not.
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,658.095,676.88,"Justice Scalia -- exactly. And, Justice Scalia, leaving aside our Eighth Amendment point in our brief that -- that followed on Justice Breyer's concurrence in Ring, the -- this is all about the eligibility, not the determination of what sentence applies."
2015.14-7505,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,781.96,804.44,"Mr. Waxman, do we -- do we just treat as irrelevant what was involved in this case, that is, the two aggravators that were alleged, the brutality of the murder and that it occurred during a robbery? Those were obvious that they existed, is that not so?"
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,804.44,806.16,I think it's not so.
2015.14-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,934.265,951.385,"Mr. Waxman, am -- am I understanding the case properly? The informant, who had all of the physical evidence, was the main identifier of the defendant, correct?"
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,951.385,952.365,Correct.
2015.14-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,952.365,952.77,And --
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,952.77,963.23,"Because there were -- there were -- there was an eyewitness from across the street who testified that he saw somebody go into the Popeye's, and he positively identified the defendant."
2015.14-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,963.23,964.36,"Now, did --"
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,964.36,971.775,"Now, I believe there was another cooperator who backed up Lee-Lee Smith's testimony."
2015.14-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,971.775,984.41,"So the defendant claimed, however, that this informant was the one who did the crime. Could the jury, under the evidence that existed, conclude that they both did it?"
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,984.41,985.675,Certainly.
2015.14-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,985.675,989.045,And that's why it's debatable whether it's harmless?
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,989.045,989.84,Yes.
2015.14-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,990.45,995.475,Because what makes it an aggravator is if he's the one who actually did the killing.
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,995.475,996.545,That's correct.
2015.14-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,996.545,997.21,That he wasn't --
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,997.21,999.34,"Well, that's what the jury was instructed."
2015.14-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,999.34,999.785,Uh-huh.
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,999.785,1009.015,"The jury was instructed that in order to find the felony murder aggravator, it had to find that the murder was committed in the course of him committing the robbery."
2015.14-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1009.015,1009.825,Personally?
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1009.825,1010.825,Yes.
2015.14-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1010.825,1011.22,All right.
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1011.64,1015.76,"But the -- the statute, the actual aggravator, is different."
2015.14-7505,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1018.46,1024.885,"Mr. Waxman, can I give you a hypothetical State system? And this is a two-part question."
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1092.425,1092.64,Okay.
2015.14-7505,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1095.87,1096.33,Yes.
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1096.33,1096.725,-- point.
2015.14-7505,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1209.56,1219.94,"Well, is that -- is that what makes a difference, then, in the end, that -- that you're saying that the jury has to be specifically told that that's what it's doing? That -- and you're saying --"
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1219.94,1220.53,"The jury, no."
2015.14-7505,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1220.53,1233.125,-- the necessary part of a constitutional system for the jury to be instructed that it has the responsibility to find the aggravating factor that serves as a precondition to death.
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1233.125,1248.3,"At a minimum, if, in fact, the jury is performing that function, it cannot, at least in a capital case, be told that it is not performing that function, that its advice is -- that its verdict is only advisory."
2015.14-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1248.3,1251.575,What if it's told that it has to decide on life or death.
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1260.265,1269.095,"If the -- I mean, there is no constitutional violation -- our view, and this again is, is Justice Breyer's Eighth Amendment point, which we endorse."
2015.14-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1292.66,1300.16,"Well, I'm trying to understand the limits of your argument that what is done under the Florida statute diminishes the jury's sense of responsibility."
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1309.41,1309.98,Well --
2015.14-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1309.98,1328.245,"Would that be the case -- isn't that case whether they -- whether they're told, you -- you make a recommendation and the judge decides, or you impose a sentence, but the judge can impose a different sentence, a lesser sentence? There's still -- they still don't have to bear the responsibility of making the absolutely final decision."
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1328.245,1405.26,"So, Justice Alito, let me separate out what I'm calling the selection decision, that is life or death and the weighing of ags and mits and the eligibility decision, which is all of the elements of capital murder have been found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury with either unanimously or a sufficient majority, and, therefore, when the sentencing jury is done, you are eligible for the death penalty, leaving aside the Eighth Amendment question whether the Constitution then require -- requires the jury to make the intensely moral judgment about whether the penalty should be life without parole or death, assuming that a judge can do that, so long as the jury is not told that its input, which is how the Florida Supreme Court has put it, is -- so long as they are not told that it's advisory, so long as they are told that you as the finders of fact have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that this capital crime was committed which includes the following elements, including one of the two specifying aggravators, the Constitution is satisfied. The -- the Caldwell problem is an Eighth Amendment problem."
2015.14-7505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1474.06,1474.6,You may.
2015.14-7505,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1474.6,1478.18,Thank you.
2015.14-7505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1478.18,1482.4,Mr. Winsor.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1482.4,1492.975,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Florida's capital sentencing system was constitutional before Ring v. Arizona, and it remains constitutional in light of Ring v. Arizona."
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1525.53,1525.77,I'm sorry.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1534.96,1539.925,"Well, I agree with the other side that there is a difference between the sentence selection and the sentence eligibility."
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1548.89,1564.285,"Could you tell me how this is different than Arizona? I mean, in terms of the system, just like in the Arizona case, there had been precedent by this Court that Arizona law had been constitutional."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1595.13,1596.35,"Well, if I could back up --"
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1596.35,1600.755,"Even when it says a murder has been committed, felony murder wasn't."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1605.02,1615.49,"We -- at the guilt phase they convicted of first degree murder, which could have either been felony murder with the predicate underlying felony being robbery or premeditated murder."
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1615.49,1616.89,So how do we know --
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1616.89,1617.84,I'm sorry?
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1617.84,1621.35,How do we know which one they picked? Which makes them eligible for the death penalty?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1621.35,1636.255,"Well, our position is that he became eligible at the sentencing phase when the jury made its advisory decision, because the jury at that phase was instructed, if you determine that no aggravating circumstances are found to exist, you must recommend life."
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1636.255,1640.225,But you do agree that that -- it doesn't require unanimous jury?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1640.225,1642.01,It does not require a unanimous jury.
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1642.01,1645.31,And a simple majority is all you need?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1645.31,1646.515,That's right.
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1646.515,1647.68,So we don't have --
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1647.68,1648.85,"That's right, but that's a jury finding."
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1648.85,1655.62,"-- an unanimous jury, even a functionally equivalent unanimous jury, finding those aggravators."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1655.62,1656.27,I'm sorry?
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1656.27,1663.4,We don't have a unanimous or functionally unanimous jury finding those aggravators.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1663.4,1681.02,"Our reliance for the -- the final eligibility determination is that seven to five. But I would make this point: The seven to five -- there are two things that go on when the -- when the jury determines whether someone should be sentenced to death or not. First, the jury looks and determines whether the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt an aggravating circumstance."
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1695.92,1696.4,I'm sorry.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1698.635,1699.24,I'm sorry?
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1699.24,1700.765,It's not asked to find an aggravator.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1700.765,1701.42,"It is, Your Honor."
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1704.53,1704.63,I know.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1706.73,1707.22,I'm sorry?
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1707.22,1709.145,It's not found at the trial --
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1709.145,1710.72,At the sentencing phase.
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1710.72,1712.16,You're -- only at the sentencing phase.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1712.16,1713.66,I'm talking about the sentencing phase right --
2015.14-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1713.66,1718.125,"Suppose that the jury comes back at the sentencing phase and says, we recommend life."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1718.125,1718.57,Yes.
2015.14-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1718.57,1726.225,"And the reason, though I guess no one would know it, is because they -- no -- nobody found an aggravating. Can the judge nonetheless give death?"
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1726.225,1726.815,No.
2015.14-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1727.74,1727.83,No.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1727.83,1728.845,With this caveat.
2015.14-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1728.845,1742.09,"No, we -- we have -- they have a page in their opinion, in their brief, you know, Page 20, where it cites about six Florida cases, which suggested to me that they thought the answer to that question as a matter of Florida law was, Yes, the judge can sentence to death."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1742.09,1742.25,Yeah.
2015.14-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1742.81,1743.98,Is that so or not so?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1743.98,1747.95,"Let me be clear: As a matter of Florida statutory law, it is permitted."
2015.14-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1758.2,1760.16,That's -- I missed the last part.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1760.16,1760.77,Okay.
2015.14-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1760.77,1761.9,The jury comes back.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1764.195,1764.71,Right.
2015.14-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1764.71,1767.235,"And we know, through mental telepathy --"
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1767.235,1767.47,Right.
2015.14-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1767.47,1782.0,"-- though I guess the judge doesn't, that the reason that they did that is no one found an aggravator. My simple question is: As a matter of Florida law, can the judge impose the death sentence? Yes or no."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1782.0,1784.27,"As a matter of Florida statutory law, yes."
2015.14-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1786.005,1788.21,"That isn't -- I mean, it is."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1793.705,1795.3,"With this caveat, Justice Breyer --"
2015.14-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1795.3,1803.2,"-- because of Ring. Because you agree that this case is like Ring, and therefore Ring would apply, and therefore -- not this case, but any case in which they recommend life."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1803.2,1804.62,"Not any case, Your Honor."
2015.14-7505,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.62,1806.31,"God, I'd like to know your caveat."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1809.44,1810.44,The caveat is this --
2015.14-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1810.44,1812.235,"I am, too. Sorry."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1812.235,1877.0,"There are multiple ways that a defendant in Florida can become eligible for death. One is, in this case, where it's determined at the sentencing phase because of the finding within the jury's recommendation. In other instances it can be -- a person can become eligible before the sentencing phase either because they have a prior violent felony conviction or because they have a contemporaneous conviction. For example, if someone murdered two people and were convicted of double murder, that person at the guilt phase, by virtue of that guilt jury's verdict has been found to be eligible for the death penalty. And so at that stage, then in your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, if that sentencing-phase jury recommended life, the judge could override it without violating Ring. Now, I will tell you that, as a matter of Florida State law, the judge in that circumstance would face an exacting standard; and, as a matter of fact, no judge has overwritten a jury's life recommendation since before Ring. So as a matter of function, it is just not something that happens in Florida. But to answer your question, we do believe it would be constitutional in the situation that I described."
2015.14-7505,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1877.0,1879.285,Suppose the jury came in hung.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1879.285,1880.91,I'm sorry?
2015.14-7505,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1880.91,1882.83,On -- on the sentence.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1882.83,1883.85,If the sentencing phase --
2015.14-7505,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1883.85,1888.1,"The jury -- jury, instead of being seven to five, it was hung."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1888.1,1889.205,If the --
2015.14-7505,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1889.205,1891.96,Could the judge then impose the death penalty?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1891.96,1896.21,"Not in this situation, Your Honor, because that would result in a life recommendation."
2015.14-7505,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1932.565,1959.875,"Just so I -- I understand it: So you're saying that it -- it is possible, but under Florida law the jury would not find the existence of an aggravated -- aggravating factor but -- and would -- and then there are different ways that this would come out -- the hypothetical was a hung jury -- but the judge could then proceed to find an aggravating factor and impose the death penalty. Now, you say, now, this hasn't happened. He'd probably be reversed."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1962.9,1970.71,"Only -- that could not happen consistent with Ring, Your Honor, unless there were some other jury finding or admission that established death eligibility."
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1970.71,1979.355,"Well, you're saying it couldn't happen consistent with Ring, meaning that there are certain applications of the Florida law that would be unconstitutional even in your view."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1979.355,1981.29,That hypothetical that we've explored here.
2015.14-7505,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1989.31,1995.96,"But -- but we don't -- we -- we don't sit in judgment of -- of theoretical scheme that Florida has set up, do we?"
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1995.96,1996.8,"No, your Honor, and --"
2015.14-7505,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1996.8,2002.39,And don't we have to adjudge that there has been unconstitutionality in this case?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2002.39,2007.82,"That's correct, Justice Scalia. And in this case there was a -- a jury recommendation, actually two jury recommendations --"
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2007.82,2012.91,"Could I give you another hypothetical scheme, notwithstanding that we don't sit in judgment of hypothetical schemes?"
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2012.91,2013.79,Sure.
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2013.79,2023.18,"Suppose that the -- the jury finds an aggravating fact, but then, you know, the judge has this whole separate hearing -- right? -- in which other things are presented to him."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2039.485,2040.09,"No, Your Honor."
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2054.97,2055.17,Yes.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2062.8,2062.97,Right.
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2062.97,2066.935,Right? If -- but the judge throws that one out and substitutes his own.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2069.415,2072.53,"Well, the judge in that instance wouldn't be throwing it out."
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2072.53,2075.6,"No, he does throw it out. He just says, I don't agree with that."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2079.035,2081.27,That would be okay because eligibility would have been determined.
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2104.07,2122.55,"But I have to say that answer surprises me because the death sentence there is not at all a function of the jury's eligibility finding. The judge has tossed out that eligibility finding and substituted his own, which then leads to the death sentence. So how can we say that that's possibly constitutional under Ring?"
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2122.55,2130.95,Because the point in Ring was to make sure that no person was subject to a greater penalty than they bargained for when they did the crime without a jury finding.
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2139.75,2145.54,The judge has said that that jury finding is utterly irrelevant to his decision about whether to impose death.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2149.59,2155.38,But at that point the judge's determination is separate from the -- the selection point.
2015.14-7505,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2161.87,2163.14,"That didn't happen here, did it?"
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2163.14,2164.045,"No, your Honor."
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2164.045,2169.265,But the thing is you can't really tell whether that happens in a wide variety of cases.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2187.045,2196.905,"But it doesn't need to be under Ring, because once the jury has determined that there is an aggravating factor or if it's been admitted, then the person is death eligible and Ring is completely finished."
2015.14-7505,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2198.97,2204.865,"Even though the jury is told, now, whatever you say, it's advisory."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2220.715,2221.4,No.
2015.14-7505,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2241.01,2242.47,That was -- that was before Ring.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2242.47,2247.725,That was before Ring. And we're not contesting that Ring would require a jury finding or an admission of those elements.
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2263.8,2264.0,I'm sorry.
2015.14-7505,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2266.52,2273.05,Is it clear to the jury that they are the last word on whether an aggravator exists or not?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2273.05,2281.97,What it -- what the jury is told is that they cannot return a death recommendation without finding an aggravating circumstance.
2015.14-7505,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2282.25,2289.94,Then they're also told that the judge is ultimately going to decide whether your recommendation stands or not.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2289.94,2294.75,"The judge is going to ultimately impose the sentence, and that's true, and that's both true under Caldwell --"
2015.14-7505,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2294.75,2304.759,But shouldn't it be clear to the jury that their determination of whether an aggravator exists or not is final? Shouldn't that be clear?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2304.759,2315.36,"Well, I -- I don't think so, Your Honor, because the determination of the aggravator doesn't yield a death sentence unless the judge in his or her own opinion believes the death is appropriate. That's a benefit."
2015.14-7505,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2315.36,2319.675,I'm talking about what responsibility the jury feels.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2344.915,2366.13,"I'm not sure that's an accurate characterization of what goes on because it's not that the judge must accept -- the aggravator determination has no purpose or no point other than determining eligibility and then the weighing. And if the judge determines that the death sentence is not appropriate for whatever reason, then the fact that the jury found an aggravating circumstance makes no difference."
2015.14-7505,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2366.13,2375.83,"Suppose in your earlier hypothetical, the judge -- the jury finds an aggravator occurred in the course of the robbery, and, therefore, there is death eligibility."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2388.61,2398.6,"Well, in that instance, that's a little bit different, as I understand it, than Justice Kagan's hypothetical. First of all, the -- the recommendation doesn't specify what -- which of the aggravating factors."
2015.14-7505,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2398.6,2400.825,But this is my hypothetical.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2400.825,2402.11,Okay.
2015.14-7505,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2403.18,2403.97,"I mean, a death case is not funny."
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2403.97,2405.87,Which honestly sounds the same.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2405.87,2417.645,"Well, I think -- I think the difference is, respectfully, is his included the finding that the judge finds no evidence to support as opposed to just disagreeing with their -- excuse me."
2015.14-7505,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2417.645,2418.76,And what would happen?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2418.76,2428.64,"If you had a situation -- and, again, this would be limited -- let me make sure I'm limiting the answer to the situation where the State is depending on the death recommendation of finding an aggravator."
2015.14-7505,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2428.64,2429.16,Yes.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2429.16,2433.495,"Which is the minority of cases, as we said in the brief."
2015.14-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2452.44,2454.845,Go for a second to an analogy.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2454.845,2455.36,I'm sorry?
2015.14-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2455.36,2458.17,There are two good other analogies in other areas of the law.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2513.975,2515.88,That may well be right.
2015.14-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2520.43,2529.635,"But we do know that the judge here -- now still you're having conceded Ring, where the jury says no aggravating factor."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2554.695,2571.05,"Well, I think, Your Honor, in the cocaine and meth example, I believe that the -- the Court would look, as they did in Jones, to say, well, is the legislature setting this up as distinctive offenses, or are they setting this up as one offense that can be satisfied by either possession of cocaine or meth."
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2577.74,2579.08,I want to clarify.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2595.85,2597.055,"We do, Your Honor."
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2597.725,2606.9,Then what do you do with the statement in our case law that says a simple majority is not a unanimous jury?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2606.9,2608.57,"Well, we don't say that it's a unanimous jury."
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2622.78,2626.085,And they don't agree with which one?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2626.085,2626.55,Sorry?
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2626.55,2629.12,So we don't know whether it was premeditation or robbery.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2632.8,2635.74,I'm talking about in the sentencing phase now.
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2642.22,2642.51,We don't know.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2644.955,2654.81,"The seven to five tells us that at a minimum, a majority of the jury at a minimum, found beyond a reasonable doubt that the State had proven the existence of one or more aggravating circumstances."
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2656.02,2657.63,Not the same one?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2657.63,2691.305,"Not the same one. And getting back to Justice Breyer's point about the cocaine and meth, the courts in these situations look at what the legislature's -- its definitions of the element. And we know, as a matter of Florida State law, that the element at issue here, to take someone who is not eligible for the death penalty and to make him or her eligible for the death penalty is the existence of one or more aggravating circumstances, not -- not a specific one. And so it is like Schad v. Arizona, where you can't say whether the jury agreed that there was premeditation or whether there was felony murder."
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2722.24,2730.54,But you believe that a simple majority is a jury unanimously or functionally unanimously finding that element beyond a reasonable doubt?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2730.54,2732.69,"Well, we -- they're certainly finding it beyond a reasonable doubt."
2015.14-7505,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2736.06,2737.415,That was ten to two.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2737.415,2738.055,I'm sorry?
2015.14-7505,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2738.055,2742.39,Does ten to two automatically mean that seven to five is okay?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2742.39,2784.37,"Not automatically, Your Honor. But I think if you look at Apodaca, what they were rejecting was the same arguments that the petitioner is asking this Court to accept, which is that this long history of the unanimity and the 12-person jury necessarily means it's brought into our system. But I'll say this too, the seven to five is not the same kind of jury verdict that you'd have at a guilt phase because of this judicial backstop, because of the other protections that Florida has put in place. And so even if it's a seven-to-five vote, you still have the judge coming behind that jury, who -- unlike at the guilt phase where he must accept the jury's findings, unless they're not supported by evidence, he or she can disagree for any reason."
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2830.095,2849.83,"Can I go back to the kinds of hypotheticals that Justice Kennedy and I were -- were proposing. So let's say that there is a jury, and it's been presented with evidence that the murder was for pecuniary gain, which is one of the aggravating factors. And the -- the jury comes out with a recommendation of death."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2879.105,2884.19,"Well, let me -- let me -- I realize it's a hypothetical, but let me tell you why that couldn't happen in Florida."
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2895.735,2904.385,"Well, no -- no -- he's -- he's heard more evidence because, you know, there's a whole new hearing that he has."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2913.834,2917.09,"Again, that's not this case because there was no additional evidence --"
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2917.09,2918.28,"Yes, yes, yes, it's not this case."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2918.28,2925.83,But -- but the -- the -- the -- if the -- if the judge found that the -- that there was no evidence of any aggravator --
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2925.83,2926.66,I'm throwing out --
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2926.66,2926.75,Okay.
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2926.75,2929.69,"-- the jury's aggravating factor, but I'm substituting my own."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2934.14,2936.27,"Well, I think it depends on -- on why you're throwing it out."
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2945.88,2949.93,This wasn't at the guilt phase; this was just as a matter of sentencing. Let me get on with my questioning --
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2949.93,2950.02,Sure.
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2950.02,2952.07,-- because I think you answered this one already.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2971.02,2978.95,"Well, the -- if I understand the hypothetical correctly, someone's convicted, has a death recommendation, a death sentence, and is appealing to the Florida Supreme Court."
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2978.95,2987.25,"And -- and he says there was just not enough evidence of all these aggravating factors, so -- but that was -- would only be as to the judge's aggravating factors."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2991.255,2995.51,"Well, the judge's aggravating factors would be detailed in a written order."
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2997.895,3014.195,"I mean, I'm just suggesting that the whole appeal process suggests that the crucial death eligibility determination is being made by the judge because that's the only death eligibility determination that the appeals court is ever going to review."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,3014.195,3019.36,"Well, I think that's -- gets to another benefit of Florida's system, is that -- that they -- they do have this to review."
2015.14-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3022.08,3023.83,"Yes, look, they have something to review."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,3030.425,3034.06,I don't think it's a Sixth Amendment problem any more than -- than here when you.
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3049.37,3049.92,What about --
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,3049.92,3051.02,Or they may sustain it.
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3051.02,3052.07,How about if a jury --
2015.14-7505,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3052.07,3059.275,So to what degree is there a -- a real dispute here about the presence of the two aggravating factors?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,3059.275,3061.99,"There is none, Justice Alito, in my view."
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3097.21,3099.61,Can I ask you two separate questions on this?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,3099.61,3100.17,Yes.
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3100.17,3119.1,"Number one, whenever have we said that a jury waiver on an issue is based on the lack of a challenge by a defense attorney? Don't we require waivers of jury trials to be explicit and by the defendant him or herself?"
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,3119.1,3121.99,"When someone's waiving the jury trial altogether, absolutely."
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3133.55,3138.915,So where have we ever said that not challenging something is an admission of that something?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,3138.915,3139.91,Well --
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3139.91,3155.985,"We take plenty of appeals where people are saying, assuming the state of facts, I'm entitled to X, and then when they go back down, they argue that that goes -- that assumption is wrong."
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,3156.99,3176.89,"Well, we -- we cited other portions of the -- where they had -- excuse me -- acknowledged that below back in the sentencing memorandum of the first go-around. But to follow up on your question, Justice Alito, about whether there is an existence of a -- of a doubt, the Florida Supreme Court found that both of these clearly existed at the post-conviction opinion, which led to the resentencing that's now on appeal here."
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3187.58,3200.05,Has there ever been an appeal in Florida where an advisory jury was given -- not given a proper instruction and a resentence was -- was ordered for that reason?
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,3200.05,3205.765,Has there been a Florida Supreme Court reversing a death sentence for --
2015.14-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3205.765,3209.41,An improper instruction to the advisory jury.
2015.14-7505,1,62295,allen_winsor,,3209.41,3212.25,"I'd be surprised if there weren't, Your Honor, but I don't know."
2015.14-7505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3229.4,3237.28,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman, six minutes."
2015.14-7505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3237.28,3257.685,"Notwithstanding this flurry of papers, I'm aspiring not to use the six minutes. Let me first -- let me go right to Justice Scalia's question, which is not a hypothetical, although I'm happy to answer hypotheticals."
2015.14-7505,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3386.31,3389.125,Is that a -- post Ring? What's the date of that?
2015.14-7505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3389.125,3390.65,"Yes, this is post Ring."
2015.14-7505,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3585.695,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
