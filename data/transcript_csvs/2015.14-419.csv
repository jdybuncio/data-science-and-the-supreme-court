2015.14-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.285,"We will hear argument next in Case 14-419, Luis v. United States. Mr. Srebnick."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,7.285,19.99,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Sixth Amendment has always recognized the individual's right to spend his own money to obtain the advice and assistance of counsel."
2015.14-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,50.315,53.07,What do you do about Monsanto?
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,53.07,59.16,"In Monsanto and in Caplin & Drysdale, those were cases involving tainted funds, drug money."
2015.14-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,59.16,59.6,Right.
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,67.41,78.939,"Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the logic is that no one has a rightful claim to drug money. No one can claim a valid property right in drug proceeds."
2015.14-419,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,86.83,95.785,"But, Mr. Srebnick, I mean, compare two situations. One is the one that Monsanto talked about where, yeah, a bank robber goes in and he has a pile of money now."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,125.78,138.59,"Because no amount of so-called dissipation, as the government would suggest, negates petitioner's lawful interest in the property she owns apart from any alleged criminal activity."
2015.14-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,138.59,153.615,"Well, but is -- doesn't it make sense the -- the sort of substitution rule? I mean, if you've got $10 million in drug activity -- money and you had $5 million, and you spent $10 million, you can't say, you know, oh, I spent the drug money, you can't touch the $5 million."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,161.345,178.73,"And so, Mr. Chief Justice, of course, if there is a conviction, if the defendant is found guilty, after the conviction when punishment is determined, there may well be the opportunity for the government to seek punishment that includes the financial penalties associated with the crime."
2015.14-419,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,189.37,193.74,"Well, but I -- I thought the Chief Justice's question was slightly different."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,199.78,200.215,I was.
2015.14-419,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,200.215,205.01,"But, you know, there are degree -- there are degrees of taint."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,215.74,229.67,"Well, in this case, it's a simple answer, because here we have a stipulation, Joint Appendix 161, that the assets that are the subject of the dispute here today are assets that are undisputedly untainted, not traceable to the crime."
2015.14-419,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,238.65,248.865,"Well, let me go back to Justice -- Justice Kagan's question and ask it in -- in a different way. So you -- we have two brothers and -- twin brothers, and they rob a bank."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,293.83,295.34,"Yes, because the --"
2015.14-419,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,295.34,296.57,What sense does that make?
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,296.57,310.13,"Because the property interest a defendant has in an inheritance or in a gift, those property rights are not negated simply because the defendant has allegedly committed a crime, simply because there's probable cause."
2015.14-419,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,310.13,314.53,So the law -- you want this Court to say spend the bank robbery money first. (Laughter.)
2015.14-419,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.53,316.205,That's -- that's your position?
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,316.205,321.085,"Well, the -- the government is concerned about what we would -- have described as the so-called wily criminal."
2015.14-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,349.96,352.74,How do -- I -- I don't know how these things actually work.
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,365.51,367.47,"As of now she gets nothing, Mr. Chief Justice."
2015.14-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,367.47,375.47,"So -- so if her -- putting aside lawyers, if her daughter's tuition bill comes due, she can't pay that?"
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,375.47,377.6,"Under the current restraining order, she can do nothing."
2015.14-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,377.6,381.14,But she can surely pay the rent or the mortgage?
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,381.14,383.435,"Under the current restraining order, she can do nothing."
2015.14-419,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,388.575,389.07,I have the --
2015.14-419,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,389.07,394.69,Is it your position that the government could prevent payment for the tuition but not for the counsel?
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,394.69,399.77,Our position is that there's a constitutional right under the Sixth Amendment to retain counsel.
2015.14-419,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,399.77,405.135,So the answer is you can -- the government can stop the tuition payment but not the payment to counsel?
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,405.135,407.57,"I would think so, in those kind of instances."
2015.14-419,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,424.325,427.49,So you really don't have a statutory argument.
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,438.51,449.285,"Justice Sotomayor, the statute, 18 U.S.C. 1345, which is different than the drug forfeiture statute, 18 U.S.C. 1345, it's at the blue brief at page 2 --"
2015.14-419,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,449.285,454.765,I guess I'm -- I understand what you're going to say because I read your brief.
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,454.765,455.26,Okay.
2015.14-419,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,455.26,469.09,"But the logic of your argument would suggest that you can't freeze untainted assets for anything, because you're saying the government has no property right to it."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,486.27,488.34,"Well, we do not go that far in our --"
2015.14-419,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,488.34,490.75,I know you don't because it's very nice that you limit it.
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,504.2,519.385,"Well, I suppose that if there's no Sixth Amendment right at stake, if there's no constitutional right to use the asset today, I don't know of any prohibition, provided that there's due process, that would prevent the Court from restraining assets proposed to be used for other purposes."
2015.14-419,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,519.385,524.02,But you said that this -- this is her property.
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,548.37,563.57,"Justice Ginsburg, from a constitutional perspective, I don't think that that's necessarily correct because the courts can give injunctive power to restrain assets, even assets currently belonging to the defendant."
2015.14-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,590.42,607.05,What if -- what if the woman is a devout Muslim and she -- she makes a -- an annual trip to Mecca every year? Wouldn't she have a constitutional right to use the money for that?
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,607.05,610.49,So certainly she would have a constitutional right.
2015.14-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,627.4,629.65,"Well, she has an immediate need to go to Mecca."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,642.91,651.16,The Sixth Amendment is important in the context of the adversarial proceeding that will determine the ultimate ownership of those assets at the end of the day.
2015.14-419,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,692.17,702.065,"Mr. Srebnick, this goes back, I think, to the Chief Justice's first question. It seems that the distinction that you're making is one that the Court explicitly rejected in Monsanto."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,731.085,741.115,"Justice Kagan, I -- I think the circumstances are quite different because of the tainted property that was at issue in Monsanto. First, we know it was drug money in Monsanto."
2015.14-419,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,757.915,763.535,"Yeah, but your -- your earlier argument was you have a constitutional right to establish that it isn't drug money."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,768.22,772.755,In this case there's no dispute that the money is untainted.
2015.14-419,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,773.36,775.615,I'm talking about the rule that you're proposing.
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,775.615,791.895,"The rule I proposed, consistent with the Court's observation in Kaley, there are two elements to establish forfeitability; one, that there's a crime committed, and second, traceability from the majority opinion in Kaley. Here we have undisputedly untainted assets, not traceable to a crime."
2015.14-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,801.415,810.945,"I guess you're -- I think this may be Justice Sotomayor's point. Your argument, you're distinguishing tainted and untainted assets, and I understand that."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,830.775,842.375,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think it has everything to do with the Sixth Amendment because, at its inception, the Sixth Amendment only encompassed the right to spend one -- one's own money to be represented by counsel."
2015.14-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,882.86,922.23,"Well, what if -- what if the prosecution brings a case for crime X and wins that case, and it imposes a fine that takes away all of the defendant's assets, and then the prosecution brings another case for crime Y, would you be arguing that the fine had to make an exception for the defense of crime Y?"
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,922.23,923.73,"No, Justice Scalia."
2015.14-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.73,924.86,What's the difference?
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,924.86,925.765,There's a judgment.
2015.14-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,950.9,956.835,The Sixth Amendment only -- only protects your money up until the point where there's a judgment?
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,956.835,957.91,Yes.
2015.14-419,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,957.91,962.165,"But in -- in this case, there was a finding of probable cause."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,962.165,962.67,Yes.
2015.14-419,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,962.67,967.585,So you want us to make a distinction between probable cause and a judgment?
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,967.585,968.565,Yes.
2015.14-419,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,999.97,1006.22,"I might just be repeating myself, but -- but I thought that, again, that distinction was the one specifically rejected in Monsanto."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1020.99,1028.785,"Yes, Justice Kagan, but probable cause to believe the assets are tainted. Probable cause to believe that the drug money is not the defendant's to spend."
2015.14-419,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1035.81,1041.62,"The problem with this argument is that as a matter of economics and -- and common sense, money is fungible."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1053.935,1056.765,"Respectfully, Justice Alito, it makes a major difference."
2015.14-419,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1069.23,1078.13,"Well, yes, but then there's -- that's all sorts of complicated rules in those areas. I mean, let's -- suppose you have -- and none of that necessarily applies here."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1104.26,1111.08,"Well, to provide a restitution exception would just swallow the entire Sixth Amendment out of the Constitution for the following reason."
2015.14-419,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1126.52,1137.175,"So your answer is that the defendant's right to hire counsel of choice takes precedence over the rights of the victims, and you would say that no matter how strong the proof is?"
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1137.175,1138.075,Yes.
2015.14-419,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1138.075,1140.48,Until there's -- until there is a verdict?
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1140.48,1152.175,"As long as the assets that the defendant proposes to use are her lawful assets, untainted, not connected to the crime, not traceable to any criminal activity, yes, because --"
2015.14-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1152.175,1158.035,That seems to me not a very -- I don't know -- not a very persuasive line. You're relying on property law.
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1181.33,1182.38,Right.
2015.14-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1182.38,1183.285,Your crime.
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1200.11,1207.91,What -- what the statute is purporting to do is give the government a prejudgment attachment on the defendant's assets based on a projected judgment.
2015.14-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1207.91,1208.21,That's right.
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1209.26,1210.78,And the Sixth Amendment --
2015.14-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1210.78,1213.67,"You're complaining about property law, not the Sixth Amendment."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1213.67,1242.295,"Well, I'm complaining that the Sixth Amendment, because at its root contemplated the use of property to retain counsel, the two in some degree are interrelated, of course, because without money 220 years ago or so, you couldn't hire a lawyer, and none would be appointed for you. So while the Court has accommodated the indigent by providing them with appointed counsel, that is not a license for the government to render people who are not indigent, indigent."
2015.14-419,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1312.33,1319.79,"I know this is not part of the question asked, but I know that it -- it's suggested in the fringes of the briefs."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1332.905,1346.965,"I don't think there's an issue, particularly in this case with that issue, because the court which now has control over the assets would manage the disbursement of funds for counsel, and the bar rules would apply."
2015.14-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1358.47,1360.825,"But you're not -- you're not looking for CJA rates, are you?"
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1360.825,1362.1,"No, we're not, Justice."
2015.14-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1362.1,1365.025,I didn't think so. (Laughter.)
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1365.025,1414.495,"And -- and so given the ability of our district courts to manage those issues, the only standard we would ask for, that they be reasonable and bona fide, and the bar rules govern that. I should add that while we are having a -- an academic discussion here, it didn't seem to be such a controversial proposition to the government when in Caplin & Drysdale in their brief, they wrote the following: ""The Constitution requires that a court afford a defendant a fair opportunity to secure counsel of choice using whatever assets he has at his lawful disposal."" That's the brief of Caplin & Drysdale by the Solicitor General at page 42. And so when the Solicitor General's office argued this case in Caplin & Drysdale 25 years ago, they came to the Court and said there was a difference between tainted and untainted assets."
2015.14-419,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1420.33,1422.045,"Well, we have a new statute."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1427.345,1429.37,"That is very true, Justice Sotomayor."
2015.14-419,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1429.93,1435.309,"This section came later, and it says substitute property."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1435.309,1436.885,That is true.
2015.14-419,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1477.61,1493.735,"But Congress seemed to have singled out these banking frauds and healthcare frauds for special treatment, so they're not governed by the general forfeiture statute, which makes the distinction between tainted and untainted."
2015.14-419,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1509.34,1516.64,"So 1345, although it doesn't use the word ""forfeiture,"" it doesn't say what happens to these assets."
2015.14-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1549.965,1554.52,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1554.52,1572.81,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think that the appropriate starting point for this case is the last sentence of Monsanto, not because Monsanto specifically addressed substitute property, but because it adopted a principle that I believes resolves this case."
2015.14-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1598.195,1612.7,"Well, that was said in the context of the government's submission that there's a difference between tainted and untainted, right? Your -- your argument in Monsanto focused on the tainted aspects of the proceeds."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1612.7,1613.505,"Yes, it did."
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1619.505,1625.18,Why is that the principle? The principle -- they're talking about money that doesn't belong to the defendant.
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1625.18,1625.63,Well --
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1625.63,1627.52,It belongs to Smith or Jones of the bank.
2015.14-419,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.26,1649.47,Sixth Amendment or not.
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1649.47,1650.425,So -- now I can imagine --
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1650.425,1653.37,"Justice Breyer, let me try to explain --"
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1653.37,1655.94,"I can go from there and find interests on both sides, da, da, da."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1655.94,1669.065,"Justice Breyer, I think that it's important to start with, actually, the principle that Monsanto adopted, not because it resolved the factual circumstances here, but because it's talking about the point in time after the government wins a judgment."
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1674.96,1675.55,Yes.
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1675.55,1677.24,-- if it can show probable --
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1677.24,1678.07,I -- I understood that.
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1728.685,1740.02,"So Justice Breyer, I think that the -- the embedded premise there is that people will not suffer restraints on their liberty or property before they have been convicted beyond a reasonable doubt."
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1740.02,1740.48,That's correct.
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1772.15,1772.41,All right.
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1806.1,1812.22,"I think -- I think that's a -- what you say is, look, this is equivalent to the case where we keep the guy in jail because he might run away."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1898.18,1899.85,So two things on that.
2015.14-419,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1940.3,1941.18,Do you really --
2015.14-419,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1941.18,1978.364,"But what is it that confines your -- your rationale to a specific area? It seems to me that if the government prevails in this case, every State in the union, every locality could say that in the event of assault and battery, malicious -- malicious mischief, drunk -- an accident caused by drunk driving, any crime involving a bodily injury, that the government is entitled to restrain disposition of assets that might be used for medical care, for pain and suffering."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1989.09,1995.5,"Justice Kennedy, it's correct that our principle is not limited to the types of crimes that are in this case."
2015.14-419,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2003.76,2005.755,"Well, but you're talking about probable cause."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2007.525,2008.325,Understood.
2015.14-419,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2008.325,2013.89,"The government can often show probable cause, and that's usually the basis for the indictment."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2013.89,2015.255,That's correct.
2015.14-419,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2029.76,2030.22,Mr. Dreeben --
2015.14-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2030.22,2045.29,"It takes the -- it - it establishes that right in the same way as the issue here, without counsel on the part of the defendant, because you -- I assume Kaley applies to tainted assets as well as untainted."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2045.29,2046.36,That's correct.
2015.14-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2046.36,2050.42,So add to the context of what Justice Breyer was concerned about.
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2055.965,2059.67,"No, I think the defendant is often entitled to a hearing."
2015.14-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2070.84,2077.87,"I thought -- I thought under Kaley, the defendant didn't have to be provided a -- a hearing with respect to the pretrial --"
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2077.87,2078.23,With --
2015.14-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2078.23,2079.01,-- seizure of assets.
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2079.01,2083.525,With respect to whether there's probable cause to believe that the defendant committed an offense.
2015.14-419,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2086.0,2088.815,"Kaley was a question of tracing, because it was --"
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2088.815,2090.62,"It -- it was, Justice Sotomayor."
2015.14-419,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2091.22,2093.305,But you don't have any tracing problem here.
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2100.81,2104.58,Although there were far fewer here because most of them had been dissipated.
2015.14-419,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2105.65,2111.36,"I respect that, and -- but -- but you agreed that these particular funds were untainted."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2113.25,2123.19,"We -- we stipulated -- it's technical, but we -- we stipulated that there may be some unquantified amount of untainted assets in the assets being restrained."
2015.14-419,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2130.235,2144.46,"Mr. Dreeben, I think, you know, in essence your argument goes like this: You have Monsanto, you combine Monsanto with a -- a simple factual acknowledgment that money is fungible, and it gets you to a judgment in this case."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2184.785,2195.985,"Well, I -- I would hope that the Court sees that even if there are some uncomfortable aspects of Monsanto, it actually rests on a sound legal judgment."
2015.14-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2248.515,2251.56,"Counsel, how -- I don't know how these things work."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2283.915,2285.06,Yes.
2015.14-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2301.765,2311.45,"How does it work? Like the -- you know, the daughter's tuition bill comes due, you know, and it's whoever -- you know, who knows how much these days, $60,000."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2314.825,2317.18,Not as a matter of right.
2015.14-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2323.18,2341.98,"Well, why was it -- why would it be -- if he can exercise equitable discretion for the daughter's tuition, why -- why not when the Sixth Amendment is at stake? And, you know, counsel of choice, it turns on that, it would seem to me that if there's going to be a case in which equitable discretion will be exercised, it ought to be in that situation."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2341.98,2343.45,"Well, I don't think automatically so."
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2368.41,2373.265,Can you get back -- you had two responses to my reading of the statute.
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2375.93,2376.33,So this --
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2376.33,2378.01,"By the way, let me -- let me remind you --"
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2378.01,2379.13,I remember exactly what --
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2379.13,2382.03,"But I want to say it, because maybe you can focus on this."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2416.26,2416.72,So Justice Breyer --
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2416.72,2417.33,-- to separate it?
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2417.33,2419.99,-- I think I need to stop you here because it's not a TRO.
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2421.32,2421.64,I know.
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2423.41,2423.69,That's correct.
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2423.69,2437.38,"-- and my suggestion is we read those words ""restraining order"" as ""temporary restraining order,"" which (3)(b), it seems to me, clearly permits, but we can get into that argument. I'll worry about that later."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2437.38,2437.88,"Well, I think that the --"
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2437.88,2440.67,I want to know what your second response was to that.
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2440.67,2445.86,My second response is that this a statute that contains two basic provisions.
2015.14-419,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2535.5,2537.385,I don't -- go ahead and finish.
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2537.385,2544.58,"Well, I think, in a sense, this statute negates the premise that there is a clean line between tainted funds and untainted funds."
2015.14-419,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2561.235,2563.64,I'm -- I'm troubled by this statute.
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2601.3,2613.64,"So (a)(2) has two different sections, and it describes what the government can seek as the ultimate relief in the case. This started out as an antifraud injunction statute."
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2636.5,2650.495,"So what they can do is this? If we read this literally under (B), that Mr. Smith is indicted for a banking law violation, he has $100,000 of other people's money."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2690.49,2703.24,"Yes, but it's -- it's referring, again, to a person who has -- there is probable cause to believe has obtained money as a result of a criminal violation, and then it provides a mechanism for restraining it."
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2708.58,2715.075,"Well, this is -- this is innocent money, the defendant's, not the money he obtained as a result of the violation."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2718.28,2724.9,The innocent money versus tainted money all depends on a theory that they are economically pure.
2015.14-419,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2753.32,2761.745,"Mr. Dreeben, you're taking Monsanto out of context, because 853, by its nature, was limited to tainted funds."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2806.86,2807.74,That's true.
2015.14-419,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2807.74,2809.66,You can't forfeit it beforehand.
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2809.92,2813.065,"That's true for all -- that's true or all money, tainted and untainted."
2015.14-419,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2813.065,2831.785,"Well, but -- but still the question becomes, is there a substantive difference, and I think Justice Breyer is expressing -- the problem with this, as Justice Kagan said, this intuitive sense, which is where do we draw this line?"
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2831.785,2832.16,So --
2015.14-419,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2832.16,2835.395,Does the right to counsel have any meaning anymore?
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2835.395,2836.31,I think it does.
2015.14-419,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2836.31,2844.39,"Frankly, I expect within three to five years, if we rule in your favor, 853 will be changed to have this same language."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2844.39,2849.62,"So 853, Justice Sotomayor, does permit forfeiture of substitute property."
2015.14-419,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2849.62,2851.22,"Yes, but not pretrial."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2851.22,2852.655,Not -- not pretrial.
2015.14-419,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2871.28,2873.17,But that's true of every judgment.
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2873.17,2874.0,It is true --
2015.14-419,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2874.0,2878.31,Every judgment gives you a right to substitute property of some sort.
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2878.31,2887.235,"Yes, but -- but the point is that the tainted property and the substitute property are similarly situated at the end of the forfeiture case."
2015.14-419,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2931.31,2932.22,Mr. Dreeben --
2015.14-419,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2932.22,2943.82,When did the -- when did the -- when was the first statute that allowed the government to restrain the expenditure of tainted funds? Does that go back a long time or --
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2943.82,2954.21,"Well, the -- the whole history of in personam forfeiture was dormant until 1970, and then Congress passed a statute that permitted this kind of activity."
2015.14-419,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2967.89,2977.01,And -- and the first time that Congress ever applied it to non-tainted property was what year?
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2977.01,2984.98,"Well, the substitute assets provision was added to the -- the basic forfeiture statute, and it was there at least by 1984."
2015.14-419,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2999.705,3000.13,And that --
2015.14-419,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3000.13,3039.37,"And -- but just -- just to be clear, so that I understood your earlier answer, the consequence, the necessary consequence of your position is that any State in the union can provide for forfeiture or a freeze -- a freeze of assets pending trial in any assault and battery case, spousal abuse case, criminal negligence, date rape cases in order to make the victim whole, to pay for medical costs, to pay for pain and suffering, and can freeze those assets even if the consequences of that is that in most of those cases most people cannot afford counsel."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3039.37,3041.76,So if -- if at the conclusion of the case --
2015.14-419,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3041.76,3043.68,That's the consequence of your argument?
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3043.68,3059.37,"Well, I think that if there is a -- yes, if there is a monetary assessment that will become provable at the conclusion of the case and the government can show a need to preserve the assets so that they're available. I mean, think about the cases that you're talking about, Justice Kennedy."
2015.14-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3068.1,3071.67,"Well, and they're all cases in which the defendant has not been found guilty."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3091.405,3098.995,So I -- I do think the Court could draw distinctions among the types of fines and the purposes of the fines that are at issue.
2015.14-419,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3099.65,3131.785,"Have you seen -- have you seen the judgments in the fraud on the market cases? I mean, it isn't too tough in cases involving fraud on the market to find judgments of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, I mean, judgments in fines after convictions, and that's what, I think, the question is. The principle of constitutional law that you're advocating would, in fact, permit the freezing of what might be paid afterwards in a fine which could be a huge amount before the person is convicted."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3132.59,3141.18,"So -- well, I -- I do think that I was trying to say to the Chief Justice that there could be distinctions that are drawn among various monetary exactions."
2015.14-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3159.44,3161.65,It goes to the Medicaid trust fund?
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3161.65,3164.33,"Medicare trust fund, provided to the Medicare trust fund."
2015.14-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3164.33,3165.33,The -- will go to the victims?
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3165.33,3165.58,Yes.
2015.14-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3165.58,3168.06,Does that go to the victims in case?
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3168.06,3173.695,"Well, the Medicare trust fund, which represents basically the fiscal interests of the people of the United States is the victim."
2015.14-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3173.695,3174.525,I'm sorry?
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3174.525,3181.175,"The Medicare trust fund, from which the funds came that we say are obtained by fraud, is the victim."
2015.14-419,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3189.26,3227.375,"Mr. Dreeben, you're saying that your -- your view, your interpretation, your reading of the statute is the only tenable one, that if one took the view that Justice Breyer's interpretation, that restraining order means a temporary restraining order, or it was another interpretation put forth in the Americans for Forfeiture Reform brief, because if -- if a judge were to take the position that all of -- all three are plausible readings of the statute, but we'll pick the one that allows the defendant to have counsel."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3227.375,3232.215,"So Justice Ginsburg, we don't think that any of the alternative readings are plausible."
2015.14-419,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3275.68,3296.065,"Mr. Dreeben, if I could go back to Justice Alito's questions about your interpretation of the statute, I think what Justice Alito was suggesting was that (a)(2)(A) would be completely subsumed by (a)(2)(B) on your interpretation, and I don't think that you got around to answering that question."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3296.065,3298.46,So I -- I think that that -- that is true.
2015.14-419,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3323.925,3332.565,"No, but in -- in just saying that, you're essentially saying, yes, (B) expands it out, meaning it covers everything that (A) covers and some more."
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3332.565,3352.88,"Yes, but the -- it's not that this is a statute that anyone's reading gives off provisions effect because the (b) section, 1345(b) permits restraining orders or prohibitions during the course of the case as are needed to protect the United States against the substantial injury."
2015.14-419,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3358.08,3360.08,Do you think that there's any --
2015.14-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3360.08,3361.025,Go ahead.
2015.14-419,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3361.025,3370.53,Do you think that there's any way to read this statute such that it applies to people who wish to retain counsel as opposed to make other expenditures?
2015.14-419,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3370.53,3381.85,"No, I don't think there's any reading of the statute that exempts counsel. It does give discretion to the district court to entertain arguments."
2015.14-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3384.195,3387.775,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srebnick, you have four minutes remaining."
2015.14-419,2,28012,howard_srebnick,,3387.775,3401.51,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I think all of us who heard the argument of Monsanto and Caplin & Drysdale when it was delivered in 1989 understood the line was drawn between tainted and untainted assets."
2015.14-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3415.89,3431.505,"I don't want to use up your rebuttal time, but I do want to ask you two quick questions about the statute. First is: Did you raise anything about this in your cert petition? And the second is: Is there a way to limit this to the Sixth Amendment context?"
2015.14-419,2,28012,howard_srebnick,,3431.505,3433.415,The answer to the first question is no.
2015.14-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3452.73,3456.065,"You didn't say anything about constitutional avoidance in your cert position, did you?"
2015.14-419,2,28012,howard_srebnick,,3456.065,3457.239,That is correct.
2015.14-419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3580.94,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
