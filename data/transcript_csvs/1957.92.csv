1957.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,10.702,United States of America versus Charles Hvass.
1957.92,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,15.656,19.46,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors."
1957.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,258.029,261.552,This is an ordinary diversity negligence case not an FELA case.
1957.92,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,261.552,264.63,It isn't a -- this happened to have been FELA cases.
1957.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,264.805,264.959,Yes.
1957.92,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,264.959,269.572,-- rule would apply equally in a diversity situation.
1957.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,269.572,272.405,I can see (Inaudible).
1957.92,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,272.405,279.214,"The -- the rule is not restricted, Your Honor to either category."
1957.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,346.916,358.593,So far as the record shows Mr. Spritzer was this order of the court sua sponte?
1957.92,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,358.593,364.673,The opinion suggests that it was and I think there is no issue that in fact that was the case.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1478.503,1482.094,"Mr. Chief Justice, associate justices and counsel."
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1564.947,1570.762,"Before you go to the next question, do I understand you to say that we do not require an oath --"
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1570.762,1570.921,That's --
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1570.921,1573.879,-- the implication of an affirmation will do?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1573.879,1576.787,It's my understanding that that is true.
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1576.787,1577.933,"Well, it's -- I don't know what it is."
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1584.828,1593.375,"I would say, Your Honor that your rule says specifically Rule number 6 that the oath does not require."
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1593.375,1595.775,Like for a test of foreign counsel.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1595.775,1596.558,That's correct.
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1596.558,1600.112,None have talked about that but the people who are admitted?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1600.112,1600.239,You're correct.
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1600.239,1602.791,It's a different story what the rule -- what the --
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1602.791,1602.852,You're correct.
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1602.852,1615.018,-- that's a different question as well as the question of policy or if you plead the validity of requiring another oath by foreign counsel not admitted.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1646.255,1655.957,If it -- it would not be a basis for perjury charge because it must have a clear legislative base and the only --
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1655.957,1656.589,All right.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1657.871,1658.155,All right.
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1658.299,1673.604,-- but I was wondering whether there is any difference between the oath that I took when I was admitted to the District Court of New York and the oath that I took when I was admitted to this Court from the point of view of the amenability to the perjury statute.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1673.604,1677.428,You're not amenable to the perjury statute because there is not a valid legislation in place.
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1677.428,1680.388,Very well but is there a difference between the two courts?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1680.388,1681.369,I'm not aware of any.
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1681.369,1682.099,All right.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1682.099,1687.553,"And I used it only in a sense, Mr. Justice that we are both foreign attorneys --"
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1687.553,1687.638,Yes.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1687.638,1689.238,-- because we were Out-of-State Attorneys.
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1689.238,1689.744,I understand that.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1689.744,1694.922,And call the illustration that Iowa got along very well for 80 some years --
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1694.922,1695.144,I understand.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1695.144,1698.244,-- and you don't require it.
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1838.001,1855.99,"Do I understand your argument to be, although assuming, assuming I accept your starting point, namely that Congress couldn't determine the qualifications for admission to this Courts bar --"
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1855.99,1857.137,That is --
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1857.137,1857.905,-- I started that.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1858.286,1858.819,That is --
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1858.819,1860.865,-- so I don't need to recite it because I couldn't.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1860.865,1861.859,That is --
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1861.859,1863.822,But assume that that is so.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1873.826,1883.758,I am saying in an admission hearing that Congress does not have any power to determine the qualifications of an officer of this Court.
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1891.104,1893.595,But I'm accepting that -- go on from there.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1908.33,1918.212,"They cannot for the plain and simple reason, Your Honor because they can enact a law to support the oath in an admission hearing."
1957.92,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1951.344,1965.874,Aren't you saying there then Mr. King that the answer to Justice Frankfurter's question when he asked what that Congress didn't in fact do that by the statute?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,1965.874,1973.719,"Congress -- that is correct and if I may modify your statement, it is correct that Congress did not do that."
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2083.473,2095.472,You mean that one could decide when you have to say that the courts and not the Congress have the exclusive balance in regulating the lawyers of the court?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2095.472,2096.559,Completely.
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2096.559,2097.382,That's your view.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2097.382,2098.549,That's our view supported by --
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2098.549,2100.704,Is that in the argument you've made in this case?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2100.704,2108.613,"It's -- it's the argument that was supported by at least three cases I can think of, (Inaudible), Brooks versus Laws."
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2108.613,2109.856,I remember those types of cases.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2109.856,2129.107,And a new case In re Schrader which is found in 22 federal -- found in 22 federal cases that we found when we traced down the citation they made 22 federal cases 12.
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2187.042,2197.118,You're not attacking this on the basis that this is a regulation for any basis of (Inaudible) merits of structure that the statute does.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2206.002,2209.856,I'm saying that Congress has not attempted to do so.
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2215.191,2216.34,-- does not attempt to do so.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2217.266,2223.152,"They haven't attempted to do so, if they did so, it would be a nullity but that's exclusively to your jurisdiction."
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2239.745,2241.303,Can I stop you there?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2241.303,2241.683,You may.
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2241.683,2273.222,"Do I understand what you just said that when he gave this -- when he made certain statements which made the basis of a charge of perjury that at the time he made the statement, there was no duty on his part to -- there was no duty on his part to make truthful statement because at least there was no rule requiring him to make a statement which are laid as the basis of perjury, is that what you're saying?"
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2273.222,2274.485,"That is not what I'm saying, Your Honor."
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2274.485,2280.754,"Repeat -- and then state what you said, what you mean by saying at the time he made these statements there was no such rules."
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2280.754,2289.133,"At the time he made this statement, there was no law of the United States, authorizing Local Rule 3 in an admission hearing."
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2289.133,2291.996,Was the local rule in existence when he made these statements?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2291.996,2292.691,Certainly.
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2292.691,2293.429,All right.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2293.995,2295.287,Four days before.
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2300.889,2305.743,Oh I'm not -- a man may -- the directive moral duty and not violate a statute.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2305.743,2307.937,But may I answer the corollary?
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2389.349,2397.715,"I don't quite understand your argument because as I understand it, you say the only law that could be declared at all has to be declared by the Court."
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2401.283,2401.508,That's --
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2401.508,2404.766,Why -- why if that's the --
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2404.766,2406.777,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2407.847,2412.079,-- argument the he hasn't violated the -- that they didn't' have a right to do it under this law.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2412.079,2421.176,"The Court declared a rule but the rule, the Local Rule of Court -- that the Court declared is not a law of the United States because our --"
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2421.176,2423.369,Anybody else can pass on but (Inaudible)
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2423.369,2424.112,Yes but --
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2424.112,2425.641,Can Congress pass one?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2425.641,2436.723,"We say they cannot in an admission hearing but the rule that they pass, Mr. Justice Black was not a law of the United States at all."
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2452.973,2456.557,-- the legislative base and Congress has no power to pass it.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2456.557,2458.518,We -- we agree that they cannot pass.
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2458.518,2477.592,"And therefore you say there never can be a statutory prosecution for perjury no matter how detail the Congress and spell it out although you indicate that you wouldn't be here if the judgment by virtue of the judicial power, lock this fellow in jail for X month, is that correct?"
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2477.592,2484.833,The last answer to your question is correct that we wouldn't be here if the judge and his judicial power could sanction what he wanted to.
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2582.974,2586.835,You might -- one might say that remotely it has a legislative base.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2594.105,2597.174,Your Honor that's 100% correct.
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2641.009,2643.799,"A child becomes mature on birth, is that right?"
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2643.799,2656.994,It matures upon birth and assumes judicial inherent power that you have which Congress cannot invade to tell you who your officers shall be and tell you how to regulate them and how they should be handled.
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2659.823,2671.985,Now -- now the attorneys get admitted on the State Legislative Act?How did he get admitted to practice from the state court?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2671.985,2674.029,I am not familiar.
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2676.922,2678.718,What bar are you?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2678.718,2680.241,I'm a member of the Minnesota Bar.
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2680.241,2689.663,"In Minnesota, how lawyers admitted to practice, under legislative act in the state courts?"
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2689.663,2694.943,We're admitted in the state courts pursuant to the inherent judicial power of that court.
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2694.943,2698.842,Is there any statute which prescribes certain qualifications for admission?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2698.842,2704.379,I am not aware of any that the courts themselves make that prescription.
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2712.924,2721.301,"You mean now that in Minnesota there's no statute of any kind to subscribe any qualifications, the lawyers to be admitted to the bar?"
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2721.301,2721.743,I'm not --
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2721.743,2723.731,"I didn't know there was one like you, maybe there is."
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2723.731,2728.0,I'm not familiar with it but may I answer your question this way.
1957.92,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2729.055,2730.365,Integrated bar?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2730.365,2730.852,I beg your pardon?
1957.92,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2730.852,2731.532,Do you have integrated bar?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2731.532,2733.598,"No, we have not."
1957.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2734.096,2740.032,Your statutes have qualifications where people become judges?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2740.032,2742.046,I'm not familiar with that qualification.
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2789.749,2792.979,You mean the judiciary were decided favorably judiciarys?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2792.979,2797.483,"I would assume so, Your Honor and this is not properly so."
1957.92,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2973.835,2975.849,Which case are you referring to now?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2975.849,2981.211,"That's the United States versus George that's cited in our brief, Your Honor."
1957.92,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2981.211,2987.981,"Heretofore, you haven't relied on that at all, have you?In the argument you've made."
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2987.981,2989.137,"Well, I --"
1957.92,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2989.137,2992.909,I didn't understand that your previous argument was on that basis.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,2992.909,2996.953,It was -- it would be part of it.
1957.92,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3000.745,3007.47,"That's the one which the Court indicated that, that would be very cautious about regulations in making criminal charges rest on them."
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,3007.47,3010.095,You are so correct and we agree.
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3074.143,3082.975,How do you distinguish or do you make any distinction between that case and the one that Mr. Spritzer cited?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,3082.975,3084.117,"Yes, I do."
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3084.117,3085.417,What is the distinction?
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,3085.417,3087.976,"The distinction is this, Your Honor."
1957.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3147.578,3159.272,"You return back to your distinction then to the ground that the courts have the exclusive power to decide all the qualifications of lawyers, anything Congress does is nullity."
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,3159.272,3169.893,100% Your Honor and therefore there is no legislative base to say it in so many words in the case that the Government cited there was a legislative base and here there is no legislative base.
1957.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3299.709,3315.898,"Mr. King, have you in your briefs argued that -- that if the Court should find that there was a legislative base for this rule, that still the rule itself invalid?"
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,3315.898,3319.287,That would be the -- that would be the report of our contention.
1957.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3319.287,3319.504,No.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,3320.645,3322.716,"Not in so many words, Your Honor."
1957.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3331.391,3334.554,And then you put all your eggs in that basket.
1957.92,1,45244,warren_b_king,,3334.554,3338.75,We do put our eggs in the basket that there was no law in the United States authorizing the oath.
