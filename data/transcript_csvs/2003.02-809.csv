2003.02-809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.052,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-809, Maryland v. Joseph Jermaine Pringle."
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,56.061,59.05,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,72.818,76.244,What... the rear seat armrest was pushed up--
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,76.244,77.07,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,77.07,79.838,--and then the drugs were behind the... the armrest?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,79.838,81.629,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,113.025,114.965,"At the end of the day, what happened?"
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,114.965,121.198,"--At the end of the day, all three were arrested, respondent confessed, and said the--"
2003.02-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,121.198,124.336,And respondent was a front seat passenger?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,124.336,126.194,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,126.194,127.597,He's the one who confessed?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,127.597,128.134,Yes.
2003.02-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,128.134,130.858,And was found ultimately guilty of--
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,130.858,131.851,He was found--
2003.02-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,131.851,133.17,--some drug-related offense?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,133.17,136.43,--He was found guilty both of possession and possession with intent to distribute.
2003.02-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,136.43,136.968,And the other two?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,136.968,142.746,The other two were not charged formally after respondent confessed.
2003.02-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.055,157.03,Do you say that there was probable cause for the arrest of all three at the time they were found?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,157.03,157.401,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.401,163.883,Was there probable cause sufficient to support charges at a preliminary hearing--
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,163.883,165.469,I think there would have been.
2003.02-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,165.469,166.317,--against all three?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,166.317,168.425,"I... yes, Justice O'Connor, I think there would have been."
2003.02-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.456,190.095,"Is there any additional requirement for establishing probable cause at a preliminary hearing above and beyond what's needed for the arrest, or are they identical, in your opinion?"
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,190.095,191.088,"I would say they're identical, Your Honor."
2003.02-809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,191.088,200.952,"So... so under... under that view, assume no confession, hypothetical case, under that view, these people, all of the three could have been bound over for trial?"
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,200.952,201.945,I believe so.
2003.02-809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,201.945,207.351,"And under that view, any motion to dismiss prior to trial would have to be denied?"
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,207.351,212.569,I believe there would have been probable cause to charge and to take the cases to trial.
2003.02-809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,212.569,221.385,"And I suppose what happens in that case is the judge says, and I want to tell you right up front I think this is a very skimpy case, you'd better come up with something... I guess that's the way it works--"
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,221.385,221.924,I think so--
2003.02-809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,221.924,232.038,"--But there's... but the... as Justice O'Connor said, it's probable cause and it's the same standard... excuse me... it's the same standard to bind over on arraignment as it is for the officer to arrest?"
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,232.038,251.85,"--My understanding from the case law, Your Honor, is that probable cause is probable cause, be it to search, to arrest, or it... I think it's a fluid concept, obviously depending on the exact context, and I'm not saying that a prosecutor would not exercise discretion as would a police officer in a given case not to take a case forward."
2003.02-809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,251.85,256.475,"Well, a preliminary hearing is largely a matter of Maryland law, isn't it, or State law?"
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,256.475,258.249,It is and--
2003.02-809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,258.249,265.103,"I mean, is there any... any constitutional requirement that there be a preliminary hearing before a criminal case is tried?"
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,265.103,267.454,"--Not that I know of, Your Honor, no."
2003.02-809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,267.454,278.682,"Well, I take it even under the Constitution, if it's a Federal case, both the indictment and the... or the information shows simply probable cause, that's enough to bind over?"
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,278.682,281.571,"I believe so, Justice Kennedy, I believe so."
2003.02-809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,284.172,286.195,"But if you say it's fluid, that... that concerns me."
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,301.966,303.369,--I'm not sure it's a greater burden.
2003.02-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,321.49,339.035,"In your view, is this very fact-specific so that it might come out differently if the money and the drugs had been located in some little pocket next to the driver as opposed to some rear seat passenger or other passenger?"
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,339.035,350.014,"I think one factor that would significantly change the totality of the circumstances here would be, for instance, if the drugs had been found on the person of one of the passengers."
2003.02-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,350.014,351.212,"No, that wasn't my question."
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,351.666,351.932,If it had been--
2003.02-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,351.932,357.033,"--they were found very close to the driver, you know, sometimes there's a little pocket right next to--"
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,357.033,357.422,--In the door?
2003.02-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,357.422,360.294,"--on the door, on the driver's side."
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,366.405,367.807,"Not in this case, no."
2003.02-809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,373.836,375.405,How about the trunk?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,375.405,380.81,"--I think the trunk changes things a little bit, but of course you have to look at the totality of the circumstances, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,380.81,381.388,Why a little bit?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,395.467,396.248,That's--
2003.02-809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,396.248,401.904,"Now, if you have something in a locked trunk, it truly is not accessible to the passengers."
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,401.904,433.75,"--It certainly is not as accessible, and of course it's not as immediately accessible, but, for instance, if there had been a large quantity of drugs in the trunk or if there had been a dead body in the trunk, I think then there is a... the calculus changes in terms of totality of the circumstances, and I think if it were that situation, even though that particular evidence was in the trunk, I think there's still a... a strong inference that could be drawn that everyone in the car knew about it, because who would take the chance in terms of taking along innocent passengers--"
2003.02-809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,433.75,438.396,"Well, let's stick to the five... these five bags that were stuck in a Ziploc bag."
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,441.945,442.567,--I understand.
2003.02-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,450.49,451.112,But under--
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,476.496,477.322,Not... not--
2003.02-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.322,491.236,"I mean, suppose it's at... in the middle of the day and she's going to the grocery store, we don't have it at 3:00 a.m. in an area where drugs are frequently sold."
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,493.465,494.291,"--I think it does, Your Honor."
2003.02-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,517.735,519.015,What if there had been four people in the car?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,519.015,521.45,--I don't know that four people would change things.
2003.02-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,521.45,522.359,How about six?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,522.359,524.505,I think within the--
2003.02-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,524.505,527.023,Or what if it was a minivan and there were eight in the minivan?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,527.849,529.807,"--I'm not sure it changes it significantly, Your Honor."
2003.02-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,531.747,536.205,You think with eight people in the minivan you could arrest all eight and hold them over for trial?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,536.205,546.425,"--I think if you have identical circumstances to these in terms of the time, how well-acquainted they all appeared, the fact there was money, the fact that there were drugs packaged for distribution."
2003.02-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,552.908,555.88,"But the distribution, as I understand it, was just enough to take care of a big party."
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,559.967,573.629,"Well, the evidence, at the time the officer made the arrest, I think he could draw an inference that there was cash proceeds perhaps of former drug sales, prior drug sales, and there were five individually packaged crack... hits of crack cocaine."
2003.02-809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,573.629,577.65,"And the charge was possession with intent to distribute, wasn't it?"
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,577.65,582.258,"Yes, it was both simple possession and possession with intent to distribute, and he was convicted."
2003.02-809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,582.258,583.455,How about if it had been a bus?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,587.209,588.407,"I think a bus is different, Your Honor."
2003.02-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.094,599.181,Are you talking about a public bus or you're talking about a chartered bus?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,600.834,605.747,--I think that would affect obviously the totality of circumstances as well.
2003.02-809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,605.747,623.246,"What... what is... what is the rule that you're... there's the restatement hypotheticals... Restatement of Torts, where there's the dead body, two people are each accusing the other, and add... I don't know how the hypothetical would work... but add to the mix that only one could have done it."
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,624.444,625.809,"I think you can, Your Honor."
2003.02-809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,635.301,638.85,The Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure just talks again about probable cause?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,638.85,644.589,"--Same situation where you have, say, two people, only one of whom could be guilty of the crime."
2003.02-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,648.51,649.874,But that's two people and here you've got three.
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,652.019,653.134,I think three is... is--
2003.02-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,653.134,653.961,You can arrest all three?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,653.961,654.537,--I think so.
2003.02-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,654.537,655.213,What about five?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,658.252,658.874,"Well, of course."
2003.02-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,658.874,660.648,"--10 percent chance, there are 10 of them now--"
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,660.648,661.596,And... and--
2003.02-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,661.596,663.992,--so the chance that any individual one did it is 10 percent.
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,665.328,671.172,--I think we can't draw... the Court in Gates said that you cannot quantify probable cause.
2003.02-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,673.113,673.773,It doesn't mean probable.
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,673.773,675.631,"--No, it does not mean probable."
2003.02-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,676.252,677.738,Why do we call it probable cause?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,677.738,688.345,"--I'm not... I think there's a bit of a misnomer there, but clearly from the case law of this Court, it means a fair probability, it means something greater than reasonable suspicion under Terry--"
2003.02-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,688.345,693.175,"But if you had to reduce it to a percentage figure, what would you call the percentage required for probable cause?"
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,693.175,694.95,"--I don't know that I could, Your Honor."
2003.02-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,697.057,698.748,"But it's less than 50, though, I gather?"
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,698.748,699.408,--Yes.
2003.02-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.977,705.602,"So that takes care of the two people in the room, but when you get down to 33-1/3 with three people?"
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,705.602,708.036,--I think... I think three people clearly would be--
2003.02-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,708.036,709.15,And with four people it would be 25 percent.
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,709.976,711.668,"--Probably, probably."
2003.02-809,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,711.668,712.289,Probably.
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,724.383,725.293,"Yes, I agree with that."
2003.02-809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,740.608,741.472,And one is--
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,741.472,752.142,"Of course, on the Government's theory I don't think it would matter, because they say you can infer a conspiracy, and I suppose then the whole bus could be in the conspiracy, but if it's an individual approach, which I think you're taking, then the number of people might make a difference."
2003.02-809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,767.85,774.166,--Do you accept Justice Stevens' suggestion that your position might differ from the Government here?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,774.166,775.198,I don't know that it does.
2003.02-809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,777.76,785.866,So... so you do think a conspiracy can generally... can be inferred as to all people in these... in the instance like this?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,785.866,787.791,"In our case, absolutely, absolutely."
2003.02-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,789.11,789.732,But if one of them--
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,794.683,795.426,"--Well, I think we did, Your Honor."
2003.02-809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,806.45,816.125,"If you know nothing more than what you know here... I mean, I take it that if... if it were undisputed that one of the three was a hitchhiker, you... you would not make the argument with respect to the hitchhiker?"
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,816.125,823.168,"I think if... if it's undisputed, and of course, that's going to be a difficult situation to... to know that there's no actual connection--"
2003.02-809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,823.168,824.654,That's the wonderful thing about being on the Supreme Court.
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,824.654,825.397,--If it's--
2003.02-809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,825.397,826.595,You can make those assumptions.
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,826.595,846.695,"--If it's undisputed, then I think that significantly changes, because I think a lot... a core concept here is this notion of common enterprise, that when you have people in a car together, particularly a small passenger car, there's an inference, I think in this case a very strong inference, that all three of these people were engaged in a common enterprise."
2003.02-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,848.636,849.751,But do you have... do you need the--
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,857.941,867.501,"--I guess it would be... of course, that would be a more difficult case because you had the money in the glove compartment of the car and the drugs in the backseat of the car, so that--"

2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,871.027,872.209,--I think it adds--
2003.02-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.209,880.094,"Because there's certainly nothing illegal about carrying money in the glove compartment, where it is illegal to carry drugs in the... behind the seat... the armrest."
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,880.094,884.673,"--Well, certainly the money without the drugs would be a... a different case than the drugs without the money."
2003.02-809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,884.673,885.212,But you--
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,895.698,901.066,"No, and... and that, of course, goes back to whether it's undisputed in some way, I don't know quite how it would be undisputed."
2003.02-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,921.211,922.53,"Well, I'm still curious about the answer to my question."
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,937.574,940.446,"Two... two answers to that, Justice Stevens."
2003.02-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.589,949.818,But what is the answer?
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,949.818,952.502,"--The other is, it could be that--"
2003.02-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.502,954.071,I thought you were going to say the two answers were yes and no.
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,954.61,960.32,"--It could be, Your Honor, that the... the driver knew the hitchhikers and that's why he picked them up."
2003.02-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,961.685,962.106,"No, no, no."
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,982.999,983.825,"--I think so, yes."
2003.02-809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,985.122,990.762,You... you have... you really have to say that based on the dead victim hypothetical that you answered earlier.
2003.02-809,0,25036,gary_e_bair,,990.762,1009.255,"I think so, I think so, that... that if the, again, one... the other inference among the... the... the indicators of a common enterprise would be, I think it's unusual that several people are going to be taking a chance driving around, either with evidence of a murder or evidence of a drug conspiracy."
2003.02-809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1020.029,1020.855,"Very well, Mr. Bair."
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1023.744,1033.048,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1050.244,1072.618,Your brief reads to me... at about page 15... to suggest that you're proposing a broad rule that probable cause exists to arrest all occupants of a car anytime commercial quantities of narcotics are found in the passenger portion of the car.
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1072.618,1073.815,It's... we don't intend--
2003.02-809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1073.815,1074.847,Is that your position?
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1074.847,1077.448,"--We don't intend to suggest a broad rule, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1077.448,1081.33,Do you agree that it is a totality of the circumstances test?
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1081.33,1087.107,"Yes, it's a totality of the circumstances test, and it will turn on contextual factors that are present in any particular case."
2003.02-809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1087.107,1103.908,"Well, you do say at page 15, beginning of the first full paragraph, for these reasons, the discovery of an amount of narcotics suitable for distribution in the passenger compartment supports an inference that all of the car's occupants were aware of, and hence, involved with the drugs."
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1105.6,1123.144,"Well, what... what we intend to say is that ordinarily when drugs that are packaged for distribution are found in a location in which they're readily discoverable by the other passengers, a reasonable officer can fairly conclude that there's a fair probability that each passenger is... is aware of the drugs, but of course in particular cases--"
2003.02-809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1123.144,1126.488,But it... it might... wouldn't different factors enter into it?
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1128.513,1129.832,"--Absolutely, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1129.832,1138.665,"--in the vehicle, and it's in the middle of the day and they're dropping the child off at school or something."
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1146.717,1147.393,No.
2003.02-809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1190.018,1200.42,"The only evidence that supports the notion that some were uninvolved is that as soon as one of them confessed, the police immediately dismissed the charge against the other two, and therefore abandoned the notion that it was a common enterprise."
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1200.42,1209.337,"--Well, I... it... there's a... I think there's a different question concerning whether there was probable cause for an arrest and the determination by an officer whether to proceed with charges."
2003.02-809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1210.74,1218.996,"You'd think if the... if the backseat person or whoever it was that confessed had confessed while the officer was arresting him, there would have remained the probable cause as to the other two?"
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1221.68,1228.573,"--There might well have been, Justice Stevens, because an officer's not required to believe the version of events that's given to him by people on the scene."
2003.02-809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1240.545,1246.86,May I... may I clarify whether you are indeed relying on common enterprise?
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1280.547,1282.238,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1316.706,1328.512,Do... do we demand the same standard from the arresting officer as we do from the district attorney who decides whether or not to proceed to preliminary hearing?
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1328.512,1330.924,The probable cause standard works the same.
2003.02-809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1334.539,1336.564,But... but do we demand a higher standard--
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1336.564,1337.761,"--Well, it's--"
2003.02-809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1337.761,1339.74,--from either of them in making that assessment?
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1339.74,1348.081,--It's often the case that prosecutors will have more rigorous standards as a matter of internal... matter of internal guidelines.
2003.02-809,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1357.74,1370.0,"Well isn't... isn't that... that means the... the probable cause standard is the same, but the prosecutor has an obligation to try to find out more and get more evidence before he goes forward."
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1371.031,1371.608,--Right.
2003.02-809,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1381.6,1396.627,"But the... but the standard... the standard that determines the... the... the degree of likelihood of inference, that is the same standard, whether we're talking about the police officer or whether we're talking about the district attorney later?"
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1396.627,1396.915,--Correct.
2003.02-809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1398.69,1401.995,I... I'm not sure what you're saying.
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1408.311,1417.932,There's a different... there's a different question whether the evidence is sufficient to convict as presented by the prosecutor and whether the prosecutor has enough to go forward with the charges.
2003.02-809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1417.932,1426.765,"No, but you're saying the prosecutor does not have an obligation to refrain from bringing a prosecution where he plainly on the face of it doesn't have enough evidence to convict?"
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1426.765,1431.678,"As long as there's probable cause to go forward, the prosecutor can go forward with the charges."
2003.02-809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1431.678,1437.434,To say plainly on the face of it is something that a... a prosecutor is seldom confronted with.
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1442.619,1444.598,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and--"
2003.02-809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1444.598,1449.428,"Well, I'm assuming he has three people in the car and the chance for each of them is 33-1/3 percent--"
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1449.428,1450.421,"--Well, he could go--"
2003.02-809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1450.421,1452.771,--and he prosecutes one of them and he has nothing else.
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1455.622,1456.448,"--Well, that's--"
2003.02-809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1456.448,1459.458,--and he picks the passenger and brings a prosecution.
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1462.885,1477.541,"--Well, that's... that's different from the facts of this case, but even assuming that it were an equal likelihood that each of them independently were involved in the offense, the prosecutor could go forward in that situation, but it's highly unlikely that he would go forward in that situation because... because he's unlikely to obtain to a verdict in his favor."
2003.02-809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1479.399,1486.579,And the district court probably would not let the case go to the jury if the motion was made at the end of the prosecution's case and this was all you had?
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1486.579,1487.944,"--That's correct, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1487.944,1494.426,The prosecution should... the prosecutor should bring cases which clearly will not be able to go to the jury?
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1494.426,1495.912,"No, not should bring cases--"
2003.02-809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1495.912,1497.232,"May, may."
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1497.232,1499.09,"--May, under the Constitution."
2003.02-809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1499.09,1500.842,"Okay, that's not my understanding of the prosecutor's--"
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1500.842,1508.711,"And that's why, I think, prosecutors typically enforce upon themselves a more rigorous obligation than the probable cause standard."
2003.02-809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1508.711,1511.721,--But we have no case saying that they may not proceed?
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1511.721,1515.519,"No, there's no case that I'm aware of that says that they can't proceed where there's probable cause."
2003.02-809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1515.519,1519.895,But you just said the manual instructed them not to bring cases to trial.
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1519.895,1521.752,In... in the Federal system--
2003.02-809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1521.752,1522.29,Yes.
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1522.29,1532.321,"--there's Federal guidelines that spell out when Federal prosecutors are supposed to bring cases to trial, but I'm not aware that that's required by Federal law or by the Constitution."
2003.02-809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1534.55,1537.811,Do you have readily at hand the... the citation to the manual?
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1537.811,1540.578,--I don't... I don't have the particular provision.
2003.02-809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.578,1545.862,"Of course, the... the manual wouldn't in any way bind Maryland authority."
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1545.862,1547.016,That's correct.
2003.02-809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1549.495,1551.474,If... if the Federal manual binds anyone.
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1551.474,1552.217,Right.
2003.02-809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1588.216,1601.59,"What about the respondent's position that your position means two innocent people may be locked up in jail, because suppose Pringle hadn't fessed up, and he exercised his right to remain silent."
2003.02-809,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1610.878,1623.882,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it's possible that innocent persons will be arrested and bound over in circumstances like in this case, but the probable cause standard accepts that possibility as the cost of ensuring the effective enforcement of the criminal laws."
2003.02-809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1633.951,1637.461,"Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,1640.6,1643.694,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1667.182,1673.682,"Ms. Forster, when you say testimony, you're not referring to any scheduled hearing or formal hearing, are you?"
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,1673.682,1696.821,"--Well, Your Honor, what the court in Maryland reviews on appeal is the motion to suppress hearing, and at that hearing there was no evidence presented whatsoever that the officer in this case noticed any furtive movements by Mr. Pringle, any furtive gestures, that he said anything suspicious at the scene, or that he acted in any unusually nervous manner."
2003.02-809,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1698.49,1717.914,"Well, I thought we were considering this on the basis offered, which is the three people at 3:30 a.m. in a high crime neighborhood in a sedan where there were a certain quantity of drugs behind the armrest and money in the glove compartment."

2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,1722.91,1728.771,"--This is... 3:00 a.m. is accurate, 3:16 a.m. It is in a residential area."
2003.02-809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1753.375,1756.802,"Well, a lot of people wouldn't refer to children as being in their twenties, I think."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,1757.916,1760.062,"--Young adult children, Your Honor."
2003.02-809,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1760.062,1769.229,You... you make an interesting opening statement that this is a highly unusual... we've... a lot of us read a lot of these cases.
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,1774.718,1780.912,But what we have here with respect to Mr. Pringle is simply presence and nothing more.
2003.02-809,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1782.148,1784.461,But isn't there... isn't there something more than presence here?
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,1860.539,1861.282,--If I--
2003.02-809,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1861.282,1868.219,--and isn't that the basic difference between this and Houghton and doesn't that inference support... amount to probably cause?

2003.02-809,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1895.71,1896.099,But is--

2003.02-809,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1902.975,1926.175,"Well, you pointed it out, but I think it... I thought, and tell me if I'm wrong here, I thought that it was... it was... the evidence was, regardless of how he first described the quantity that he saw, I thought the evidence came out that there was 700 and some odd dollars in it, so I think the judge could infer that it was fairly... a fairly sizable roll of bills."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,1926.175,1930.179,"--Justice Souter, the actual amount did not come out until the trial."

2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,1944.668,1946.525,It was concealed in the glove compartment?
2003.02-809,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1946.525,1949.415,"And it was open, it wasn't in a wallet or something like that?"
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,1949.87,1950.901,We don't... we don't know.
2003.02-809,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1967.598,1968.324,So it's reasonable--
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,1975.876,1977.157,The record is unclear.
2003.02-809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1977.157,1981.699,"Well, but, I mean, you... you don't have to have been born yesterday to decide that."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,1981.699,1997.607,"Well, the... Your Honor, I guess the point is, is that all that was before the trial... the trial judge at the motion to suppress hearing... there was never any characterization of the denomination, the amount, nothing, just the only thing that was said was the money."
2003.02-809,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1997.607,2001.511,Do you have a roll of bills exposed in your glove compartment?
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2001.511,2003.18,"At times I do, Your Honor."
2003.02-809,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2003.18,2003.657,You do?
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2003.657,2004.278,Yes.
2003.02-809,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2004.278,2005.68,You better be careful if you do.
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2007.372,2031.604,"I might also point out that at the actual trial, the expert who did testify for the State with regard to the... whether or not this was an intent to distribute... testified that without Mr. Pringle's confession and this statement, he could not in fact say that this was consistent with an intent to distribute based solely--"
2003.02-809,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2031.604,2033.007,So it was at least possession.
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2045.804,2046.26,--Yes.
2003.02-809,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2046.26,2051.833,"Then... so the officer says, I know that a crime has been committed."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2072.842,2074.206,"No, that's not the answer."
2003.02-809,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2074.206,2074.867,What arrest can he make?
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2074.867,2094.101,"Justice Ginsburg, in this case, the officer could arrest Mr. Parlo, the driver of the automobile, because I think it is universally accepted that we can impute the driver owner of an automobile with the knowledge that he knows what is in his car and he has exclusive control over that which is in his car."
2003.02-809,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2097.651,2098.56,And no one else?
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2098.56,2121.594,"Your Honor, I would suggest that perhaps... I mean, and of course, this is not the issue before the Court, that perhaps because of Mr. Smith, the backseat occupant, may also have been arrested given that the nature of an armrest is not really a normal repository that one would place personal items in--"
2003.02-809,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2121.594,2125.392,"So maybe... definitely the driver, maybe the backseat passenger--"
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2125.392,2126.052,--Maybe Mr. Smith.
2003.02-809,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2126.052,2126.795,--but not the one who in fact--
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2126.795,2127.417,But definitely--
2003.02-809,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2127.417,2129.396,--who in fact committed the crime.
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2129.396,2139.221,"--Definitely not Mr. Pringle, but of course, if we're going to use Mr. Pringle's confession in determining in hindsight, we need not have--"
2003.02-809,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2139.221,2149.541,"If this were... if this were a bus or a tavern or a theater or some of the examples, then it certainly would unreasonable to assume that the front seat passenger could reach back to the last row of the theater."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2158.624,2167.457,"--Justice Ginsburg, I agree with that... that perhaps it would not be difficult, given the compact nature of this car."
2003.02-809,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2174.35,2180.666,"Well, that's because they... they didn't have a buy committed in the presence of the officer at the scene."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2180.666,2182.773,"--Well, I... I understand that, Your Honor."
2003.02-809,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2182.773,2184.381,"I mean, I don't know why that counts against--"
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2184.381,2197.838,"Well, my second response would be this, that I think that it would be highly unreasonable that Mr. Smith, the backseat passenger, would allow Mr. Pringle to turn around and store the drugs in the armrest right next to him."
2003.02-809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2197.838,2198.664,--Why?
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2212.245,2220.668,"Your Honor, the Maryland... with all due respect, the Maryland Court of Appeals made a mistake in this case because what they said in their opinion--"
2003.02-809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2220.668,2224.133,"Well, but no, we take the facts as the lower court found them."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2229.789,2246.507,"--Your Honor, what the court of appeals incorrectly did in this case was... and they dropped a footnote to suggest that it was unclear to them whether or not there was a separate motion to suppress hearing or whether there was a combined motion to suppress trial proceeding."
2003.02-809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.473,2257.16,But the... but they nonetheless say that Officer Snyder seized $763.
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2257.16,2265.827,"That's true, Your Honor, and for purposes of Mr. Pringle's position, the fact that that money is concealed, really it makes no difference the amount."
2003.02-809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2274.622,2278.17,"Why... why did you say the driver, I mean, on your theory?"
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2286.26,2291.833,"Well, Justice Breyer, that assumes that the driver did not put it there before he picked up his passengers."
2003.02-809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2291.833,2294.145,"Well, if he put it there before, wouldn't they all know it was there?"
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2294.145,2296.086,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2003.02-809,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2301.576,2311.895,"But the driver consented to have the car searched, so one might think, my goodness, if he knew there were drugs there, why did he say yes when he could have said no?"
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2311.895,2322.381,"Justice Ginsburg, I can tell you as a criminal defense lawyer that defendants consent all the time when they have a car full of drugs and they know the drugs are there."
2003.02-809,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2324.898,2329.728,This is not like the... one of the cases that you relied on is the Di Re case.
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2347.644,2365.477,"--Except that... how this case is similar to Di Re is that in Di Re this Court held that if the act... the criminal activity, the ongoing criminal activity, is not visible to the occupants, the mere presence is not enough on which to have probable cause to arrest."
2003.02-809,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2372.164,2373.612,But there... there's... there's another difference.
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2389.587,2392.354,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I agree with that."
2003.02-809,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2402.402,2417.617,"Well, except if... if you accept the proposition that the... that there probably was a roll of bills visible in the glove compartment, Mr. Pringle was within easy reach, not even arm's reach of the rolled bills."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2417.617,2426.451,"Well, Justice Souter, the... the problem with that, of course, it's pure speculation, but we don't even know if this glove compartment was locked or unlocked."
2003.02-809,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2439.165,2445.315,"Well, we... we don't know that and we don't know whether the armrest had come down during the time the backseat passenger was there."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2466.742,2478.835,"But, Your Honor, I... I think that if we want to speculate that perhaps then we could say that that would be enough, but probable cause requires far more than speculation."
2003.02-809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2534.646,2555.906,"Those I just think that... look, it just doesn't strike me as plausible that when you have three people in a car, one of them would stuff some drugs behind an armrest where they're very easy to find, unless he thought the other two were in on it, I mean, unless you thought the other two at least didn't care, and if they didn't care they're out there transporting the drugs with them."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2555.906,2556.344,--Well--
2003.02-809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2556.344,2566.514,"So... so how... I don't even know, I mean, what I'm struggling for is, that seems like a reasonable inference so how... how do I know, I mean, I'm making this kind of inference."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2569.031,2575.513,"--Justice Breyer, the inference that the backseat passenger may stuff the drugs in the armrest--"
2003.02-809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2575.513,2579.024,"Any of the three, I mean, any of them might, and why would they?"
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2587.979,2589.093,--But certainly--
2003.02-809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2589.093,2590.208,--and probably are in on it.
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2633.098,2638.588,"--Well, no, Your Honor, I... perhaps I... I was not clear."
2003.02-809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2638.588,2640.696,"Here's what she's thinking, and there might be a million different crimes."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2657.453,2658.446,"No, Your Honor, I--"
2003.02-809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2658.446,2659.272,You couldn't arrest him then?
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2659.272,2660.979,--I don't think he could be arrested.
2003.02-809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2660.979,2665.438,For transporting the drugs or helping to transport them or being an accessory or doing something?
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2665.438,2670.706,"Well, certainly if he's the front seat passenger and not the driver he's... he's along for the ride."
2003.02-809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2672.563,2673.307,"Well, he doesn't say anything."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2679.372,2683.542,"--Under those circumstances, Your Honor, I think you'd have a much closer case."
2003.02-809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2683.542,2689.775,"No, no, but... but no, look, either there is a crime of being in a car knowing that or there isn't."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2691.883,2700.799,"Well, the crime of possession requires not just knowledge, but it also requires the intent to exercise dominion and control over the drug."
2003.02-809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2700.799,2708.479,"All right, so... so you'd have to then make an inference that a person who says, yes, I knew the drugs where there, was also going to help later on."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2708.479,2708.767,Yes.
2003.02-809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2709.344,2709.965,All right.
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2710.459,2712.704,--there would have to be some reasonable inference--
2003.02-809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2712.704,2714.628,--And you think that's not reasonable either?
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2714.628,2716.736,--I think it is not just on those facts alone.
2003.02-809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2716.736,2718.715,Okay.
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2723.34,2724.592,"No, they did not, Your Honor."
2003.02-809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2724.592,2726.6,Or at the trial?
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2726.6,2729.489,"No, Your Honor, nor at the trial."
2003.02-809,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2773.783,2776.772,"Well, it was in separate little packets, right?"
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2776.772,2778.53,"--Yes, it was, but that, again--"
2003.02-809,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2778.53,2780.47,A kind that people would buy for a single dose?
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2780.47,2786.786,"--That, again, your Honor, is not inconsistent with personal use, and certainly I should think that if this police--"
2003.02-809,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2786.786,2789.758,"Yeah, and one of their charges was possession, was it not?"
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2793.473,2794.216,--That... that is correct.
2003.02-809,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2795.125,2796.035,--Pure possession is what--
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2796.035,2796.983,--and possession with intent.
2003.02-809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2796.983,2810.374,"--Well, to say it's not inconsistent with personal use, I don't think gets your client totally off the hook, because something can be both consistent with personal use and consistent with commercial intent."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2814.073,2824.764,"However, Justice Rehnquist, here this amount is not indicative of an operation that requires the participation of more than one person."
2003.02-809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2829.305,2835.249,But... but how about the combination of that with the... with the $763 roll in the glove compartment?
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2835.249,2844.554,"--Well, Your Honor, I think then it would still require speculation on the part of this police officer to assume that one was connected to the other."
2003.02-809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2884.474,2886.686,"Thank you, Ms. Forster."
2003.02-809,2,37098,nancy_s_forster,,2886.686,2886.957,Thank you.
2003.02-809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2886.957,2889.036,"Mr. Bair, you have 4 minutes remaining."
2003.02-809,3,25036,gary_e_bair,,2889.036,2890.401,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2003.02-809,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3007.551,3008.173,"Yeah, I do have one--"
2003.02-809,3,25036,gary_e_bair,,3008.173,3008.583,--Yes.
2003.02-809,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3008.583,3011.145,"--which is, I think she said, look, there are three possible inferences."
2003.02-809,3,25036,gary_e_bair,,3027.159,3036.819,"Your Honor, I think all... the nature of probable cause is that the officer is entitled to accept under the totality of the facts any of those inferences."
2003.02-809,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3037.933,3041.071,"Two... two isn't a crime, I mean, if they just all knew about it?"
2003.02-809,3,25036,gary_e_bair,,3041.071,3047.387,"--Under Maryland law, they have to have an intent to exercise control over the drugs."
2003.02-809,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3051.268,3056.015,"It has to be all three... it has to be three is great enough, so despite one plus two... okay."
2003.02-809,3,25036,gary_e_bair,,3056.015,3059.276,"--Yes, but I think for probable cause purposes, clearly that would be sufficient."
2003.02-809,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3060.845,3061.754,"Thank you, Mr. Bair."
