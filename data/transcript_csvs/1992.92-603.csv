1992.92-603,0,31702,john_f_manning,,12.299,15.22,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-603,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,147.478,150.588,"Are they generally free from FCC regulations, as well?"
1992.92-603,0,31702,john_f_manning,,150.588,164.909,"Well, the crux of this case is what a cable system is, and a cable system determines... one's status as a cable system determines whether one is subject to franchise requirements, but there are also other Federal requirements that apply to cable systems as well, such as--"
1992.92-603,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,164.909,165.929,There are other--
1992.92-603,0,31702,john_f_manning,,165.929,166.911,--There are--
1992.92-603,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,166.911,172.844,"--Requirements that these cable operators, that these small cable operators are subject to."
1992.92-603,0,31702,john_f_manning,,172.844,173.826,--That's right.
1992.92-603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,219.227,232.714,"Mr. Mann, when you are talking about a franchise requirement, are you talking about a requirement imposed by Congress, or a requirement that... franchise that allows local governments to impose?"
1992.92-603,0,31702,john_f_manning,,232.714,252.309,"Under 47 U.S.C. section 541, Congress has provided that with the exception of facilities that are grandfathered under subsection (b) of that section, a cable operator... that is, a person who operates a cable system... must obtain a franchise before beginning to provide cable service."
1992.92-603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,252.309,254.56,And a franchise from the Federal Government.
1992.92-603,0,31702,john_f_manning,,254.56,260.464,Franchise... a franchising authority... it's not clear what they mean by franchise.
1992.92-603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,273.072,277.053,"So although the act may not be clear, that is in practice what happens."
1992.92-603,0,31702,john_f_manning,,282.67,283.778,That's correct.
1992.92-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,342.467,349.362,"Mr. Manning, is that the right-of-way criterion, whether it goes over city streets?"
1992.92-603,0,31702,john_f_manning,,349.362,350.393,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,350.393,356.735,"So in New York City, you could wire up an entire city block without using city rights-of-way."
1992.92-603,0,31702,john_f_manning,,356.735,360.078,"That's correct, and it could be... as your question suggests--"
1992.92-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,360.078,360.839,Which is a lot of people.
1992.92-603,0,31702,john_f_manning,,360.839,376.18,"--It could be quite a number of people, and the judgment that Congress made, that the common-ownership requirement in addition to the right-of-way requirement was a rational basis for distinguishing between franchised and unfranchised facilities, was a reasonable line."
1992.92-603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,439.339,445.804,"What would be the virtue of that conclusion, that it would be less likely to be run as an independent business venture?"
1992.92-603,0,31702,john_f_manning,,445.804,463.446,"--Well, you would think that if you were an owner of a building and you were putting up a satellite dish and providing the service to your tenants, that your primary interest would be in keeping your tenants happy, because you are making a lot more money from their rent, or from their condo fee, than you are from providing them with cable service."
1992.92-603,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,523.765,536.766,"Mr. Manning, is it correct, I guess almost as a matter of definition, that on the scenario you're just describing, every unit of buildings is going to have to have its own complete system?"
1992.92-603,0,31702,john_f_manning,,549.182,550.504,"That's correct, Justice Souter."
1992.92-603,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,583.496,585.937,You simply have more at stake in keeping them happy.
1992.92-603,0,31702,john_f_manning,,585.937,593.771,"Right, whereas if you're serving 10 different buildings, then no one owner has that degree of leverage over your service."
1992.92-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,618.117,623.641,And the owner would have real monopoly power over that... at least over all the people within that block.
1992.92-603,0,31702,john_f_manning,,623.641,628.254,"--The owner would have substantial leverage, because the alternative for any of the buildings on that block--"
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,1702.448,1709.364,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1766.979,1772.713,"Ms. Costlow, what are the practical consequences when a franchise is required?"
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,1779.778,1793.367,"The burdens that would be imposed upon an SMATV facility that would have to obtain a franchise would be the same burdens that would be imposed upon traditional cable operators, but those burdens would not apply to any other interstate media of communications."
1992.92-603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.663,1819.974,It would include some sort of the price regulation.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,1819.974,1832.193,"--Yes, it would include price regulation as a result of the '92 act, depending upon whether or not under the statute that particular market and the players within that market are subject to effective competition."
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.827,1905.17,"It's a lot more expensive to... both to install and operate, isn't it?"
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,1908.292,1919.609,It is obviously interconnecting separately owned or managed buildings by means of a piece of cable will be cheaper in all instances for any--
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1919.609,1920.9,Virtually costless.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,1920.9,1924.815,"--I think it's 6 or 12 cents a foot, Your Honor, depending on how much cable is used."
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1950.169,1957.095,"Well, do you think a State can choose to regulate telephones without regulating cable?"
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,1957.095,1959.717,"Telephone companies, Your Honor."
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.717,1960.107,Yes.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,1960.476,1968.191,"There are incidences of telephone companies that are both intrastate and interstate service, and so there has been a dual regulatory scheme adopted for telephones--"
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1968.191,1969.161,"--No, but I--"
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,1969.161,1969.801,--Precisely because of that.
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1969.801,1970.983,"--Well, let me use another example."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,1981.84,1993.006,I believe that the Feds and the... the Federal Government or the State government cannot discriminate in the circumstances in which they regulate particular speakers.
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.457,2007.776,Are you going to answer my question?
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2010.179,2012.641,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, I thought that I was answering your question."
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.641,2013.141,I don't know--
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2013.141,2014.42,I must be misunderstanding your question.
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2014.42,2015.692,"--Well, if you have, I don't know whether it's yes or no."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2025.187,2029.641,"Yes, but may I offer an explanation?"
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2029.641,2030.643,"Okay, sure."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2030.643,2040.618,The explanation is that they can distinguish between those two media only if there are distinguishing characteristics that provide a justification for distinguishing between those media.
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2040.618,2043.791,"One's over the air, one isn't over the air."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2045.87,2047.843,But that is a distinction without a difference.
1992.92-603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2075.44,2085.558,"How about the line of cases from this Court that say that the legislature can confront evils one step at a time and you know, make exceptions if it wants to?"
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2090.079,2110.344,"Your Honor, it is true that Congress can act one step at a time, but if you look at the particular background and history and context of this particular regulation, the... neither the Federal Government nor Congress have ever subjected interstate media of communications operating by wireless, for example, to local franchising regulation."
1992.92-603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2147.378,2153.021,"Well, maybe this... maybe Congress is in the process of changing its mind and is beginning to go the other way."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2153.021,2156.914,"Your Honor, the FCC has never done so."
1992.92-603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2163.61,2167.952,"Yes, but Congress isn't bound by previous FCC decisions."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2177.007,2183.532,"--Your Honor, Congress in 1984 chose to adopt the Orth-O-Vision decision and exempt wireless from regulation."
1992.92-603,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2208.647,2221.696,"Counsel, I take it there's just no evidence in the legislative history as to what Congress thought the justification was for this distinction."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2221.696,2222.998,"No, Your Honor, there is not."
1992.92-603,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.699,2240.19,Was not what?
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2240.19,2243.642,"--Was not system size, which is the rationale presented by the Government."
1992.92-603,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2286.369,2292.132,Do you think that decision was also irrational?
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2292.132,2300.067,I don't think the decision to exempt SMATV facilities serving commonly owned or managed buildings was irrational.
1992.92-603,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2315.327,2323.682,So you just think... you think Congress was just thoughtless when they... they just cribbed this out of a Commission decision.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2323.682,2325.484,"--That is certainly likely, Your Honor."
1992.92-603,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2332.14,2342.385,You would think that at some point since 1965 there would have been some considerable objections to this discrimination.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2342.385,2350.44,"--Your Honor, the first time Congres legislated in this area was '84, so when we were speaking of the definition being in existence since 1965--"
1992.92-603,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2350.44,2356.955,I thought counsel on the other side said this distinction first came on the books in '65.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2356.955,2362.317,"--At the Federal Communications Commission level, not on the congressional level."
1992.92-603,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2372.655,2373.016,Yes.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2373.016,2375.518,SMATV did not really come into existence--
1992.92-603,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.518,2390.377,"Well, when... has there ever been objections made to Congress in their hearings since '84, because they certainly have been back in this area."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2390.377,2394.381,--There's nothing to show anything on the record in the legislative history.
1992.92-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2437.548,2440.059,Even when that ruling was subject to appeal.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2440.059,2455.82,"Your Honor, I find it implausible that if Congress truly wanted to keep this distinction, and this distinction had been held unconstitutional by the district of columbia circuit, that Congress would have gambled on the fact--"
1992.92-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2455.82,2456.619,On us.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2456.619,2457.72,--That this Court was grant cert--
1992.92-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2457.72,2458.932,Would have gambled on us getting it right?
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2460.663,2477.664,"--No... I'm sure they would have gambled on this Court getting it right, and I submit that getting it right is affirming the decision below, but I don't think that if Congress felt strongly about this, they would have gambled on this Court potentially denying cert and therefore not reaching the issue."
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2477.664,2481.727,"Ms. Costlow, what does an SMATV company do?"
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2489.711,2497.168,It is incorrect to assume that satellite master antenna television systems are always landlord-provided.
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2515.558,2516.369,Are they competitive?
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2516.369,2517.631,"--Yes, they are competitive."
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2517.631,2521.564,"Are there a number of competitors that come to buildings and say, we'd like to run an SMATV service?"
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2521.564,2522.543,And I tell you how they compete.
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2532.219,2532.71,Okay.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2554.354,2561.88,"That property owner has the same bargaining power whether it's a traditional cable, or SMATV, or MMDS."
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2563.791,2568.692,"Sure, that's true, but now let's assume that the block is not all owned by one person."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2603.818,2608.108,"--Are we speaking of separately owned buildings, or commonly owned buildings?"
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2608.108,2610.179,I'm talking now of separately owned buildings.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2610.179,2611.061,Your Honor--
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2611.061,2617.164,"If they were commonly owned, as I say, there'd be some bargaining power at the outset, but one building gets the system."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2627.902,2629.714,--If you can interconnect by wire--
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2629.714,2630.135,Sure.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2630.135,2634.506,"--That may be potentially true, but I don't think that it gives you a lot more than the traditional cable operator."
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2641.542,2642.624,"Well, that's right, but he's--"
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2642.624,2644.674,So their entry costs are no greater than the entry costs--
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2644.674,2645.442,--But he's regulated.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2645.442,2646.814,--Of an SMATV provider.
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2646.814,2647.224,But he's regulated--
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2647.224,2647.975,He's regulated--
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2647.975,2651.356,--And that's all they're trying to do here... regulate the SMATV provider.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2651.356,2655.439,"--Your Honor, everyone in the market has the potential to serve a separately owned building."
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2671.121,2672.521,It's a lot more expensive.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2685.711,2691.985,--A wireless cable operator can install service to a multiple dwelling unit for somewhere around $300.
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2703.171,2728.276,"Well, that may be, ma'am, but you see, now, I didn't know that, and maybe a reasonably informed legislator wouldn't know that, and would think, gee, if I'm... you know, if I'm a company trying to compete with another company who's gotten one building in the block, I'm just out of competition, because they only have to... I can see a legislator thinking that and saying, that's sort of a monopoly situation that we ought to allow to be regulated."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2734.441,2753.805,"--Your Honor, the purposes... I would submit that the purposes of the '84 act as confirmed in the 1992 cable act are a deregulatory purpose, and the purpose of... set forth and the objectives set forth in both those acts by Congress are that they sought to promote competition by free entry, not to impose regulations on system or entry barriers to system."
1992.92-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2788.738,2793.92,"Well, excuse me, the Government's relying on a leverage rationale, not a crude size rationale, isn't that clear?"
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2793.92,2807.581,"--The Government is relying upon the fact that Congress intended to regulate systems of larger size, because systems of smaller size would somehow be more subject to consumer control."
1992.92-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2807.581,2823.98,"Well, it's resting on the assumption that certain systems will more likely be small and other systems will likely be larger, but the rationale ultimately on those assumptions is based on leverage, not a mere crude size cut-off, isn't that correct?"
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2823.98,2825.961,"That is the Government's position, you are correct."
1992.92-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2836.84,2837.819,"That may be so, but that's a different argument."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2851.369,2868.92,"The distinctions between different media and who does and does not have to have a franchise, they did not determine that larger systems such as MMDS or DBS or any of the other private property systems would be subject to local franchising regulation."
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2937.175,2945.88,"With wireless, I guess you can... can you get... does wireless use the public right-of-way if you shoot it across a street?"
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2950.343,2951.635,That's exactly my point.
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2957.368,2979.471,"Why isn't the distinction between wireless and cable simply the distinction that it cost more, that you do not... the single system that has sold its service to one building on the block has... if it can connect by wire, it has a monopoly over all the other buildings on the block."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,2993.031,3032.087,"I find the fact that Congress would have intended to only harm the market entry and growth of SMATV facilities and not somehow... that they just... they wanted to advance and promote some technologies over others, or some speakers over others, not to be a plausible reason for Congress' actions here, because if you assume that Congress meant to impose, on purpose, greater cost on SMATV facilities that they did not mean to impose on other like-situated media, Your Honor, I have problems with that."
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3151.944,3157.909,I suppose you could... there is such a thing as franchising the ownership of television sets.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,3179.383,3183.585,"--But when you franchise those businesses, that gives them the right to enter the market."
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3192.841,3193.202,"Yes, it does."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,3201.737,3206.76,--Not without the permission of the private property owner.
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3218.788,3221.519,You can say the same thing about any private business that is franchised.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,3225.452,3227.215,But why--
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3227.215,3228.395,"I mean, of course that's a condition of a franchise."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,3228.395,3235.65,--But why only harm the competitive entry of a particular interstate media?
1992.92-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3244.276,3245.135,I agree.
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,3250.46,3261.616,"Well, the issue is whether or not there is some objective here that Congress sought to achieve that this particular regulatory or discriminatory classification actually serves."
1992.92-603,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3261.616,3263.887,May I ask you a factual question just to help me?
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,3275.786,3291.548,"Typically, in practice, a local franchise grants a franchise to extend cable facilities to extend cable facilities throughout the public streets and rights-of-way in the franchise area, which is usually equivalent to the individual municipality, the boundaries of the individual municipality."
1992.92-603,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3291.548,3298.091,"So there isn't a case-by-case determination about whether the... your bargaining power's been abused in a particular apartment complex, or anything like that."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,3298.091,3299.333,"Exactly not, Your Honor."
1992.92-603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3332.303,3336.258,"Ms. Costlow, has your client applied for a franchise?"
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,3336.258,3348.905,"Your Honor, until the FCC's decision below... the FCC after passage of the '84 act had determined that... had interpreted the language such that we would not have to obtain a franchise."
1992.92-603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3348.905,3350.535,"So your answer is no, it has not."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,3350.535,3351.407,"I'm sorry, Your Honor--"
1992.92-603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3351.407,3352.058,Is that correct?
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,3352.058,3354.378,"--My answer is no, it has not, and may I offer an explanation?"
1992.92-603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3354.378,3360.062,"Well, no, I don't see that you should have to explain... I mean, if it hasn't, it hasn't."
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,3369.619,3373.2,"In the '92 act, which is what I was about to explain--"
1992.92-603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3373.2,3381.046,"I... any... I mean, where does your client want to have its services?"

1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,3402.95,3403.611,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3421.422,3425.135,How about the other 49 States in which you might want to do business?
1992.92-603,1,20695,deborah_c_costlow,,3425.135,3433.971,"There are... with respect to a uniform franchise statute, Your Honor, I believe that there are about nine or ten of those in various States throughout the country."
