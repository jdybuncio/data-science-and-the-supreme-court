1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,32.842,"We’ll hear arguments next in 71-1005, Michigan against Payne."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,37.299,37.536,Thank you.
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,131.353,140.398,"Well before you passed that, when he gave the testimony against him as co-defendant, did he acknowledge at all the facts that you presented to us?"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,140.398,141.082,He did.
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,141.082,147.045,Was that testimony used against him in any way thereafter?
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,147.045,151.271,It was not.
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,234.244,239.144,"Now, in this trial, was his testimony against Bradford available to the jury?"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,239.144,240.288,"It was not, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,240.288,244.041,Does some rule or law of Michigan prohibit that?
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,244.041,248.321,The confession was not entered because Judge Burns specifically suppressed it and--
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,248.321,249.047,"Well, the confession."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,257.144,274.574,"No mention as to be made of any-- there is an agreement prior to trial, it’s my understanding, and order of the Court that no mention was to be made either of his confession or his plea or the testimony before Judge Hadsol in the Bradford trial, and none was made."
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,299.337,303.267,"But this was by virtue of an agreement, not by a--"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,303.267,306.054,"By virtue of an order of the Court, I recall."
1972.71-1005,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,306.054,308.801,By an order of the Court?
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,308.801,323.509,"It-- I’m not sure how the-- exactly the order was formulated, whether it was by stipulation of counsel, which I believe was the case, and the Court ordered-- made an order based on that understanding."
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,323.509,324.352,I see.
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,324.352,330.802,"It may have been recorded-- it may have been done in chambers and it may not have been formally filed, but that was the case."
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,330.802,343.193,"So that neither the jury nor the judge, this trial you’re speaking of now, were aware of his testimony which amounted to a judicial confession in the Bradford case."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,343.193,351.524,"The judge was, Your Honor, because the-- he was the one who had vacated the prior conviction."
1972.71-1005,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,474.483,475.744,"And that issue is not here, is it?"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,475.744,476.754,"That issue is not here, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,476.754,477.279,No?
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,477.279,478.075,No question of that.
1972.71-1005,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,478.075,479.74,Okay.
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,479.74,489.206,The second issue is that of whether or not a higher sentence could be imposed on the second sentence after a successful appeal.
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,771.68,776.084,"Well, first of all, did the same Judge evoke the trial?"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,776.084,777.045,"No, sir."
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,780.303,780.872,Right.
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,780.872,783.106,And Judge Chester Burns imposed the second sentence.
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,783.106,786.787,"That’s what I thought, yes."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,786.787,788.182,There are certain factors--
1972.71-1005,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,788.182,794.904,"It was Judge Burns who, in fact, had set aside the original judgment and granted a new trial, wasn’t it?"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,794.904,796.069,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,796.069,798.156,"What was that, just on-- he wasn’t an appellate judge."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,798.299,816.751,"No, he was-- their case was remanded from the Michigan Court of Appeals for an evidentiary hearing and, at that evidentiary hearing or after it, he decided, first, that the order-- that the confession should be suppressed, the plea vacated, and it was set for a new preliminary examination which was held and proceeded to trial."
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,816.751,819.647,"Yes, and so that was, they allowed him to withdraw his guilty plea."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,819.647,819.742,That’s correct.
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,819.742,821.46,"That was the thrust of that holding, wasn’t it?"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,821.46,825.566,That’s correct.
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1001.784,1002.779,Do you have--
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1002.779,1002.884,I’m sorry--
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1002.884,1010.192,"Do you have any figure as to how many people convicted, successful on appeal, who had their sentences enhanced?"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1010.192,1025.516,"I have no figures, Your Honor, except for figures which were cited in the appendix to Walsh versus Commonwealth dealing there, not with the type of review we have here, the type of sentence we have here, but appellate review of sentencing."
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1031.458,1035.112,I’m talking about Ju-- this big flood you’re talking about.
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1035.112,1036.452,"Well, in Minneap--"
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1036.452,1038.393,I don’t know how big this flood is.
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1038.393,1043.746,"Well, the flood, Your Honor, would come from every single conviction."
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1043.746,1044.996,Every single conviction?
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1044.996,1050.116,"If a person could conceivably-- for example, a person is convicted, 100 people are convicted--"
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1050.116,1057.882,Like a few people in the penitentiary today were convicted and didn’t appeal at all?
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1057.882,1059.184,I don’t know how many there are.
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1059.184,1060.334,"Well, there are some."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1060.334,1061.342,There are some.
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1061.342,1063.133,"Well, they wouldn’t be covered."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1063.133,1064.511,"I think they would be, Your Honor, because--"
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1064.511,1065.292,How?
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1065.292,1073.94,Because the appellate purpose of Pearce is to avoid the fear of a higher sentence.
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1084.737,1096.758,"Well, I’m already quarreling with your word “all,” and I still say that a man in the penitentiary who serves life imprisonment wouldn’t be worried about enhancement of his sentence."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1098.951,1103.42,"That could be, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1181.726,1195.735,"After lunch, you will have only 10 minutes left and I hope you are saving a substantial amount of that time to emphasize the differences in a situation when the second sentence was imposed as compared with the first."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1195.735,1197.557,I will.
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1203.107,1204.5,You may continue.
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1207.057,1209.763,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1219.55,1222.592,"I don’t mean to limit you to that, but that’s a matter of very great interest to me."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1222.592,1226.866,"Yes, it is but, primarily, I’d like to deal with the two items."
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1386.504,1397.239,"Well now, the important thing perhaps or one of the important things is the impact of this as compared with the posture of the case when it was before the original sentencing judge."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1399.988,1400.943,That’s correct.
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1400.943,1404.038,"That judge had the impression somewhere, I get it, out of the record--"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1404.038,1405.133,Yes.
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1405.133,1426.556,"That since he fully confessed and re-- expressed regret and sorrow for the shooting of these officers, that he was reasonable candidate for rehabilitation and, did not the second judge give some indication that he thought that this was a--"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1426.556,1426.963,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1427.255,1429.278,Very much in marked contrast?
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1429.278,1431.19,"Yes, Your Honor, that is my second point."
1972.71-1005,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1462.673,1479.248,"Well, is it your-- state’s position that the state may impose a heavier sentence in any case if they plead guilty."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1479.248,1479.523,No.
1972.71-1005,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.523,1480.258,For the victim.
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1480.258,1482.748,"No, that’s not the case, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1485.381,1487.408,What else is there here?
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1492.59,1492.914,Yes.
1972.71-1005,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1492.914,1500.539,"But, you’re saying the heavier sentence was justified by his behavior, namely denying the crime and maintaining his innocence."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1500.539,1504.762,"In-- there’s a difference, Your Honor, we believe, between maintaining a person’s innocence."
1972.71-1005,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1514.022,1533.231,"You do say that, but a man comes up the stand and denies that he shot the weapon, that he shot the gun and then the jury finds him guilty, that the state justified imposing a heavier sentence on him than his co-defendant who plead guilty."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1533.231,1535.946,"If the case-- I know, we’re not dealing with a co-defendant, Your Honor, because--"
1972.71-1005,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1535.946,1538.071,"I know, but you would say that, I suppose."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1538.071,1541.756,"No, because I’m dealing with a question of the same person."
1972.71-1005,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1549.246,1553.817,"Well, if he loses then, he loses his game when the jury finds him innocent."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1557.093,1557.763,For behavior--
1972.71-1005,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.763,1559.174,Than if he had pleaded guilty.
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1559.174,1562.687,"For behavior which he had exhibited after that first sentence, yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1562.687,1566.762,"Well, what’s the sense-- this man was pleaded guilty."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1569.871,1571.65,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1571.65,1575.699,"Well, was the purpose of the appeal so he could go back and plead guilty again?"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1575.699,1578.409,"No, the purpose was not that he’d go back and plead guilty again."
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1586.12,1586.947,What’s that?
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1586.947,1589.151,"That is, testifying falsely."
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1589.97,1591.879,How do you know it was falsely?
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1591.879,1593.495,"Your Honor, the-- a determination--"
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1593.495,1595.756,"Well, do you have perjury as an issue?"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1595.756,1596.68,"Yes, we do."
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1600.467,1603.044,All you can say is the jury didn’t agree with him.
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1605.307,1606.854,The case?
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1606.854,1610.496,The jury agreed with the state and did not agree with the defendant.
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1610.496,1611.27,That’s correct.
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1611.27,1612.148,That’s all.
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1612.148,1619.969,"But, in finding that they agree with the state, they have to completely disregard the testimony of the defendant in this case."
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1619.969,1624.065,"Well, what other convic-- how else do you get a conviction?"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1624.065,1624.434,Well--
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1624.434,1626.716,"If you plead one side, you vote that way."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1630.055,1630.986,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1631.181,1634.064,Is that this case?
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1634.064,1634.221,We should note--
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1634.221,1636.93,What makes it so different from the (Inaudible) criminal case?
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1636.93,1651.233,Isn’t the essence of it that the verdict in the second trial cannot be read any other way than a finding that he testified falsely under oath and that they reach that finding beyond a reasonable doubt?
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1673.886,1678.909,"Yes, sir, and all the testimony has to do is to lead to that conclusion."
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1679.698,1682.816,"Well, what is it that’s so different?"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1682.816,1684.227,"The difference, I believe, Your Honor, is--"
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1684.227,1697.037,"One time, he says “I did it, I shot it and I’m sorry,” which he has a perfect right to do, and then he gets a new trial and he says “I didn’t shoot it.”"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1698.82,1699.67,Your Honor--
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1699.67,1702.099,Is that enough to increase a sentence on him?
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1702.099,1709.349,"I believe, Your Honor, it’s his conduct which would indicate a certain something about his character which the judge could take into consideration in imposing a higher sentence, yes."
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1709.349,1714.493,"Well, what did the judge take in the consideration except that he didn’t believe him?"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1714.493,1724.625,"He took into consideration that the jury found he was not telling the truth, and this indicated something about his character, a change in his character which had to do with the length of the sentence which had been imposed."
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1724.625,1727.8,The change in his character that he wasn’t now and then a scraper.
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1729.042,1730.321,"That is not what we require defendants, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1730.321,1732.089,"Well, what else is there, other than that?"
1972.71-1005,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1732.089,1736.262,"I take it, you’ve already explained at some length what you think is different, haven’t you?"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1736.262,1738.156,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1738.156,1744.949,"And did he not, not once but twice, make a full confession?"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1747.841,1748.61,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1748.61,1757.57,"When he testified in Bradford’s trial leading to the conviction of his co-defendant, he fully described in every detail his participation in the card."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1757.57,1757.774,That’s correct.
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1757.774,1766.124,"And none of this information was, of course-- could’ve been known to the judge who sentenced him on the guilty plea in the first instance."
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1766.124,1766.255,No.
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1791.619,1796.545,Did he also take consideration of the fact that he testified for the state to convict the other man?
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1796.545,1797.176,He may have.
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1798.054,1798.218,You don’t know that.
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1798.218,1799.378,He didn’t specifically state that.
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1799.378,1802.379,"Well, I don’t know he took it into consideration at all, do I?"
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1802.379,1802.843,"You don’t, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1802.843,1805.469,He only took one side into consideration.
1972.71-1005,0,32770,john_a_smietanka,,1805.469,1807.489,That’s correct.
1972.71-1005,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1815.175,1825.712,Mr. Neuhard.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,1825.712,1828.522,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1882.514,1887.457,"Well, you mean there’s some spillover effect when he testified against Bradford?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,1887.457,1888.604,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1888.748,1890.32,How long a time was that?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,1890.32,1890.707,Pardon?
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1890.707,1893.305,How long a time was that between the two trials?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,1893.305,1895.478,That’s almost a period now of 10 years.
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1895.478,1896.235,Yes.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,1905.598,1910.194,"That’s correct, Your Honor, in this particular case because of the unusual fact situation."
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1968.78,1973.154,What was the holding would set aside Bradford’s conviction?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,1973.154,1973.251,Because--
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1973.251,1974.112,Based on what?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,1974.112,1977.822,Because the confession that was introduced was the testimony of Lionel Bradford.
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1977.822,1978.828,Whose confession is it?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,1978.828,1980.343,That is Leroy Payne’s.
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1980.343,1981.494,It was introduced at the--
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,1981.494,1982.998,"In Lionel Bradford’s trial, that is, he took the stand and testified."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1982.998,1984.827,"Well, was it a confession or was he testifying--"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,1984.827,1985.85,It was his testimony.
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1985.85,1987.333,He testified in person?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,1987.333,1987.969,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1987.969,1988.781,Not a confession?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,1988.781,1989.205,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1989.205,1991.303,And it was said that that was the fruit of these beatings?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,1991.303,1992.345,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1992.345,1994.04,That’s the holding of the District Court?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,1994.04,1994.257,That’s correct.
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1994.257,1995.468,That’s now on appeal in the Sixth Circuit?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,1995.468,1999.92,That’s the-- people are appealing that case to the Sixth Circuit.
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2058.853,2061.663,But he has-- he did plead guilty.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2061.663,2062.599,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.15,2071.121,"I understand that, but at the sentencing he was found guilty."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2071.121,2072.933,"That’s correct, Your Honor, the first sentencing."
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2074.773,2078.648,Which Michigan needs to perform the actual charge.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2078.648,2082.576,"That’s correct, Your Honor, the same as a confession which was beaten out of you as an admission."
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.576,2083.848,Yes.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2083.848,2085.071,The point is the same.
1972.71-1005,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2085.071,2088.277,"Well, is there any contention that the guilty plea was beaten out of him?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2088.277,2094.157,"That-- yes, Your Honor, that the guilty plea was the product of the coercion of the Byron County police officers."
1972.71-1005,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2094.157,2100.392,"Well-- But what I asked you was, was there any contention that the guilty plea itself was beaten out of him."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2100.392,2102.83,"You mean, while he was in Court, was he being coerced at that particular time?"
1972.71-1005,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2102.83,2103.418,"Well, I think--"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2103.418,2104.952,"Well, the implication is-- that’s our implic--"
1972.71-1005,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2104.952,2108.104,I’m not-- I didn’t ask you over the implication.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2115.744,2117.594,"Directly, Your Honor, I’m without knowledge on that point."
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2120.29,2122.997,What did the Judge hold when he set aside the guilty plea?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2122.997,2127.421,That it was the product of the coerced confessions and that it directly led to the guilty plea.
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2127.421,2141.991,And that has nothing to do with whether or not he did or did not say he conformed with the act or the relevance of the fact that he said he conformed with the act in what sentence he might give.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2141.991,2142.891,I’m not sure I understand your question.
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2142.891,2147.815,It is completely different from the second case where he plead defecto.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2147.815,2152.104,"Well, it is in the sense that after the first convictions and the guilty plea--"
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2152.104,2156.459,"No, setting aside the plea the product of a coerced confession."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2162.028,2165.784,"Well, I think it has some direct bearing on whether or not a man would plead guilty knowing that he had three confessions."
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2165.784,2166.749,"No, I can see."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2174.96,2176.281,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2188.559,2197.378,"How long after the original plea of guilty and sentencing did he move for a new trial and, well, move to withdraw his plea of guilty?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2197.378,2213.649,"Well, there was-- the initial four months would be, I’d say, about three months bef-- after he plead guilty until the Bradford trial, and then it would be a period of about two years, I would imagine, before the first plea-- motion for a new trial was sen-- was made and that was in front of Judge Hadsol."
1972.71-1005,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2231.786,2245.044,"Did-- in this recent Bradford proceeding, Judge Kennedy make any finding that the story Payne told at Bradford’s trial was coerced out of him and was not true in fact?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2245.044,2247.033,"Well, she didn’t go so far as to say it was not true in fact."
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2312.106,2315.677,What year was his first sentence?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2315.677,2317.66,"He’s first sentence, Your Honor, or first conviction?"
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2317.66,2319.047,He’s first conviction.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2319.047,2320.812,His first conviction was set aside.
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2330.424,2331.99,And they’re still setting it?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2343.068,2349.488,"Well, there is, Your Honor, the very basic procedure we have for challenging the validity of a guilty plea itself. That is a voluntary--"
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2349.488,2359.778,"You may appeal-- after a guilty plea, you may appeal the admissibility, say, of a appeal procedure?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2359.778,2360.615,"Well, you can, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.229,2379.456,"No, but you can’t-- you don’t have a system in New York where if you make a motion to suppress certain evidence and is denied, plead guilty, and have him appeal the suppression of it?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2379.456,2385.646,"Well, Your Honor, it’s sort of yes, you can do it, but there’s no set up procedure to do that specifically."
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2385.646,2391.09,But then you have in your case what happened was the guilty plea was claimed to be an expressed conduct.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2391.09,2393.21,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2403.87,2411.151,Does Michigan have any statute allowing some particular time limitation on withdrawing a guilty plea after sentence?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2411.151,2412.047,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2433.878,2436.165,You mean after sentence?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2436.165,2436.988,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2449.072,2457.61,"Among the reasons given, is it required that he assert inst-- innocence of the crime?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2457.61,2461.456,"Not in the State of Michigan, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2464.29,2471.31,"In any event, he could’ve-- in view of his subsequent conduct, that wouldn’t have been a barrier to him because he did--"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2471.31,2474.873,"That’s correct, and he did assert innocence once he got back to trial."
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.44,2532.115,"Would your position be different if he had, in fact, Bradford?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2532.115,2535.552,"No, Your Honor, it would not."
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2557.311,2560.853,"Well subs-- absently, Bradford had pried."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2570.308,2572.005,"Well, in Michigan also, we have this--"
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2572.005,2576.631,This is the kind of information that Pearce had probably.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2576.631,2577.279,"No, it isn’t."
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.252,2585.949,But it may be information that the first judge had.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2585.949,2590.705,"There may, in fact, be a situation where the judge doesn’t have the same information the second judge has."
1972.71-1005,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2612.144,2632.194,"I know there’s reference to that in Judge Burns’ second affidavit that he says he did receive and studied, prior to sentencing Mr. Payne, a supplemental plea sentence report which it cannot, under the present Michigan law, make public, but which a higher Court than this one can order produced. Did that-- was that ever called for?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2632.194,2632.709,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2674.299,2677.766,But didn’t this Court settle that issue in Williams against New York?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2677.766,2691.107,"Your Honor, we agree with the basic premise of Williams v. New York that you should have-- that the judge knows much about the individual as he possibly can when he sentence him, but what we’re talking about here is the second sentencing when you have other constitutional rights which are at stake."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2727.093,2762.351,"I can understand your emphasizing the fact-- the circumstances of this first confession right after the commission of the crime after Payne was taken into custody, but we can’t avoid looking, can we, at the record which shows that police officer identified Payne by sight and that bullet holes were found at the back of his car and that the pistol-- Payne’s pistol was found to be the pistol that had been used to shoot the officers?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2765.774,2780.925,"Yes, they are, Your Honor, and they are necessarily so in many criminal convictions where a defendant takes a stand and asserts his reasons for or his explanation of the charges against him, and we contend that’s what the charge of perjury is to take into account."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2800.706,2829.205,"Well, are you suggesting that the judge in the trial, the judge whose sentence is under consideration now, was not entitled to conclude that this man was a less probable prospect for a successful rehabilitation than the first sentencing judge had concluded when he had expressed great sorrow over his conduct?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2829.205,2838.865,"Well, I can-- there’s many answers I can give to that, Your Honor, but one of the primary answers I think that’s important to recognize is this man had a 19-year minimum at this time, the 40 years in prison."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2847.271,2849.711,What’s that got to do with the question I just put to you?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2849.711,2867.496,"Because what you’re allowing because of this idea that because one judge-- the impact before him on one judge is different than the impact it has on the second judge necessarily on his candidate for rehabilitation allows him to increase his sentence at seven years, and the impact on this is that a man is now serving in prison."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2867.496,2872.827,"But don’t you think his conduct, in the meantime, should-- is something that Judge may take into account?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2872.827,2877.588,"I do, Your Honor, and this man, the judge said at the second sentencing that his conduct in prison was exemplary and that’s the only thing that prevented him--"
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2877.588,2879.242,I’m not talking about his conduct in prison.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2881.601,2891.504,"Well, if it’s conduct outside the prison, as we’re into this case, the only conduct which has occurred after the first sentencing which is alleged perjury that occurred inside the second trial."
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2925.335,2939.934,"Well, let’s assume at the-- let’s assume that at the sentencing, after the second trial, there’s no-- the defendant doesn’t say anything but “I’m innocent” and maintains his innocence."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2948.181,2949.276,"At the second sentencing, Your Honor, I think--"
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2949.276,2966.564,"No, I don’t-- let’s just say first sentence, second sentence, third sentence, any sentencing, a judge may not take into consideration the fact that the defendant denies his guilt and shows no remorse whatsoever."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2969.143,2974.877,"Well, I think there was one comment that was made, although it’s a very difficult line to draw, that we’ve cited in our brief."
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2991.465,2995.266,So your answer is that it’s unconstitutional to take that factor into account?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,2995.266,2995.665,That’s correct.
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2997.075,3000.956,"And, if you’re wrong on that, you don’t have as good a case here, do you?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3000.956,3004.095,If I’m wrong in the fact that you can’t take into account remorse?
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3045.167,3059.896,"I take it the state’s position is very close to saying that Pearce would never apply where there’s a-- where, in the first proceeding, there’s a plea of guilty which is said aside then there’s a retrial and conviction."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3059.896,3061.827,"Well, I wouldn’t chose to speak for what the state--"
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3061.827,3063.327,And the judge as well.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3076.997,3081.202,"I’m not quite sure I understand the points you’re getting at, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3091.324,3104.675,"Well, the other side of the coin is that your position is that you should-- a defendant’s conduct in the second trial, in the Courtroom, should never be sufficient to abate Pearce."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3104.675,3122.433,"No-- yes, that’s precisely our points, Your Honor, because, necessarily, in the process of an appeal of a guilty plea that was improper would be the contemplation by the defendant that he’s going to trial and that if he only sits there and does nothing, so simply as his lawyer asserts his innocence by saying “prove my guilt at this particular time.”"
1972.71-1005,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3126.843,3148.963,"That’s quite different, really, isn’t it, if the man simply pleads innocent and says to the state “prove my case” or even if he takes the stand and testifies on issues that he could be believed on consistently with an overall verdict of guilty and compare it to the getting on the stand and saying that I was in such and such a place and not where the crime is committed."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3153.202,3154.046,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3167.798,3169.874,Wasn’t there a second hearing?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3169.874,3174.438,"There-- well, in Michigan, Your Honor, you have a right to elocution which the lawyer exercised and which the judge recognized."
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3174.438,3176.135,"The defendant was there, wasn’t he?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3176.135,3176.954,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3176.954,3182.25,And didn’t the defendant-- didn’t the judge say that-- why he took it into account?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3182.25,3201.79,"Your Honor, at the first sentencing, he stated the main reason why he was increasing the sentence was because he now knows more about the crime than the first judge knew about the crime, and we’re contending that that is just factually incorrect and, because that’s the major factor he took into account, that the worst for Mr. Payne that can happen in this is that it should be remanded for resentencing at that particular time."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3201.79,3215.279,"Well, inevitably, just as a matter of time, of sequence, he was bound to know more because he knew about the intervening Bradford trial which the first judge couldn’t have known about because it hadn’t happened."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3215.279,3216.651,"Well, the first judge did know about the intervening--"
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3216.651,3218.172,He didn’t know about it when he sentenced him.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3218.172,3218.575,"Yes, he did."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3220.998,3225.857,"No, but in the first trial when he sentenced this man."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3227.517,3228.356,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3230.806,3231.859,After the Bradford trial?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3231.859,3232.145,After the Bradford trial.
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3232.145,3233.13,I see.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3233.13,3237.588,"So, the first judge knew necessarily all there was to know about this particular crime itself."
1972.71-1005,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3291.26,3293.897,"But, in Williams, we said the original sentence could be imposed."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3293.897,3294.291,Pardon?
1972.71-1005,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3294.291,3298.66,"In Williams, we said the original sentence could be imposed on that basis, didn’t we?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3298.66,3302.928,"Well, we have no qualms with the original sentence being re-imposed in this particular case."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3302.928,3307.89,"Including the death sentence, a choice between life and death was made in Williams, wasn’t it?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3307.89,3319.917,"Yes, Your Honor, but the-- in this particular case, what we’re concerned with is the actual increase in the punishment or the potential for rehabilitation as you will, of this particular individual of seven years."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3328.587,3331.361,I can understand his discomfiture over that.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3391.512,3392.993,"Yes, Your Honor, it does."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3392.993,3404.11,So that the situation can change by a virtue of different impressions about the prospects of rehabilitation.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3404.11,3407.95,"That’s correct, Your Honor, and it’s that very danger that we’re talking about in this particular case, and when you have--"
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3407.95,3414.847,And you’re supposing it takes a due process hearing to evaluate that second process?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3414.847,3420.446,"That’s correct, Your Honor, because what they’re alleging here is a separate crime and they’re giving him no opportunity to be heard on that particular crime."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3420.446,3423.182,"Well, in Williams-- going back to Williams."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3437.137,3437.416,"Well, we don’t know--"
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3437.416,3447.496,It was on the basis of that ex parte information in which the defendant couldn’t have any possibility of challenging any of the information.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3457.213,3465.771,We do not relent for a minute on the position that we should have access to that presentence report and have some control over the information being generated by that particular report.
1972.71-1005,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3495.983,3497.223,His conduct in prison?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3497.223,3499.053,"That’s-- well, where else would he be, Your Honor, with the 19--"
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3499.053,3501.585,He was being tried at the second trial.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3501.585,3509.547,"In the course of the second trial, when the con-- when the potential charge is one of-- that amounts to perjury, which at this particular case it was."
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3509.547,3510.354,Well--
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3510.354,3514.043,"If this were any other individual, he’d have a right at that particular time to have--"
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3514.043,3531.756,"Mr. Neuhard, is it clear in this case that the second judge, when he-- when the second sentence was imposed, took into account in assessing the defendant’s character and his conduct since the first trial, compared his conduct with his conduct at his guilty plea?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3531.756,3532.692,"Yes, Your Honor, they did."
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3532.692,3542.042,"Now, so he is saying that while he had read the transcript at the first sent-- at the first guilty plea, is that right or not?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3542.042,3544.154,He read the transcript of the first guilty plea?
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3545.059,3552.342,"Well, did he say that while he had confessed his guilt at the first guilty plea, he denies it now?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3552.342,3552.695,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3553.881,3566.617,"Now, isn’t this using a guilty plea that has been set aside as invalid as the product of coerced confession, isn’t it using that guilty plea in some way a subsequent proceeding?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3566.617,3567.633,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3567.633,3569.682,Do you make that point or not?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3569.682,3579.428,"We do inferentially, Your Honor, in that we consider any content-- any consideration of a lack of remorse was improper, and that’-- gets to the point where he said “you confessed in the first trial and now you’re not.”"
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3579.428,3579.931,"Well, I know."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3586.504,3592.233,"Well, he didn’t state it that way though, Your Honor, that “because you plead not guilty in this trial, I’m taking into account your lack of remorse.”"
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3617.792,3621.667,"You’re not attacking the basic conviction, just the increase in the sentence."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3621.667,3623.018,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3623.018,3640.613,"So, that means that in this Court, here and now, today, it must be accepted that the verdict was correct and the judgment of conviction was correct, namely that he did shoot these police officers."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3640.613,3648.516,"Well, the verdict, as it stands, that the jury found that he in fact had shot the police officers is, at this time, a valid verdict."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3648.516,3650.191,At this time?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3653.34,3666.758,"I won’t speak for what Mr. Payne intends to do with that particular conviction as far as collateral re-attacking it but, at this time, this Court can approach the conviction as being valid, the conviction itself."
1972.71-1005,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3783.451,3786.787,"What’s perjury in Michigan, five years?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3786.787,3789.226,"In this particular case, it would’ve been life imprisonment."
1972.71-1005,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3789.226,3790.017,For perjury?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3790.017,3791.312,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3806.009,3815.883,So that there wasn’t much percentage in the prosecution prosecuting him for perjury with-- in light of the heavy sentence he already have.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3815.883,3836.232,"Well, Your Honor, if they wanted to increase the sentence, if they felt that it was important for his sentence to be increased because of the nature of his perjury, then I feel they could’ve gone to trial and the judge certainly, at that time, was free to give him up to life, but he would’ve at least had the opportunity to appear in Court and test-- and attempt to justify why he said what he did, and he would have all the concomitant rights that go with it."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3845.406,3847.815,Did he not have a trial before a jury?
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3847.815,3849.43,"Not on the issue of perjury, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3849.43,3857.331,"Well, when a defendant takes the stand and testifies, does he not tender the truth or falsity of his own testimony?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3857.331,3858.39,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3870.615,3902.001,"Mr. Neuhard, referring to Judge Burns’ affidavit executed last November 29th and appearing on page 21 (a) of the affidavit-- of the appendix, the paragraph 4 there seems to be an open invitation for this Court to order the production of the supplemental presentence report."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,3919.044,3930.969,"No, I would not, Your honor, but I think it would point out to the Court that in our appendix A, we have the motion where we made-- which we made for the production of the presentence report and, in that particular motion itself--"

1972.71-1005,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3983.64,3984.629,Well--

1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3991.663,3995.175,Are you familiar with the case of Giles and Maryland?

1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,4002.97,4009.985,"We are-- I’d like to point out one factor in this particular case which I mentioned at the outset, which is this is a very complex case."
1972.71-1005,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4031.621,4037.709,"Well, this would be within the confine of the affidavit on November 29th, paragraph 4, wouldn’t it?"
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,4037.709,4043.857,"Well, yes, Your Honor, but I feel that there shouldn’t-- according to how I read his implications, there should not be anything there."
1972.71-1005,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4048.706,4052.267,"Certainly, it does. That’s the reason I asked the question if you would have any objection."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,4052.267,4055.689,"Well, Your Honor, I-- in that, I don’t expect there’s anything in there."
1972.71-1005,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4081.959,4082.135,I know.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,4082.135,4088.479,In which he stated the subsequent conduct and they also-- he also stated the lack of remorse and the contrary testimony.
1972.71-1005,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4090.538,4103.917,"But this new one is filed, as you know, in this Court and he does make this reference in paragraph 4 and does point out that a higher Court, presumably this one, can order it to be produced."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,4103.917,4112.774,"That’s-- I know he said that, Your Honor, and I’m at a loss as to-- we did everything we could do to obtain that in time to come to this Court, and we have not been able to obtain it."
1972.71-1005,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4113.424,4115.29,He didn’t offer to give it to you.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,4115.29,4116.037,Pardon?
1972.71-1005,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4116.037,4118.551,"In his affidavit, he didn’t offer to give it to you."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,4118.551,4123.444,"That’s correct, Your Honor, he did not."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4123.444,4135.663,"I suppose there’s nothing in the record that would show how long a hearing was held at the time of the original guilty plea and sentence, but I suppose also that that’s a relatively brief procedure."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,4135.663,4139.312,"In Michigan, as a matter of fact, it is a very brief procedure."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4139.312,4169.167,"And the judge says in his affidavit that, without going into what is already part of the record, and now I’m ensurging because there’s an antecedent I, was greatly influenced by the brutal details of the crime which, over three days plus-- which, over a period of three days, plus its-- the judge’s owns impressions of the defendant during these days, plus the impression of his testimony during those trials."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,4187.939,4188.522,"No, I would not."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4198.055,4200.721,"Then you’re saying that when he said that, this is not true."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,4200.721,4201.837,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4207.069,4224.066,"As a matter of fact, what he said at the second sentencing, in effect, retracted in the affidavit that he’s filed in this Court because he now acknowledges what he said was not the case at the second sentencing, namely that Judge Hadsol did have the opportunity to know all about the case because he presided at the de facto trial."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,4224.066,4225.239,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4225.239,4229.13,And we don’t-- and that first comes to the record when we get the affidavit here in this Court.
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,4229.13,4232.701,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4233.296,4234.643,"Very well, Mr. Neuhard."
1972.71-1005,1,32197,james_r_neuhard,,4234.643,4239.789,Thank you.
1972.71-1005,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4239.789,4242.651,We’ll enlarge your time in due of the enlargement here.
1972.71-1005,2,32770,john_a_smietanka,,4245.734,4250.932,"Thank you, Mr. Justice."
1972.71-1005,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4291.716,4293.398,Giving them a copy of it?
1972.71-1005,2,32770,john_a_smietanka,,4293.398,4297.349,This would then put the burden on this Court.
1972.71-1005,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4304.233,4307.971,The only way that the defendant can see it is for us to order.
1972.71-1005,2,32770,john_a_smietanka,,4310.652,4344.36,"That’s the way the ruling was made, yes, Your Honor, and the reason for it was that because of Judge Burns’ feelings on the matter of disclosure of presentence reports which eh included in his ruling, the reasons why he feels they should be confidential and to-- namely to protect the sources of the information and not to have these sources dry up and to give the judges as much latitude as possible to consider information, both favorable and unfavorable, to the defendant."
1972.71-1005,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4430.948,4431.916,Very well.
