1994.94-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.017,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-780, Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board v. Vincent J. Pinette."
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,11.449,14.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,46.312,50.474,"Mr. Renner, what do you mean when you say at the very seat of Government?"
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,50.474,60.781,"Mr. Chief Justice, the seat of Government would be a building or structure from which the public realizes the power of Government does its work."
1994.94-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,69.115,72.288,"Would it have to be located, say, at least in a county seat?"
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,72.288,85.248,"I am not aware... well, I don't think there are any... there would be Federal post office buildings that, for instance in cities other than county seats which--"
1994.94-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,85.248,92.651,"So when you say the seat of Government, you're not talking about a geographical location of a capital or a county seat."
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,92.651,93.663,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,106.649,109.952,"Well, do you really mean, then, anything more than a Government building?"
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,109.952,111.915,"Probably not, Your Honor."
1994.94-780,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,125.574,135.361,"Do you think the reasonable observer can conclude that petition and assembly are important activities to take place at the seat of Government, assuming that that is a valid legal category?"
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,135.361,147.837,"Well, Justice Kennedy, the reasonable observer does understand that assemblies, demonstrations, speeches and rallies take place at the seat of Government frequently, yes."
1994.94-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.837,151.629,"And is the Capitol Square a public forum, in your view?"
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,151.629,160.105,"Justice O'Connor, the Capitol Square has been recognized... certainly the State of Ohio's Capitol Square has been recognized as a public forum."
1994.94-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,160.105,161.217,And do you accept that?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,161.217,176.848,"We accept that it is a public forum, Your Honor, but if I could explain that just because it is a public forum doesn't mean that unattended displays are recognized as being anything other than a governmental display."
1994.94-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,176.848,189.333,"Well, now, as I understand it, at one time the board here had adopted a regulation saying that all displays on the square had to be attended by someone."
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,192.546,193.147,I believe there was--
1994.94-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.147,197.191,No unattended displays permitted at the Christmas season?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,197.191,197.95,"--Well, that's correct."
1994.94-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,204.524,212.401,"And that would have been a content-neutral sort of a time, place, and manner regulation, I suppose."
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,212.401,214.091,"We would certainly believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.091,217.163,"And the board could certainly adopt that as a policy, couldn't it?"
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,217.163,217.924,That's correct.
1994.94-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,217.924,226.509,"And it also, I suppose, could designate a certain part of the Capitol Square where it would allow displays by different groups."
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,226.509,227.899,"That would be correct also, Your Honor."
1994.94-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,227.899,229.471,And it hasn't attempted to do that.
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,229.471,235.936,"It didn't attempt to adopt that... it adopted the regulation you first suggested, but did not--"
1994.94-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,235.936,236.935,And then withdrew it.
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,236.935,237.616,"--adopt the regulation, the second--"
1994.94-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,237.616,248.252,Has the board permitted other groups to have displays in the Capitol Square area during the holiday season?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,248.252,251.535,--Yes.
1994.94-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,272.788,274.669,And any other groups?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,274.669,290.34,"The United Way at one time requested the State to have positioned in front of the State Capitol building a thermometer showing the progress of the United Way Campaign in the community, which the State readily approved."
1994.94-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,290.34,298.315,And has the board denied access to Capitol Square to groups other than the KKK?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,298.315,308.192,"Your Honor, other than the ones that you and I have just discussed, I'm not aware of any petitions for unattended displays on the Statehouse grounds."
1994.94-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,308.192,310.152,One last question.
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,327.714,336.041,"That's correct, Your Honor, and I believe there's a photograph attached to the documents presented to the Court of the disclaimer."
1994.94-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,341.375,348.028,"And, of course, the board could have required other types of disclaimers on more permanent material if it chose, could it not?"
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,348.028,351.489,There is an infinite variety of potential disclaimers that could be employed.
1994.94-780,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,352.401,374.597,"Mr. Renner, one of the points that you make is that the court of appeals seem to have applied a rule that so long as the forum is public, and so long as the actual sponsor is private, that's the end of the matter, and I'm not sure that the court of appeals applied that rule."
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,434.864,457.23,"Justice Souter, the reason that we believe that there was legal error in the Sixth Circuit is because, though there were various portions of the Sixth Circuit decision which address other factors... it even mentioned the enforcement analysis... the court still pronounced as its conclusion that any private speech in a public forum is permissible."
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,481.364,490.901,"Mr. Renner, could you... I'm not clear as to what kind of unattended displays were permitted under Ohio's law."
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,505.681,510.683,"Justice Scalia, the answer to that question is no."
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,547.049,550.53,But there was that content limitation on unattended displays.
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,559.036,559.657,Well--
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.657,560.468,Can you do that?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,560.468,576.277,"--You're correct, Justice Scalia, the State, of course, which was making its decisions under the guidance of court determinations, had concluded that it would be an Establishment Clause violation to allow purely religious displays to be exhibited."
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.277,577.228,I'm not talking about purely religious.
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,589.897,592.037,"Oh, I think not, Your Honor."
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,599.812,600.212,Yes.
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,600.212,602.774,But if displays are going to be presented--
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,602.774,603.345,Right.
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,603.345,610.029,--then the free speech and equal access provisions would require us to provide them to all speech content.
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,610.029,613.042,So the Libertarian Party could have put up an unattended display.
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,613.042,616.635,"That would be my under... as long as it were not purely religious, Your Honor."
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,616.635,617.314,I see.
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,622.947,624.639,"They might be, Your Honor."
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,624.639,625.809,But that's okay.
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,625.809,631.005,"Well, there's no proscription in the Constitution that the State may not be involved--"
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,631.005,632.584,The State can endorse the Libertarian Party?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,632.584,634.136,--I'm not aware of a restriction.
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,634.136,636.767,If you want to be a real Ohioan you should support the Libertarian Party?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,638.277,642.19,"Well, I would hope that they wouldn't, Your Honor, but I don't think it's violation of the Establishment Clause."
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,642.19,651.157,They really can support a particular political party officially and say you're not... you know you're not a patriotic Ohioan if you don't vote Libertarian?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,651.157,652.128,Well I--
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,652.128,653.518,I wasn't aware of that.
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,653.518,660.193,"--Well, as I'm standing here, Your Honor, I'm trying to think of what proscription in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights which would proscribe that."
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,662.704,669.719,"But you wouldn't worry... but in any case, you wouldn't worry about that being identified with the State--"
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,669.719,670.608,Well--
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,670.608,672.6,--by allowing it up in front of the State building?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,672.6,678.953,--As the attorneys for the State of Ohio we would certainly want to review all other constitutional provisions and statutes.
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,678.953,685.127,"And if the Nazi Party did it I guess the legislature wouldn't worry about the Nazi Party display being associated with the State, would it?"
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,685.127,689.241,"Your Honor, to say that they wouldn't worry about it would be disingenuous."
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,689.241,692.013,"Well, but they have this regulation that you say permits it."
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,692.013,694.213,That's correct.
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,705.103,713.227,"Whether it's lawful or not, I find it difficult to believe that the members of the Ohio Legislature wouldn't worry about the Nazi Party being associated with the State."
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,713.227,714.517,"I agree with that, Your Honor."
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.517,721.352,"And if they don't worry about it with the Nazi Party, I don't know why they would worry about it with the KKK or with a cross, or with a religious symbol."
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,732.729,742.627,"Well, I hope that it would be because, Your Honor, that religion has a specific qualification in the First Amendment, and I would hope that the State worries about the things that their attorneys suggest that they worry--"
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,742.627,759.887,"Well, I'm not worried about it whether it's... it is in the First Amendment, but you also have to establish a risk of identification, and if there's a real risk of identification, I doubt whether the Ohio Legislature would say, anybody with any sort of an unpleasant message can stick it up in front of our Statehouse."
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,762.809,766.963,"--Your Honor, I think I would agree with your analysis."
1994.94-780,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,781.432,785.544,"Mr. Renner, may I ask the other side of the coin from Justice Scalia's question?"
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,799.043,801.434,"No, I don't understand it that way, Your Honor."
1994.94-780,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,801.995,805.217,You don't understand the court of... the rationale of the court of appeals to require that?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,805.217,812.703,--It would require that if in fact those forums of speeches were allowed to others.
1994.94-780,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.703,815.946,They said it's an open--
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,815.946,827.723,"I think the State of Ohio could proscribe all unattended displays, but I think once speech is opened up, the only way that the State of Ohio could forbid any speech is if it were a violation of some other constitutional provision."
1994.94-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,827.723,828.434,--Well--
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,828.434,832.024,And that's what we assert is the problem here in this case.
1994.94-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,832.024,838.76,--Wasn't there testimony in the record here from a rabbi that said that a menorah was a religious symbol?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,838.76,846.785,"There was, Your Honor, and he testified quite vehemently that it was a purely religious symbol, as viewed by members of his faith."
1994.94-780,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,846.785,852.468,I take it your argument today is that the menorah would have to fall in the same category as the cross.
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,859.464,870.95,"It is correct, Justice Ginsburg, that Ohio made the distinction, but it was based on directives that Ohio felt had been provided to it by superior courts."
1994.94-780,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,870.95,886.562,But do I take it from your opening statement at this argument that you have now reconsidered and you... I thought you said in the beginning of your argument that no religious symbol could be in front of a building that is identified with Government.
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,886.562,889.473,"That is our belief, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,898.399,899.939,Was that an opinion of the Court?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,899.939,902.032,It was in the opinion--
1994.94-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,902.032,905.165,Did it command the votes of five justices?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,905.165,907.225,"--I do not believe that it did, Your Honor."
1994.94-780,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,924.346,930.289,Does your theory ask us to presume what a reasonable observer would conclude?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,934.504,938.196,"Justice Kennedy, I don't believe it's necessary."
1994.94-780,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,975.11,995.852,"But even if we stipulate, then, that most people, certainly most reasonable people, will not conclude that the State is sponsoring or hsa anything to do with this message, that the message is still prohibited, or the message must still be suppressed?"
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,995.852,1001.957,"--If it were a fact that nobody, or no reasonable people would associate the State of Ohio--"
1994.94-780,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1001.957,1017.227,"Well, we usually in the law talk about a reasonable observer for a starting point, and I'm asking you if your theory doesn't require us to assume that a reasonable observer would attribute this message to the sponsorship of the State."
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,1017.227,1020.25,"--I'm saying, Justice Kennedy, I don't think it requires that analysis."
1994.94-780,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1038.501,1039.502,But if this is not a part--
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,1039.502,1039.821,--but it doesn't require that.
1994.94-780,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1039.821,1049.119,"--Well, then we must assume that under your theory even if a reasonable observer would not attribute this message to the State, the State still is required to suppress it."
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,1049.119,1057.895,"The answer to that question, I think, Your Honor, lies in the decision of Lee v. Weisman in which the reasonable observer analysis was not required either, but--"
1994.94-780,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1057.895,1067.341,"But that was different, because the whole assumption there was that the State was sponsoring the message, and that's not this case at all."
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,1067.341,1076.427,"--Well, I would invite the Court to consider the parallels, because it was in that case, after all, private speech that was rendered by the rabbi that was in question."
1994.94-780,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1076.427,1079.559,But that wasn't the assumption of the opinion.
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,1082.432,1099.293,"Well, I think the Court concluded it was State-sponsored by some fact patterns that connected the rabbi with the message, and with the school system in that case, that the rabbi was invited by the school system to give the benediction and the invocation."
1994.94-780,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1099.293,1100.495,But that hasn't occurred here.
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,1100.495,1113.33,"It has not, but I also do not believe, Your Honor, that Lee v. Weisman would have turned on a situation in which the rabbi called up the school and said that my daughter's graduating, may I present the invocation for the school system."
1994.94-780,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1114.341,1117.594,Was there any indication in Lee v. Weisman that a graduation is a public forum?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,1117.594,1119.915,"--Well, there is none, and we would suggest--"
1994.94-780,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1119.915,1122.877,And haven't you conceded that this is a public forum?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,1122.877,1126.841,--We have conceded that it is a public forum for speeches and discussions.
1994.94-780,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1142.23,1151.517,"Well, are you then saying that the reasonable observer test is passed here, or are you... as distinct from saying that it need not be applied?"
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,1151.517,1165.356,"Oh, I think if we apply the reasonable observer test, which we encourage this Court to do, we would have to conclude that when we have a message as powerful as the cross, placed in front of a building that's recognizable as the State government--"
1994.94-780,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1165.356,1166.465,You're saying it meets the test.
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,1166.465,1166.976,--That's right.
1994.94-780,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1167.717,1170.648,But you're not saying that the test is irrelevant to the decision of the case.

1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,1241.446,1242.164,Well--
1994.94-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1242.164,1257.515,"--and the board has every power to protect itself by any reasonable regulation, and yet it comes here arguing for this remarkable proposition to suppress speech in a discriminatory fashion."
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,1266.341,1299.733,"--If I may, Justice O'Connor, discuss the notion of the reasonable observer who can read and, under the fact patterns of this case, what we have is a 10-foot high cross displayed in the middle of the Statehouse grounds surrounded by 8 to 10 25-story or higher buildings from which people can observe this scene of the Statehouse and the cross at distances far greater than they are capable of reading any disclaimer."

1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,1446.809,1447.51,And that--
1994.94-780,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1447.51,1450.031,--but do we have any other factual premises from which to draw that?
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,1450.031,1463.649,"--We do not, and if I might add, the one testimony that we have in the record of a witness called by the respondents indicated that when he viewed the thermometer, he viewed this as government support for the thermometer."

1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1596.728,1598.949,You said that any display could go up.
1994.94-780,0,36576,michael_j_renner,,1598.949,1623.607,"--I'm saying that we, based on analysis of equal access, that we would not deny any display based on speech content, but I would put out that when the United Way barometer went up, it went up with the approval of the State of Ohio, and people saw it as having the approval of the State of Ohio, and that was permissible because the State of Ohio is not required constitutionally not to support the United Way."
1994.94-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1623.607,1626.178,Just close it to the public forum and you would have no problem.

1994.94-780,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1972.624,1977.136,And would one such possibility be no unattended displays?

1994.94-780,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2000.672,2008.616,And I suppose they could designate a certain smaller area of the open space for use by anyone who has a display.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2008.616,2009.608,They could indeed.
1994.94-780,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2009.608,2014.112,Could a reason be that they didn't want the Ku Klux Klan to get in on the act?

1994.94-780,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2037.186,2040.128,Why not?
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2071.808,2085.597,"We believe that when there is a traditional public forum, as there is in this case, the State cannot be in the position, as it did in this case, of making ad hoc willy nilly judgments."

1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2101.668,2104.52,It could pull in the limits of the forum.
1994.94-780,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2110.624,2120.34,"But my question is, suppose, following up the Chief Justice's question, the Commission says, we have had for years a Christmas tree and a menorah."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2135.211,2136.049,We believe not.

1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2207.066,2217.655,"And, Justice Stevens, yes, in that particular hypothetical example, they are not looking to the content of individual speakers."

1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2231.823,2234.746,I think that's absolutely the worst kind of limitation.

1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2277.732,2286.607,"--Justice Ginsburg, we believe that the Establishment Clause clearly creates a legitimate interest for the State to make an inquiry."
1994.94-780,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2327.444,2343.105,"Well, could we bring it down to this case, and to make it concrete, if you can focus your attention on the Second Circuit's decision in the Kaplan case, and there Judge Feinburg and one of his colleagues thought that no viewer... in that case it happened to be a menorah."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2368.991,2387.044,"Justice Ginsburg, we believe that the Establishment Clause serves a very significant interest for the Society, and as applied to this case, we think the district court and, indeed, the circuit as well, properly applied the reasonable observer test."
1994.94-780,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2418.465,2421.347,You didn't ask to have this placed in the particular place.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2423.338,2426.51,It was not placed in a particular place.

1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2482.077,2484.717,The State didn't insist on a sign of any particular size.
1994.94-780,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2486.868,2487.489,--Could it have?
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2487.489,2488.05,--It could have.
1994.94-780,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2488.05,2495.704,"Could it have said, we want this sign to be not of cardboard, we want it to be legible, large letters... could it have said that?"
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2495.704,2510.196,"It could have, and on the facts in this case, it took so long for the processes to go forward my clients very speedily put together their symbol and the disclaimer after the district court ruled a couple of days before Christmas."
1994.94-780,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2510.196,2513.518,How about the size of the religious symbol?
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2523.142,2541.756,"Justice Ginsburg, the State may well have limitations on size of any of the displays within the forum, and if it ultimately became necessary, in order to serve a compelling State interest of Establishment Clause protection, the State could have suggested limitations."
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2553.324,2562.629,"Mr. Wolman, I confess not to understand your argument, how you wish us to decide this case."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2579.029,2580.15,That is correct.
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2580.15,2583.343,But you've mentioned some case-by-case evaluation.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2598.894,2607.897,"Justice Scalia, we believe that presumptively the speech should be treated... religious speech should be treated the same, presumptively, but--"
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2607.897,2608.978,But not necessarily.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2608.978,2611.871,--But not an irrebuttable presumption.
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2611.871,2612.522,I see.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2612.522,2614.131,"In other words, there may--"
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2614.131,2626.911,"So maybe if I thought this is too closely associated with the State Capitol, I... it's just a factual matter, whether I think the crosses are too close to the Capitol, and if they are, then even though you're allowing other speech, the cross can be excluded."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2626.911,2630.384,"--No, not excluded, Justice Scalia."
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2637.628,2638.128,But not exclusions.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2642.001,2643.023,"No, it... well--"
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2643.023,2643.912,"It is, or it isn't?"
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2643.912,2646.493,--Justice Scalia--
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2646.493,2647.795,I'm talking about exclusion.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2650.316,2653.257,"--Exclusion, you're absolutely correct, is not a case-by-case."
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2653.257,2656.571,"If you allow others to do it, you're saying you have to allow crosses there."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2656.571,2668.158,"That's correct, and time, place, and manner restrictions might be appropriate in terms of, if there is that overwhelming appearance of endorsement that the State seems so worried--"
1994.94-780,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2668.158,2677.144,"Well, Mr. Wolman, that's what I thought you had been getting at before, and I guess you've relinquished this position if it was yours, but let me just put it forward and get your response to it."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2748.351,2750.601,--I think not.
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2771.404,2774.507,"So you've retracted the answer you gave me, in other words."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2774.507,2774.928,No.
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2774.928,2775.489,Right?
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2775.489,2776.117,"No, I believe not, Justice--"
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2776.117,2777.018,It has to be one or the other.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2789.197,2789.958,--No.
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2789.958,2791.057,--is not necessarily.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2798.203,2799.896,"No, Justice Scalia."
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2812.802,2815.994,So that means there would be no content regulation.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2832.224,2836.568,"I believe that the State rules do not prohibit that, and that the State--"
1994.94-780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2836.568,2837.269,So the answer is yes.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2837.269,2837.719,--Yes.
1994.94-780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2837.719,2838.698,They would have to allow that.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2840.972,2842.772,That's correct.
1994.94-780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2842.772,2844.022,--Has that ever been done?
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2844.022,2846.886,I do not know if that--
1994.94-780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2846.886,2847.996,Is there anything in the record suggesting--
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2847.996,2850.697,--I don't know of anything specifically on that in the record.
1994.94-780,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2859.352,2860.544,--That was attended.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2885.181,2886.531,No.
1994.94-780,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2895.876,2909.484,"Could the State say that because there is controversy over religious symbols generally at Christmastime, we are going to leave the field, as it were, and prohibit all unattended displays?"
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2909.484,2910.316,"--No, Justice Kennedy."
1994.94-780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2910.316,2912.848,"Well, can they abandon the public forum?"
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2914.179,2919.923,"The State cannot terminate the public forum, which... this is one of the most quintessential ever."
1994.94-780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2923.486,2934.211,"But is every city square in every State in the... every capitol square in every capital in the United States a public forum, and if not, why can't Ohio say, we want to be like everybody else, and not make it a public forum?"
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2934.211,2936.222,This is in fact--
1994.94-780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2936.222,2938.605,"Well, what is your position on that?"
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2938.605,2939.915,--No.
1994.94-780,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2957.366,2961.33,So we can have a Ku Klux Klan cross on every Statehouse lawn in the United States?
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2961.33,2966.693,"We could, depending on events that occurred."
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2966.693,2967.474,"Not could, we must."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2981.783,2990.008,"The State, for neutral reasons, not content-based, the State could choose not to have unattended displays."
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2990.008,2991.608,"And that's a time, place... that's a manner restriction."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,2991.608,2992.069,Yes.
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2992.069,3003.656,"And is it also your position, in answer to Justice Souter and me, that the State could place a manner restriction only upon religious displays out of Establishment Clause concerns?"
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3018.175,3019.086,"No, we would--"
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3019.086,3019.537,No?
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3019.537,3025.001,"--We would say that religious displays must be permitted, not banned."
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3025.001,3025.471,They're permitted.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3027.602,3028.223,No.
1994.94-780,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3039.039,3041.493,On the same rules that every other display is permitted.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3043.533,3045.043,--Everyone has to play--
1994.94-780,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3045.043,3045.534,Right.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3045.534,3046.065,--by the same rules.
1994.94-780,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3046.065,3047.166,"And that's as far as you go, isn't it?"
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3047.166,3049.588,Not quite.
1994.94-780,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3049.588,3050.647,Well--
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3054.509,3054.95,No.
1994.94-780,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3057.682,3058.803,"It's not relevant, that--"
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3058.803,3061.285,"--Well, I think one is not--"
1994.94-780,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3061.285,3065.047,"--But if you said, if everything is the same, the Establishment Clause doesn't apply to all speech."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3065.047,3080.219,"--If everything is the same, the Establishment CLause would not apply, but these things happen in different ways in different places, and everything may not be the same."
1994.94-780,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3083.879,3091.974,"Well, could you give me an instance where you could ban a religious symbol, but could not ban the thermometer?"
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3091.974,3095.105,--I can't think--
1994.94-780,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3095.105,3102.321,"Or you could ban the Klan cross, but you could not ban the red cross, which people I think don't associate with religion."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3102.321,3106.144,--I cannot think of an example where you could outright ban.
1994.94-780,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3106.144,3110.286,"So then, the Establishment Clause you say really doesn't bear on this problem."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3110.286,3134.402,"The Establishment Clause may bear where, if absent certain types of handling of displays it becomes necessary for some special reason, given the extraordinarily immense display as an example, it may be appropriate to have in general time, place, and manner restrictions."
1994.94-780,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3134.402,3155.116,"Well, Mr. Wolman, supposing you have not the State Capitol in Columbus, where you have 10 acres, but a State Capitol which has a much, much smaller grounds, and they've got some beautiful flowers planted there, and they say, you know, we're not having any displays here at all on these grounds."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3164.592,3167.134,"That's content neutral, and it is permissible."
1994.94-780,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3167.134,3172.958,"Well then, why can't Ohio return to that sort of a thing even though previously it wasn't?"
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3172.958,3176.619,"It could return to it, if--"
1994.94-780,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3176.619,3178.691,But I thought you said they can never get out of their public forum.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3178.691,3185.145,"--No, I was speaking of the general public forum, slightly distinguished from displays."
1994.94-780,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3190.098,3193.05,What if they just have a content-neutral rule?
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3193.05,3193.531,--Yes.
1994.94-780,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3193.531,3196.523,Why do we have to inquire into their motive why they have a content-neutral rule?
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3196.523,3206.02,"If they do have a content-neutral rule, then, indeed, they could exclude unattended displays from the public forum, for a variety of reasons."
1994.94-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3216.007,3219.146,"No, they're just doing it because they just don't like the KKK thing."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3227.842,3230.764,--No.
1994.94-780,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3230.764,3243.814,"On the other hand, if the State is broke, and it says, the only way we can balance the budget is to sell our 10-acre plot for an office building, you'd let them do that, wouldn't you?"
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3243.814,3246.255,"We would, indeed."
1994.94-780,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3246.255,3251.408,So there's one circumstance in which they can totally eliminate the public forum and you agree.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3254.46,3255.481,That's absolutely correct.
1994.94-780,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3255.481,3261.254,"--Mr. Wolman... I hate to interrupt you, but I'd like to ask just a couple of questions, if I may."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3267.399,3272.843,The Klan members hold themselves out in this record as Christians.
1994.94-780,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3301.741,3310.037,But I think the argument... the reason I ask is so much of the argument is based on the assumption that this cross is a religious symbol.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3313.649,3324.247,"There is testimony as to the mixed purpose, and indeed, not just testimony, but the disclaimer itself specifically recited... it's at page 12 of our brief in chief."
1994.94-780,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3342.559,3345.161,"Well, if it has a... and I don't know what the mix is."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3352.735,3356.868,"Well, we believe that free exercise is not a problem."
1994.94-780,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3358.157,3360.01,"Well, I mean, it's a problem in this case."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3360.01,3367.124,"--In this case, the State is asserting that the Establishment Clause bans it, and we think they're totally off-base in doing it."
1994.94-780,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3367.124,3373.098,"Well, now, with that said, what is... what does a burning cross symbolize?"
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3373.098,3389.63,"A burning cross, I believe, would symbolize the general orientation of the Ku Klux Klan against racial minorities, not just you, ethnic minorities, myself and others, a whole variety of purposes."
1994.94-780,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3389.63,3399.114,"So there are some people... as I understand the record, there were some concerns that some of the citizens of Columbus, when they saw that, could actually see fire on that cross."
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3399.114,3402.036,"Could see fire, you mean figuratively?"
1994.94-780,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3402.036,3402.607,That's right.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3402.607,3404.419,Perhaps some could.
1994.94-780,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3408.741,3414.765,"But doesn't the record suggest, though, that there was some concern that people would see more than the religious symbol in that cross?"
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3414.765,3423.179,"--Yes, I think that's true, and that's a political message, and one very much protected by the Free Speech Clause."
1994.94-780,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3423.179,3426.713,But that message doesn't implicate the Establishment Clause.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3426.713,3428.776,We believe not.
1994.94-780,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3431.445,3462.856,"Do you think that the political... with respect to the cross, that the political message for the Klan overwhelms the religious free exercise considerations, that if someone... if I said that a member of the Ku Klux Klan is carrying a cross down Pennsyivania Avenue, would the average person, or the reasonable person, think that that, that the Klan is engaged in an exercise of religion, or a political statement?"
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3462.856,3479.998,"My own personal views, but not in the record, are that I would view it as mostly a political statement, but we... and in fact we believe that the State has used the Establishment Clause as a make-weight in this matter."
1994.94-780,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3484.171,3489.144,So we're shoe-horning a political case into the religious component of the First Amendment.
1994.94-780,1,18127,benson_a_wolman,,3489.144,3492.717,--We believe the State has done just that.
1994.94-780,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3493.478,3493.908,"Thank you, Mr. Wolman."
