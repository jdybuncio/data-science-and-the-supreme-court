2009.08-1200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.67,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-1200, Jerman v. Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer, & Ulrich."
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,8.637,11.206,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-1200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,78.231,92.805,"I think -- reading ""intentional"" the way you just articulated is absolutely right, but when you add -- I don't see what work ""bona fide error"" does in the statute, if ""intentional"" should be read in this case to mean what you say."
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,92.805,101.395,"Well, I think it captures the circumstance in which somebody makes a mistake of fact, but does so and with -- not in good faith."
2009.08-1200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,102.513,109.501,"But you say: Well, intentional means you meant to send out the document; you meant to serve it; in other words, no specific intent requirement."
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,118.539,120.158,--But I think that's right.
2009.08-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,144.023,151.61,"I really don't think that the -- the word that we're wrestling with here is the -- the word ""intentional""."
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,174.559,178.495,I think that is the central question here and it is Respondents' best argument.
2009.08-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,209.132,213.35,So what -- the part that's worrying me most is where the lawyer is the debt collector.
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,264.208,268.112,"Well, let me address the hypothetical, to make sure I understand it."
2009.08-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,276.366,276.7,"No, no."
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,278.268,278.918,--Okay.
2009.08-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,292.058,295.593,Does litigation constitute debt -- debt collection activity?
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,295.593,295.862,--Yes.
2009.08-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,298.395,300.231,So he is a lawyer litigating for a client.
2009.08-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,301.364,301.683,Okay.
2009.08-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,301.683,303.116,Yes.
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,303.116,309.17,"--In that circumstance -- in that circumstance, I think yes, the lawyer can be held liable for -- for mistakes."
2009.08-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,310.955,312.005,It's not a mistake.
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,323.377,330.05,"--And when that happens, their clients are almost never protected from liability, for -- because they did what their lawyers reasonably told them to."
2009.08-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,330.883,332.3,Why aren't they in good faith?
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,332.3,333.483,--The lawyer?
2009.08-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,333.483,334.6,Both.
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,334.6,337.852,"Well, certainly, because there generally is a mistake of law defense."
2009.08-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,337.852,339.62,"Ah, but that's in your view of it."
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,349.91,350.778,Well--
2009.08-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,350.778,352.778,It -- it's not just that it's unfair.
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,377.679,392.422,"--I think the lawyers are not in a terribly different position than is, for example, the executive of a company that has a fiduciary duty to its shareholders to maximize profits and is considering a venture that could violate the antitrust laws."
2009.08-1200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,400.658,401.793,But you are sort of begging the question there.
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,410.383,410.883,--That's right.
2009.08-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,420.755,428.678,"But it -- but it suggests that you would like a -- a sensible interpretation of this that avoids the result I said, if possible."
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,467.986,472.621,"Well, I do think that if you disagree with us, that's the better reading than the second."
2009.08-1200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,500.086,504.906,"One -- one of the things you have to include on this initial communication is the name of the creditor, right?"
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,504.906,505.573,Yes.
2009.08-1200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,505.573,506.056,Okay.
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,549.681,552.347,"No, because in either circumstance it would be a factual error."
2009.08-1200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,553.883,560.453,"No, it's a -- it's a legal -- the lawyer looks at it and says: Well, you know, the merger is not going to close for whatever, but I think it's still this bank."
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,564.089,569.224,"Well, again, I'm not sure that that's a legal -- but assuming that it is a legal mistake--"
2009.08-1200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,569.224,569.724,Yes.
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,569.724,578.311,"--I think that the client is not -- I mean, if it's a legal mistake, it's a legal mistake for the client as well as the lawyer, and I think either one of them would be in the same position--"
2009.08-1200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,578.311,587.065,"But if the client just says: I'm not going to ask the lawyer; I'm just going to make -- I think it's A -- it's a bona fide error, but it's an error -- he gets the benefit of that position."
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,589.967,594.986,"--Well, under our view, he wouldn't get benefit under either circumstance, because it would be a mistake of law and the statute doesn't cover it."
2009.08-1200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,597.455,0.0,"Who the -- who the creditor is is necessarily a mistake of law, rather than fact?"
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,602.426,0.0,--No.
2009.08-1200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,609.496,612.632,"Well, is it a mistake of fact if the lawyer does legal research to find it out?"
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,612.632,613.582,"--Well, I don't think--"
2009.08-1200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,613.582,617.852,"He looks and he says: Well, it depends upon the date of the closing of the merger, not the announcement."
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,617.852,618.436,"--Well, if the--"
2009.08-1200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,618.436,620.138,And it turns out that's a legal mistake.
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,620.138,625.605,"--Then I -- I don't think the defense would apply and I don't think it would apply to the client, either."
2009.08-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,659.763,660.763,So how -- how do we do that?
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,691.567,700.09,"--And that is to recognize that, as this Court held in Heintz, that Congress didn't intend for every unsuccessful lawsuit to result in liability under this statute."
2009.08-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,719.901,724.055,The lawyer writes a letter to the client.
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,756.822,759.876,"--Well, typically -- I don't know that that's a uniquely lawyerly activity."
2009.08-1200,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,844.259,857.5,"Counsel, if the district court were to say: You violated the act; this was a mistake of law not covered, but I'm not awarding statutory damages because--"
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,857.5,857.733,--I think they--
2009.08-1200,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,857.733,873.677,"--in this case, just for the reasons here, you did something the Sixth Circuit -- or that the circuit law said was permissible, so you didn't do it -- you did it intentionally because you did the violation of the act, but it was based on a mistake of law."
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,873.677,878.23,--I do think that that's a perfectly permissible exercise of discretion.
2009.08-1200,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,885.134,886.634,"Well, what about attorneys' fees?"
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,886.634,890.204,"No, the attorneys' fees is not discretionary in that sense."
2009.08-1200,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,946.708,953.445,Congress wrote this statute to -- to have a cottage industry of litigation.
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,954.795,956.147,"Well, I -- I would not say that."
2009.08-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1147.959,1163.504,"Well, maybe your colleague can, but how -- so they define a -- the reasonable error falls in is because he's a person who regularly collects or attempts to collect consumer debts owed to a -- you know, owed to another person."
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1170.574,1171.474,--Yes.
2009.08-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1172.124,1172.526,Okay.
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1180.013,1181.263,"--Well, no."
2009.08-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1214.334,1215.603,So -- I get -- okay.
2009.08-1200,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1215.603,1216.236,--Thank you.
2009.08-1200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1216.236,1217.186,"Thank you, Counsel."
2009.08-1200,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1232.878,1234.644,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-1200,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1335.827,1346.016,"And your example of that couldn't happen, because if you were calling debtors, you should certainly check what time of evening the call is."
2009.08-1200,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1359.173,1378.654,"--Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, if -- if you check, but due to a keyboarding error, for example, Arizona is entered as Alabama or an error in time zone is entered in whatever record is being consulting by the debt collector, that's the kind of factual error, a clerical, bookkeeping type error that -- that Congress had in mind when it created this defense."
2009.08-1200,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1395.215,1409.439,"Do you know why when Congress codified that law errors don't count, codified that for the Truth in Lending Act purposes, it didn't make the corresponding change in the others?"
2009.08-1200,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1409.439,1417.945,"We don't have a specific indication, Justice Ginsburg, why it didn't go back and revise every other statute that -- that already had such a defense."
2009.08-1200,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1468.294,1473.263,Even if the -- even if the error of law is completely reasonable?
2009.08-1200,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1478.931,1491.64,"Well, I think, Justice Alito, that that is not uncommon under any civil statute, that when a court of appeals has precedent on point, that there is always a possibility that that precedent will be reversed."
2009.08-1200,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1508.4,1513.618,It also makes it hard to use the safe harbor to get the -- to get advice from the FTC.
2009.08-1200,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1513.618,1515.987,"--I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1200,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1518.003,1524.925,"That -- that if you have -- you can -- you are home free if you ask the FTC, right?"
2009.08-1200,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1524.925,1525.725,That's correct.
2009.08-1200,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1525.725,1530.477,But that's the only -- only way you -- under your reading that you are home free?
2009.08-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1530.477,1532.079,If you ask and they answer.
2009.08-1200,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1532.079,1536.9,If you ask and they answer and they say that your view of the statute is the correct one--
2009.08-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1536.9,1538.5,How many times have they answered in the past decade?
2009.08-1200,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1538.5,1548.708,"--In the past decade, Mr. Chief Justice, they have been asked seven times for opinions by the debt collection industry, and they have answered four of them under the criteria that they adopted in the regulations they are cited in footnote of our brief."
2009.08-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1548.708,1551.66,"So that's not a very realistic procedure to rely on, is it?"
2009.08-1200,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1551.66,1555.278,"Well, the debt collection industry seems to not have asked very many times, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1555.278,1555.444,And why is that?
2009.08-1200,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1560.663,1586.23,"I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that first, even if this were relevant to what Congress intended the -- how Congress intended the adviser opinion process to work when it wrote this provision in 1977, that the debt collection industry, as we pointed out in our brief -- if you ask the FTC for an adviser opinion, and it sides against the requester, which, incidentally, in none of these four opinions has it ever done -- in each case it sided with the requester -- but if it sides against, then the requester is on notice of the law."
2009.08-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1595.586,1606.042,"So you are saying that the debt collection industry doesn't does ask the FTC, which would be a safe harbor for them, because if they get a bad answer, they may not follow it and then they may be subject to heightened penalties?"
2009.08-1200,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1606.042,1616.148,"--Well, I'm saying, Mr. Chief Justice, that the -- that they would understandably prefer to ask their own lawyer for an opinion if the -- if this Court were to agree with the Respondent's position and affirm the Sixth Circuit."
2009.08-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1637.144,1638.111,"Well, but there are four of them."
2009.08-1200,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1650.118,1655.086,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I submit that you can't look simply at the number of responses without looking at the number of inquiries."
2009.08-1200,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1672.447,1674.733,Do we know what the time interval was?
2009.08-1200,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1686.124,1689.576,"In the four that were granted, three of them took three to four months."
2009.08-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1739.342,1740.992,"And if that's wrong, it doesn't do you any good."
2009.08-1200,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1740.992,1743.644,"--If that's wrong, it doesn't confer the safe harbor."
2009.08-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1849.792,1850.292,"Thank you, Mr. Jay."
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,1857.281,1859.983,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-1200,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1968.419,1986.547,"And also saying -- and then this sentence is what I would like to have your response on, that there is no statute -- Federal statute that makes mistake of law a defense."
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2003.525,2009.246,"--Justice Ginsburg, that is their argument, that it is unprecedented."
2009.08-1200,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2056.375,2067.081,"Do you think before our Heintz decision, that they intended for debt collectors to have an automatic defense if they just called up a lawyer?"
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2078.204,2080.073,"--Absolutely not, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-1200,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2080.69,2094.148,"No, I think part of the difficulty in this case, isn't it, is the -- is our Heintz decision which made lawyers debt collectors, and so now we are in this quandary about a lawyer's good faith."
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2107.722,2118.696,"--Well -- it was absolutely meant to protect debt collectors, however, that term was defined in 1977, which included lay debt collectors."
2009.08-1200,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2149.033,2149.699,Call a lawyer.
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2149.699,2150.985,--Pardon?
2009.08-1200,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2150.985,2151.885,Call a lawyer.
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2151.885,2152.985,How--
2009.08-1200,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2152.985,2154.187,Just have a lawyer sign off.
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2154.187,2155.02,"--No, but--"
2009.08-1200,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2155.02,2172.481,"Even if the lawyer made a mistake, if the debt collector relies, you know, I have a reputable law firm, they are well educated, they tell me they do legal research, that -- I can assume that, so why don't I have a ""get out of jail"" card?"
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2172.481,2183.722,"--The unfairness of this statute, as Justice Breyer indicated in his commentary with Mr. Russell, is -- is exemplified by your question."
2009.08-1200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2222.997,2225.533,"That's true of antitrust defendants, too."
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2225.533,2234.639,"But in this, Your Honor, there is a -- there is a bona fide error defense that has been crafted into this statute."
2009.08-1200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2234.639,2234.955,"No, I see that."
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2304.912,2313.401,"Justice Breyer, I don't think that gives credence to the 1977 focus when lawyers were not part of the statute."
2009.08-1200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2339.283,2339.969,That's right.
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2383.544,2393.167,"--I believe that the lawyer would be just subject to the rigors of the bona fide error defense, the way any other debt collector as defined from 1977 forward would be--"
2009.08-1200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2393.167,2396.702,I suppose it would make interpretation of the act a little more difficult.
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2423.352,2440.398,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I believe this would be part of the inquiry that a lawyer would be faced in trying to prove the affirmative defense of bona fide error in a legal situation, and that -- that would be part of the good faith analysis, part of the reasonable procedures that he would present to the court--"
2009.08-1200,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2440.398,2442.564,Could we do that in the context of this case?
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2471.1,2496.216,"--There was a case, Graziano, Your Honor, that talked about the -- was construing the statute and specifically section 1692g(a)(3) and determining because g -- the second and third prong of the statute had the words in writing, does the first prong in order to be coherently read remain ""in writing""?"

2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2513.927,2515.727,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice--"
2009.08-1200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2515.727,2517.327,We still don't know if the lawyer here was right or wrong.
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2517.327,2518.577,--That's correct.
2009.08-1200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2553.147,2555.849,"Mr. Coakley, one of your earlier statements confused me."
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2607.299,2613.953,"--Justice Scalia, there were cases, although not court of appeals cases that--"
2009.08-1200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2613.953,2619.273,Every court of appeals to construe it had held that mistakes of law were not covered.
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2620.19,2620.456,--That's correct.
2009.08-1200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2620.456,2623.642,"Well, then -- then your prior statement was very misleading."
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2623.642,2665.069,"Well, to the extent that there were two different -- two different analyses or interpretations that had emerged before 1980 that led the Congress to -- in 1980, enact or to amend TILA, otherwise, as pointed out in the Herrera case in our brief, if everything was so settled in 1980, why would there be a need to clarify the definition of bona fide error under TILA, and -- and if it was clarified in 1980 under the FDCPA, then why didn't they take the step and clarify it in the FDCPA from 1980 to 2010, especially when Congress--"
2009.08-1200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2665.069,2673.223,There is no basis for saying that the amendment was overturning -- changing the prior meaning of TILA.
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2678.841,2690.149,"--Your Honor, the -- the Petitioner's position was that the case law was uniform at the time, and our position is the case law was not uniform at the time."
2009.08-1200,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2706.508,2721.351,"But why doesn't that just mean that Congress wants to confirm that the judges -- the majority of judges who -- who had held that it didn't -- that errors of law were not a defense, that they were right, it's not changing -- changing anything."
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2724.403,2755.839,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, the case law says that the law has to be settled, and as we pointed out in our brief, it was not settled, and the courts, afterwards, have reflected that there was no settlement, and that that's one of the reasons why the error portion of the TILA bona fide error was -- was clarified, as the Petitioner puts it, to say this excludes any interpretations of legal -- of legal -- of the legal interpretations of TILA."
2009.08-1200,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2770.749,2790.595,"Well, why wouldn't one say, now, Congress has confirmed that the word in the Truth and Lending Act means thus and so, Congress has said that's what those words mean, and then go back to the other statutes and say the same language was used, so it means the same thing, the same thing that Congress has just confirmed?"
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2790.595,2806.005,"--Justice Ginsburg, I believe that the -- the words TILA statute were being construed, although not by courts of appeals, to reasonably read the bona fide error encompasses legal error."
2009.08-1200,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2827.953,2842.297,"Were there any district court decisions, of any kind, reading bona fide errors to mean legal mistakes under any of the other statutes?"
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2842.297,2844.847,--I--

2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2856.188,2856.755,--Okay.
2009.08-1200,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2857.49,2861.524,"--I'm talking about under this statute, under any other statute that uses similar language."
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2861.524,2862.058,--Yes--
2009.08-1200,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2862.058,2868.345,Were there any district court cases that were reading those statutes to include mistakes of law?
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2868.345,2879.486,"--Well, in this case that we are here on, Judge Gaughan from the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Ohio read the -- read that TILA--"
2009.08-1200,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2879.486,2881.588,But that was after the TILA amendment?
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2881.588,2883.338,--That was after the amendment.
2009.08-1200,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2885.29,2887.373,I was talking about the time that Congress was look at amending the statutes.
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2887.373,2896.027,"--Under the -- well, the FDCPA came into effect in 1977, and the -- TILA was in 1968."
2009.08-1200,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2906.316,2915.071,"Do you think that a -- a mistake of law has to be substantively reasonable in order to fall within this defense, and if so, where do you get that?"
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2917.106,2928.498,"The statute doesn't refer to substantively or procedurally, Justice Alito, the statute refers to bona fide error and the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted."
2009.08-1200,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2941.139,2953.796,"Well, suppose that a lawyer spends a whole week researching a question, but arrives at a conclusion that is plainly incorrect, does not, therefore, intend to violate the statute and proceeds in good faith."
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2957.331,2959.933,"--Well, in proving--"
2009.08-1200,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2959.933,2965.77,"It would be an unreasonable decision, and yet, would it -- it would fall within your understanding of this provision; is that correct?"
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,2965.77,2966.47,--Absolutely.
2009.08-1200,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3035.581,3041.068,Could you answer one question -- I'm just a little confused about.
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3060.632,3089.401,"There -- there are differences -- substantial differences, Justice Stevens, in the TILA and in the FDCPA statute, starting with the purposes of the statute, starting with the construction of the statute, one, TILA has a criminal liability, TILA has life lines that the debt collector doesn't have in the FDCPA, TILA dealing -- is dealing with disclosure of financial information, TILA has regulations, as opposed to no regulations--"
2009.08-1200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3089.401,3091.701,I would think all -- which way do these cut?
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3109.879,3110.648,"--The -- no, Your Honor."
2009.08-1200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3110.648,3111.215,I would think--
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3111.215,3123.555,"It's a -- it's a distinction between why -- in trying to answer Justice Stevens' question, it's a distinction why TILA would be interpreted differently by the -- than the FDCPA."
2009.08-1200,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3123.555,3130.042,"But the question is -- is there a greater need for the mistake of law defense under one statute, rather than the other, I sort of--"
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3130.042,3130.642,Given--
2009.08-1200,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3130.642,3132.425,--have the same problem Justice Scalia expressed.
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3132.425,3145.749,"--Given -- well, given the purpose of TILA, and TILA dealing with computational errors, regulation C, Truth in Lending, they -- they amend -- they amended TILA -- I mean, I'm sorry."
2009.08-1200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3187.407,3191.942,"So I mean, you're -- the substance of your answer is that they are just two very different statutes."
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3191.942,3193.044,Absolutely.
2009.08-1200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3193.044,3204.934,"But I -- but I share Justice Scalia's concern, I mean the -- the ways in which they are different would suggest you need the legal mistake defense more in TILA than you do in the FDCPA."
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3204.934,3214.623,"Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I don't believe that that is consistent with the purpose of -- of TILA."
2009.08-1200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3251.313,3264.306,"Can you tell me if you know, can you give me just a rough idea, of the percentage of instances in which people write to the FTC to take advantage of the safe harbor and the FTC just says,"
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3265.34,3270.958,"I do not have that empirical evidence, Your Honor."
2009.08-1200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3287.068,3288.068,How many have asked?
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3288.068,3290.435,I don't know how many have asked.
2009.08-1200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3290.435,3302.743,"I mean, it seems to me that's the obvious solution to the problem, that -- until you hold they are not -- they are liable for mistake of law, but anyone can write to the FTC ahead of time and -- and get a safe harbor."
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3312.866,3314.801,I think that--
2009.08-1200,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3314.801,3317.92,Didn't Mr. Jay tell us there were seven requests?
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3319.686,3322.372,"--I am not disputing that, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3345.92,0.0,"Well, all right."
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3364.048,3370.635,--But the safe harbor defense on its face applies prospectively.
2009.08-1200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3373.92,3377.622,"That means lawyer, if you are worried about this, go write before you do it."
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3377.622,3382.259,"--Yes, but the bona fide error defense applies retrospectively."
2009.08-1200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3382.259,3387.413,I see I have a copy in the retail -- Association of Retail Collection Trades.
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3393.317,3393.967,I--
2009.08-1200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3393.967,3398.102,It is not an atypical issue in dealing with government agencies.
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3398.102,3412.794,"--And -- yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and the penultimate paragraph in there: For the foregoing reasons your request for advisory opinion does not satisfy either the prerequisites described, well -- and accordingly we can't -- grant it."
2009.08-1200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3412.794,3416.496,"--Mr. Coakley, why do you need a safe harbor if there is no store?"
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3430.672,3432.439,The safe harbor--
2009.08-1200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3432.439,3434.208,You are talking about a safe harbor rule.
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3435.124,3442.564,"--Justice Scalia, as it worked out the safe harbor is neither safe nor a harbor, but that's not the perspective that we have to look at it."
2009.08-1200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3451.669,3454.621,"What does that have to do -- what does that have to do with anything, whether it's prospective or not?"
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3465.16,3474.432,"--Well, there are reasons why a debt collector may use it if he has time and he needs the prospective letter from the FTC."
2009.08-1200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3517.057,3527.214,"Oh, now I do see -- which is why I asked the question, I asked to get an answer, and the answer now seems to be floating around the FTC idea."
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3542.457,3547.426,Justice Ginsburg asked the question about unprecedented.
2009.08-1200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3576.695,3579.23,"There are severe limits on the liability, aren't there?"
2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3581.33,3583.515,"--Yes, Your Honor."

2009.08-1200,2,25058,george_s_coakley,,3585.7,3591.121,"But let that -- well, maybe for the prior group that was up here, but I don't--"
2009.08-1200,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3593.621,3597.108,"This isn't -- this is a class action, wasn't it?"
