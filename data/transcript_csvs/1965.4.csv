1965.4,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,28.551,"Number 4, Marc D.Leh, etcetera, Petitioners, versus General Petroleum Corporation, et al."
1965.4,0,39536,richard_g_harris,,31.569,36.071,May it please the Court.
1965.4,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,886.211,892.141,"Your -- your case involves the help yourself or self-service, what do you call it?"
1965.4,0,39536,richard_g_harris,,892.141,894.727,"Yes, Mr. Justice Clark."
1965.4,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,906.857,911.213,"Your defendants, are they the same as the other defendants in the standard stations?"
1965.4,0,39536,richard_g_harris,,911.213,915.735,"No, they are not, and I will refer to that as the second distinction urged here."
1965.4,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,932.358,936.462,"You've dealt with these defendants, your man?"
1965.4,0,39536,richard_g_harris,,936.462,942.35,"Yes, they dealt with the defendants, specifically General Petroleum Corporation and Olympic Refining Company."
1965.4,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,942.35,946.208,When the -- when was the inception of the help yourself idea?
1965.4,0,39536,richard_g_harris,,946.208,950.48,"Approximately 1947, Mr. Justice Clark."
1965.4,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,977.24,980.883,The standard station was filed in '50?
1965.4,0,39536,richard_g_harris,,980.883,983.212,June of 1950.
1965.4,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,983.212,988.156,Thank you.
1965.4,0,39536,richard_g_harris,,988.156,1005.94,"The interesting thing about the idea of a conspiracy within a conspiracy is that it has been used in a much stronger setting than is urged by the plaintiffs in this case, and that setting is under Section 5 (a) rather than Section 5 (b)."
1965.4,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1358.248,1366.347,"But before you go on, if you may, I don't -- I didn't quite get that last point and I wonder if you could illustrate what you mean."
1965.4,0,39536,richard_g_harris,,1366.347,1367.024,Yes.
1965.4,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1372.439,1372.838,Yes.
1965.4,0,39536,richard_g_harris,,1372.838,1380.631,"Now, let us assume that we had a violation of the antitrust laws, hurting a private litigant in 1949."
1965.4,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1435.929,1436.852,I see what you mean.
1965.4,0,39536,richard_g_harris,,1436.852,1445.868,"And, the Green's case has expressly stated that this should not be so."
1965.4,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1533.986,1535.037,Mr. Kirkham.
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,1535.037,1539.906,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.4,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2281.48,2295.08,"If one were to look simply at the -- at the first generalized statement of (b), that would cover, would it not, the -- and embrace the alleged wrong in the present case?"
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,2295.08,2296.183,If one were to look only to --
1965.4,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2296.183,2297.087,Without railroad materials --
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,2297.087,2299.439,"If there had been no other allegation in the complaint, it might be --"
1965.4,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2299.439,2301.244,Without reference to the bill of particulars.
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,2301.244,2304.018,It might be argued.
1965.4,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2317.602,2318.07,Right.
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,2318.07,2319.586,And nothing else.
1965.4,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2335.536,2336.659,Yes.
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,2336.659,2342.685,"The more definite the statement would have been made, and what the Government complained of would have been set forth."
1965.4,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2404.283,2412.473,"Mr. Kirkham, when you deal with -- then only on an exclusive basis under 15, couldn't they?"
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,2412.473,2415.215,"Under 15, it would be under -- yes, that the --"
1965.4,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2415.215,2423.17,"Well, if an independent did not waste a deal on an exclusive basis, he wouldn't be able to be deal with an independent refiner, would he?"
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,2423.17,2424.329,That is the allegation.
1965.4,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2429.599,2439.93,"Mr. Kirkham, the point that you argue was -- is one that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals passed on, isn't that right?"
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,2439.93,2443.097,"No, I don't think that's right, Mr. Justice Douglas."
1965.4,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2443.097,2447.386,"I mean, in their opinions, they dealt with the statute of limitations."
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,2447.386,2449.033,They dealt with both points.
1965.4,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2454.099,2462.132,The point that you're making that the -- that these are not -- these causes of action have nothing in common or no identity.
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,2462.132,2464.611,"No, they -- they passed upon that point."
1965.4,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2694.84,2696.553,You're not depending on the Steiner case here.
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,2696.553,2698.036,I'm not depending on the Steiner case.
1965.4,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2702.134,2703.075,Yes.
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,2703.075,2709.0,"I am stating, Justice Stewart, that there is not a conflict of decisions."
1965.4,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2709.0,2709.064,Yes.
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,2709.064,2736.981,"And that the representation that there was a conflict of decisions when the petition for certiorari was asked for was mistaken because in this case, the Court of Appeals recognizing specifically that as earlier Steiner decision stated a more rigid rule than had been stated by Nisley and having said in the Goldwyn case that it would reexamine its Steiner decision when the case -- a proper case came before it."
1965.4,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2749.874,2761.207,"(Inaudible) don't you think it says that if the action is based in whole or in part, on what, on any?"
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,2761.207,2762.308,Any matter complained of.
1965.4,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2762.308,2764.212,Any matter.
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,2770.926,2779.23,"Well, it -- it could be based -- I think, in this case, it was based upon the ultimate issues framed after pretrial."
1965.4,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2779.23,2779.876,On the pretrial.
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,2779.876,2788.194,"But, we are prepared, for the purposes of decision here, to let it rest on that or upon the memorandum of contentions or upon the complaints themselves."
1965.4,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2788.194,2799.231,"Well, your position is that there is no matter in the Government's complaint upon which the complaint here could be based."
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,2800.428,2816.055,"Our position is that the plaintiffs' complaint in this case is not based in part upon any matter complained of in the Government's complaint, and that, it appears to us, is -- is -- is manifest."
1965.4,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3033.158,3041.869,(Inaudible) a vertical conspiracy running from production through marketing.
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,3041.869,3042.385,In every aspect --
1965.4,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3042.385,3046.483,"This jobber would be dealing entirely with marketing, wouldn't he?"
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,3046.483,3047.913,That is correct.
1965.4,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3047.913,3059.85,"So, that depends upon whether there is any matter in the Government's complaint with reference to marketing, upon which the complainant here could hang his head."
1965.4,1,24193,francis_r_kirkham,,3059.85,3063.25,"Well, that -- that would be the ultimate test, Justice Clark."
1965.4,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3421.317,3422.617,Mr. Harris.
1965.4,2,39536,richard_g_harris,,3422.617,3431.751,"Yes, in the five minutes that I have left, Your Honor, I would like to address myself briefly to three points raised by the respondent."
1965.4,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3490.076,3494.038,"Well, it doesn't really make any difference to the question involved at all, does it?"
1965.4,2,39536,richard_g_harris,,3494.453,3495.147,"Well, perhaps not."
1965.4,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3495.147,3496.524,"The result wouldn't depend on that, on the facts --"
1965.4,2,39536,richard_g_harris,,3496.524,3500.92,"The inference was that I had all of these available to me and if I wanted to draw the complaint this way, I could've."
1965.4,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3501.626,3507.179,"Whether you did or whether you didn't, the statute either applies here or doesn't."
1965.4,2,39536,richard_g_harris,,3507.179,3507.411,I think that --
1965.4,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3507.411,3511.404,"Whether it's filed in the same court or a court across the country 3,000 miles away."
1965.4,2,39536,richard_g_harris,,3511.404,3513.753,"I think that's a fair statement, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1965.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3596.058,3604.727,"Mr. Harris, had the Government's case gone to trial, would your evidence had been relevant in support of the Government's complaint?"
1965.4,2,39536,richard_g_harris,,3604.727,3607.699,"Well, that has been our contention from the beginning, Your Honor."
1965.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3625.639,3627.637,"Well, you're talking about your own case."
1965.4,2,39536,richard_g_harris,,3631.67,3632.904,That's correct.
1965.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3632.904,3634.335,After you had brought your case.
1965.4,2,39536,richard_g_harris,,3634.335,3634.844,That's correct.
1965.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3634.844,3640.505,"And after there'd been, I gather, considerable pretrial discovery in like."
1965.4,2,39536,richard_g_harris,,3640.505,3641.202,In the government case?
1965.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3641.202,3642.211,In the government case.
1965.4,2,39536,richard_g_harris,,3642.211,3642.702,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1965.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3642.702,3655.007,"My question was if that case had gone to trial and had been settled, the proofs on which you rely for your case have been relevant to the proof of the Government's case?"
1965.4,2,39536,richard_g_harris,,3655.007,3657.626,"Yes, that is my contention."
