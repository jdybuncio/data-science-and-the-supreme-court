1978.77-753,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.929,"We'll hear first this morning, Numbers 77-753 and the consolidated case, International Brotherhood of Teamsters against Daniel."
1978.77-753,0,41133,sherman_carmell,,20.496,24.278,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-753,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,403.045,408.377,"Of course Mr. Carmell, not every retirement plan is a product of collective bargaining."
1978.77-753,0,41133,sherman_carmell,,427.746,433.84,It is correct to that -- to the extent Your Honor that they all were not necessarily bargained for.
1978.77-753,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,455.106,458.49,If there -- but sometimes it's not even a collective bargaining agent.
1978.77-753,0,41133,sherman_carmell,,472.038,475.368,They would not have had cause of action under Section 302.
1978.77-753,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,797.394,819.779,"Well, it wouldn't -- you would -- wouldn't you agree that Judge Tone's concurring opinion is evidence of anything but a value of judgment that he instinctively -- his sense of values or his sense of -- his instinctive sense would have led him the other way but he thought he was driven to this conclusion by the language of the statute, isn't that about what he said?"
1978.77-753,0,41133,sherman_carmell,,819.779,830.72,I don't believe it was -- by the breadth of the statute and by the fact that this Court has not spoken particularly to the issue I believe was another factor.
1978.77-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,876.578,888.215,"Mr. Carmell, before you sit down does the record tell us what significance if any there is to the fact that the -- that Daniel took -- a withdraw occurred, is that critical in the -- is ineligibility?"
1978.77-753,0,41133,sherman_carmell,,888.215,892.713,I don't believe that the issue as framed now that question is critical.
1978.77-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.048,939.337,I see.
1978.77-753,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,946.726,948.308,Mr. Dickstein.
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,948.308,952.931,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1204.614,1216.435,And in that case the security is the stock of the employer corporation rather than the participation of the pension plan.
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1216.435,1222.36,"Your Honor the Securities and Exchange Commissions position is that that transaction, there were two Securities involved."
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1228.725,1236.092,"Well, if one is the interest of the plan, then why isn't this a security?"
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1236.092,1249.43,The interest of the plan and the special circumstance in which employer stock is bought with employee money is indivisible with the arrangement of the entire arrangement under which that stock is purchased.
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1253.359,1257.125,But we are talking about a dissipating interest in a retirement plan.
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1257.125,1258.735,We're talking about a participating interest in --
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1258.735,1264.642,"And if it's a security in one case why isn't it in the other, quite apart from the employer stock."
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1264.642,1266.283,There are several reasons for that Your Honor.
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1309.376,1336.292,"I understand that and I understand that the -- that you concede the -- that that one special kind of a retirement plan is subject to SEC jurisdiction under the Securities Laws and I understand the factual difference but I don't understand if the participation -- the participatory interest in the retirement plan itself is a security, in one case, why isn't it in the other?"
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1336.292,1352.167,"Your Honor the answer again is that in the instance where the employee's money is buying employers stock, that is always been treated as a transaction covered by the Security."
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1352.167,1353.563,I understand that.
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1353.563,1374.264,"And if one wraps that basic transaction around the retirement plan in which the stock which is purchased is kept in a fund, it is ultimately given to the employee on retirement or ultimately sold in order to fund his retirement that does not change that basic reality."
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1374.264,1374.435,Well in this --
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1374.435,1374.933,It is still --
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1374.933,1380.395,"In this case the funds of the planner, he has to buy what are conceitedly securities."
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1380.395,1382.161,"No Your Honor, we do not --"
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1382.161,1382.652,Not --
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1382.652,1390.895,"Not only do we not concede it to be securities in this case, we are -- we believe the -- not only that Congress has not considered it to be securities and the SEC --"
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1390.895,1393.628,But many -- but the funds of no retirement plan entirely is quite --
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1393.628,1398.03,And until quite recently the SEC did not maintain that they have securities.
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1398.03,1402.949,But what are the funds -- what -- how are the funds invested to this plan?
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1403.213,1404.171,In a --
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1404.171,1406.046,In no securities at all?
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1406.046,1408.407,"They -- no, Your Honor, of course they are invested in securities."
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1408.407,1409.704,"Well, that was my question."
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1410.359,1411.049,"Oh, yes."
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1414.81,1415.641,But they are invested in securities.
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1415.641,1429.858,But even -- but they are invested in securities unquestionably and it is quite clear that purports the investment of pension fund -- pension funds in a portfolio of securities.
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1490.31,1491.187,And you concede that it isn't --
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1491.187,1491.908,That the history --
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1491.908,1494.656,-- in the one case?
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1494.656,1499.255,"Your Honor, yes, I do, because it is clearly a security."
1978.77-753,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1519.976,1533.288,"Mr. Dickstein, are you -- I take it you're making the argument that even if there were no Labor Laws at all, no federal labors statutes and only the Securities Laws that this would not be a security."
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1533.288,1534.954,"Yes, Your Honor, we are."
1978.77-753,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1534.954,1535.004,Are you also --
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1535.004,1535.58,But --
1978.77-753,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1535.58,1547.61,"-- arguing that even if it -- otherwise would be a security, the Federal Labor Laws in effect make an exception to the securities or laws, or not."
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1547.61,1552.195,"No, Your Honor, we are not arguing exception but what I -- what we are arguing is that --"
1978.77-753,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1552.195,1561.135,You're not arguing that the labor law is -- the labor laws require a different construction of the Securities Laws then otherwise it would be true.
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1561.135,1562.561,"Oh, yes, oh, yes."
1978.77-753,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1590.938,1601.976,So would you say the impact to the labor laws is equivalent to their being an exception in this Securities Laws that -- is that your argument or not?
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1601.976,1610.881,"An exception, an interdiction and inhibition of that construction whichever way -- I think one can fairly put it that way."
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1610.881,1631.062,I'd understood that the principal thrust of your argument not that you don't make the one suggested in your answer to my Brother White but that the principal thrust of your argument with respect to the labor laws and WPPDA and ERISA is that they reflect congressional understanding that pension plans are simply not covered by the Securities Laws.
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1631.062,1635.033,They reflect both congressional understandings and actions based upon those (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1635.033,1636.096,Based upon that understanding.
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1636.096,1639.033,"-- on those understandings, quite correct."
1978.77-753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1666.796,1677.627,"This is a basic question and I always wonder about, the congressional intent we're really concerned about is back in 1935 isn't it or 33 rather or 33 and 34?"
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1677.627,1677.927,That --
1978.77-753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1677.927,1679.807,And all these stuff comes later.
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1679.807,1681.373,That is certainly true.
1978.77-753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1692.857,1693.135,"Well, its clear they used --"
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1693.135,1694.111,That's really the question.
1978.77-753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1694.111,1702.976,"Its clear they used some broad language that encompass some situations they did not specifically contemplate at that time, that much I think you have to concede."
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1702.976,1704.364,"Oh yes, oh yes."
1978.77-753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1732.413,1743.364,The Court of Appeals was apparently influenced by the fact that pension money is a huge percentage of the total capital market today with a very small percentage in 33.
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1743.364,1769.546,"No question about it, it was -- as a matter of fact it was because of the growth of pensions in 19 -- in the mid 50's that Congress turned to express concern with the absence of disclosures to pension plan participants, conducted its studies very, very carefully inquired into the subject over a long period of time and enacted the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act as an expression of concern."
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1810.085,1818.78,"Of course you go back to 1934, there is no private right of action at all under 10 (b) of the 34 Act."
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1824.58,1829.368,That -- a little acorn may have grown into too much of an oak for that Your Honor.
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1989.04,1991.64,"And when he gets work, he sells it, I suppose."
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1991.64,2004.437,"Well, that is precisely one of the points which of course differentiate what we have here from what we had in a conventional security in a commercial sense or even a non-conventional security in a congressional sense."
1978.77-753,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2032.204,2054.1,"Just one question counsel, there's been some comment, questions to you about the difference between the situation that existed 40 odd years ago and today in terms of the amount of investment in pension funds that are within the range of collective bargaining."
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,2078.563,2084.349,"No, I think we have the best evidence of that as what Congress has in fact done Your Honor."
1978.77-753,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2084.349,2084.802,But you mean (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,2084.802,2085.297,Because --
1978.77-753,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2085.297,2088.781,Change them -- they can't change their views on the matter.
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,2088.781,2089.85,"Oh, of course they can change their views."
1978.77-753,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2089.85,2090.547,That's -- that's all I'm asking.
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,2090.547,2101.621,But they have already -- they have already acted at least twice based upon the new evidence of the mounting importance of pensions in this country.
1978.77-753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2159.877,2164.159,"Mr. Dickstein, before you sit, let me ask you one question, I think I understand but I'm not sure."
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,2170.211,2173.211,"Yes, this is a -- this of course is a defying benefit plan."
1978.77-753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2175.68,2180.36,Without the consent of the union and the employers.
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,2180.36,2187.627,It would be an act which would be participated in by the trustees and would be equally designated by the employers and the trustees.
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2187.627,2189.102,That is (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,2191.119,2191.97,Defined benefit.
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2191.97,2192.548,Defined.
1978.77-753,1,41207,sidney_dickstein,,2192.548,2193.442,Defined benefit.
1978.77-753,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2193.442,2197.243,I didn't understand the word.
1978.77-753,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2197.243,2204.929,Mr. Stillman.
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2204.929,2208.557,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-753,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2270.165,2277.021,"The -- going back to what you said at the outset, the Solicitor General does agree with you on the sale issue, does he not?"
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2277.021,2282.915,"Yes, Your Honor on that issue he does agree."
1978.77-753,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2413.747,2422.032,"Mr. Stillman, is there any other case in which an investment in the form of labor has been a way of deciding that it's a security?"
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2422.032,2426.175,Not -- not that I am aware of in deciding that it's a security.
1978.77-753,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2434.628,2443.391,Isn't it true that different employees con -- can contribute different amounts -- the labor and have the same amount to be contributed to the pension fund?
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2448.363,2458.166,I believe that is so Your Honor but does not affect the basic relationship which this Court has recognized in a series of six decisions.
1978.77-753,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2475.956,2475.971,What contract is --
1978.77-753,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2475.971,2487.039,When did the SEC Mr. Stillman first have the position that agreement such as this was an investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act?
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2487.039,2493.2,It is important to differentiate as I think you're doing the question of security versus the question of sale.
1978.77-753,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2541.619,2555.698,"Well, in the intervening 37 years, why wasn't the commission out seeking injunctions against one or another of these plans that -- presuming, just by the law of averages would have proved fraudulent or failure to disclose?"
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2555.698,2569.019,"Your Honor, the question of why at any given point in time or over -- even over a period of years, certain types of activity does not give rise to proceedings whether it be a commission proceeding or even private proceedings is of -- is something that is very difficult."
1978.77-753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2569.019,2569.978,(Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2578.728,2581.467,The focus of the statements over the years about no sale --
1978.77-753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2581.467,2583.862,"Well, what about the sale -- what about the sale issue?"
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2583.862,2585.849,"Oh, that's, that's what I was getting to Your Honor."
1978.77-753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2637.789,2642.82,"Well, is the commission's position that it is a sale now for the purpose of registration?"
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2642.82,2647.376,"No, Your Honor, that goes back to the fact that --"
1978.77-753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2647.376,2660.068,"Well, when did the commission first assert that an interest -- acquiring an interest in a pension plan is a sale, is a sale, affirmatively said it was."
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2660.068,2672.407,"For purposes of involuntary noncontributory plans of the sort involved this case -- is involved in this case, the commission as far as I'm aware did not even consider the matter until this case arose."
1978.77-753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2672.407,2673.671,Yes.
1978.77-753,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2673.671,2685.468,"Well, in fact despite what Commissioner Purcell may have said, we all know what he said, we -- there's a dispute as to what he meant."
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2694.214,2697.63,"Your Honor, he did not testify that there was no security and there was no sale."
1978.77-753,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2698.134,2704.398,He testified that the SEC had no business with this and didn't know anything about it and please don't give us any jurisdiction over it.
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2704.398,2711.002,Your Honor in context I think that has to be judged in terms of the kind of legislation that was then before Congress.
1978.77-753,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2781.192,2792.923,"On that question of different kinds of regulation, they're imposed, don't have securities, going back to the stock purchase plans for employees which are -- everybody concedes those are covered."
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2799.035,2801.457,In certain types I'm not sure of the details that --
1978.77-753,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2801.457,2813.064,"Why would there be a difference if this is security and if this is a sale, what is the policy reason for saying that there is no need for registration if it's this huge segment of the capital market?"
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2813.064,2820.468,The reason that was originally given back in Commissioner Purcell's testimony back in 1941 --
1978.77-753,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2820.468,2820.882,"Oh, I'm not interested --"
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2820.882,2823.555,It did not really go to a policy question.
1978.77-753,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.404,2829.468,No.
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2829.468,2829.7,"Now, --"
1978.77-753,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.7,2838.233,"But if we say now, it does involve a sale, it does involve a security, should it not and is it not important enough to require the registration as well, I'd understand --"
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2838.233,2838.446,At the present --
1978.77-753,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2838.446,2840.633,-- other than concern about retroactive liability.
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2840.633,2850.768,At the present time given the enactment of ERISA as a policy matter registration probably would not be a needed thing.
1978.77-753,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2850.768,2853.127,You mean registration under the 33 Act?
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2853.127,2853.57,That's right.
1978.77-753,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2854.197,2856.78,Of the Securities Act (Voice Overlap) -- Yeah.
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2856.78,2858.513,At the present time given ERISA.
1978.77-753,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2865.605,2877.777,"But prior to the enactment of ERISA, it would seem that the reasons why the antifraud provisions apply, should equally apply -- should equally have applied to the registration statement, didn't they?"
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2877.777,2890.473,"If I may refer to this Court's decision on the National Securities case, in a different context that involved a question of whether an exchange of securities by a shareholder in connection with the merger constitutes a sale."
1978.77-753,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2932.406,2932.858,"From 34, I take it."
1978.77-753,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2932.858,2935.233,Mr. Still --
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2935.863,2936.775,Yes sir.
1978.77-753,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2936.775,2957.48,Do you think the commission is as free after this relative period of quiescence to take the position and now it does in view of the enactment of WPPDA in 1958 and ERISA in 1974 is it would have been prior to the enactments of those laws?
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2957.48,2967.018,"Yes Your Honor, it seems to me that those laws really have -- I cannot see what effect they have on the meaning of the word “security” and the meaning of the world “sale”."
1978.77-753,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2967.018,2977.939,"Well but, Congress has really been proceeding on two different tracks hasn't it since 1958, one for securities and one for pension funds."
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,2977.939,2985.114,But there is really no indication that Congress clearly believe that the antifraud provisions were not applicable.
1978.77-753,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3052.883,3060.64,"Mr. Stillman, you've been talking about the definition of security which of course is the threshold issue."
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,3098.955,3105.493,"In terms of the man on the street, the employee if you ask him is your pension, a security; I suppose it would say no."
1978.77-753,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3105.493,3107.142,Would anybody have said yes?
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,3107.142,3108.159,Pardon?
1978.77-753,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3108.159,3110.698,Who would have said yes?
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,3110.698,3111.849,That is really irrelevant.
1978.77-753,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3116.854,3118.669,Well let's assume it is irrelevant.
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,3123.087,3123.774,Someone who would have looked at it.
1978.77-753,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3123.774,3125.865,"I'm not asking Justice Stewart, I'm asking you."
1978.77-753,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3125.865,3128.418,"I mean, (Inaudible)."
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,3128.418,3147.728,"If I had looked to see how a pension fund actually operates to see as was stated in the few sentences that I read from the union's brochure in this case exactly, exactly how it worked that the money's are invested, the profits are returned that that is -- that those profits are necessary to make the payments."
1978.77-753,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3150.934,3156.902,Let me ask you -- let me ask you another question about these two sections.
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,3196.273,3197.273,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-753,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3197.278,3199.974,You don't think it would've occurred to them?
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,3199.974,3201.362,"No, Your Honor I don't believe so."
1978.77-753,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3320.756,3323.086,Your time is expired now Mr. Stillman.
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,3323.086,3323.53,Okay.
1978.77-753,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3325.109,3326.227,"Very, very briefly."
1978.77-753,2,33002,jacob_h_stillman,,3326.227,3327.129,Okay.
1978.77-753,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3361.294,3371.546,Mr. Walner.
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,3371.546,3374.653,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-753,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3461.732,3467.28,Under your argument wouldn't they have to be registered even though not fraudulent.
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,3467.28,3468.086,No sir.
1978.77-753,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3493.881,3500.958,"Of course the long standing SEC policy would cause you to lose your case, wouldn't it?"
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,3500.958,3502.29,Well --
1978.77-753,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3502.29,3511.658,"The Court had no difficulty in Sloan avoiding long standing policy that went back to the same period, I think."
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,3511.658,3532.226,"We feel they're still covered under the expressed exemption of 382 of the 33 Act and we feel that the express terms of the statute otherwise embrace the antifraud provisions, the registration requirement is the provision that's exempted from compliance."
1978.77-753,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3646.126,3657.956,"You mean you're talking generally or just about welfare funds, I'm sure the SEC wouldn't agree with your very loose duty that your language seems to impose upon --"
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,3657.956,3658.707,I think it reports --
1978.77-753,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3658.707,3662.918,"-- Upon an issue where the right over proxy statement, all that's required is a good faith effort."
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,3662.918,3665.327,I'm talking only about the antifraud provisions.
1978.77-753,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3665.327,3666.315,Yes.
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,3666.315,3673.915,"I think if there's an absence of scienter and under private cause of action, there simply is no cause of action."
1978.77-753,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3673.915,3674.286,Well --
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,3674.286,3674.822,And I think that was made clear in the Ernst case.
1978.77-753,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3674.822,3676.65,Scienter or its equivalent.
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,3676.65,3676.955,Pardon?
1978.77-753,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3676.955,3678.349,Scienter or its equivalent?
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,3678.349,3678.664,The -- yes sir.
1978.77-753,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3678.664,3680.744,That's what held in the Ernst case but --
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,3680.744,3681.489,Yes.
1978.77-753,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3681.489,3690.268,In your view Mr. Walner is there any difference when the elements of a recovery in a 10 (b) (5) action in the common law fraud action.
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,3690.268,3712.849,There maybe some differences in the kind and categories of proof and I would like to point out in that connection that since ERISA has been discussed as a -- in effect the preemption type argument although they haven't used the words preemption that ERISA has cut off common law fraud.
1978.77-753,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3742.74,3746.491,Is there any claim that ERISA has destroyed your common law claim?
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,3746.491,3747.26,No sir.
1978.77-753,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3816.57,3822.058,"Well, are you suggesting that Congress deliberately cut off a group of remedies but preserved this one."
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,3822.058,3823.441,"Your Honor, I'm suggesting --"
1978.77-753,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3823.441,3823.455,Why would they preserve --
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,3823.455,3826.912,-- that Congress never intended to cutoff the antifraud provisions.
1978.77-753,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3879.878,3888.253,"Well, it can't reversely as suggested a few minutes ago by the Chief Justice if they don't like the reversal of this decision they could also change the law."
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,3888.253,3892.685,Absolutely.
1978.77-753,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4090.143,4091.361,Mr. Walner.
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4091.361,4091.686,Yes sir.
1978.77-753,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4091.686,4100.678,What other type of investment contract do you consider to be the closest analogy to this one?
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4100.678,4113.25,The closest analogy investment contract Your Honor I would consider to be a mutual fund purchase by an employee through his union or variable annuity purchase through his union.
1978.77-753,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4136.595,4138.792,Let's take the purchase of the mutual fund --
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4138.792,4140.29,Yes sir.
1978.77-753,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4140.29,4141.723,What happens there?
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4150.448,4153.247,There would be a designated participation he would have.
1978.77-753,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4153.247,4153.34,Right.
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4153.34,4154.206,But he also has --
1978.77-753,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4154.206,4161.971,"Not -- could you tell me how that could be forfeited, how could the employee lose that outright as in this case?"
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4161.971,4165.337,If it were a mutual fund that he was buying with those own money --
1978.77-753,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4165.337,4166.567,And he'd paid for it?
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4166.567,4167.947,If -- and he pays for it.
1978.77-753,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4167.947,4168.826,Right.
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4168.826,4169.767,He would -- he couldn't forfeit it under those terms.
1978.77-753,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4169.767,4171.877,He could -- he couldn't --
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4171.877,4179.067,The thing we're complaining about is he's not made aware of the forfeitures opportunities here.
1978.77-753,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4179.067,4197.313,"Right, but do you know of any type of investment where one as you suggests has contributed his wages or portions of him over a period of years in the acquisition of that which can be forfeited?"
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4207.902,4208.345,"Well, Your Honor --"
1978.77-753,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4208.345,4212.324,"Before it had vested, it would have been forfeited, wouldn't it?"
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4212.324,4219.095,There are other examples where a contingency or an expectation has been considered security and this contingency --
1978.77-753,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4219.095,4221.687,It wipes out if what he's paid all together?
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4221.687,4222.324,Pardon?
1978.77-753,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4222.324,4224.825,And wipes out what he has paid over a period of years?
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4224.825,4240.22,It would wipe out the interest in the security and the example I have in mind Your Honor specifically is an employee's stock option where the option is granted to the employee who works there providing he remains that a period -- for there for a period of years.
1978.77-753,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4244.662,4247.718,But you don't pay anything for it until you exercise the option.
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4247.718,4253.885,But it's given in partial consideration for his services because if he leaves the employment he doesn't have the option.
1978.77-753,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4281.2,4285.213,Is a stock option deemed to be an investment security within the (Voice Overlap) Act.
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4285.213,4289.302,I believe it is a security by definition or by a case decision.
1978.77-753,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4289.302,4296.87,"I'm talking about for an employee of a corporation, does a corporation have to register a stock option before it offset to one of its offices?"
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4301.759,4309.202,"If they have to register their securities generally, that registration would cover the offer to the employee."
1978.77-753,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4310.313,4312.437,If there's a registration statement in effect.
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4312.437,4315.34,If there's a registration statement in effect it would cover that employee.
1978.77-753,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4315.34,4315.433,Right.
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4315.433,4324.618,If there's no registration in effect they would not have to make -- file a registration statement merely because of the employee option as I understand it.
1978.77-753,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4324.618,4326.632,Your time has expired now.
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4326.632,4329.598,I would just like to make --
1978.77-753,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4329.598,4331.727,I think you've covered your points counsel.
1978.77-753,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4331.727,4334.46,"Well, Mr. Walner I hope somebody's going to -- there are two issues here."
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4334.46,4334.616,Yes sir.
1978.77-753,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4334.616,4336.899,Whether this is the security and whether this is a sale.
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4336.899,4337.532,Yes.
1978.77-753,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4337.532,4341.399,"And we've heard on both those issues from the other side, you said you were --"
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4341.399,4341.9,I was going to cover a little bit of sale --
1978.77-753,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4341.9,4345.297,-- cover (Voice Overlap) I hope Mr. Barack will because as Chief Justice --
1978.77-753,3,35275,lawrence_walner,,4345.297,4351.804,"All right, I just want to make two remarks on response to Mr. Dickstein's arguments with respect to sale."
1978.77-753,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4425.696,4429.901,Mr. Barack.
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4429.901,4432.787,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-753,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4497.297,4517.96,"Well, we're concerned here with despite of all the elaborate briefing and argument with two rather precise and fairly technical questions, i.e. whether within the meaning of the 1933 and 1934 Acts and/or those two statutes."
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4523.535,4523.752,"Well, one can answer the question --"
1978.77-753,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4523.752,4533.859,Those are precise statutory questions not -- and if you're talking about economic effects you could be talking about insurance or bank savings account or lots of other things that are not covered by the Securities Act.
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4533.859,4541.546,"Well, I think what we have here is a situation we were not writing on the cleans -- on a clean slate as this Court has expressly recognized in Forman."
1978.77-753,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4562.951,4566.275,"Unless the forms of investment, I mean let's have -- we're not securities."
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4571.952,4574.211,"However, a variable annuity plan is a security."
1978.77-753,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4574.211,4574.624,"Yeah, but it's correct."
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4574.624,4576.037,"Now, why is it a security?"
1978.77-753,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4595.645,4603.171,"Right there, Mr. Barack, in the trusting -- what the employee entrusted in order to acquire the interest."
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4623.053,4631.307,"Well, I would suggest that the -- a reading of the Howey rule in order not to exult form over substance in order to look at the economic realities involved."
1978.77-753,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4650.75,4657.823,But it isn't true that in those cases if the person contributing the services were terminated for some reason after a year of work.
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4662.842,4667.384,That is a question that goes to the issue of contingency an issue already discussed.
1978.77-753,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4714.53,4720.881,"If the plan were never subject to amendments, say a defined benefits are always $2.00 or whatever the payment was."
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4724.882,4725.297,But that -- that is the question --
1978.77-753,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4725.297,4731.407,-- in the contingent interest one that depending on the trustees amending the plan to increase the benefits provided there's enough money there that is a means to reduce the claim prior to contributions and so forth.
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4731.407,4738.972,That raises a very interesting question which is whether or not a fixed dollar annuity which cannot be amended is also a security.
1978.77-753,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4741.783,4743.306,So what's your view on that question?
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4743.306,4743.621,Pardon?
1978.77-753,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4743.621,4748.624,"What's your view on that question for a fixed dollar annuity, would there be -- would have been an investment?"
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4748.624,4751.613,I would think that it's a very close question and I don't think I have any answers with it.
1978.77-753,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4751.613,4753.9,"Well, what interest would there be in profits, I mean how do you --"
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4753.9,4761.47,"However, this is not that case because here we have a situation where the lure to the investor was actually the profit element."
1978.77-753,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4775.994,4779.088,"But he don't read the whole paragraph, that's what I object to both there."
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4792.938,4793.223,"Well, that's not --"
1978.77-753,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4793.223,4796.644,They didn't talk about this is going to give you $260.00 or $270.00.
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4796.644,4798.908,"Well, this is the promise of profits."
1978.77-753,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4799.676,4801.613,They don't promise profits in that paragraph.
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4805.075,4820.97,"Well, it -- this is a promise again that you're getting this and they also reiterate throughout their descriptive materials which have been distributed which we alleged are materially misleading that over the course of the period of time the benefits have been increase and indeed this is just the facts here."
1978.77-753,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4832.004,4835.575,Will you tell us what caused that increase?
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4848.294,4855.383,"Well, we don't know the exact answer to that question in terms of the numbers but let me tell you an -- a number that we do know that is analogous to that."
1978.77-753,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4903.369,4920.683,"When Mr. McDaniel signed the pass -- signed on in the pension agreement as recently formulated to prog -- guarantee him on $240.00 or $250.00 a month as Justice Stevens questions you about, was there any promise that he would get more than that if the investments went well?"
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4920.683,4923.379,We believe that the facts when we get to trial in this case will indicate --
1978.77-753,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4923.379,4926.765,"Well, what -- was there any provision in the agreement to that effect?"
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4926.765,4927.77,In the agreement?
1978.77-753,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4940.829,4944.893,You keep emphasizing the motive that it -- and used this people to invest.
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4948.454,4949.51,This is an import -- this is an important --
1978.77-753,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4949.51,4953.435,"If he's going to take this job, he had to become a member of this plan, didn't he?"
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,4953.435,4961.03,"This is an important question, the question that we have to recognize that the defendants have conceded a voluntary contributory plan."
1978.77-753,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5007.277,5009.635,Your time has expired for now Mr. Barack.
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,5009.635,5010.658,Let me just conclude that.
1978.77-753,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5010.658,5013.088,If you can finish your sentence.
1978.77-753,4,37713,peter_j_barack,,5013.088,5022.447,Mr. Justice Harlan thus stated in United Benefit Life that the two promises involved are entirely distinct and maybe separated from one another.
1978.77-753,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5049.538,5052.325,Thank you gentlemen the case is submitted.
1978.77-753,5,41207,sidney_dickstein,,5061.13,5062.289,Thank you Your Honor.
1978.77-753,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5062.289,5068.135,You've got eight minutes left.
1978.77-753,5,41207,sidney_dickstein,,5068.135,5079.122,"Mr. Barack, at the end of his argument said that we have conceded that an interest in a voluntary contributory pension fund is a security."
1978.77-753,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5428.317,5441.973,"Mr. Dickstein, (Voice Overlap) -- if you look at the -- this thing in a broad sense as you're suggesting now, you supposed that before vesting occurs an employee would have standing to bring a lawsuit to challenge the administration of the fund by the trustees."
1978.77-753,5,41207,sidney_dickstein,,5451.786,5452.9,Certainly.
1978.77-753,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5452.9,5454.693,So he does have some interest in the fund there?
1978.77-753,5,41207,sidney_dickstein,,5454.693,5459.435,The -- as a -- in that sense just -- I suppose like a contingent remainder in an ordinary trust.
1978.77-753,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5459.435,5460.651,And whether or not it's (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-753,5,41207,sidney_dickstein,,5460.651,5463.914,Might have the right -- might have the right to bring the suit against the trustee.
1978.77-753,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5463.914,5468.603,And the -- and his specific interest in this -- is whether it's profitable as it ought to be.
1978.77-753,5,41207,sidney_dickstein,,5468.603,5469.902,No.
1978.77-753,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5480.768,5487.614,But if the embezzlement wouldn't prejudice his expectancy of $250.00 a month or whatever the fixed benefit would be.
1978.77-753,5,41207,sidney_dickstein,,5488.991,5492.968,It -- in that sense he would have a sufficient interest.
1978.77-753,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5497.761,5515.237,"Well, a forfeitability doesn't mean it's not a security does it because then you can have an agreement of sale for cost of land and if you got a bunch of orange groves on it, it can -- could conceivably come within the Howey-Joiner rationale and still the contract might be forfeitable."
1978.77-753,5,41207,sidney_dickstein,,5515.237,5531.5,There is no single aspect which perhaps by itself you cannot find extent in a circums -- in a situation in which you would say that there is a security.
1978.77-753,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5570.144,5571.099,Thank you gentlemen.
