1997.97-288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.456,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-288, Vicky Lewis v. Brunswick Corporation."
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,28.65,34.221,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1997.97-288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,118.909,121.594,"Mr. Hudson, we have a good amplifying system."
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,124.395,125.831,--I will tone it down--
1997.97-288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,125.831,126.314,Okay.
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,126.314,127.597,--Chief Justice.
1997.97-288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,165.139,178.966,"Well, but we've certainly held in Medtronic and in that Cipollone case that State common law actions can constitute requirements subject to preemption."
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,178.966,186.053,"Yes, Your Honor, there has a been a holding that the common law can lead to a requirement."
1997.97-288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,187.322,188.005,Can lead to?
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,198.88,200.263,"--Well, for a couple of reasons."
1997.97-288,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,245.741,252.947,"Well, I... isn't the whole purpose of your punitive damage claim to require the manufacturer to change his behavior?"
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,252.947,254.966,--Even then--
1997.97-288,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,254.966,256.732,Isn't that what you're going to argue to the jury?
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,256.732,262.803,"--Even then, Your Honor, it may not be necessary that they actually install a propeller guard."
1997.97-288,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,277.812,283.633,"Well, I take it that the main thrust of your argument below is that the propeller guard should have been installed."
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,294.174,295.457,--To award compensation to the injured victim is the first purpose.
1997.97-288,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,325.71,349.428,"On that very point, if... imagine that the Coast Guard here had said what it didn't say, but suppose it said we think that the guards on these propellers are actually a greater danger than an unguarded propeller because somebody can get hit on the head, and that's a bigger chance of harm than the other, so suppose because of that they'd said very clearly, we don't want guards."
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,367.822,371.424,"Under that reading it wouldn't make sense, Justice Breyer, and I'd like to--"
1997.97-288,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,371.424,382.065,"So how do you prevent... how do you read it your way, which is to say, it preserves common law claims, and yet avoid what you've just said is a ridiculous result?"
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,382.065,399.693,"--May I assume in your question that you are referring to the Coast Guard adopting a regulation saying thou shalt not have propeller guards, and then not as a matter of preemption, but I think as a matter of the Supremacy Clause and cases like American Airlines v. Wollands and the case that was cited from 1907."
1997.97-288,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,406.18,408.214,What happens to your savings clause here?
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,427.011,427.644,--Well--
1997.97-288,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,427.644,428.361,--and... yes.
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,430.713,433.998,--It's... I think you have to go one word further.
1997.97-288,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,442.52,443.02,Well--
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,445.322,445.755,--No.
1997.97-288,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,460.982,462.601,I'm trying to get your view on it.
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,476.242,478.744,"--No, sir, I think that is our view, Your Honor."
1997.97-288,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,478.744,489.101,"So in other words your view is that the savings clause does nothing if the Coast Guard... it... the savings clause is necessary, I guess, in your view."
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,498.774,505.694,"Well, it depends on whether or not there's a conflict, because if they say thou shalt not have a propeller guard, then our claim would be barred."
1997.97-288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,505.694,506.88,Suppose it simply--
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,518.371,519.054,Well--
1997.97-288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,519.054,534.064,"Now, I take it you're backing off that position and you're saying, well, if it really is in direct conflict, then maybe common law rules can in fact be requirements or regulations under--"
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,534.064,536.43,"--Fortunately, that's not our case, but I do--"
1997.97-288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,536.43,537.932,"--No, but even if--"
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,537.932,538.532,--I do concede--
1997.97-288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,538.532,545.252,"--Even if we think that, that doesn't end the case for you because you have another theory here, right?"
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,545.252,548.471,"--Well, our theory is that there is no conflict."
1997.97-288,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,548.471,569.737,"No, but before you get to... I thought that your position was that the savings clause requires us to read the statute in such a way that the reference to regulations or standards does not necessarily encompass every common law rule."
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,572.02,574.455,"No, we don't, Justice Souter."
1997.97-288,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,574.455,574.872,Okay.
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,574.872,586.162,"That is statutory evidence, along with some pretty extensive legislative history, that all concerned thought that common law claims would survive even after the adoption of this act."
1997.97-288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,597.07,601.172,"And what do you do with the phrase, or under State law?"
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,603.391,606.01,"Justice Scalia, you backed up in that statute."
1997.97-288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.01,609.045,--You just say you have to read it with the word--
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,609.045,610.162,Liability.
1997.97-288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,610.162,610.564,--liability.
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,613.766,618.568,"For example, Justice Scalia, in our case we are bringing a negligence... we have a negligence count."
1997.97-288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,633.327,638.647,"--Well, you could call it a State law... it's positive State enactment rather than common law... couldn't you?"
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,638.647,644.868,"The difference, I think, Chief Justice, is it is not a law aimed specifically at boating requirements."
1997.97-288,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,665.631,681.993,"Of course, that reference to State law might be an indication that the only... that the general preemption clause should be read to mean that there is no preemption unless there is a positive enactment of Federal law."
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,690.599,707.541,"I think that is the most logical reading, because when you read 4306 in conjunction with 4305, what you are permitted to obtain exemption from if you apply to the Coast Guard is from existing rules and regulations of the Coast Guard."
1997.97-288,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,732.426,733.759,"Well, you could read it either way."
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,779.24,788.429,"To that I would respond, Justice Souter, that the former reading, why do you need State laws that simply parrot an existing Federal regulation that has been enacted by the Coast Guard."
1997.97-288,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,788.429,788.829,Mm-hmm.
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,788.829,790.429,The conduct is being regulated.
1997.97-288,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,803.939,805.055,If that's what we mean.
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,827.554,840.295,"That is correct, because from the time of the enactment of the act and through the present time the Coast Guard has never taken the position that common law claims of general application of State laws are preempted."
1997.97-288,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,840.295,860.209,"--May I ask you about the... whether the Georgia... the question of Georgia law of... to introduce to this jury the fact that the Coast Guard did not make a regulation requiring propeller guards would be relevant, wouldn't it?"
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,860.209,875.301,"At least the underlying facts that caused the Coast Guard not to do anything, and the Coast Guard decided not to do anything because they couldn't come up with a common solution and it might expensive and the data was incomplete."
1997.97-288,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,885.759,891.413,And the fact that the Coast Guard that has set other standards didn't set this one.
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,891.413,906.272,"Yes, I think that could, because it will be a very limited application, even when it comes in, because the Coast Guard's action was very narrow in scope, the letter that adopted the position of the subcommittee that studied propeller guards."
1997.97-288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,906.272,907.272,Mr. Hudson--
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,916.362,918.73,"Well, I think I do know that much, Your Honor."
1997.97-288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,939.144,944.481,"Mr. Hudson, 4305 is discussed in all the briefs."
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,960.891,965.895,"Your Honor, I can't... we'll look in the blue brief."
1997.97-288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,972.615,977.019,It's the one that permits the State to apply--
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,977.019,977.986,--For an exemption.
1997.97-288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.986,978.836,--For an exemption.
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,978.836,979.286,Okay.
1997.97-288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,979.638,980.105,Right.
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,980.105,999.782,"It's... if we haven't set it forth, Your Honor, that's an oversight, but it simply says the Coast Guard can grant an exemption from an existing act or a regulation that the Coast Guard has adopted, not an exemption from the wiping-of-the-slate clean notion that Brunswick submits in this case."
1997.97-288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,999.782,1002.901,"Well, I'm still looking for it."
1997.97-288,0,21026,david_e_hudson,,1002.901,1005.003,I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
1997.97-288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1005.003,1006.538,"Very well, Mr. Hudson."
1997.97-288,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1008.805,1025.934,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-288,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1085.655,1086.822,What about punitives?
1997.97-288,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1096.362,1098.329,"--Well, Justice Scalia--"
1997.97-288,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1098.329,1101.414,"I mean, it's true, you can roll the dice if you like."
1997.97-288,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1127.082,1134.135,"--Justice Scalia, I'm trying to set forth the reasons why in 1971, when Congress enacted this statute, it may have differentiated it."
1997.97-288,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1162.053,1166.04,Is that true even if the Coast Guard has a particular rule?
1997.97-288,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1195.357,1195.74,--No.
1997.97-288,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1197.559,1197.992,Ah.
1997.97-288,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1197.992,1199.926,--principles would be applicable.
1997.97-288,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1199.926,1205.164,"So in other words it's just the fact they don't have a particular reg here that this turns on, in your opinion."
1997.97-288,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1205.164,1227.161,"Well, the savings clause should not be read to eviscerate the power that Congress gave the Coast Guard to promulgate affirmative regulations, so that if in exercising that power that Congress gave the Coast Guard the Coast Guard promulgates a regulation that prohibits propeller guards, it would be anomalous to read the savings clause to bring it into conflict with that."
1997.97-288,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1227.161,1228.927,So if they have a reg... suppose they do have a reg.
1997.97-288,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1228.927,1229.361,Yes.
1997.97-288,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1229.361,1251.442,"In your view, should we look to see whether that reg, there's a direct conflict with the State law or common law State... you know, the tort judgment, whether it... the State tort judgment would defeat an object of the reg, or whether the state judgment would be in an area that the reg clearly intends to reserve to the Coast Guard... that's your view of it?"
1997.97-288,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1251.442,1251.976,That's correct.
1997.97-288,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1252.376,1252.642,Okay.
1997.97-288,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1262.834,1271.94,"--Because in 4306 the words that Congress used, it started out by saying, unless permitted by the Secretary, and everything else follows."
1997.97-288,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1329.609,1353.225,"The trouble I find with this analysis, that you rely just on implied preemption for common law, is that would be very peculiar in a statute which in 4306 insists that the State law be identical, that the State regulation, at least, be identical to the Federal law."
1997.97-288,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1360.729,1363.997,"--Well, to the contrary, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-288,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1417.565,1422.469,Why would a State want to have a regulation that was identical with the Federal regulation?
1997.97-288,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1422.469,1450.203,"--Mr. Chief Justice, the history of it is that the Coast Guard recognized that it lacked the resources in order to enforce all of these provisions with the tens of millions of boats that were out there, so in fact when the Commandant of the Coast Guard testified he urged Congress to provide a scheme that would allow States to promulgate parallel... an identical regulation so that State enforcement officers could go and help with the enforcement of the safety standards."
1997.97-288,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1450.203,1452.571,The States couldn't help enforce the Coast Guard regulation?
1997.97-288,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1452.571,1477.456,"It wasn't clear at the time whether in the absence of that explicit authority and provision that State officers would have the incentive or necessarily the power to do that, so when the Commandant of the Coast Guard testified before the Senate committee he made very clear that what the concern that the Coast Guard had was the positive enactments that would be conflicting with State law."
1997.97-288,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1573.183,1581.437,Do you think the American Law Institute always represents what is the view in almost all of the States?
1997.97-288,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1583.305,1584.272,"--Well, I think--"
1997.97-288,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1584.272,1590.728,"I mean, I think there would be real reason to put that in just in case a number of States were following it."
1997.97-288,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1590.728,1614.76,"--Justice Scalia, even if you were to say that what Congress was intending to do was to put the ALI's view right into law, the words that Congress used made very clear that general provisions of common law liability are to be preserved, because it didn't say liability under common law, especially breach of warranty or product defect claims."
1997.97-288,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1637.189,1638.14,What do you do--
1997.97-288,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1640.391,1642.327,--Thank you.
1997.97-288,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1642.327,1643.327,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick."
1997.97-288,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1646.962,1664.341,"Mr. Geller, we'll hear from you."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1664.341,1669.228,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-288,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1699.814,1700.23,"Well, excuse me."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1723.279,1741.407,"--No, there's no... I should say the Coast Guard was relying, I believe, on unanimous recommendations from the... from its Subcommittee on Propeller Guards and from the National Boating Safety Advisory Council, each of whom had found that the use of propeller guards would demonstrably make boating less safe, and the Coast Guard--"
1997.97-288,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1741.407,1742.209,"Well, that's right, but the Coast Guard--"
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1742.209,1742.409,--The Coast Guard--
1997.97-288,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1742.409,1743.793,--gave its reasons.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1759.487,1759.937,--That's--
1997.97-288,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1759.937,1762.689,--so I don't think we can attribute that to the Coast Guard.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1762.689,1770.176,"--That's true, Justice Souter, although it did find... it did agree with the recommendations of the underlying committees that it shouldn't impose a prop guard requirement."
1997.97-288,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1791.257,1794.392,What if there had been no Federal statute at all?
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1798.612,1799.262,Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1799.262,1801.564,--South Carolina and Georgia law were they different.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1801.564,1808.968,"But it was the very purpose of this statute, Mr. Chief Justice, the very purpose of this statute to avoid that sort of a problem."
1997.97-288,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1826.113,1837.488,"Well, yes, but the Coast Guard did not, in fact, adopt a regulation on this specific device, and I don't know that South Carolina have a different rule."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1844.824,1847.776,"--No, it doesn't, and no, I think that would be preempted if it did as well."
1997.97-288,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1860.27,1872.678,"Yes, but it clearly envisions that the Coast Guard might not take action with regard to the whole universe of possible actions it could take, and we have a situation here where it didn't take action."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1872.678,1874.078,But the language--
1997.97-288,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1874.078,1879.998,And that may leave open some room for application of State law.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1879.998,1907.167,"--I think that the language of the preemption provision, Justice O'Connor, specifically addresses the situation and provides, as the Solicitor General acknowledges, the Coast Guard has always interpreted the provision according to its plain... the Coast Guard has always interpreted the provision according to its plain language to preempt State law involving design and equipment requirements even in the absence of a Coast Guard regulation because of this congressional desire to have uniform national requirements."
1997.97-288,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1923.426,1937.353,"Well, of course, that included, as I understand it, State regulatory requirements in the narrow sense, so that it did not necessarily imply that the Coast Guard thought that it was necessary to do that to preserve any State common law."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1937.353,1941.988,--There was no... it simply exempted all existing State requirements.
1997.97-288,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1946.909,1955.565,"Right, and that's... I mean, my only point is, I don't think you can infer from that that the Coast Guard ever took the position that a common law requirement was, in fact, preempted."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1955.565,1955.898,--No.
1997.97-288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1969.657,1975.728,"Mr. Geller, doesn't it... it's a little unrealistic to talk about a requirement imposed by State law anyway."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2004.312,2004.664,That's true.
1997.97-288,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2027.678,2052.828,"But isn't the argument for exception oddly enough supported by the advisory committee's report here, and that is that the designs of boats vary so enormously that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to have a uniform rule in the sense of saying, all boats should have propeller guards, or all boats should have this kind of propeller guard."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2073.324,2075.844,"--Two requirements, Justice... two responses, Justice Souter."
1997.97-288,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2094.538,2097.09,"Well, I thought they... and you know this better than I do."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2102.078,2102.511,--Exactly.
1997.97-288,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2102.511,2104.294,But not in all cases.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2104.294,2107.898,In every case in which a motor boat was going more than 10 miles an hour.
1997.97-288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2131.53,2134.549,But we have emphasized the language in the particular statutes.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2134.549,2139.184,"Yes, and the language in this statute I think is indistinguishable, Justice Stevens, from--"
1997.97-288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2139.184,2139.817,Does it have the word requirement in it?
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2139.817,2140.101,--Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2147.59,2148.923,"Mr. Geller, as you do that--"
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2148.923,2149.392,--Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2149.392,2157.915,"--can you tell me if there's another statute that uses the word, minimum safety standards, because I thought that gave some kind of a tone to it."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2157.915,2158.181,Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2170.738,2173.507,"No, everyone agrees that there's a preemption pro tanto."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2179.678,2180.444,--Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2180.444,2188.434,"But the word minimum suggests to me that there could be other things, that every--"
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2188.434,2188.984,What the Court--
1997.97-288,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2188.984,2195.088,"--That those standards must be followed, but there could be additional standards."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2195.088,2200.492,"--That's not the argument... the Court rejected that very argument in Ray v. Atlantic-Richfield, Your Honor."
1997.97-288,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2215.001,2227.825,"The reason could be that these standards are in place, but we're not saying that that's the universe, that there can't be liability apart from these standards."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2239.8,2240.083,Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2240.569,2242.669,Where... what is the status of that now?
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2242.669,2253.292,"As recently as last August, Justice Ginsburg, the Coast Guard again asked for comments from people as to whether there would be a workable type of propeller guard that the Coast Guard could consider."
1997.97-288,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2253.292,2254.392,And that's just--
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2254.392,2266.867,"They haven't yet issued any regulation presumably because they haven't yet been satisfied that they can meet the standards of 4302, which is to say that the requirement that the propeller guard would actually advance the interest of boat safety."
1997.97-288,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2266.867,2268.302,--All we know is that they asked again.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2268.302,2268.952,Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2268.952,2270.254,And we don't know anything about the answers.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2270.254,2270.571,No.
1997.97-288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2334.528,2335.363,"Well, you take--"
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2337.53,2338.815,--Law or--
1997.97-288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2338.815,2340.498,--A law or regulation establishing--
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2340.498,2340.934,--Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2341.6,2342.234,--the requirement?
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2342.234,2345.219,"--I think the language in Medtronic was very, very similar."
1997.97-288,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2351.539,2376.17,"Well, you take the position, Mr. Geller, that regardless of whether... what we think of the action or inaction of the Coast Guard on this propeller guard business that any common law requirement for a propeller guard by a State is preempted, no matter what the Coast Guard has done--"
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2376.17,2376.654,That's right.
1997.97-288,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2376.654,2377.67,--or hasn't done.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2377.67,2388.562,Because I think that section 43... section 4306 enacts a general preemption rule that says no State can impose a requirement for associated equipment.
1997.97-288,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2389.195,2393.616,"So if the Coast Guard had never even studied the problem, nothing had been done--"
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2393.616,2394.166,--Absolutely.
1997.97-288,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2395.066,2396.484,--you take the position it's still preempted.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2396.484,2398.018,"--Yes, for purposes of our express preemption."
1997.97-288,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2409.541,2410.927,What sense would that make?
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2417.747,2418.397,Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2418.397,2427.27,--then you would have a Coast Guard explicit rule and a State could have a tort case that would force the opposite.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2429.372,2430.055,That would make no sense.
1997.97-288,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2430.055,2430.889,--at least for argument.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2444.299,2445.115,You couldn't have any--
1997.97-288,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2445.115,2463.526,"I mean, I can understand why Congress might have said, if the Coast Guard does nothing at all, still the States aren't supposed to sit there and write rules out on a piece of paper, but I just can't understand why Congress would have said, if the Congress does nothing at all, all of State tort law goes up in smoke."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2463.526,2468.097,"--Not all of State tort... I think the breadth of this argument has been grossly overstated, Justice Breyer."
1997.97-288,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2481.84,2483.124,"No, no, but why would Congress have wanted to--"
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2483.124,2483.757,"--Yes, and--"
1997.97-288,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2483.757,2491.129,--say that no State tort law for the basic hornbook classic negligence--
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2491.129,2492.012,--Of design.
1997.97-288,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2492.579,2495.481,"--of design, any of that stuff when the Coast Guard does nothing."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2495.481,2501.551,"Because, as Congress said... as Congress said, there has to be a uniform national rule for design requirements."
1997.97-288,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2506.955,2523.584,"Well, I take it... I take it that an additional answer to Justice Breyer... maybe you don't want... is that this didn't prempt all State tort law automatically because the Coast Guard could and, in fact, did leave much of it in place, and in the States."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2523.584,2523.984,--Absolutely.
1997.97-288,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2525.284,2527.136,Under 430... 05.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2527.136,2527.636,--4305.
1997.97-288,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2574.016,2576.635,Are we talking about 4306 or 4305?
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2576.635,2577.118,"--Yes, 4306."
1997.97-288,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2731.533,2736.837,"Well, but you also have the savings clause, 4311, and--"
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2736.837,2737.437,Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2738.789,2744.527,"--its reference to common law and State law cuts the other way, I--"
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2744.527,2749.661,"I don't think a fair reading of the savings clause cuts the other way, Justice O'Connor, but let's look at that as well."
1997.97-288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2799.077,2799.811,--What does it apply to?
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2801.629,2814.187,"One example might be, Justice Scalia, if a State had a design requirement that was not preempted because it was intended to deal with uniquely hazardous local conditions."
1997.97-288,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2818.491,2821.443,"Yes, but by the same token you don't need a savings clause."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2821.443,2832.398,"--You need a savings clause, Justice Souter, for fear that the... that it might be perceived under State law that it's a complete defense that you've complied with the Federal regulation."
1997.97-288,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2832.398,2835.636,"Yes, but that would be a bizarre reading of the preemption clause."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2838.186,2838.571,Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2850.462,2851.196,You're talking to me?
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2851.646,2854.431,--I'm talking to the Court.
1997.97-288,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2880.581,2886.302,What would happen in a case that... let's assume that there is fairly clear preemption.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2896.158,2902.662,--I think that that claim would... the failure to warn about the absence of propeller guards?
1997.97-288,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2902.662,2903.229,"About the absence, yes."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2903.229,2918.69,"I think... I think that would probably be preempted as well because of the effect it would have on manufacturers to build their boats to... in other words, the failure to warn would have to warn about some dangerous, perhaps defective condition that--"
1997.97-288,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2918.69,2920.04,I looked at the complaint briefly.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2921.475,2923.258,--There isn't a failure to warn claim in this case--
1997.97-288,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2923.258,2923.925,--allegation here.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2923.925,2925.36,--and it's an interesting question.
1997.97-288,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2940.636,2940.903,"Oh, no."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2943.905,2952.777,"--There are warning requirements in the act as well, Federal warning requirements, and it may be that those would preempt a State warning requirement, but that's not what we have here."
1997.97-288,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2973.257,2981.447,"Well, Mr. Geller, it's... you say that a propeller is regarded as associated equipment for the board--"
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2981.447,2981.83,Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2981.83,2982.38,--for the boat?
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2982.38,2982.88,Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2982.88,2984.649,It's not a part of the boat itself.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2984.649,2987.516,It's defined in Coast Guard regulations as associated equipment.
1997.97-288,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2987.516,2993.504,"So there's a little bit different language about associated equipment than there is for the vessel itself, isn't there?"
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3004.276,3011.216,"Right, and we are relying... this case involves the section of 4306 that talks about imposing a equipment for associated--"
1997.97-288,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3011.216,3012.016,A requirement.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3012.016,3014.751,"--A requirement for associated equipment, that's right."
1997.97-288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3014.751,3026.726,"Mr. Geller, can I come back and ask you for another example of how the savings clause would apply State law, other than a State law that had been exempted under 4305?"
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3026.726,3031.361,"There are many types... first of all, I'm not sure that Congress necessarily had in mind a specific situation."
1997.97-288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3032.144,3032.63,I don't need many.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3033.23,3033.646,--Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3043.919,3045.121,But--
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3045.121,3059.447,--suggestion is that you shouldn't allow the preemption provision to be broadened beyond Congress' intent by allowing the defense to argue that mere compliance... mere compliance with the Federal regulations is a defense under State law.
1997.97-288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3059.447,3064.499,--But unless the defective manufacture claim dealt with the manufacture of the propeller--
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3064.499,3065.601,Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3068.136,3069.503,--It seems to me it would be preempted anyway.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3078.009,3078.342,--Well--
1997.97-288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3078.342,3079.159,--terribly persuasive.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3079.159,3082.694,"--That's one example, but you have to remember, Justice Scalia, this was added at the last minute."
1997.97-288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3091.216,3092.934,Mr.... finish your answer.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3093.701,3104.409,"--But the other key point... I mean, I think the Achille's heel of the plaintiffs' and any attempt to rely on section 4311(g) is that it doesn't distinguish at all between common law and State law."
1997.97-288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3125.406,3130.459,I want to be sure... I thought you made an acknowledgement of a point I didn't think you would make.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3146.219,3146.453,Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3146.453,3147.838,There could still be a State law claim?
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3147.838,3156.861,"There could be a claim... there could well be a State law claim because we would not be within State 4306, that the boat was not manufactured according to its design requirements."
1997.97-288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3156.861,3162.765,"No, I'm assuming it complied with the... because it only talks about when they comply with all the Federal requirements."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3164.215,3166.133,"Yes, but there aren't manufacturing requirements."
1997.97-288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3166.133,3169.601,"--No, but I'm assuming they... of course, they could have a problem here, of course."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3169.601,3169.868,Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3176.505,3176.722,Right.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3176.722,3183.844,"--and you complied fully with... you put the propeller guard on your boat, so you satisfied the design requirements, but you didn't fasten it properly."
1997.97-288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3190.932,3192.2,Even if--
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3192.2,3192.7,--failure to manufacture--
1997.97-288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3192.7,3196.319,--Assuming that the Coast Guard regulation didn't tell you how many bolts to put on.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3196.319,3196.819,--Right.
1997.97-288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3196.819,3197.186,Is that right?
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3197.186,3197.486,Right.
1997.97-288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3202.39,3204.025,It seems to me there's a bigger gap in this case than the one you--
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3204.025,3211.845,--A failure to manufacture claim only requires the manufacturer to comply with his own or the Coast Guard's design requirements.
1997.97-288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3217.999,3225.921,"--But if that's true in regard to a minor matter like nuts and bolts, why isn't it true with regard to the total omission of any requirement for propeller guards?"
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3225.921,3236.443,--Because how the boat is to be designed and what equipment the boat is to have on it is a question reserved to the Coast Guard or else you can't have a uniform national rule.
1997.97-288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3236.443,3238.895,"Well, but that's the same... true with the four bolts instead of two."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3238.895,3239.229,No.
1997.97-288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3247.334,3250.469,"No, but the omission is, there's no requirement on the number of bolts."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3253.254,3259.058,"--No, but in one case you're simply being asked to comply with your own design requirements."
1997.97-288,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3273.283,3277.77,The statute says performance standard.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3279.637,3280.889,Right.
1997.97-288,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3280.889,3284.257,"So therefore, if the failure to have... it's the same question."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3307.206,3315.21,"I thought Justice Stevens was referring to a manufacturing defect, a failure to comply with your own design requirements or the Coast Guard's design requirements."
1997.97-288,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3401.751,3410.19,"--Mr. Geller, do we give any credence to the fact that the Coast Guard itself doesn't think that this is contrary to what it's intending to do."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3413.408,3415.927,"--Well, I don't know, Justice Ginsburg."
1997.97-288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3440.543,3442.828,The Coast Guard isn't in charge of preemption anyway.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3450.082,3450.515,Yes.
1997.97-288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3451.684,3455.636,Whether the State is preempted or not is not within the Coast Guard's bailiwick.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3455.636,3463.908,"--All I'm saying, Justice Scalia, the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question is, I don't know of any pronouncement by the Coast Guard, ever, that has ever drawn a distinction between--"
1997.97-288,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3463.908,3465.692,"Well, maybe we should just leave the Coast Guard out of it."
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3465.692,3469.294,"--Well, the fact of the matter is that the Coast Guard has never--"
1997.97-288,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3489.123,3496.129,"And I suppose some inquiry into that subject is within their purview, because they can pronounce regulations exempting--"
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3496.129,3496.679,--Right.
1997.97-288,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3496.679,3497.713,--certain State laws.
1997.97-288,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3497.713,3504.217,"Right, and I don't know of any instance in which they have ever said, contrary, for example, to in Medtronic, where the FDA had a regulation that--"
1997.97-288,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3504.217,3506.669,"Thank you, Mr. Geller."
1997.97-288,3,21026,david_e_hudson,,3509.371,3524.213,"In regard to the position of the Coast Guard, I think in footnote 2 of the blue brief the statement of the Commandant at the time the legislation was enacted is pretty compelling."
1997.97-288,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3547.829,3553.482,This is the statement of the Commandant before this legislation was on the books?
1997.97-288,3,21026,david_e_hudson,,3553.482,3557.953,"Yes, during the Senate committee hearings in response to a question from the committee."
1997.97-288,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3557.953,3561.738,You consider that to be a position of the agency as to the meaning of the law?
1997.97-288,3,21026,david_e_hudson,,3561.738,3578.617,"Further evidence of the agency's position I think, Justice Scalia, is found in those 1971 and 1973 Federal Register provisions that are cited in all of the briefs where the Coast Guard specifically left in place all laws enacted by the States prior to 1971."
1997.97-288,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3649.944,3657.133,"You wouldn't necessarily have a conflict if they added something that the regulations didn't have, like a propeller guard."
1997.97-288,3,21026,david_e_hudson,,3659.916,3664.054,"--I agree there would be no conflict, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-288,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3751.16,3752.593,"Thank you, Mr. Hudson."
