1982.81-298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.428,We will hear arguments next in Community Television against Gottfried.
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,148.848,158.936,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this statutory construction case involves television programs for the deaf."
1982.81-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,633.935,647.794,"Mr. Czarra, do you have any idea whether the FCC at the license renewal stage would take into consideration the fact, if there were a fact, that a licensee had been found to be guilty of an unfair labor practice?"
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,647.794,649.136,"Yes, it would."
1982.81-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,657.18,662.454,What would it do if it found that a licensee had committed an unfair labor practice?
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,662.454,665.636,It would depend on the circumstances.
1982.81-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,684.018,694.875,"What if an intervenor in a license renewal proceeding, if that is what you call them, someone objecting to the license renewal, said, I think this station has been guilty of an unfair labor practice."
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,701.38,719.881,"Well, I think the FCC initially would look at the nature of the allegations, how well they were supported by specific facts, affidavits, and so on, but I suspect that the most that the FCC would do in that situation is simply wait to see what one of the enforcement agencies would do."
1982.81-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,719.881,740.455,"Do you think if... assume the unfair labor practice had been adjudicated by the NLRB, or that it hadn't, but the intervenor called the FCC's attention to an adjudicated unfair labor and an alleged unadjudicated one."
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,744.198,747.799,I don't think that they would say that it was irrelevant.
1982.81-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,747.799,749.161,I didn't ask that.
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,764.191,768.823,"No, I think it depends on the nature of the law."
1982.81-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,768.823,770.653,"What about this case, then?"
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,782.053,783.563,"No, they did not."
1982.81-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,785.824,788.836,Irrelevant to the license renewal proceedings.
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,788.836,801.094,"--No, they said it was relevant, and that they would take into account any adjudication by a responsible agency that there had been discrimination or violation of Section 504."
1982.81-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.094,804.016,"But until some other agency acted on it, it was irrelevant?"
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,804.016,809.008,"Well, I am stumbling over the word ""irrelevant""."
1982.81-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,809.008,816.985,"Well, anyway, they would not take evidence as to what the station's conduct was with respect to 504--"
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,816.985,818.325,"Well, they had--"
1982.81-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,818.325,820.666,--as long as there had been no adjudication by some other agency.
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,820.666,840.65,"--But they had evidence before it of what the station was doing in terms of service to the deaf, and it decided that apart from a specific finding by a funding agency that there was some problem under 504, that the Commission under its view of the public interest standard found no shortcoming."
1982.81-298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,894.754,904.551,"Mr. Czarra, did the FCC take any new action after the adoption of Section 504, or was its policy already fixed?"
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,913.738,925.535,"As far as the published opinions go, Justice O'Connor, there is no indication that they specifically took into account a statute called Section 504."
1982.81-298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,925.535,927.896,It never mentioned it by number or name?
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,927.896,939.564,"Not as far as I recall, but after its enactment it did on several occasions before it resolved this case deal with the subject of television service for the deaf."
1982.81-298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,979.282,1006.218,"If we were to determine that the Act, Section 504, is relevant to the purposes and things which the FCC has to decide in some way, I take it it is your position that the FCC has taken action and has applied the principles embodied in 504."
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,1006.218,1007.318,Precisely.
1982.81-298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1023.73,1039.689,"Did the holding of the Court of Appeals impose any special burdens on the agency other than to require it to make tracks, so to speak, indicating its consideration of the section?"
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,1039.689,1044.434,"Well, I think the Court of Appeals' opinion is somewhat ambiguous."
1982.81-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1084.201,1097.26,"What if evidence is offered that out of the 300 employees, there are only 3 percent that include minorities, Hispanics, orientals, Negroes, et cetera?"
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,1103.304,1104.865,"Yes, it would be."
1982.81-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.96,1123.577,Why wouldn't the Commission then have a hearing on the allegations that a station hadn't lived up to its obligations under 504?
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,1123.577,1141.649,"Well, the FCC had said in 1970 and again in 1976 that we are not going to impose any specific obligations because this whole question of television service for the deaf is wrapped up in technology and economics and other practical problems."
1982.81-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.381,1163.582,But allegedly had run afoul of 504.
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,1163.582,1165.886,"Well, that is correct, but--"
1982.81-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1165.886,1179.033,Just like the Commission listens to allegations that the station hasn't lived up to some of its obligations under some other statutes.
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,1179.033,1197.735,"--Well, the Commission evaluates the factual allegations and the record of the station, and it decides whether in its view of the public interest, whether it takes into account fully the provision of some other statute or only partially."
1982.81-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1197.735,1207.422,"Well, did the Commission in this case, or did it not, rule that the Section 504 provided no basis for the non-renewal of the license?"
1982.81-298,0,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,1207.422,1210.723,It did not so state that.
1982.81-298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1241.203,1251.449,Mr. Alito?
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1251.449,1271.214,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the narrow issue presented by this case is which agency or agencies have the responsibility for construing and enforcing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act."
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.533,1289.646,You think it must be one or the other?
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1289.646,1292.157,"No, it could be both, Your Honor."
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1302.423,1303.765,So it couldn't be both under the statute?
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1303.765,1305.225,--That's correct.
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1307.799,1319.706,So the FCC would have no authority by rule to say that because of 504 the stations must do so and so?
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1319.706,1327.24,"--I believe the FCC certainly has the authority under its own public interest standard to impose captioning requirements, and it has said so."
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1327.24,1336.046,"Yes, but when it says particularly because of 504, the requirements of 504, we are incorporating into our public interest standard, it would have authority to do that?"
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1336.046,1356.94,"I believe that the enactment of 504 or any other statute is something that the Commission could take into consideration in making its public interest determination, but I don't believe the Commission can take upon itself the responsibility for enforcing statutes if that responsibility was committed to other agencies by Congress, and I think--"
1982.81-298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1356.94,1367.665,"Then you don't agree with your colleague, who suggested that the employment policies of the licensee are relevant factors in the license renewal."
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1367.665,1370.757,"--Oh, I agree that that is a relevant factor, Your Honor."
1982.81-298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1371.559,1373.119,How does it affect the listeners?
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1373.119,1374.501,--Pardon me?
1982.81-298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1374.501,1382.646,"How does the employment practice of technicians, stenographers, salesmen, et cetera, have any bearing on what goes out over the air?"
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1382.646,1399.706,"The Commission has taken the position that a station that refuses to employ persons regardless of race, sex, national origin, or religion, cannot provide service to all members of the community, as is required by the Communications Act."
1982.81-298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1400.277,1415.848,"Well, then I am confused by your other response that these... I thought you were indicating that the enforcement of these other statutory duties entrusted to other agencies was left to them, and not to be taken on by the FCC."
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1415.848,1430.809,--I think it's necessary to draw a sharp distinction between the enforcement of other statutes or the policies they express merely because those policies happen to be expressed in the statute and a factor that the Commission determines to be relevant under the public interest standard.
1982.81-298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1430.809,1438.021,What could be a greater enforcement mechanism than the threat of losing a television license?
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1438.021,1439.784,It certainly is severe.
1982.81-298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1439.784,1447.567,"That is far more serious than an order of the National Labor Relations Board or the EEOC, is it not?"
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1447.567,1449.538,It certainly is a severe sanction.
1982.81-298,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1558.302,1571.639,"Do you make the same argument on equal employment opportunity, for example, that the FCC should not concern itself whatever with that in license renewals?"
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1571.639,1572.871,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1982.81-298,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1580.425,1589.011,Don't you think the FCC has determined that service to the hearing impaired is relevant to its license renewal application?
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1589.011,1590.623,"--It certainly has, and it has said so."
1982.81-298,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1590.623,1592.704,Was that an erroneous decision?
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1592.704,1593.953,Absolutely not.
1982.81-298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1752.298,1768.437,"Your thought there is that the Commission may take into consideration some policies from other statutes as a part of the public interest standard on its own initiative, although had it declined to do so, the Court of Appeals couldn't compel it to do so."
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1768.437,1776.644,--The Commission's decision to consider or not to consider a factor would be tested against an abuse of discretion standard.
1982.81-298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1776.644,1796.887,"Well, do you think that in the particular case that we are talking about, it is the Commission's position that it couldn't have been required to consider employment discrimination if it had chosen not to, if that had been appealed to the Court of Appeals the way the 504 situation was here?"
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1796.887,1813.466,"The Commission might well have been held by a court to have abused its discretion if it had decided that no evidence of employment discrimination, no matter how invidious, was relevant to the public interest standard, and the same sort of test is the proper one here."
1982.81-298,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1867.844,1873.638,"Your argument, counsel, seems to go beyond that of the station itself."
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1903.865,1909.411,"Your Honor, I hope that that is not the argument that I have left the impression I am advancing."
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.358,1942.791,"Well, it did here just reject the submission without hearing."
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1942.791,1945.983,It rejected the submission here without a hearing.
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1945.983,1953.31,And it wasn't going to take any evidence about the station's performance with respect... under 504.
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1953.31,1954.729,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1961.525,1973.763,But apparently it did think that the station wasn't out of line in terms of what the Commission's own judgment had been in the past about what stations ought to do.
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1973.763,1997.589,"The Commission has taken the position that mandatory requirements should not be imposed, largely for the technical reasons that I have touched on, and therefore there was no reason to conduct a hearing to determine whether the number of captioned hours broadcast by KCET was sufficient to meet any standard previously imposed."
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.589,2004.625,"So the Commission's policy was, the station should not be made to do anything with respect to 504."
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2004.625,2009.027,"That is correct, Your Honor, in a sense."
1982.81-298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2009.027,2013.16,"We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, counsel."
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2035.953,2045.711,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in FCC versus National Citizens Commission for Broadcasting, this Court stated,"
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2075.22,2076.051,Must it?
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2076.051,2080.153,"--That would be tested against the public interest, against an abuse of discretion standard."
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.153,2081.415,"Well, how about the case you just cited?"
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2086.027,2087.659,The Court didn't find that it had to.
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2087.659,2090.02,What is your submission on that?
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2091.523,2095.284,"It varies, I think, Your Honor, depending from case to case."
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2098.326,2103.258,"What about... Let's just take the antitrust case then, if you want to do it case by case."
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2105.971,2108.242,"In certain contexts, I think it may be required to do so, but not--"
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2108.242,2109.312,Sometimes it must?
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2110.483,2111.705,--In certain--
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2111.705,2113.065,Sometimes it must?
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2113.065,2119.258,"--In certain contexts, anticompetitive behavior by a licensee might be relevant to the licensing decision."
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2119.258,2120.56,So it must in certain cases.
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2120.56,2125.723,"Under an abuse of discretion standard, it might be found to be required to do so."
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.723,2140.694,"So in our case, it must take into consideration in the proper case, as you say, the conduct of the licensee in the light of 504."
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2140.694,2146.627,"I don't mean... by proper case, I don't mean the case of one licensee as opposed to another licensee."
1982.81-298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2161.647,2164.88,"Mr. Alito, may I ask you a question about the particular problem that this case raises?"
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2187.323,2190.656,"Her claim was, she had two basic claims."
1982.81-298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2190.656,2193.938,"My specific question first is, where can I find it in the papers?"
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2197.031,2198.43,It is in the record of the case.
1982.81-298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2201.673,2203.025,--It is not in the appendix at all?
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2203.025,2203.536,"No, it's not."
1982.81-298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2203.536,2203.933,Oh.
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2205.055,2206.897,I believe she had two principal claims.
1982.81-298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2218.335,2220.496,Insufficient according to what standard?
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2220.496,2224.737,--Under the... Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.
1982.81-298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.341,2246.452,So she did get a hearing on the second charge she made?
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2246.452,2249.705,She certainly got an inquiry by the Commission into that charge.
1982.81-298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.241,2338.243,May I ask another question?
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2348.397,2353.412,--She alleged facts which she claimed constituted a violation.
1982.81-298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2353.412,2355.253,"Essentially, what facts did she allege?"
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2357.095,2367.181,"The specific allegation concerned when KCET began to broadcast the ABC captioned news, and the hour at which it was programmed."
1982.81-298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2375.466,2389.257,"And so, could it be said that by denying a hearing, that the FCC said... ruled, in effect, that those allegations, even if true, do not constitute a violation of that statute, or is it better to say they don't care whether it constitutes a violation of the statute?"
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2390.296,2392.409,"Your Honor, I don't believe it's either."
1982.81-298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2415.543,2419.937,That's like saying they don't care unless some other agency finds there to be a violation.
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2419.937,2421.708,"I wouldn't say they don't care, Your Honor."
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2432.724,2442.18,"So it is a... I asked you earlier in this argument, didn't they say, it is irrelevant until and unless some other agency decides there has been a violation?"
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2444.151,2448.315,It is true in that sense.
1982.81-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2454.69,2459.742,"Yes, because they felt that they were at least in line with Commission policy."
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2459.742,2465.326,They felt they were in line with the Commission policy of not imposing mandatory requirements at this time.
1982.81-298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2465.326,2473.141,"Insofar as 504 is concerned, isn't it a fairly orthodox application of primary jurisdiction on behalf of one agency for another?"
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2473.141,2474.302,"I believe it is, Your Honor."
1982.81-298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2486.139,2495.476,"Frequently in our opinions and questions we refer to the alleged expertise, the accumulated experience of these regulatory agencies."
1982.81-298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2514.237,2518.5,I believe the FCC's expertise is very relevant in this sense.
1982.81-298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2568.773,2583.514,Mr. Firestone.
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2583.514,2607.368,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I represent Sue Gottfried and the Greater Los Angeles Council on Deafness, who in turn represent the estimated five and a half to eighteen million severely hearing impaired people who have been subject to a history of discrimination generally and largely excluded from participation in and denied the benefits of our nation's pervasive and influential television system."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2615.945,2619.496,"The word... when you use the word ""discrimination"", what do you mean?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2619.496,2624.681,--Certainly that is a term of art with respect to--
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2624.681,2630.034,"Well, I am just wondering... it must be in your mind, so how is it defined in your mind?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2630.034,2644.523,"--I think in the case of 504, I think discrimination means failure to... indifference, exclusion, and failure to remove barriers that are at least reasonably accommodable."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2644.523,2650.928,You don't suggest it means purposeful discrimination because somebody can't hear?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2650.928,2658.773,"Well, I think that is part of the definition of discrimination as well, and certainly that--"
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.773,2661.374,Somebody is discriminating against them because they can't hear?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2661.374,2661.875,--No.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2661.875,2662.676,Is that what you are saying?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2662.676,2665.057,It is hard to believe that that would be the case.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2665.057,2666.52,"That isn't what you really mean, is it?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2666.52,2668.88,"No, although that--"
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.88,2672.591,You mean they are discriminating in the sense they don't have the same opportunity.
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2672.591,2678.785,"--Yes, they are denied equal access, more or less, and denied--"
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2678.785,2680.568,They are not provided equal access.
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2680.568,2682.899,--Not provided by reasonable accommodations.
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2711.276,2730.981,"Well, if this Court or any court, for example, which is open to the public does not provide amplifying equipment so that people who are hard of hearing either can't follow the proceedings or have great difficulty, is that a discrimination?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2730.981,2745.54,"Well, certainly you are not under any obligation, legal obligation, as is in this case, but I think that... and I would also preface by saying that the Court has been accommodating to--"
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2745.54,2746.59,Must it?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2747.341,2748.182,--Not under the law.
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2752.255,2752.843,Then--
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2752.843,2754.065,"--You mean, if the Court--"
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2754.065,2767.734,"--Do I understand your answer that it is not discriminatory not to provide caption, immediate translation of everything that is going on here for the benefit of the audience?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2767.734,2774.739,"--Actually, I am... I don't know if the Court is considered... you mean, under Section 504, or just generally discrimination?"
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2774.739,2775.819,"No, generally."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2781.532,2790.937,I think what is required is reasonable accommodation under the standard of Davis and other cases that have looked at what is discrimination against the disabled.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.069,2824.121,"Well, are we subject to 504?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2824.121,2825.132,I don't think so.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2825.132,2826.382,Why aren't we?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2826.382,2829.104,"I don't think you are defined as a federal agency, are you?"
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2832.525,2833.437,"Well, we are funded."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2834.628,2835.978,"Federally funded, but I don't think--"
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2835.978,2837.13,No one can cancel our license.
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2838.569,2839.24,--Right.
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2841.321,2844.053,And our license can't be cancelled by anyone.
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2844.053,2845.285,Right.
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2850.648,2854.561,"My hypothetical questions were put to you in your use of the word ""discrimination""."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2854.561,2855.671,Yes.
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2855.671,2859.664,Which is not limited to 504 or any other statute.
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2861.294,2874.483,"Right, and I think that I was somewhat careful not to only use the word ""discrimination"", but also use the other words of the statute, which say not to exclude from the benefits or deny participation."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2954.596,2967.683,"Suppose the Commission said, well, we are going to adopt a rule that we think 504 is a relevant matter for the public interest, and here is our rule, here is what stations must do."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2967.683,2968.734,--Yes.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2968.734,2990.711,"And then a station comes up for license renewal, and the Commission rules that the station is in perfect conformity with its rule, and denies a hearing on allegations that the station has not lived up to 504."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,2990.711,2995.752,"Well, in that case, then the rule was adopted pursuant to 504."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2999.696,3000.838,The action or the rule?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3000.838,3001.98,It has a rule.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3003.229,3005.141,"Yes, well, the rule could be subject to--"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3005.141,3008.633,"Yes, or presumably at the license renewal time, and that--"
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3008.633,3012.125,--You think the rule could be attacked at license renewal time?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3012.125,3026.285,"--I think that if the rule were an illegal rule, were found to be contrary to the law, I think that it could be attacked."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3032.677,3041.496,"Well, the Commission... I gather the Commission's argument is that it has done internally all that it thinks necessary under 504."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3041.496,3042.285,"--Well, the Commission--"
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3042.285,3046.258,And that it doesn't need to listen to anything else.
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3046.258,3051.331,"--No, the Commission has one grave omission, and that omission is 504."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3141.399,3169.529,"Let me ask you, suppose the funding agency had considered a complaint that this particular funded station hadn't lived up to its obligations under 504, and had decided that... had rejected the complaint, and said the station was living up to its obligations under 504, doing all that was reasonably necessary, and then the station came up for license renewal."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3171.9,3174.541,"I think so, certainly, because--"
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3174.541,3176.812,"You have to say that, I gather, don't you?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3176.812,3183.486,"--Well, I wouldn't have to say that, because in this case there was no reasonable expectation that another agency would act."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3185.208,3185.717,Why?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3185.717,3197.417,"Because the Commission was told, and it admitted that HEW, who they were deferring to, had no intention to act until Congress passed a law to decide which agency was the appropriate agency."
1982.81-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3202.19,3211.285,"Well, if Congress hasn't yet passed a law deciding which agency should be responsible, isn't that an indication of some go slow attitude on Congress's part--"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3211.285,3211.836,--No.
1982.81-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3211.836,3212.667,--until that law is passed?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3212.667,3212.725,No.
1982.81-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3232.64,3234.21,By whom?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3234.21,3243.426,"--Well, they were mainly looking for guidelines from the HEW, but they also specified that there was no specific enforcement mechanism in the statute."
1982.81-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3305.497,3316.063,But the Court of Appeals did hold that the agency was not entitled as a matter of its discretion to defer to the other agency which had primary responsibility for enforcing 504.
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3316.834,3317.375,Well--
1982.81-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3317.375,3318.835,"Is it correct, or not?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3318.835,3325.94,"--In this case, and they did say the special circumstances of this case, they said that deference... that they couldn't defer."
1982.81-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3327.52,3328.932,Was your answer yes or no?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3328.932,3330.911,--Yes.
1982.81-298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3361.043,3369.158,"Mr. Firestone, that makes me... I hate to interrupt you, and maybe I shouldn't, but I really want to be sure I understand the relief that you think your client is entitled to."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3375.992,3382.757,"Your Honor, in this case, had we won, it would simply be considered as a... we would go through a hearing."
1982.81-298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3382.757,3386.46,"Is that the relief that you requested, a denial of the license?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3386.46,3388.03,That's the extreme relief that is possible.
1982.81-298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3388.611,3390.061,"Well, is that what you requested?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3390.061,3396.446,"--I think that as a matter of law we put in, you petition to deny."
1982.81-298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3398.266,3399.739,"Well, if that isn't what you really wanted, what did you want?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3399.739,3403.722,We want access of programming for the deaf.
1982.81-298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3404.891,3409.436,"Do you want something specific with respect to this particular station, or do you want a general rule to apply to all stations?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3409.436,3415.037,"Your Honor, we would like to see... I'm stepping back from this case for a second."
1982.81-298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3419.219,3419.62,"Well, we have to decide a lawsuit, you know."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3419.62,3422.461,The Commission can choose whether it proceeds by rulemaking or adjudication.
1982.81-298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3422.461,3427.396,"Well, Judge McGowan said they ought to proceed by rulemaking, and therefore you should lose in this proceeding."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3427.396,3433.401,"Well, it would have been tremendous if the Commission had proceeded by rulemaking, but they specifically declined to adopt a rule."
1982.81-298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3442.287,3451.183,"But what is it... I still don't... I have... it is a very strange case for me, because the pleadings are not before us, and that is what we are arguing about, the sufficiency of your pleadings."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3454.973,3455.694,Yes.
1982.81-298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3455.694,3461.488,But is an objection to a license renewal an appropriate way to get the Commission to adopt a rule?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3463.328,3464.8,"Well, the Commission... what we want is a guideline."
1982.81-298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3467.342,3471.135,"Well, should they deny this applicant's license in order to give you a guideline?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3471.135,3480.041,"--No, I think the court recognized that the licensee would not lose its license, that in fact there are plenty of other sanctions that are available to the Commission in this area."
1982.81-298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3489.158,3492.978,"Did they treat this licensee any differently than any other licensee, according to your allegations?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3497.652,3509.97,"Well, we certainly allege that their refusal to carry the ABC captioned news, for example, or their refusal to put on the captioned version of... was indicative of an attitude of indifference, at the least."
1982.81-298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3509.97,3512.282,But is it unique to this station?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3512.282,3524.831,"Well, there were 118 stations around the country that were carrying the ABC captioned news when the Los Angeles station, where there may be the second most number of people who are deaf in the country, was not carrying this."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3544.853,3560.164,"Mr. Firestone, I take it your position is, and arguably it is correct, that the Commission ruled that considerations of 504 are irrelevant to the license renewal proceeding."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3561.504,3562.765,"--No, we--"
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3562.765,3564.516,"I mean, the Commission."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3566.69,3568.069,"--Yes, the Commission's... that's right."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3568.069,3584.661,"--that it is irrelevant, it is just beside the point, in which event they would say also if you asked them to make a rule that that is irrelevant, too, because it just... until somebody else does something, it is none of our business."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3584.661,3587.672,It seems to me that that is their attitude.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3600.53,3603.133,"If they won't make a rule, you want it by adjudication at an appropriate time."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3603.133,3604.143,--That's right.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3707.811,3728.555,Do you think the Commission in any manner short of rulemaking has ever communicated to any station what its preferments are with respect to the handicapped?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3730.966,3731.687,Yes.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3731.687,3743.165,"Well, are you aware that the Commission has ever taken any position with respect to communicating with the people who can't hear very well?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3743.165,3746.467,"The only thing that they did was, in 1970... I will go through it."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3758.203,3759.433,"They suggested it, didn't they?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3759.433,3760.915,They suggested some things.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3760.915,3764.839,And people knowledgeable in the business knew what the suggestions are.
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3764.839,3770.362,If they read the deaf captioning decision at 26 FCC 2nd 916 or whatever.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3770.362,3772.733,"Well, lawyers for stations usually do, don't they?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3772.733,3773.885,I would hope so.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3773.885,3774.626,Yes.
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3780.319,3783.04,"Well, the Commission has never... won't look at that question."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3783.04,3785.781,"I am asking you, not the Commission."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3785.781,3792.106,I think that they aren't in compliance with the suggestions.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3795.549,3801.052,"So this station has followed the lead of the Commission, is doing everything the Commission thought needed to be done."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3801.052,3802.913,"--No, it said that they had not."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3804.485,3807.337,This station has not done everything the Commission thought should be done?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3807.337,3812.39,--They have not done everything that the Commission suggested in the 1970 statement.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3812.39,3812.69,"Oh, they haven't?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3812.69,3813.321,They have not.
1982.81-298,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3847.593,3871.948,"I understood that the Commission had stated that it did encourage experimentation with technology by stations about this problem, and that it actually issued a warning that it would consider imposition of mandatory requirements if it determined in the future that the voluntary efforts were not satisfactory."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3873.378,3882.705,"They did when they adopted the Line 21 captioning, said that... at that time, they said it is still up to each individual licensee."
1982.81-298,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3892.552,3901.288,"Well, is what the Court of Appeals did here really to quarrel with the FCC's determination of public interest?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3901.288,3902.607,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-298,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3902.607,3903.739,What is in the public interest?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3903.739,3913.887,The Court of Appeals was extremely careful and extremely narrow in this decision to say in the special circumstances of this case the FCC must... cannot ignore the dictates of 504.
1982.81-298,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3929.936,3935.7,Has the FCC also required that all emergency messages be visually transmitted?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3935.7,3936.451,Yes.
1982.81-298,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3938.782,3950.221,"And it said that if the agency charged with primary enforcement of 504 determines there is a violation, it will take that into account?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3950.221,3965.289,"--Well, I don't think they could have taken it into account in this decision without actually proceeding with revocation action, because they did not condition the outcome of this proceeding on the outcome of any other proceedings in the government."
1982.81-298,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3965.289,3966.4,Mr. Firestone--
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3982.43,3990.616,"Your Honor, I think that they have to inquire into the good faith of the licensee as to how they were--"
1982.81-298,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3990.616,3991.896,How would they do that?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3991.896,3995.859,--I think that the... I suppose that if... first of all--
1982.81-298,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3995.859,3998.641,Can we get beyond supposing?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,3998.641,4002.795,"--Well, there are... the Commission has a variety of options that the court left open to them."
1982.81-298,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4032.823,4033.894,All you want is a hearing?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4033.894,4034.656,--That's right.
1982.81-298,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4036.185,4037.276,That is all you want?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4040.409,4041.838,"--Well, the Commission must be reasonable."
1982.81-298,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4043.541,4046.393,What do you want beyond a hearing?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4046.393,4048.223,"--Beyond the hearing, we would like guidelines."
1982.81-298,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4050.604,4055.008,You would get the guidelines on a hearing involving one station?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4055.008,4057.47,"--Well, the Commission has done this on numerous occasions."
1982.81-298,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4057.47,4058.461,You want rulemaking or not?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4058.461,4061.283,The Commission could defer... This is another possibility.
1982.81-298,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4062.382,4063.945,"Well, what do you want?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4063.945,4066.715,"I would like to see a rulemaking, but--"
1982.81-298,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4066.715,4068.285,You've got a ruling.
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4078.954,4079.723,--Pardon?
1982.81-298,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4079.723,4082.507,Where did you ask for relief?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4082.507,4086.508,In the petition before the Commission.
1982.81-298,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4086.508,4087.93,None of that is here.
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4087.93,4089.37,"It is not, Your Honor."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4089.37,4090.892,It is in the record.
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4090.892,4092.342,It is in the joint appendix of the D.C. Circuit.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4095.114,4098.106,"Isn't it in the record that has been lodged here, somewhere?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4098.106,4098.697,Yes.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4098.697,4099.708,It is not in the printed--
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4099.708,4101.859,It is not in the joint appendix.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4101.859,4103.602,"--It is in the record lodged here, isn't it?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4103.602,4104.31,It's in the record.
1982.81-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4122.312,4132.93,"Mr. Firestone, do you think it is crystal clear that this television station and the programming it presents is"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4138.146,4139.005,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4139.005,4144.22,"--and that it would have no defense to an action, say, if the appropriate agency brought it in court?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4144.22,4148.081,"Yes, Your Honor, and in fact this has been held by everyone who has looked at."
1982.81-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4148.081,4149.753,"What do you mean, held by everyone?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4149.753,4150.783,"Well, the District Court--"
1982.81-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4150.783,4152.245,Are some of them judges?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4152.245,4156.327,"--Yes, the District Court in Los Angeles held that they were subject to 504."
1982.81-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4189.318,4200.536,"Didn't the station make some defense in the Court of Appeals that it was not subject to this provision, that it had a statutory exemption from program control or something to that effect?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4200.536,4202.747,"Well, the Court of Appeals disposed of it in a footnote."
1982.81-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4203.338,4226.213,"Well, if we get back to your contention that all these things ought to be originally thrashed out before the FCC, does that really make much sense, if it is deciding a fairly complicated question of... wouldn't you want the agency charged with the statutory mandate whose administrative interpretation would be entitled to considerable weight to make those kind of determinations in the first place?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4226.213,4241.151,"Well, I don't see how the fact that the licensee got $5 million in federal money in 1977, and how they have gotten something like 30 percent of their money from federal subsidies can be a difficult question as to whether or not they are subject to 504."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4241.151,4254.271,Could you have just gone into a district court somewhere and sought to enjoin or to get an injunction against the station for violations of 504?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4254.271,4255.854,"Yes, there was an action."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4256.752,4258.064,"Well, there was such an action."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4258.854,4259.915,"No, the... well--"
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4259.915,4261.157,What was the result of the action?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4261.157,4268.8,--The result was that the court found that they couldn't... that there was no standard by any of these funding agencies.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4268.8,4272.493,"Didn't they say you should go to the funding agency, or not?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4272.493,4285.972,"It was the... actually, the licensee in that decision, and that is, I think, at Page 149 of the joint appendix that you have, argued that there was primary jurisdiction in the FCC."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4289.014,4291.465,"Did you lose, or what happened?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4291.465,4293.298,It is on appeal in the Ninth Circuit.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4293.298,4297.139,"Well, you lost in the district court on the grounds that that was the wrong place to go?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4297.139,4298.741,"No, no."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4308.985,4311.048,No standards issued by the funding agency.
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4311.048,4314.649,"--By the funding agencies, and they included the Federal Communications Commission."
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4314.649,4326.407,"Now, this Court has said countless times, and other courts have, that these regulatory agencies have broad, very broad discretion as to what they will weigh and take into account."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4347.791,4350.373,"Yes, Your Honor, and that's exactly what happened in this case."
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4350.373,4353.204,And you suggest there is an abuse of discretion here on the part of the agency?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4353.204,4353.695,Yes.
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4373.939,4387.679,"An abuse of discretion on the Commission's part because it decided to defer to an agency which has a life or death control over a public television station, life or death control by virtue of the grants."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4387.679,4392.33,"--Well, the agencies that they deferred to do not have life and death control."
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4394.911,4402.408,"Don't you think the grants have a lot to do... perhaps life and death isn't quite it, but they can shut off the supply of blood, can't they?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4402.408,4411.795,"--They can, and that would be an extreme remedy which we frankly would not like to see, but the... because we would like to see public... we don't want to hurt public broadcasting."
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4420.801,4425.803,But the grant agency doesn't always just inflict a death blow right away.
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4435.049,4435.58,Okay.
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4435.58,4438.592,Isn't that the real control over this problem?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4438.592,4440.893,"No, Your Honor, it isn't, quite honestly."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4440.893,4444.975,"Well, 504, though, isn't a commerce power regulation."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4446.978,4448.838,"Yes, but it is still aimed at--"
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4448.838,4451.87,And it only affects people who get federal money.
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4451.87,4454.292,"--That's right, which is this licensee."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4454.292,4466.229,"It is not a general regulation that people who communicate over the airways that are granted, that are licensed through a public authority are subject to this regulation."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4468.58,4469.361,That's right.
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4469.361,4474.024,"What kind of an agency, or what kind of a licensee do we have here?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4475.405,4476.117,Yes.
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4476.117,4477.168,"Well, then--"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4477.168,4480.029,A licensee who received money from the federal government.
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4480.029,4480.267,--Yes.
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4480.267,4481.148,"However, some of the--"
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4481.148,4487.022,"And if they don't play ball according to the views of that agency, they aren't going to get any more money."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4488.763,4493.768,--Perhaps that would be the extreme repercussion.
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4493.768,4496.279,Isn't that the statutory scheme?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4496.279,4516.381,"Your Honor, and I would really like to go to the statutory scheme, which contemplates not only that these factors would be enforced at the individual funding agencies, and by the way, they get most of their funds from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which cannot in fact enforce this statute."
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4594.425,4598.326,Wasn't that issue settled in United Church of Christ against WLBT?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4598.326,4602.13,"That's right, and the Commission had an obligation to--"
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4602.13,4607.152,"That was a clear case of discrimination on the basis of race, was it not?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4607.152,4610.605,--But the Commission is saying that if there is another agency... that's exactly what this case is about.
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4628.687,4634.591,"But in the United Church of Christ case, it was 50 or 60 percent of the audience that was being discriminated against."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4639.145,4644.489,"Your Honor, the percentage is in single figures, I think."
1982.81-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4834.451,4839.005,"In that case, the Commission should take into consideration the antitrust laws on its own motion?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4841.817,4857.077,"--They weren't, but there are other cases where Courts of Appeals have required, and the Supreme Court, required that they take into account the... such as the Southern Steamship case that I was referring to a minute ago."
1982.81-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4857.077,4859.629,"That was the National Labor Relations Board, wasn't it?"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4859.629,4862.71,"Yes, but the principle is the same."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4882.716,4890.49,So you say that the FCC must take into account any clearly defined federal policy expressed in a statute?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4911.273,4917.458,It is wrong if the statute that they are excluding relates to the underlying values of the Communications Act.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4917.458,4921.311,"Well, may they exclude any statute that has some relevance to the--"
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4921.311,4923.933,May they exclude any statute that has relevance?
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4923.933,4925.014,--from consideration of the public interest?
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4934.449,4944.866,"They... I would first preface this by saying that that is... this case... that is broader than what this case holds, and it is broader than the NAACP versus Federal Power Commission."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4944.866,4956.183,"Yes, but surely the Court of Appeals imposed ingredients of the public interest that the Communcations Commission rejected."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4964.248,4970.422,Because the Commission abused its discretion by failing to consider this relevant factor which they agree is relevant.
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5006.256,5037.555,"Well, suppose the Commission had undertaken a rulemaking proceeding about this subject, and the submissions were so confusing and the technology in such a state of flux that they declined to issue any rule, that it just wasn't timely to issue a rule right now, and then the next day this submission is made, that the license should be denied because of failure to live up to 504."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,5044.961,5051.246,"Well, I think what they would have to do is at least look at the allegations."
1982.81-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5051.246,5056.369,"Well, they did look at the allegations, and they said, we don't want to have another hearing, we just decided that it isn't time to have a decision."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,5056.369,5062.994,"No, what they did was, they looked at those allegations in consideration of another factor."
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5106.242,5107.003,"Your time has expired now, counsel."
1982.81-298,2,18926,charles_m_firestone,,5107.003,5108.431,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1982.81-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5108.431,5110.502,Mr. Czarra.
1982.81-298,3,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,5110.502,5126.724,"Justice Stevens, the Respondents here asked the FCC to deny KCET's license because it was not broadcasting with open captions all of its programs."
1982.81-298,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5133.679,5138.953,Does the record tell us whether any station uses captioning in all its programs?
1982.81-298,3,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,5138.953,5157.305,"--The record, I think, does not show that, Your Honor, but the point is, Justice White, that KCET did everything that the FCC had said in its policy statements it was going to require."
1982.81-298,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5157.305,5159.075,Your colleague denied that.
1982.81-298,3,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,5159.075,5160.637,He is incorrect.
1982.81-298,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5160.637,5161.827,Is that in the record?
1982.81-298,3,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,5161.827,5163.109,It is in the record.
1982.81-298,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5163.109,5167.02,That it complied with everything the FCC had suggested stations ought to do?
1982.81-298,3,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,5167.02,5171.905,The only thing the FCC said it was going to require stations to do--
1982.81-298,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5171.905,5173.515,"Well, suggest, suggest."
1982.81-298,3,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,5173.515,5174.296,"--Well, all right."
1982.81-298,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5180.731,5182.15,How about suggest?
1982.81-298,3,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,5182.15,5193.657,"The suggestions were that the faces of newscasters be present on the screen, that scores of games be given visually."
1982.81-298,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5196.95,5199.33,"You mean, not even scores?"
1982.81-298,3,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,5199.33,5200.261,I think not.
1982.81-298,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5204.205,5209.778,"They would violate their license if they broadcast one, I suppose."
1982.81-298,3,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,5209.778,5215.062,"No, the question, I guess, is, would they violate their license if they didn't broadcast one."
1982.81-298,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5215.062,5215.933,"If they didn't, okay."
1982.81-298,3,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,5215.933,5230.024,"After a day and a half of trial in federal district court in California, the judge dismissed the complaint against KCET, the complaint of discrimination, on the ground that there had been no proof of discrimination."
1982.81-298,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5235.648,5238.058,"Well, you can certainly finish your--"
1982.81-298,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5238.058,5239.18,Finish your sentence.
1982.81-298,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5239.18,5240.72,--Finish your answer to my question.
1982.81-298,3,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,5240.72,5242.172,"Well, I was going to another point."
1982.81-298,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5243.053,5244.974,"Well, not quite."
1982.81-298,3,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,5248.065,5249.035,Wonderful.
1982.81-298,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5249.035,5261.194,"Did the court find, or has anybody found, or is it just your assertion, that the station had lived up to every suggestion that the FCC had made about taking care of the handicapped?"
1982.81-298,3,22140,edgar_f_czarra_jr,,5261.194,5281.876,"The only express suggestions were the ones that I enumerated, emergency bulletins, focusing on the face of people so that lipreading would be permissible, and giving scores in writing."
1982.81-298,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5281.876,5284.62,"Thank you, gentlemen."
