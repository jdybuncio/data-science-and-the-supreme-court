1987.87-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.622,"We will hear arguments next in Bendix Autolite Coproration versus Midwesco Enterprises, Inc.--"
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,13.324,25.881,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the appellant in this lawsuit is Bendix Autolite Corporation."
1987.87-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,95.212,108.602,You say then that the Ohio tolling statute should have been allowed to be applied by the Ohio courts and therefore it would not have run against you in your action against Midwesco?
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,108.602,109.221,Precisely so.
1987.87-367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,170.693,175.429,"Well, it also... it just doesn't benefit Ohio citizens, does it?"
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,177.531,178.431,"No, just--"
1987.87-367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,178.431,180.317,--Anybody who sues in Ohio.
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,180.317,182.1,--Certainly that would follow.
1987.87-367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,183.185,184.169,All right.
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,184.169,194.827,The statute here in question is virtually identical to a particular New Jersey statute which this Court reviewed in the Searle case.
1987.87-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,253.497,254.531,Mr. Crowley--
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,254.531,255.465,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.465,275.445,"--if the only way to satisfy the requirement of Ohio's statute is for the foreign company to come in and actual register to do business for all purposes, do you concede that it would fail under the commerce clause?"
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,275.445,276.695,"No, we don't at all concede."
1987.87-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,283.635,288.003,I guess you didn't hear my question then or maybe I misstated it.
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,288.003,288.57,--Forgive me.
1987.87-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.57,303.43,"If the only way of complying with the Ohio statute is to register for all purposes, do you concede that the commerce clause burden would be such that the statute would fail?"
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,303.43,316.272,"No, and I understand Your Honor's question, and it is a little hard to reckon with the question if that was the only way of complying."
1987.87-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,320.641,322.343,We will get to that in a minute.
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,335.501,343.174,"What it is not, Justice O'Connor, what it is not is a forced licensure statute."
1987.87-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.872,369.657,I'm not sure I'm following you.
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,382.815,384.0,"No, we do not so concede."
1987.87-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,384.0,386.633,I thought that's what you just said.
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,386.633,387.285,No.
1987.87-367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,393.606,395.156,In order to do what?
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,395.156,419.84,"--In order to seriously expect to do business in the state, as, for example, in the Allenberg Cotton case, where there is a familiar kind of statute arid where the situation is such that you are under that statute denied access to the courts of the state unless and until you qualify to do business, and they are describing business which is of an interstate character."
1987.87-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,432.981,434.949,"Well, I thought that was my question exactly."
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,434.949,437.135,"--Well, I had difficulty with--"
1987.87-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,437.135,444.372,And I have different responses from you now to Justice Scalia and to me and I don't know what your position is.
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,444.372,451.526,"--I am putting it badly, but I understand our position and I am going to try once again to explain it."
1987.87-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,472.122,478.026,"Well, here the consequence is simply that the statute of limitations is not tolled."
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,478.026,480.545,"--Yes, exactly, and we don't think that that is sufficiently coercive."
1987.87-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,480.545,482.164,You think that is different somehow.
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,482.164,483.68,It most assuredly is different.
1987.87-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,522.722,538.315,"Now, the courts below in this case apparently did not find that the statute, the tolling statute would be met by a provision in the contract."
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,538.315,549.457,We are puzzled and to some extent confounded by what the reasoning of the Circuit Court was in that regard.
1987.87-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,558.562,562.53,But they said that didn't answer the question.
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,562.53,567.251,"--Yes, and we are at a loss to know just what they meant by that."
1987.87-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,579.559,584.63,How are we to know what the state law is on that subject?
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,584.63,602.924,"--I think there is nothing in the statute itself which even refers to licensure, so all that can be said of licensure is that it is one means of appointing an agent for the service of process."
1987.87-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,638.597,644.918,"He has to be an agent for service in all matters, not just in the particular contract."
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,644.918,647.97,"No, there is nothing in the statute to suggest that that would be the case."
1987.87-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,651.422,652.274,That would do it.
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,652.274,653.49,--that should be in all respects sufficient.
1987.87-367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,694.267,699.303,"Tell me, what is the case that holds that would have been a sufficient answer?"
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,699.303,709.527,"It is a particular Virginia District Court opinion, and it is quoted in our brief."
1987.87-367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,709.527,712.979,A Virginia case?
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,712.979,713.613,Yes.
1987.87-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,713.613,716.114,Nothing from this State of Ohio?
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,716.114,722.601,"No, but it is not talking about a particular statute, it is just talking about, in general about the designation of agents."
1987.87-367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,724.12,727.738,"The Ohio statute hasn't been construed on this point, though, has it?"
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,727.738,728.638,--Forgive me.
1987.87-367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,728.638,731.79,The Ohio statute has not been construed on this point.
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,735.011,749.252,"I think there are Ohio decisions that confirm that if a corporation has an agent present within the state, that that makes it present within the state for purposes of the tolling statute."
1987.87-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,759.626,780.39,"That is something of a burden, to have a general corporation resident for... what you are saying is, you have to agree in order to get the benefit of the... or not to be... not to have the burden of the tolling statute you have to have a resident there for all purposes and be sued by anybody who wants to sue you in that state."
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,781.323,783.659,If that were the fact that would be a substantial burden.
1987.87-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,783.659,790.496,"No, but those are the only cases that you have in Ohio that talk about a general agent for service, right?"
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,790.496,812.178,"I don't understand that the cases we have in mind establish whether it is general or specific, and I can't imagine any reason why a narrow and specific appointment, if indeed it is a real appointment, should be any the less efficacious as regards the particular claim to which it is addressed."
1987.87-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,854.805,861.961,But isn't one proviso of the Allenberg holding that the company has to be engaged only in interstate commerce?
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,861.961,863.077,"--Oh, very much so."
1987.87-367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1091.592,1096.377,Do you also rely on his dissent in the Allenberg Cotton case?
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1096.377,1100.864,"--No, I don't think--"
1987.87-367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.864,1102.181,You don't.
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1102.181,1134.002,"--It occurs to us, it occurs to us that this case may be a fitting occasion for the Court saying that there is a burden that is so slight, so speculative, so insubstantial that it shouldn't ever be subjected to hostile scrutiny either under the so-called per se test or the balancing test, and this would be an occasion for that, but to reach the result we want we certainly don't have to go that far, and certainly don't have to reverse Allenberg Cotton."
1987.87-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1188.589,1205.431,"Mr. Crowley, I have a special concern about whether this statute is discriminatory in the sense that it is peculiarly directed against out of state companies or against interstate business."
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1207.383,1209.835,It most assuredly is not.
1987.87-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1209.835,1225.762,"You could be, I take it, a domestic company in that state or could have been at the time of the alleged tort and then if you move your company elsewhere you would still be liable."
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1225.762,1227.047,Absolutely.
1987.87-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1227.047,1227.98,The tolling statute would apply.
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1230.082,1230.699,Absolutely.
1987.87-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.699,1236.986,"--if you were a private citizen and didn't even move your residence but... well, I guess you could be served at your residence, I don't know."
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1241.889,1256.733,"I take it that it would, and the case seemed... the Ohio cases seemed to indicate that where there is a sojourn of substantial length out of the state, that the tolling does apply."
1987.87-367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.274,1301.178,Do you suppose there is any burden in the problem of having to negotiate the appropriate period of limitations in a contract?
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1304.714,1308.082,I don't understand that any such negotiations would be necessary at all.
1987.87-367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1311.801,1317.605,"Yes, but supposing the Ohio company said, we want the benefit of the existing statute."
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1319.974,1345.957,"I think we have sort of anticipated that question, first of all, that that would be a puzzling response for the other company to make, because presumably they benefit from having an in-state agent on whom they can effect the service, so it would be puzzling to see them resist it, but if they did, arbitrarily or whatever, the other company simply writes them a letter unilaterally designating, saying, if you have any quarrel with this contract, any claim, we have appointed somebody our agent, he is in the City of Cleveland, and here is where you can find him."
1987.87-367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1345.957,1347.993,And how long will he be there?
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1347.993,1349.409,I think that is a sufficient answer to the whole of it.
1987.87-367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1361.467,1368.387,"Well, that may be... if you make a contract, that may be right, but what about product liability?"
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1368.387,1370.756,This--
1987.87-367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1370.756,1377.762,You don't write around to somebody who gets hurt by one of your products.
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1377.762,1397.907,"--Well, that is a distinguishable case, not the case presented here, but we are indebted to Judge Potter in the District Court in Toledo for making the suggestion in oral argument that it might be perfectly feasible for a company to designate an agent on the product itself, and that is not an issue we are raising here--"
1987.87-367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1397.907,1409.547,Does Ohio have any formal mechanism by which you may appoint an agent for service of process in the state without qualifying to do business?
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1409.547,1423.541,"--That is the... what I was starting to explore, talking about the correspondence that is in the record that was exchanged with the Ohio Secretary of State's office, and there are two letters."
1987.87-367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.278,1462.432,Does this statute have to either stand up or fall in one piece?
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1471.204,1474.656,"--The answer to the question, put in those terms, is, assuredly not."
1987.87-367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1490.115,1496.403,"The operative considerations are those where there is no agent been appointed, right?"
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1496.403,1497.938,"--Forgive me, Justice--"
1987.87-367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1497.938,1502.323,"One of the operative considerations that we find is, there was no agent appointed in Ohio."
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1502.323,1504.675,"--Yes, and that argument is made."
1987.87-367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1504.675,1505.711,There could have been.
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1505.711,1506.994,There could have been.
1987.87-367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1506.994,1508.996,That is your answer.
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1508.996,1516.583,"And if there is a remaining burden, it is because they didn't make the designations, not because of any infirmity in the statute, is our answer."
1987.87-367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1581.509,1588.115,"If you represent plaintiffs, I don't imagine you explained that operative principle to them, that we are not going to get to your work any sooner than we have to."
1987.87-367,0,37043,noel_c_crowley,,1588.115,1592.567,--I hope I didn't pay attention to the lesson and don't observe it.
1987.87-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1687.544,1689.23,"Thank you, Mr. Crowley."
1987.87-367,1,28482,ira_j_bornstein,,1691.163,1706.442,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it Please the Court, as counsel indicated, the issue before this Court is very simply whether or not the Ohio tolling statute is what has been construed as a forced licensure provision."
1987.87-367,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1785.192,1790.346,"Well, that isn't exactly what the Court of Appeals said in its opinion, is it?"
1987.87-367,1,28482,ira_j_bornstein,,1804.021,1807.407,"I agree, and I believe what the court said is incorrect."
1987.87-367,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1811.875,1818.096,"Well, do you want us then to say the Sixth Circuit was just wrong on that as a matter of Ohio law?"
1987.87-367,1,28482,ira_j_bornstein,,1818.096,1820.381,"--Well, what the Sixth Circuit said is that they could have put their provision in there."
1987.87-367,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1847.967,1855.954,"Well, the answer to the question, though, seems to me to affect the extent of the burden on interstate commerce."
1987.87-367,1,28482,ira_j_bornstein,,1861.442,1864.108,"If it can be done that easily, it would be less of a burden."
1987.87-367,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1864.108,1865.81,And it would be helpful to know.
1987.87-367,1,28482,ira_j_bornstein,,1865.81,1867.679,It would be helpful to know.
1987.87-367,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1867.679,1873.833,So are we stuck just as we were in the Searle case with not knowing and having to send it back?
1987.87-367,1,28482,ira_j_bornstein,,1873.833,1903.352,"No, I don't believe we are, because in Searle the reason that they were stuck was there was what was considered to be a footnote in the Velmohos case which seemed to indicate that possibly there were other means in which it could be done, and in fact after remand, and Coons turned out to be the culmination of Searle, the Supreme Court of New Jersey found there was no other way, and in fact the same argument that there could have been some type of contractual provision was raised in Coons, and the New Jersey Supreme Court said it can't be done."
1987.87-367,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1903.352,1905.385,"Well, that was New Jersey, not Ohio."
1987.87-367,1,28482,ira_j_bornstein,,1905.385,1910.923,"That's correct, but Ohio has the same type of Foreign Corporation Act, almost identical."
1987.87-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1910.923,1916.76,"But, Mr. Bornstein, in that passage from the Sixth Circuit's opinion they say two arguments are made."
1987.87-367,1,28482,ira_j_bornstein,,1942.594,1943.61,"Well, I don't believe so."
1987.87-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1961.891,1968.794,"Well, they certainly didn't use your argument in dealing with the question at all, did they?"
1987.87-367,1,28482,ira_j_bornstein,,1968.794,1972.079,They did not make any statement in there one way or the other.
