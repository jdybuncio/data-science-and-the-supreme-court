1969.55,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,19.235,"Number 55, Wade against Wilson and others."
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,23.037,27.316,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1969.55,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,69.337,91.369,"Now, I may have missed it in the record and parts of the appendix which are here, but is there an explanation for why this could not have been obtained for the use of this petitioner by the ordinary courtesies and amenities as between and among lawyers?"
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,91.369,95.659,"I don't know that there was any separate lawyer appointed at that time, Your Honor."
1969.55,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,105.826,115.233,But we don't -- so we have nothing in this record to show whether he made any efforts or if so what efforts he made to get the transcript that had already been certified?
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,115.233,115.83,That's correct.
1969.55,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,176.948,189.261,With -- the California courts have had the -- do they have the power to order the codefendant to surrender his copy of the transcript for use by your petitioner?
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,189.261,199.187,"I would assume they do under rule ten by direction of the court they could've made it available, but they have taken no action to do that."
1969.55,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,199.187,205.553,And you -- do you know whether any effort was made to get them to exercise the rules and power?
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,205.553,207.503,"I do not, Your Honor."
1969.55,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,207.503,213.35,"Is it -- while I have you interrupted, is it a substantial record if you know?"
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,213.35,219.177,"I have looked at the record myself, just briefly perused at -- had it sent up from Los Angeles to San Francisco."
1969.55,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,240.849,243.981,Or about $25 for the Xerox equipment?
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,243.981,249.778,Right it would be substantially less than commercial rates.
1969.55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,473.425,479.519,"Mr. Small, is it the problem here, I'm looking at that footnote, the Court of Appeals submitted."
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,485.734,487.358,I really do not think so.
1969.55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,487.358,490.586,There is a suggestion that you might have a good interest point?
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,490.586,491.512,Yes.
1969.55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,502.292,506.296,"You don't think -- in other words, is there anything in that which precludes or which he emerged, the issue?"
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,506.296,506.721,No sir.
1969.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,515.609,522.99,You don't think any particular showing is necessary to prejudice in a particular case?
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,540.116,543.959,I'm really not prepared to make that contention.
1969.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,561.623,568.741,"Well, do you rely at all on the unavailability of the transcript, to prepare a petition for rehearing?"
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,568.741,571.017,"Yes, I do."
1969.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,591.521,597.213,"Well, assume you win -- why -- what do you want to win for, so you can get another appeal?"
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,597.213,616.812,"That would be -- I think the ultimate result of your primary -- first off, I think that the man is entitled to a copy of this transcript so that he can at least -- at the very least, at the minimum, he should at least have a copy of his transcript so that he can examine it and prepare its basis for collateral attack."
1969.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.05,646.244,Have -- has this Court ever held that a state must furnish a transcript in order to prepare a petition for collateral relief?
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,646.244,647.262,Not specifically.
1969.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,679.511,681.058,"That was the state habeas, wasn't it Mr. Small?"
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,681.058,682.944,"That was state habeas, that's correct."
1969.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,682.944,688.675,But is there a right to counsel to prepare a habeas corpus petition?
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,688.675,705.603,"No, not necessarily and of course that's a point that we make in our brief that you can draw a legitimate distinction between right to counsel where a man made -- file repeated habeas corpus petitions which may or may not be meritorious and the right to a transcript which you need only once."
1969.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.603,710.465,"Well, is that -- on what provision of the constitution do you rely on?"
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,710.465,714.859,"The Fourteenth Amendment, violation of the equal protection and due process."
1969.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,714.859,715.963,Equal protection?
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,715.963,718.15,Equal protection.
1969.55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,719.677,723.474,That's because (Inaudible) ending up tried jointly.
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,723.474,723.957,That's right.
1969.55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,723.957,725.274,He would be entitled?
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,725.274,725.856,That's correct.
1969.55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,725.856,731.078,"Because he was tried jointly and the other chap was supposed to get a transcript, the rules denied him of it?"
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,731.078,733.531,"That's right, that he has none of his own and carrying that --"
1969.55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,733.531,737.991,"That's the only basis, is it, of your equal protection argument?"
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,737.991,751.012,"Well, I think you could carry it up a step further and say that there are other examples of how he was discriminated against, including on collateral attack."
1969.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,760.178,764.915,"But on that basis, it carry the right to counsel too, wouldn't it?"
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,764.915,768.857,"Not necessarily, not necessarily."
1969.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,768.857,771.391,Almost necessarily.
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,771.391,777.446,"I wouldn't want to have to advance that argument here, in this particular proceeding but simply the right to the transcript."
1969.55,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,777.446,786.844,"How does California decide which of the three or four or five defendants, codefendants gets the first shot at the transcript?"
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,786.844,788.709,I only wish I knew Your Honor.
1969.55,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,795.715,804.009,Then for all we know it may have been made available to all of them and each of them collectively?
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,804.009,829.263,"Well, I'm a little reluctant to speak from my own personal perusal of the transcript as what apparently happened and since it's not of record in the case, but on the facts that were alleged in the habeas petition here, which haven't been denied, petitioner Wade never saw a copy of his transcript, never had it available."
1969.55,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,963.885,966.768,What stage did you come in to the case counsel?
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,966.768,972.871,In connection with the preparation of the brief on the merits in this Court.
1969.55,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,972.871,973.905,And you were appointed by this Court?
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,973.905,976.574,I was appointed by this Court for the purpose of this case.
1969.55,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,976.574,995.672,"I'm not sure that its relevant at all and please don't assume I'm suggesting any criticism by the question, but I wonder if you made any effort to consider getting an order to show cause on the codefendant or other processes to get that transcript before you came all the way here?"
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,995.672,996.902,No sir.
1969.55,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1003.085,1004.124,Of course I recognize that.
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,1005.733,1011.583,Yes sir.
1969.55,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1161.837,1164.786,"Very well, Mr. Small."
1969.55,0,36748,marshall_l_small,,1164.786,1168.557,Thank you.
1969.55,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1168.557,1170.127,Mr. Murphy?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1170.127,1173.687,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.55,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1305.823,1306.714,Excuse me Mr. Murphy?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1306.714,1308.434,Yes.
1969.55,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1308.434,1312.806,Are you trying to say that he already had (Ianudible) daily transcript?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1312.806,1316.081,"Yes Your Honor, this was a capital case."
1969.55,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1317.714,1320.248,"And -- at -- was on appeal, first appeal."
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1320.248,1321.015,Yes Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1321.015,1323.431,This is the compulsory (Inaudible)
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1323.431,1326.779,"No Your Honor, it was not a compulsory or automatic appeal because like --"
1969.55,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1326.779,1331.34,"But he then -- he had a complete transcript for the purposes of that appeal, did he?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1331.34,1341.178,"Yes Your Honor, not personal possession, the record doesn't disclose that he had a personal possession of the trial transcript."
1969.55,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1349.836,1353.178,"This is still something on how you been tried, and just to of them?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1353.178,1354.45,"Yes Your Honor, codefendants."
1969.55,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1354.45,1356.239,But there was only a single transcript?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1356.239,1356.919,Yes Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1356.919,1359.057,"I see, a single daily transcript?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1359.057,1360.38,Yes Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1360.38,1360.584,Available --
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1360.584,1369.358,That is -- I can make that representation of fact that there was but a single daily transcript appeared.
1969.55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1369.358,1373.034,Mr. Murphy what do you mean by access?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1381.542,1383.449,"Well, let me -- before I answer that question."
1969.55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1383.449,1383.476,Okay.
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1383.476,1386.339,Let me premise your question Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1492.934,1494.046,May I ask your --
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1494.046,1494.591,Yes Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1494.591,1505.515,"-- state, the method California use this when they have three or four defendants to make a copy of your evidence available to all of them?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1510.681,1511.455,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1561.793,1567.619,How does the state draw about fulfilling this obligation?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1567.619,1575.135,I can't speak with any -- any more than the general familiarity.
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1601.724,1609.04,"You mean the state has nothing to do with it but just leave it up to the different defendant, if you get from another defendant?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1609.04,1630.634,"You Honor, if there was any complain, if every appointed attorney had a complaint that a transcript was not available to him to prepare a brief on appeal, all the attorney would have to do under the rules of court would bring this to the attention of the court and the court will take the necessary action --"
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1630.634,1631.021,What action?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1631.021,1644.477,"-- to either to reproduce, say a copy of the Court's transcript for the -- whether the co-appellant to furnish his copy to the appellant who does not have a copy."
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1644.477,1651.063,"So, you are saying is -- in preparing his brief, or use in preparing his brief?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1651.063,1652.604,"Yes Your Honor, in use for his brief."
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1652.604,1666.672,"Whether it's yes as to whether the state will furnish each individual defendant with a complete transcript of the record, is that what it is?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1666.672,1670.614,What the state furnishes is access to the record.
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1705.177,1720.954,"But have we ever held that where there are more than one defendant, the state is under an obligation, and they're all indigent, the state is under an obligation to file a complete transcript with each one?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1720.954,1724.045,That during the appellate process Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1724.045,1724.094,What?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1724.094,1729.768,The state would be under an obligation to furnish the appellate attorney or the appellant in pro per --
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1729.768,1736.169,But have we held -- has there been any in a case which either raised this question or decided the question --
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1736.169,1736.533,No Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1736.533,1741.981,"-- whether there are four or five defendant, the state has to supply four or five transcripts?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1741.981,1748.847,"No Your Honor, no case in California nor is there any federal case."
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1810.212,1827.403,In your view -- your argument then that the state is not compelled to provide a transcript for collateral attacks only during the time that matter can be held on the appellate process?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1827.403,1827.59,Yes Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1827.59,1830.076,"From the original judgment, is that to -- what you're arguing?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1830.076,1831.926,"Yes, yes Your Honor."
1969.55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1901.14,1902.2,Mr. Murphy.
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1902.2,1902.29,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1902.29,1909.772,"Do I understand you that this transcript, there is one that he had on appeal is still available some place?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1909.772,1910.672,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1919.412,1924.033,"Well, is -- I understood you to say, you gave him one when he went up on appeal."
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1924.033,1925.338,"No, Your Honor."
1969.55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1943.691,1950.504,"What I'm trying to get to, is there more than one copy of this transcript available as of this moment?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1950.504,1951.552,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1951.552,1954.59,"Well, why not give it to him?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1954.59,1957.092,"Well, Your Honor we are involved here --"
1969.55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1957.092,1960.215,"I mean, you don't need the one, do you?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,1960.215,1963.477,"Your Honor, we're involved here with a very broad issue."
1969.55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2059.764,2065.882,"I understand all of that, but I don't see the need for the Xerox copies."
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2079.911,2100.503,"Well, I don't know the exact number of copies, but under the rule of court, there would be an original which would've gone to the appellate court and there would've been three copies because this was a capital case, the District Attorney would've received the copy and the Attorney General would've received the copy."
1969.55,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2199.783,2200.852,Mr. Murphy.
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2200.852,2201.343,Yes Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2201.343,2211.399,It seems to me that you and your brother counsel are -- differ a little bit as to what is the issue in this case.
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2235.815,2236.21,Yes Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2236.766,2251.205,"And that the only -- thus you can eat can the defendant be tried jointly be equated and give an equal protection with the defendant who is tried individually and singly, that's the way he posts the issue before us."
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2300.77,2301.384,Yes Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2305.28,2307.156,But would you -- am I right (Voice Overlap) --
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2307.156,2307.816,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.55,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2344.647,2346.177,Or the content of it?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2346.177,2349.611,The content of the transcript would be immaterial.
1969.55,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2370.716,2371.21,But which point?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2371.21,2372.346,But the District Court --
1969.55,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2372.346,2373.376,Which point?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2373.376,2380.536,If you're raising the point that there -- the -- there are some invidious discrimination in providing an individual --
1969.55,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2380.536,2382.238,"Yes, I understand that point."
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2382.238,2387.641,-- defendant with the transcript in requiring codefendants to share a transcript.
1969.55,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2451.366,2459.206,"Seven or eight years after the affirmance of his conviction on direct appeal at which his counsel did have access to a transcript, is that correct?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2459.206,2460.656,Yes Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2460.656,2475.278,Did anyone ask the District judge here to direct a copy of the transcript be made either from the codefendant or from some other person having custody.
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2475.278,2477.646,Not to my knowledge Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2477.646,2479.609,The record doesn't show anything of that (Voice Overlap) --
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2479.609,2483.752,The record discloses these alleged facts.
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2508.821,2511.692,Wasn't that copy available in the court?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2511.692,2513.393,Yes Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2515.718,2517.419,And was he indigent?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2517.419,2519.94,"Yes Your Honor, he was indigent."
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2519.94,2520.532,There was a copy in the --
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2520.532,2522.181,The allegation is that he was indigent.
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2522.181,2525.195,And he asked to see a copy?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2525.195,2528.691,"He asked for a copy Your Honor, not to see a copy, asked for a copy."
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2528.691,2534.769,And is that the only issue between them whether you give it to him or whether you'll let him have a -- have it available?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2534.769,2536.291,No Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2562.473,2567.642,"You had it there looking at from a practical standpoint, the courts had it?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2567.642,2569.442,"Well, Your Honor --"
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2569.442,2569.807,What --
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2569.807,2570.225,I don't think this --
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2570.225,2574.454,What harm would it do the court to let him see it?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2574.454,2585.864,What harm would it do Your Honor in reply to -- provide him with an attorney or to provide with a team of investigators or provide him with some experts.
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2591.237,2606.816,(Voice Overlap)-- but we have said that a man who is indigent is entitled to get -- to have said as nearly as possible in the status of the man who would have money to pay for a record.
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2619.484,2628.091,"The court would've made it available to him if he could have arranged for the reproduction of the record, that's what the facts of this case disclose."
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2628.091,2630.072,If -- who could arrange them?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2630.072,2630.733,Pardon me Your Honor?
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2630.733,2632.529,If who could arrange for the reproduction of the --
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2632.529,2634.657,If the petitioner himself --
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2634.657,2638.041,"Well that means if he didn't have the money to do it, he just couldn't do it."
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2638.041,2649.22,"Your Honor if he had had the money, he could have to be candid with the court, he could have had a copy of the record, but that's not the question before the court, I think --"
1969.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2649.22,2652.165,It seems to be the question to me from what you tell me?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2652.165,2658.632,"Well, Your Honor, here is how I would pose the question."
1969.55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2697.047,2697.618,What is the --
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2697.618,2703.096,-- of providing a transcript for any indigent who request a copy of it.
1969.55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2703.096,2712.194,"Mr. Murphy, what is the financial burden of giving him the record that they have, you said they had it?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2712.194,2712.862,Yes Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2712.862,2716.051,There is no financial burden.
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2716.051,2718.346,Let me answer the question this way.
1969.55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2718.346,2730.536,"Well, suppose if -- would you agree that it would fair to say that if there is one available, it should be shared with the prisoner, that there'd be no financial burden there, would it?"
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2730.536,2749.623,"Your Honor I -- on an administrative basis, on a legislative basis, some procedure might be devised which would permit an incarcerated prisoner a glance or a look at his particular record."
1969.55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2749.623,2754.69,But don't you think he should have the same right as the wealthy prisoner?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2754.69,2762.375,"Well, does a wealthy prisoner Your Honor have any real need for the transcript?"
1969.55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2762.375,2764.148,Unless the --
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2764.148,2765.641,That's I think is a basic question.
1969.55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2765.641,2771.422,"Unless I misunderstood you, you said that this man could get it if he could pay for it."
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2771.422,2772.741,Yes Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2772.741,2776.788,And the only reason he couldn't get it was because he couldn't pay for it?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2776.788,2778.668,That's right Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2881.792,2896.926,Would you concede Mr. Murphy that the District judge had inherent power to direct that a Xerox copy or some other kind of copy would be made for the benefit of the District Court judge at the time of the original hearing?
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2896.926,2916.946,"Your Honor if he had -- if the petitioner had come forward and alleged some trial error, if he had come forth -- I don't think there'd be any question but that the District Court judge could've required the state to produce the trial transcript."
1969.55,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2916.946,2924.449,"We'll take it in exactly the posture it was in when it appeared before the United State's District judge, not the state court."
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,2942.067,2943.804,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1969.55,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3008.719,3011.153,I think we have (Voice Overlap) -- I think we have your argument on that point.
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,3011.153,3018.109,-- continuing efforts once the state has satisfied itself that the man has been validly --
1969.55,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3018.109,3025.327,I think we (Voice Overlap) Mr. Murphy that the state having provided this for a complete appeal once around that that's the end of the obligation.
1969.55,1,31959,john_t_murphy,,3025.327,3025.715,Yes Your Honor.
1969.55,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3025.715,3026.493,Alright.
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3034.993,3038.773,"Thank you, Your Honor, I don't believe I'll need to take very much additional time."
1969.55,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3060.074,3061.176,Would you mind speaking a little louder?
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3061.176,3063.293,"Well, excuse me Mr. Justice Black."
1969.55,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3098.549,3121.402,"But since the codefendant presumably has it or may have it in his possession for use for the same purposes, why couldn't the district judge have issued such an order to show cause on that codefendant either at the request of the counsel if they had the imagination to ask for it or on his own motion?"
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3121.402,3123.522,"I suppose he could Your Honor, but I think that this --"
1969.55,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3123.522,3129.522,"And then this case would not have been engaged all the time, involve the people all the way to Washington?"
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3129.522,3138.818,"I suppose that might have been the result, but I think that that in and of itself underscores the unfair application of these California Rules of Court."
1969.55,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3144.927,3153.902,"Well, why was there a denial when such a lack of imagination and enterprise at least as I see it as exhibited on this record?"
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3153.902,3159.253,Because I think that puts a burden on the indigent and his appointed counsel.
1969.55,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3159.253,3160.78,To ask the court to do this?
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3160.78,3167.272,"To have to go to court and fight to get a copy of the transcript to use, a burden that a moneyed defendant would not have placed upon it."
1969.55,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3167.272,3184.357,"Well, now he is all the way through the chain of command to this Court and that was a considerably greater enterprise than simply asking the District judge in open court on an oral motion to do what I've just suggested, would you not agree?"
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3184.357,3193.388,"I'd say that that is correct, Your Honor that it -- that he is certainly having to take it up through this sort of procedure --"
1969.55,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3193.388,3196.582,I'm directing no criticism or no implication of at you?
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3196.582,3199.035,"No, I understand that."
1969.55,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3217.856,3224.419,I hope it isn't exemplary of the lack of enterprise that I see for my part on this record.
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3224.419,3236.903,It would be easier though I believe in the terms of the administration of justice if instead of requiring court appointed counsel for indigents to fight to get copies of the record.
1969.55,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3242.743,3246.62,"Well, excuse me, I don't want to interrupt your answer to the Chief Justice Mr. Small."
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3246.62,3248.781,"No sir, that's quite alright."
1969.55,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3248.781,3289.496,"I'm not sure I quite understand whether your basic claim is that it was incumbent upon California to supply a separate extra transcript to this man for his direct appeal which took place a good many years ago or whether its now incumbent upon California to supply to this man at -- upon his mere request a transcript of his trial that took place many years ago for the purpose of now making a collateral attack on his judgment of conviction, which is it?"
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3289.496,3306.702,"My argument is that it was incumbent upon them to supply it years ago and because they didn't, he should not be placed in a less advantageous position now because of his indigency and having to show meritorious grounds for reversal before he can even have a look at his trial transcript."
1969.55,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3306.702,3312.327,Because the second is a much -- of course a much broader rule of law?
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3312.327,3314.393,"Yes, and I am not arguing for that."
1969.55,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3315.087,3316.68,Very understandably you're not arguing that.
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3326.267,3328.789,If he had been given his appellate -- And he --(Voice Overlap)
1969.55,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3328.789,3334.817,"With all his negligence that it just disappeared, now, where would you be in?"
1969.55,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3334.817,3338.495,Just bearing mind before you answer there will be of other question I'll add.
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3342.223,3343.638,Yes.
1969.55,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3363.346,3373.344,But that is really -- its that broader issue is it not that the District Court seems to have decided and that its upon that broader issue that the Court of Appeals seems to have reversed the District Court (Voice Overlap) --
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3373.344,3386.066,"The opinion could be so read, however, I don't think that this Court has to deny relief to this petitioner simply because of the broader basis upon which the District Court may have posited its result."
1969.55,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3392.957,3402.758,"And in this particular State of California where if this man had been -- for everybody who was separately and individually, this question would never arise unless he lost the transcript."
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3402.758,3417.373,"That's right and in the same way in most states as we point out in our brief, the -- in most states this question isn't going to come up because the overwhelming majority of the states give transcripts to individual defendants whether -- and the codefendants."
1969.55,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3425.089,3432.298,Perhaps the advent of the Xerox machine and other related machines will help solve this problem without more.
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3432.298,3454.059,"That in substance is really my contention that that as modern techniques become available, they really should be applied to judicial process such as the stenotype machine here in this Court that over a period of time that hopefully by using modern methods of recording and duplicating trial transcripts, we won't have to get into this type of situation."
1969.55,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3458.612,3461.744,Thank you counsel.
1969.55,2,36748,marshall_l_small,,3469.219,3470.569,Thank you sir.
