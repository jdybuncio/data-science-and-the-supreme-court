2008.08-146,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.043,"We'll hear argument next in Case 08-146, Arthur Andersen v. Carlisle."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,7.979,26.645,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The principal question before the Court today is whether nonparties to an arbitration agreement that are otherwise entitled to enforce that agreement under State law are foreclosed as a matter of law from seeking relief under section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act."
2008.08-146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,83.949,87.899,"Before you leave the text, it says as you --"
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,100.409,106.768,"Your Honor, it's -- it's clear from the -- from the context it's referring to parties to the action."
2008.08-146,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,123.01,125.354,"And what -- what is the ""controversy""?"
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,129.241,132.989,"Well, 4, Your Honor, as opposed to section 3."
2008.08-146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,183.362,201.713,"In practice, are there decisions in which -- and I'm assuming that you are right on the jurisdictional question -- in which a nonparty to the arbitration agreement but a party to the litigation has, in fact, succeeded in getting a stay under section 3?"
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,239.324,240.853,"Yes, there have been, Your Honor."
2008.08-146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,255.722,259.112,"Well, the question -- ability is one thing."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,310.027,312.261,"Well, Your Honor, it depends upon the facts and the law."
2008.08-146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,331.037,334.972,I -- I don't see that the -- that the section 3 stay follows from that.
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,406.411,417.86,"Section 2, Your Honor, sets the policy of the FAA, and section 2 establishes that State law determines the rights and obligations of nonparties to an arbitration agreement."
2008.08-146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,419.891,431.386,"Including -- and -- and you're saying that that covers, in effect, even a point of Federal procedure as to whether you get, in practical terms, an interlocutory appeal."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,433.446,437.743,"--Your Honor, that brings us to the question of appellate jurisdiction, but first let me deal with the merits."
2008.08-146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,459.156,465.809,And the question here is: What is the procedure to be followed in a Federal court when there is disagreement about that?
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,469.995,475.369,"--Your Honor, section 3 is a procedural device to enforce State law arbitration rights."
2008.08-146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,478.586,491.392,Why do you say that section -- it isn't at all clear to me that section 2 says State law determines whether somebody not a party to the arbitration agreement can -- can enforce it.
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,491.392,496.189,"Your Honor, that was the reading of this Court in the Perry v. Thomas decision in 1987."
2008.08-146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,510.057,513.32,Including enforceability by whom?
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,513.32,514.321,Absolutely.
2008.08-146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,546.856,571.703,"Do we have any situation -- and this one is really peculiar because the one party who has the arbitration agreement with Carlisle is now out of it, and is not going to get back in, because -- is it Bricolage -- is bankrupt, so there is an automatic stay of any litigation against Bricolage."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,611.844,620.779,"Your Honor, the bankruptcy of Bricolage has no effect whatsoever on our rights under State law to enforce the agreement."
2008.08-146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,622.935,629.853,"But if you have a party to the agreement who is no longer in the picture, doesn't that change things?"
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,629.853,644.549,"--Well, the Respondents might -- might contend so, and they -- they are free to argue on remand the question of whether or not that bankruptcy in any way affects our rights, whether we can prevail under equitable estoppel in this case."
2008.08-146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,747.041,749.396,May -- may I ask you this?
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,761.172,770.843,"Your Honor, State law controls the question of who may enforce the agreement, who has rights and obligations under the agreement."
2008.08-146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,783.868,785.069,But isn't that the problem?
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,834.37,841.651,"--Your Honor, the premise of your question drives a wedge between section 2 and section 3 that is inconsistent with this Court's -- Court's decision in Bernhardt."
2008.08-146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,853.662,865.017,"And your argument depends upon, as Justice Scalia pointed out a moment ago, reading section 2 as in effect incorporating State law for purposes of determining substantive rights."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,865.017,866.109,--It absolutely does.
2008.08-146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,866.109,883.368,"Okay, but that still begs the question whether the -- whether the incorporation of State law to determine substantive rights controls the question of what law determines procedural rights, when a Federal procedural right is claimed, which is what is involved here."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,883.368,885.867,That's -- that's correct.
2008.08-146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,890.82,895.254,"And regardless of State law, the answer to the Federal question is independent of it."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,895.254,896.834,"That's not correct, Your Honor."
2008.08-146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,896.834,899.91,Then I'm -- I'm missing the logic of your argument.
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,899.91,912.793,"The logic of the argument is that section 3 and section 4, as this Court has said on several occasions, are devices to enforce the principle of arbitration enforceability outlined in section 2."
2008.08-146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,919.914,925.069,"But they are Federal procedural devices, and State law could not contradict them."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,933.099,940.282,"--That would apply to -- that would apply to the question of the -- the action in that court, but in the Federal court the threshold--"
2008.08-146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,940.282,946.061,"It would apply to what the judge is supposed to do at that moment when somebody says, I want a stay."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,950.156,954.339,--That -- on the procedural question of what procedural mechanism--
2008.08-146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,954.339,955.759,"Well, just stick to my question."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,959.993,967.723,"--The judge first looks to the question of who can enforce the agreement, and to ask that -- to answer that question, the judge has to look to State law."
2008.08-146,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,967.723,969.146,Why is that necessarily so?
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1017.956,1023.029,"I don't think it has any question -- effect on the question of jurisdiction, Your Honor."
2008.08-146,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1023.029,1027.951,"Nor does it mean that you necessarily cannot enforce the arbitration agreement, does it?"
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1027.951,1036.275,"It means that -- well, you have to look to a source of law to determine whether a nonparty has rights under an arbitration agreement."
2008.08-146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1053.41,1065.608,"But if you read section 3, if you interpret, as you do, the word ""parties"" to mean parties to the litigation, then for purposes of jurisdiction the only thing is, is this person a party to the litigation?"
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1118.524,1121.504,"--Your Honor, I'm not sure I understand the question."
2008.08-146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1124.694,1131.283,"First, is there jurisdiction -- yes, appellate jurisdiction."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1146.027,1149.79,"The answer, Your Honor, is clearly yes."
2008.08-146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1151.868,1162.613,But your step -- you seem to be involving some merits question of State law in that question.
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1162.613,1170.283,"--Your Honor, I turned to the merits first because the Sixth Circuit below erroneously conflated two entirely distinct concepts."
2008.08-146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1171.847,1172.673,But you shouldn't do that.
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1178.312,1178.826,--All right.
2008.08-146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1180.043,1180.589,Good.
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1180.62,1180.963,All right.
2008.08-146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1196.332,1197.549,May I ask -- may I ask?
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1206.201,1219.822,"--If a -- if a party -- if a litigant makes a section 3 stay and they claim no right to enforce the arbitration agreement, the denial of that stay would be appealable, all right, because section 16--"
2008.08-146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1219.822,1235.3,"I'm asking if somebody who is not a litigant, who can -- if somebody who is an interested spectator moves for a stay of litigation to which that person is not a party, and the court says of course not."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1238.377,1241.359,"--No, because they -- the spectator is not even a party, Your Honor, to the litigation."
2008.08-146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1258.197,1259.929,And that's your jurisdictional argument.
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1259.929,1267.864,"That's our jurisdictional argument, that the mere request for relief under section 3 and the denial of that request triggers appellate jurisdiction."
2008.08-146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1267.864,1271.971,And you're saying that's all that's before us because it was thrown out on--
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1271.971,1272.751,That's not all that's before you.
2008.08-146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1317.373,1325.339,"Now, what are the instances in which somebody who is not a signatory might seem to have a right to enforce it?"
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1330.213,1332.46,"Well, absolutely, Your Honor."
2008.08-146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1332.46,1333.243,What?
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1333.243,1337.739,"There's assignment, successor in interest, assumption, estoppel."
2008.08-146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1337.739,1338.27,Okay.
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1338.27,1339.568,There's a whole--
2008.08-146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1339.568,1341.128,"I mean, which one applies here?"
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1341.128,1342.973,"--Well, estoppel, and there are--"
2008.08-146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1342.973,1343.612,Estoppel?
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1345.114,1348.658,"--Well, Your Honor, it's a theory that was--"
2008.08-146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1348.658,1350.467,I know what estoppel is in the law.
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1350.939,1360.2,"--More precisely, it's equitable estoppel, but the -- the practice treatises have entire chapters devoted to--"
2008.08-146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1360.2,1363.652,"I know, but I haven't unfortunately had a chance to read all the practice treatises."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1374.585,1375.319,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.08-146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1430.342,1440.293,"In other words, whenever I sign a contract with anybody -- I sign one with Smith, I ask him to buy some wheat, I sell him some wheat, and there's an arbitration clause."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1484.01,1487.181,"Well, Your Honor, we're not saying that that applies in every case."
2008.08-146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1488.179,1488.569,"Oh, okay."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1491.662,1492.662,--The theory of equitable estoppel.
2008.08-146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1492.662,1500.486,"If that's the theory, I -- unless I think it always applies, I could just say I don't have to decide about a third-party beneficiary."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1500.486,1501.3,Your Honor--
2008.08-146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1501.3,1503.625,I just have to decide whether you can enforce it.
2008.08-146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1507.547,1508.749,"Well, of course, one of--"
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1508.749,1509.263,"--Well, Your Honor, give me--"
2008.08-146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1509.263,1517.215,"--One of the things you're going to say is that, with all due respect, Justice Breyer, this conflates the merits with the jurisdictional problem, which is exactly the mistake that the court of appeals made."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1519.445,1531.988,"--Well, that's -- that's the first error of the court of appeals, but the court of -- the second error of the court of appeals was to decide -- was to hold as a matter of law that section 3 does not allow nonparties to enforce an arbitration agreement."
2008.08-146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1539.905,1548.293,"I wouldn't have asked my question if you hadn't said we have to go beyond the question whether they had jurisdiction and answer the merits, which is whether you can in fact enforce it."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1548.293,1549.092,--Your Honor--
2008.08-146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1549.092,1550.153,"Now you're saying, no, we don't."
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1550.153,1552.388,"--Your Honor, the merits -- there are two parts to the merits."
2008.08-146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1561.54,1564.165,I could just rely on my third-party beneficiary example?
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1564.165,1565.756,--As an example?
2008.08-146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1572.536,1573.737,If he can do it under State law?
2008.08-146,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1573.737,1575.016,If he can do it under State law.
2008.08-146,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1587.811,1589.059,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,1597.493,1616.124,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Estoppel is what you invoke when you have no contract to invoke, and this version of equitable estoppel is what you invoke when you have no arbitration agreement to invoke."
2008.08-146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1652.643,1655.705,"Well, I thought the first issue -- I never got past the first issue."
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,1655.705,1656.219,"Yes, sir."
2008.08-146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1656.219,1659.593,"And the first issue was, does he have a right to appeal?"
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,1675.807,1697.406,"Because the stay that he requested was distinctly outside section 3, not as a merits question, but so far outside question -- section 3 that we can say he should not -- that the stay was not requested under section 3; it was not denied under section--"
2008.08-146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1697.406,1705.198,"Is there any -- is there any other example in the law -- I can't think of one -- where you say this party has so silly an argument, which is really what you're saying--"
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,1705.198,1705.603,--Right.
2008.08-146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1705.603,1706.652,--that we don't even let him appeal.
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,1706.652,1707.478,Yes.
2008.08-146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1707.915,1714.475,"It seems to me I've gotten a lot of appeals where the appeal, I don't think, is too meritorious, but nonetheless I never heard of saying you can't appeal."
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,1714.475,1715.146,--Right.
2008.08-146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1758.083,1760.831,"As to that, if you did that, I got your first point."
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,1779.463,1780.325,--Right.
2008.08-146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1780.325,1789.742,"And -- and all I want you to say is that sometimes, at least, a third party could enforce a contract to arbitration that two others make."
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,1806.783,1807.844,Right.
2008.08-146,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1925.905,1937.35,"Then you might say that they haven't stated a claim on which relief can be granted, but that is the merits question."
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,1957.733,1979.961,"Your Honor, the -- the fact that they have filed a motion, and as I referred to it, the concern that we have -- and I think the concern that animated DSMC and Universal when they took up this issue -- was the Trojan Horse stay motion."
2008.08-146,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2000.39,2000.858,Okay.
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2005.027,2024.271,"The criterion, Your Honor, is that the -- that the right to the stay must be -- the right to -- the statute speaks in terms of referable to arbitration under an agreement."
2008.08-146,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2043.198,2054.959,"And your -- and your position is that the statute should be so construed that only a signatory to the written agreement has a right to the stay, indeed has a right to request the stay under article 3?"
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2054.959,2055.743,--Yes.
2008.08-146,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2055.743,2057.771,What is your reason for saying that?
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2057.771,2060.973,"Just to clarify, the statute being section 3?"
2008.08-146,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2060.973,2061.441,Yes.
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2061.441,2062.427,Yes.
2008.08-146,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2089.961,2094.083,"Well, what do you do with third-party beneficiary, assignment, assumption?"
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2094.083,2112.001,"All of those examples, Justice Kennedy -- in all of those examples the right to enforce the agreement, let's say the right to procure a stay based on the agreement, flows from the intention of the parties to the original agreement."
2008.08-146,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2138.507,2146.953,"Well, in a way that was where one of the parties, without the other party's consent, say, assigned a third-party beneficiary."
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2157.84,2163.12,"Well, let me tease that out a bit."
2008.08-146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2187.626,2188.735,Your proper -- I see.
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2198.511,2199.182,Right.
2008.08-146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2199.182,2212.211,"And now what I don't know, is -- what they're doing -- it's true that section 3 and all the other sections, they talk about the agreement, but they don't say that the individual who is asking for the stay has to be the same person who signed it, as they couldn't."
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2229.123,2229.7,Right.
2008.08-146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2229.7,2238.899,"And so, so -- is it possible to answer this case by saying he's wrong in thinking you always look to State law."
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2263.938,2272.918,"Justice Breyer, the question of arbitrability does not always depend on State law."
2008.08-146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.281,2306.171,"Well, you see it's a little hard."
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2327.835,2328.724,--Right.
2008.08-146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.724,2333.178,"So I hate to write the words ""equitable estoppel is never relevant""."
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2340.392,2346.093,I think the safest ground is to clear up first this question of how arbitrability is decided.
2008.08-146,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2388.076,2388.45,Okay.
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2449.769,2458.173,--I think that it's the correct approach to say that we are not talking generically about the enforceability of arbitration agreements.
2008.08-146,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2473.462,2473.868,Okay.
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2476.367,2476.804,It does.
2008.08-146,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2476.804,2478.648,--is it a good theory or a bad theory?
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2478.648,2490.051,"It's a good theory because then, once you've opened that door to the -- the ability to ask for a stay, you must ask: Well, what are the ground rules for asking for this stay?"
2008.08-146,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2517.133,2517.663,Okay.
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2589.149,2593.754,"Well, that's consistent with the Federal policy as this Court has expressed that Federal policy."
2008.08-146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.314,2642.767,"Mr. De Marco, can I ask you this question?"
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2648.437,2650.905,With my friend's reading?
2008.08-146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2650.905,2651.529,Yes.
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2651.529,2674.143,"Justice Stevens, I have to be honest and say I'm concerned about that argument because I think Congress has used the word FAA rather haphazardly to mean three different things, maybe four: Party to the agreement, party to the action, party to the arbitration, or party-like person."
2008.08-146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2687.264,2691.651,"You are concerned about -- does that mean you agree with him that ""parties"" means parties to the--"
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2691.651,2691.874,Yes.
2008.08-146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2691.874,2693.621,"--action, not parties to the contract?"
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2693.621,2701.462,"I -- actually in section 3, what I would say is it's equivocal, and the rest of the FAA doesn't help us understand that."
2008.08-146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2706.805,2719.003,"What would you think about saying that some parties -- some parties to the case who are not parties to the contract can as third parties, nonetheless, enforce arbitration?"
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2734.901,2735.447,Right.
2008.08-146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2735.447,2736.434,Something related to that.
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2737.619,2738.54,Right.
2008.08-146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2738.54,2741.804,What it isn't is a case management device.
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2755.455,2756.266,Right.
2008.08-146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2756.266,2759.203,"So is that -- is that right, or is it wrong?"
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2760.454,2761.796,I think it's -- it's correct.
2008.08-146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2761.796,2767.684,I'm just looking for ways of separating these sheep from goats.
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2767.684,2768.246,Yes.
2008.08-146,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2783.695,2786.865,But you -- you just told us that section 3 was ambiguous.
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2808.48,2825.942,"Justice Ginsburg, by declining Justice Stevens's invitation of sorts to read ""parties"" a particular way, I did not mean to -- to suggest that the referable -- issue referable to arbitration under a written agreement is ambiguous."
2008.08-146,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2857.163,2874.0,"If the 3 means parties to the arbitration agreement, would that mean that a -- someone who is not a party to the litigation could file a stay motion under section 3, someone who is not a party to the litigation but is a party to the arbitration agreement?"
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2874.0,2897.819,"--If it were limited to parties to the -- if it were interpreted as parties to the arbitration agreement, then it would suggest that a party outside the litigation -- let's say a party that's conducting an arbitration pursuant to an arbitration agreement -- could intervene."
2008.08-146,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2915.218,2917.795,"Well, once they intervene, they are a party to the litigation as well."
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2917.795,2918.731,Pardon me?
2008.08-146,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2918.731,2921.637,Once they intervene they are a party to the litigation as well.
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,2921.637,2922.483,That's true.
2008.08-146,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2982.395,3013.085,"But you would recognize that there is some appeal possibility, because you already said or at least you said in your brief that 12 might -- to get this question settled about the equitable estoppel and going to arbitration -- that the district court in its discretion could give a 1292(b) order and say, I want to get this issue settled on appeal before I go on with the case."
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,3013.085,3013.6,--Right.
2008.08-146,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3013.6,3014.679,That would be all right?
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,3014.679,3018.239,There is an appellate pathway and that is 1292(b).
2008.08-146,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3054.961,3077.465,"Well, the district judge could say, I'm going to treat this as a 1292(b) issue, and I'm going to grant the stay so that the court of appeals can tell -- can tell me what the law is?"
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,3077.465,3080.776,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.08-146,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3360.615,3363.349,Bricolage did move to compel.
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,3368.458,3368.957,--Yes.
2008.08-146,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3368.957,3379.092,"--application, and then it -- it became bankrupt and got the benefit of the automatic stay in bankruptcy."
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,3379.092,3379.638,Right.
2008.08-146,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3379.638,3392.136,"But -- and I take it that Andersen and Curtis are saying, we have a right to be substituted for Bricolage."
2008.08-146,1,38145,paul_m_de_marco,,3392.728,3399.692,"That's what their -- that's apparently their argument, and the problem is how do they fill that gap."
