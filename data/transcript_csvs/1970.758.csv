1970.758,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,34.621,"We’ll hear arguments now in number 758, United States against Raymond J. Ryan."
1970.758,0,30393,jerome_feit,,36.915,40.764,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.758,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,230.413,232.373,Were these domestic corporations or with the --
1970.758,0,30393,jerome_feit,,232.373,233.744,These were Kenya corporations.
1970.758,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,233.744,234.77,All of them.
1970.758,0,30393,jerome_feit,,234.77,235.49,All of them.
1970.758,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,235.49,237.938,And what was Mr. Ryan’s connection with them?
1970.758,0,30393,jerome_feit,,237.938,260.891,The Government’s position was that Mr. Ryan was a Director who owned 80% of Ryan -- who owned 80% of the Mawingo which was doing business at Mount Kenya Safari Club but he owned 98% of Ryan Investments and that in fact he was in control generally of all these corporations.
1970.758,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,260.891,262.92,What have you said was the Pepsi Cola Company.
1970.758,0,30393,jerome_feit,,262.92,281.968,"Well, that was subsequently, that was in the original subpoena but the Court’s order which modified the subpoena excluded the Pepsi Cola and one of the other companies, the Zimmerman Company from the reach of the subpoena on the ground that Pepsi Cola Company apparently had gone out of business several years before."
1970.758,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,281.968,283.132,That’s Pepsi Cola Company of Kenya.
1970.758,0,30393,jerome_feit,,283.132,287.555,"Of Kenya, not the Pepsi Cola generally."
1970.758,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,397.996,402.178,Was there anything in the Kenya law that prevents them copying?
1970.758,0,30393,jerome_feit,,402.178,405.538,There is nothing in Kenya law.
1970.758,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,427.558,431.838,"Well, is there anything for the purpose that you will take them out of the country?"
1970.758,0,30393,jerome_feit,,431.838,433.54,Yes.
1970.758,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,473.289,474.602,What?
1970.758,0,30393,jerome_feit,,474.602,478.162,"Well, because the law so provides and I think most --"
1970.758,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,478.162,482.091,What authority that we have over Kenya officials?
1970.758,0,30393,jerome_feit,,482.091,484.845,We have no authority over Kenya officials.
1970.758,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,492.068,495.26,"(Inaudible) try to get it and Kenya says, “No”, that’s it?"
1970.758,0,30393,jerome_feit,,495.26,497.523,"If Kenya said, “No”."
1970.758,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,518.78,520.914,Let me make sure I have this clear.
1970.758,0,30393,jerome_feit,,528.205,538.435,"As far as our position is, the -- no, there is no limitation upon Mr. Ryan’s rights to provide copies of these records which are restricted."
1970.758,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,569.984,573.069,But the process involved here is directed only at Mr. Ryan.
1970.758,0,30393,jerome_feit,,573.069,574.449,Only at Mr. Ryan.
1970.758,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,575.168,579.605,To tell him to produce what he could get any day in the week for himself.
1970.758,0,30393,jerome_feit,,579.605,579.914,Precisely.
1970.758,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,579.914,580.747,For his own purpose.
1970.758,0,30393,jerome_feit,,580.747,581.664,Precisely.
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1784.262,1790.06,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.758,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1918.515,1932.031,"Are those issues before us in this stage, the Court of Appeals did not rule on this, read through oppressiveness or other possible illegalities of the subpoena, it simply dismissed the appeal?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,1932.031,1966.132,"If the Court pleases, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the order of July 25, 1968 issued by Judge Manuel Real of the District Court of California requiring respondent Ryan to travel to Kenya and produce 2,000 pounds of records at his own expense covering a 30 year period was an appealable order."
1970.758,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2178.274,2186.347,"Mr. Miller, is that order anymore than an implement to carry out the subpoena duces tecum?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2186.347,2187.189,Yes sir.
1970.758,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2187.189,2188.308,In what respect?
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2188.308,2198.741,It is -- It goes far beyond the capability of any subpoena that I have ever seen in my experience at the Bar.
1970.758,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2211.447,2217.311,Does the subpoena not to do that by clear implication?
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2217.311,2225.723,"No sir, it does not. Because what the subpoena says, is that you produce the records."
1970.758,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2232.518,2244.695,Doesn’t that command that the subpoena mean when it directs that you produce the records to do everything necessary to accomplish that end whatever it is?
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2244.695,2245.672,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.758,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2246.121,2253.112,"Apply to the foreign government to apply to warrant state department to make a request to the foreign government, whatever is necessary?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2253.112,2254.084,"Yes, sir."
1970.758,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2405.948,2411.259,Where do we find in this record that it’s necessary that he’s commanded to go to Kenya?
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2415.505,2419.836,"If the Court please, it could not be done by a surface travel, I don’t believe."
1970.758,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2419.836,2425.845,Its that been -- is that issue been litigated and are there findings to that effect?
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2425.845,2428.402,"There are no findings, there are no findings."
1970.758,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2556.194,2559.646,"But Mr. Miller, it doesn’t mean that those record goes to the grand jury at all."
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2562.503,2563.711,It either goes --
1970.758,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2563.711,2566.036,"It might never get to a grand jury, isn’t that right?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2566.036,2566.966,That is correct.
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2607.228,2607.818,Mr. Miller.
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2607.818,2608.199,Yes sir.
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2608.199,2610.067,The issue here is appealability?
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2610.067,2611.363,That’s correct.
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.363,2612.866,Not whether the order was valid or not?
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2612.866,2614.88,That’s correct.
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2614.88,2624.561,"Would you say that any -- in an ordinary civil case, any order for inspection and copying of records or an order for a physical examination, for example, would be appealable?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2624.561,2627.062,"On the contrary, it would not be appealable."
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2627.062,2629.055,"But it would be an order, an affirmative order."
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2629.055,2630.668,It would be an affirmative order --
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2630.668,2632.89,But why isn’t that an injunction?
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2632.89,2658.651,It is because it is in the nature of an order entered in the course of civil litigation and the requirements there are that the way the order is enforced is that the pleadings of the party be stricken or that some other action be taken with respect to the litigant as distinguished from here where you have an order directed to a particular individual.
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2659.667,2669.218,"No, there is nothing that is more of a specific order to a specific individual than to submit to a physical examination?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2669.218,2683.478,"Yes sir and I would -- I would submit if that order were directed to the plaintiff in a case, and if he refused that under the practice certainly of the federal rules that that individual will just have complaint stricken."
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2692.577,2698.161,"You think the only -- that there wouldn’t be any possibility of contempt, is that it?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2698.161,2700.976,The order could be so phrased whereby it could be contempt --
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2700.976,2702.573,But what if it were --
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2702.573,2702.673,Sir?
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2702.673,2704.197,"What if it were, appealable?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2704.197,2722.186,"If it were and if it were a mandatory, if the Court specifically said, as was in this case, that you shall forth with take yourself to a doctor’s office and then right then, under those circumstances comparable to your issue here, I think, you would have a question of an appealability."
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2790.075,2792.353,"Now, what does subpoena mean?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2795.28,2795.744,"Yes, sir."
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2796.729,2801.142,"And you’re subject to a contempt order, if you disobey it?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2801.142,2802.81,Correct.
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2802.81,2813.775,"So what’s the difference between a subpoena and an order -- an ordinary subpoena and what happened in this case, in terms of whether it commands certain affirmative acts or not?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2813.775,2824.271,"MBecause, if the Court please, the man was under no requirement to turn records over for copying, for example, in Kenya."
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2832.323,2848.065,"But if it’s a civil litigation, if the Government had applied to inspect and copy records in Kenya, and the Court had ordered Mr. Ryan to turn them over for inspection and copying, there would have been no -- it would not have been an appealable order?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2848.065,2856.48,"If the Court please, depending on the type of order and depending on the framework, for example, if it were in fact an independent action."
1970.758,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2927.262,2935.22,"Yes, Mr. Miller but isn’t he’s doing business in Kenya his own doing?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2935.22,2941.642,"If the Court please, the fact that he was in Kenya was in fact his own thing to be sure, yes."
1970.758,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2941.642,2953.539,"Well, I failed to follow you on why then it is such an imposition on him to produce records which may have some consequence in this investigation?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2953.539,2965.485,"The imposition, sir, is that he is required “forthwith” to make application and to do the things required in the order."
1970.758,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2982.045,2987.033,"Well, then we might come back of course to the Chief Justice’s inquiry."
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2995.424,3001.693,"Sir, I believe it goes far beyond the original subpoena because it does what the subpoena could not do."
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3075.283,3081.716,"Mr. Miller, let’s assume that in a criminal case, the Government subpoenas a witness not a party."
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3081.716,3082.573,Yes sir.
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3082.573,3094.992,Subpoenas a witness or applies for an order to -- for the witness to produce certain records.
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3102.642,3105.138,There is under Rule 17.
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3105.138,3106.023,16?
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3106.023,3106.888,Rule 17.
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3122.828,3123.726,I understand that.
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3123.726,3124.522,"Yes, sir."
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3124.522,3138.285,"But would that kind of a refusal to quash that kind of a subpoena which would demand the inspection and copying or permitted inspection and copying, would that be appealable?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3138.285,3138.637,"No, sir."
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.721,3184.679,"Well, I suppose the defendant in an ordinary criminal case would make the Government produce for inspection and copying certain documents?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3184.679,3185.214,Correct.
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3185.214,3186.726,Under 16?
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3186.726,3188.371,"Yes, mostly to it."
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3188.371,3196.755,"And the Court will issue an order directing the Government to, at a specific time and place to produce for inspection and copying of certain documents."
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3196.755,3197.766,Yes.
1970.758,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3197.766,3198.836,Appealable?
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3198.836,3202.296,No.
1970.758,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3298.106,3306.23,Does that tie anything to the subpoena? Did not the subpoena by implication require him to do precisely that?
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3306.23,3322.744,"The subpoena would by implication require to do that except, if the Court please, the subpoena would not, as I pointed out before, apply to the requirements that these records be made available to other people."
1970.758,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3322.744,3328.116,"But does that make it any more or less oppressive Mr. Miller, the fact that other people can look at it?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3328.116,3328.738,"Well, if there --"
1970.758,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3328.738,3330.909,And the other people being officials of the Government?
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3330.909,3332.894,"Well, let me say this."
1970.758,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3344.048,3350.379,"But the coercive impact of the order is no greater and broader than the subpoena, is it?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3350.379,3366.731,"The -- in effect, the subpoena would require that type of action to be taken except that the -- when a subpoena is served, you have to use what capabilities you have to produce the records, granted."
1970.758,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3514.584,3521.4,"Are there some records in Kenya that he could have had mailed, correspondence things like that?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3521.4,3522.883,"I beg your pardon, sir."
1970.758,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3522.883,3530.418,Didn’t Ryan have some records in Kenya that he could’ve gotten by his request by mail?
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3530.418,3533.496,"I'm certain, absolutely not."
1970.758,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3540.186,3545.93,"Well, do you deny that there are any records in Kenya that he had custody and control of?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3545.93,3547.527,Yes.
1970.758,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3547.527,3548.41,You say that there are none of them?
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3548.41,3553.159,"There are -- Well, there are probably records there but he doesn’t have any control over those records."
1970.758,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3553.159,3554.834,Why isn't that a perfect defense?
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3554.834,3556.595,"Well, it is, if the Court please, we filed --"
1970.758,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3556.595,3558.464,Why don’t you use it sometime?
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3560.098,3575.635,I filed a motion to quash and submitted an affidavit from people in Kenya which established this fact and the Court ruled to the contrary.
1970.758,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3575.635,3588.951,"Mr. Miller, if hypothetically, Mr. Ryan needed and wanted these records for his own purposes in the United States, do you say he could not get them?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3588.951,3592.515,"I certainly do and I submit to the Court, he could not do so."
1970.758,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3609.347,3626.035,"Well then, why should this have been litigated in the first place at the level where it seems to me fundamental that no man can be held in contempt for not performing an act which he cannot perform?"
1970.758,1,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3626.035,3632.05,I couldn’t agree with the Court more and I did make a motion to quash based on that.
1970.758,2,30393,jerome_feit,,3791.039,3793.037,"Yes, I’d like to make two points."
1970.758,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3877.946,3879.318,"On appeal from what, Mr. Feit?"
1970.758,2,30393,jerome_feit,,3879.318,3889.705,On appeal from the finding in contempt which is precisely Cobbledick and precisely what this Court has reaffirmed in cases since Cobbledick and I may have one --
1970.758,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3889.705,3900.323,Is there a further opportunity for hearing on the issues of whether or not he has control and so on in the District Court before the finding of contempt?
1970.758,2,30393,jerome_feit,,3900.323,3903.302,"Well, I would assume that this would -- our view would be."
1970.758,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3903.302,3906.074,"Otherwise, the appeal is very meaningful thing if you have any record --"
1970.758,2,30393,jerome_feit,,3906.074,3917.991,"Well, the appeal from the contempt and he -- counsel refers to cases which I don’t know of and which he refers to cases in which that order of July 25 would not be reviewable on appeal."

1970.758,2,30393,jerome_feit,,4000.438,4000.849,Precisely.
1970.758,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4000.849,4003.949,"It would be triggered by an order to show cause, wouldn’t it?"
1970.758,2,30393,jerome_feit,,4003.949,4005.482,"Yes, as it was here."
1970.758,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4005.482,4012.204,"Now, is there any limit on what cause, he could show as an explanation why he had not complied?"

1970.758,2,30393,jerome_feit,,4015.148,4022.523,There’s no limitation except as I suggest that the way the District Court runs the contempt proceeding.
