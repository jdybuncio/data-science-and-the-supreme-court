1985.84-1586,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.539,We will hear arguments first this morning in Edward Malley against Briggs.
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,15.693,18.512,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1586,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,51.866,59.805,"Ms. Sheadel, may I interrupt you just for a moment to announce that Justice Prennan will be delayed in arriving, but will participate in all the cases."
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,59.805,69.394,"We ask this Court to find that a police officer cannot be amenable to suit in such a situation, but rather that he is in fact immune, from liability."
1985.84-1586,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,181.668,191.456,"Ms. Sheadel, do you concede that the facts that were available here were not sufficient to justify the issuance of a warrant?"
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,191.456,196.677,"We would not concede that there was absence of probable cause in this case, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,203.581,225.612,"Well, if you would assume for a, moment that the facts were insufficient to amount to probable cause and if the warrant had issued and evidence obtained as a result of it, would the evidence be excludable in your view under the Leon case at trial?"
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,225.612,229.231,"Using the Leon case, it's possible the evidence could be excluded."
1985.84-1586,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,237.587,252.247,Why should a different rule apply than in insulating the officer from any damage liability than the rule that would be applied for exclusion of evidence under Leon?
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,255.032,259.167,We don't believe that this Court has ever said that the two rules are synonymous.
1985.84-1586,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,289.619,302.929,But in Leon was there not some indication that perhaps deterrence is a valid objective if the police officer's reliance on the warrant is objectively unreasonable?
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,302.929,306.065,"--Yes, I believe that was indicated in Leon."
1985.84-1586,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,351.159,359.098,"Well, if you were right on that immunity it wouldn't make any difference what the objectives were, would it?"
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,360.448,361.081,That's right.
1985.84-1586,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,361.081,363.9,As far as your absolute immunity argument is concerned.
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,363.9,365.419,As far as the absolute immunity is concerned.
1985.84-1586,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,365.419,369.387,But your qualified immunity argument would certainly implicate that.
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,369.387,371.737,Yes.
1985.84-1586,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,371.737,374.289,May I just ask this question.
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,378.909,383.895,"There was no finding made on probable cause, Your Honor, at all at the trial level."
1985.84-1586,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,383.895,389.465,What did the appellate court in the State of Rhode Island find?
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,389.465,392.816,The case went before the First Circuit Court of Appeals and the First--
1985.84-1586,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,392.816,393.868,Directly from the state trial?
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,393.868,394.935,--It was not a state trial.
1985.84-1586,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,396.287,398.053,Federal district court all the way.
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,398.053,398.47,Yes.
1985.84-1586,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,412.563,418.799,"But the state trial judge actually approved the issuance of the complaint, didn't he?"
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,418.799,424.37,"Oh, yes the arrest warrant was approved by the state judge, yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,424.37,429.672,And didn't the face of the warrant disclose the substance of the wiretap evidence?
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,429.672,430.255,"Yes, it did."
1985.84-1586,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,435.49,441.48,"And the state judge then commanded the arrest of the defendants, didn't he?"
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,441.48,445.115,"Yes, he did, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,445.115,453.202,"The First Circuit said that your client should have qualified immunity, is that right?"
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,453.202,455.635,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,717.355,721.825,Let me ask you a sort of a hypothetical question about the extent of your position.
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,733.466,737.601,"--That would be the full extent of the absolute immunity argument, yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,737.601,741.936,"That is your position, even assuming it's objectively unreasonable."
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,773.721,792.349,"We believe that the Court's analysis in civil liability would in fact give the officer in your hypothetical situation absolute immunity, for the same reasons that it has given the magistrate absolute immunity for that kind of function, or the same reason that it has given the prosecuting attorney absolute immunity."
1985.84-1586,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,802.988,806.858,What if there are falsehoods in the application for a warrant?
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,808.742,814.446,"That's a question that we have not asked the Court to directly address in this case, since it is not raised."
1985.84-1586,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,861.593,883.125,"See, if I understand your position, you would give, you recognize that in Leon some of this evidence may be subject to the exclusionary rule, and you would give the guilty defendant greater protection by excluding the evidence than you will the innocent victim of this kind of police error, if I understand your position, by not equating the Leon test to this situation."
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,883.125,890.446,We would make a certain distinction between search warrants and arrest warrants.
1985.84-1586,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,949.435,956.823,And from that I take it that you would say that if the magistrate fails to do his duty that failure can never be attributed to the police officer?
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,956.823,963.577,"That is exactly our position, that it is the magistrate's responsibility here to review the application for the arrest warrant."
1985.84-1586,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,963.577,964.277,Go ahead.
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,964.277,975.535,"If the magistrate in fact does not do his job correctly or is objectively unreasonable, we would say that is something that is not the police officer's fault."
1985.84-1586,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,989.962,990.978,What alternative... I'm sorry.
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1011.141,1014.41,"Yes, would lose for civil damages."
1985.84-1586,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1014.41,1015.227,Yes.
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1015.227,1025.385,"What this Court has recognized in its policy considerations for alternatives that are available, the Court has recognized that civil damages are not always available for a wrong that is done."
1985.84-1586,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1063.943,1078.036,"Counsel, if we go that far is there anybody in the state side of the judicial process that is not immune, absolutely immune?"
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1085.439,1095.731,"Well, i should clarify that we're not asking for absolute immunity for every action that a police officer would take, but only for an action that we feel is so intimately involved in the process."
1985.84-1586,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1095.731,1099.949,"Well, I thought you based your argument that he has the same immunity as the prosecutor."
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1099.949,1100.799,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1100.799,1103.335,Which is the same immunity that a judge has.
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1103.335,1104.337,Your Honor.
1985.84-1586,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1104.337,1108.372,"So that the policeman has the same immunity, as the judge has."
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1113.859,1121.446,"None that I can think of right now, because the Court has recognized absolute immunity for judges, prosecutors, grand jurors, witnesses."
1985.84-1586,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1131.237,1139.491,"Well, are you saying that the immunity of the policeman here is the derivative immunity from the judicial immunity of the magistrate?"
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1144.312,1159.322,"It could be seen as derivative, although we would prefer to call it the quasi-judicial immunity, the phrase that this Court has used whenever it has extended immunity within a judicial proceeding, saying that the immunity is considered to be quasi-judicial because it is of such a nature within the--"
1985.84-1586,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1159.322,1161.94,Is that any different from a derivative immunity?
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1166.158,1167.627,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1170.379,1173.731,So it isn't an independent immunity of a policeman as such.
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1185.389,1187.507,"--Yes, Your Honor, we would say that that is correct."
1985.84-1586,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.18,1205.285,Does your argument rest on the assumption that in filling out the application for a warrant that the police officer was just doing what the magistrate told him to do?
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1205.285,1206.235,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1220.128,1223.597,Has this Court ever directed him to do what was objectively unreasonable?
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1223.597,1225.197,"--No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1225.197,1230.268,"Perhaps false and deliberately misleading the magistrate, to be immune for that kind of thing?"
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1230.268,1237.674,"Well, of course the Court has never directed anyone within the judicial process to be unreasonable or objectively unreasonable or false."
1985.84-1586,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1272.428,1293.757,"Suppose the affidavit for the warrant recites that it's a warrant to search the premises of 36 Jackson Street and the secretary for the magistrate, not the police officer, the secretary for the magistrate makes a typographical error and puts in 38 Jackson Street."
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1317.557,1319.573,"The police officer who executes the warrant, Your Honor?"
1985.84-1586,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1348.859,1352.813,"So that's a case that would be protected adequately by the qualified immunity doctrine, wouldn't it?"
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1352.813,1353.163,Yes.
1985.84-1586,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1474.009,1481.763,Is it not true that all of the retaliatory lawsuits in this category of litigation are by people who are innocent of any criminal wrongdoing?
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1488.417,1493.986,--Whether or not there was probable cause may not have ever been decided.
1985.84-1586,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1523.506,1523.722,"Well, let me put it this way."
1985.84-1586,0,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1539.031,1551.089,"--Right, and I would say that the same would be true for a prosecutor that gets an indictment from a grand jury and then the case never proceeds any further or the person is ultimately exonerated in some way."
1985.84-1586,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1574.102,1579.172,Mr. Decof.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1579.172,1583.893,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.84-1586,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1608.425,1632.724,"What would you say about the hypothetical I put to your friend on the magistrate's making a mistake, either he or his secretary, and puts in 38 Jackson Street instead of 36, and then another officer, knowing nothing of the facts, goes and searches the wrong place?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1632.724,1633.207,Under the proposition--
1985.84-1586,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1633.207,1633.926,Liable?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1633.926,1640.746,"--Under the proposition advanced by the Petitioners, there would be immunity, there would be absolute immunity."
1985.84-1586,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1640.746,1642.512,Do you agree?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1643.698,1644.948,"No, Your Honor, I dispute that."
1985.84-1586,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1647.066,1652.285,"But then are you not holding the policeman responsible for the magistrate's, for the judge's mistake?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1652.285,1662.575,"--If the Court please, I believe in that situation under the Harlow objective doctrine objective test, the police would not be held responsible."
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1663.025,1664.125,Qualified immunity?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1664.125,1664.894,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1668.313,1671.031,He'd have to defend the action.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1674.217,1683.989,"Again, the purpose for Harlow adopting the objective act was to promote summary judgment... the objective standard, was to promote summary judgment."
1985.84-1586,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1743.544,1751.65,"Well, isn't the argument limited to the case of executing a warrant issued by a judicial officer?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1751.65,1759.054,"--No, if the Court please, it is not, because in the instant case here this warrant was not executed by the officer who was sued."
1985.84-1586,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1786.888,1792.292,"Question: Well, are you suggesting there's a difference between lower and higher judicial officers with respect to immunity?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1792.292,1793.144,"No, I'm not, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1824.762,1826.214,May I just interrupt there.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1830.683,1831.768,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1834.468,1836.07,And you didn't sue him because--
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1836.07,1836.62,He's immune.
1985.84-1586,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1836.62,1837.589,--of judicial immunity?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1837.589,1839.006,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1858.083,1868.039,"Mr. Decof, do you think that the question of whether there was probable cause here has been fully resolved and is not an issue now?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1868.039,1880.947,"I think it's not at issue in this case, Your Honor, because the First Circuit Court of Appeals indicated that from its face the warrant exhibited that there was no probable cause."
1985.84-1586,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1880.947,1888.368,Is the absence of probable cause sufficient to defeat the Harlow test for qualified immunity?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1903.212,1903.645,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1903.645,1914.603,"But here I take it either if there's probable cause everyone is off the hook and if there isn't probable cause, even if it may be kind of a then the police officer is liable?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1914.603,1916.203,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1942.42,1952.192,"Did the First Circuit say only that there was no probable cause, or also that whatever the standard is no reasonable person could have thought them was probable cause?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1952.192,1957.011,"The First Circuit applied the Harlow test, Your Honor, and said that there was no probable cause here."
1985.84-1586,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1991.001,1996.571,"Mr. Decof, can I pursue this question just a little bit to see if I understand you."
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2013.349,2014.582,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2014.582,2024.738,"Now, is that necessarily always the same as a determination of whether or not probable cause existed?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2035.113,2044.719,"I think there has to be an allegation, allegations which if taken in the light most favorable to the affiant would establish probable cause."
1985.84-1586,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2049.604,2054.139,"Mr. Decof, the Court of Appeals was quite clearly in agreement with what Justice O'Connor said."
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2061.093,2061.528,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2061.528,2062.612,They're two different standards.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2062.612,2063.245,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2063.245,2064.928,I thought you were--
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2064.928,2067.047,"No, I don't disagree with that."
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.047,2071.099,--They said there'd be liability only if the officer really should have known.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2071.099,2073.367,"Yes, Your Honor, and I say that would be a question to determine."
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2073.367,2076.836,You think the Harlow test and the Leon test are roughly the same?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2076.836,2084.24,"I think that Leon has followed along with the teaching of Harlow, yes, I do, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2084.24,2086.275,May I continue to interrupt you?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2086.275,2087.208,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1586,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2087.208,2093.029,"You would agree that the officer at most acted only negligently, wouldn't you?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2093.029,2093.879,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2093.879,2100.701,"In other words, he faithfully recorded in the affidavit the essential facts from the wiretap."
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2106.186,2110.84,"He acted constitutionally negligently, is what our claim was, Your Honor, yes."
1985.84-1586,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2110.84,2111.407,"Well, yes, but--"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2111.407,2113.009,We didn't claim there was malice or anything of that kind.
1985.84-1586,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2113.009,2121.115,"--When we get to the constitutional part, all that he... he made a mistake in judgment, basically, didn't he?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2121.115,2122.081,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2122.081,2123.315,We didn't fabricate any facts.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2123.315,2123.915,No he didn't.
1985.84-1586,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2123.915,2126.067,He reported all the facts he had to the magistrate?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2126.067,2126.783,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2126.783,2127.202,Right.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2127.769,2128.469,Yes.
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.469,2132.154,"Well, and the jury or judge may conclude that at trial."
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2132.154,2133.873,"Yes, they may, Your Honor, that's so."
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.031,2186.74,"The district court dismissed the case because he thought the magistrate's action just insulated, automatically insulated, the police officer, isn't that right?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2186.74,2187.523,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2188.79,2194.244,But under the Court of Appeals' opinion they remanded it for trial.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2213.225,2213.675,--The district court--
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2213.675,2216.443,He could still dismiss it under the Harlow standard.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2216.443,2223.43,"--Yes, Your Honor, he could conceivably say that there was no issue of triable fact to go before a jury."
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.43,2224.13,Exactly.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2224.13,2225.632,Yes.
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.936,2232.619,Yes.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2232.619,2241.142,"When the district court dismissed this action, he did it on the basis of old First Circuit cases."
1985.84-1586,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2317.892,2323.112,Would it have been any different on the hypothetical I gave you with a mistake in the address?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2323.112,2344.875,"If the Court please, if there had been a mistake in the address, under the qualified immunity rule of Harlow, the police either at filing of affidavits to this effect on the motion for summary judgment would probably get a summary judgment, or at the very least, if the matter went to trial on the facts they would be found to be not responsible."
1985.84-1586,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2344.875,2347.911,"The injury to the person, to have your home raided--"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2347.911,2348.561,"I understand, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2348.561,2351.779,"--by the police is a very bad business for any citizen, of course."
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2351.779,2352.881,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2352.881,2358.702,"But the situation with the typographical error, is that any different than the situation here?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2358.702,2359.969,"I think so, Your Honor because--"
1985.84-1586,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2359.969,2360.585,How?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2360.585,2367.308,--we don't take the obverse of the coin from the Attorney general of Rhode Island and say that there should be absolute liability.
1985.84-1586,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2510.349,2517.703,"Do you think the police officer who gets the warrant should then go to another lawyer and say, I went to be sure before I execute this warrant?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2517.703,2518.189,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2518.189,2524.526,I want to be sure that it's a valid warrant; will you look at the application and then look at the warrant and see if I'm protected.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2524.526,2525.226,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2556.228,2562.882,"Well, isn't the very purpose of the magistrate the judicial officer's intervention?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2562.882,2563.399,"Yes, You Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2563.399,2565.168,To correct the mistakes of the police?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2565.168,2565.784,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.863,2617.969,What's unlawful about the magistrate... about the policeman submitting to the magistrate a set of facts for the magistrate's judgment?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2617.969,2623.773,If the set of facts... he must act reasonably in submitting this set of facts.
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2655.242,2664.415,Why isn't it objectively reasonable to think that if there isn't probable cause the magistrate will surely tell me?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2664.415,2665.865,"Because, if the Court please--"
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2665.865,2672.771,"And if the magistrate issues the warrant, he has told me that my conduct is very reasonable?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2672.771,2677.906,"--Then we relieve the police of all responsibility and make them nothing but messengers and, as I said, anybody--"
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2677.906,2687.464,"Well, only... but it certainly doesn't go any farther than when he applies for a warrant?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2687.464,2700.021,"--If the Court please, he then has a very simple way to escape liability and to conduct his business, and with the best of--"
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2700.021,2708.961,"Well, it isn't simple at all if magistrates do their job, which you say that, obviously say, that they usually are."
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2708.961,2709.711,--Yes.
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2746.498,2751.119,"Well, you're just making the police pay for, the policeman pay for an incompetent magistrate."
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2751.119,2757.106,"--No, if the Court please, the policeman is not paying for an incompetent magistrate unless you accept--"
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2757.106,2762.158,"You would hold him, you would make him pay."
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2762.158,2763.177,"--No, if the Court please."
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2768.914,2773.116,"Well, I know, but if the magistrate had done his job he would be off the hook."
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2773.116,2785.19,"But if the Court please, it isn't the magistrate... the magistrate is a governing factor, of course, and the purpose that the magistrate is there and he should be sought to is to protect the individual."
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2804.254,2816.727,"Of course there might be a plus to this from the state's argument, because it would encourage police to go to magistrates to get a warrant, rather than making arrests without a warrant."
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2816.727,2822.298,"Yes, but again this Court has spoken to that and also encouraged it."
1985.84-1586,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2848.949,2853.501,"Mr. Decof, we're not giving you much of a chance to make your argument coherently, but--"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2853.501,2855.102,--I welcome Your Honor's questions.
1985.84-1586,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2855.102,2857.638,--I'll ask you one more question and then try to keep quiet.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2892.959,2894.311,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2894.311,2895.044,It is?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2895.044,2907.135,Our position is that this warrant was so patently without probable cause on its face that any reasonable police officer would have known so.
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2933.536,2940.375,"Well, that standard is the standard that you think the district judge will be entitled to follow at trial."
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2940.375,2941.158,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.158,2945.16,"If he didn't think it was a flagrant enough error, he's going to dismiss your case."
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2945.16,2946.077,"Exactly, Your Honor, yes, sir."
1985.84-1586,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2946.077,2949.981,You give me great problems.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2963.771,2965.871,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2965.871,2967.406,The officer is.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2967.406,2968.256,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2968.256,2969.373,The officer is responsible.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2969.373,2971.056,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2971.056,2988.268,"So that if the officer has say four points to make to show probable cause and he puts down three and a half points, he is liable to civil action per se?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2988.268,2989.168,"He's liable, but he--"
1985.84-1586,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2989.168,2990.036,That's your position?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2990.036,2991.086,--He's liable to action.
1985.84-1586,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3000.058,3001.675,All because he left out one point?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,3001.675,3002.044,I'm sorry?
1985.84-1586,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3002.044,3003.394,He left out half of one point.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,3003.394,3005.212,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3005.212,3009.498,And so he can be brought up and carried through court on that?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,3009.498,3010.198,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3010.198,3014.152,And why does he have to present it to the magistrate?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,3014.152,3014.818,The reason--
1985.84-1586,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3014.818,3020.922,"The reason is so that the magistrate can determine whether it's sufficient, is that correct?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,3020.922,3021.656,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3025.793,3029.428,But he has to satisfy the magistrate?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,3029.428,3030.578,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3030.578,3037.85,So he is at his peril if the magistrate goes wrong?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,3037.85,3038.517,The point--
1985.84-1586,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3038.517,3042.135,He and the magistrate have made an equal mistake.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,3042.135,3043.035,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3043.035,3043.421,Right?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,3043.421,3045.087,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1586,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3045.087,3046.789,So he's responsible?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,3046.789,3057.245,"Well, what I'm saying is, again, if there are two joint tortfeasors, you don't solve the problem if one is unavailable by letting the other one go."
1985.84-1586,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3063.499,3065.265,I'm not interested in torts.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,3065.265,3070.819,"Well, in this situation there are two separate wrongs that have been done."
1985.84-1586,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3118.717,3128.357,"Mr. Decof, you also made a claim, I believe, below that the Petitioner acted maliciously and in bad faith, is that right?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,3128.357,3131.209,"Yes, but we didn't pursue that."
1985.84-1586,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3131.993,3135.095,And you don't intend to when it goes back?
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,3135.445,3136.761,"--That's correct, Your Honor, that's correct."
1985.84-1586,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3136.761,3137.363,Thank you.
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,3137.363,3144.517,The only good faith that we'd be talking about is the objective standard of good faith that has been announced in Harlow.
1985.84-1586,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3295.648,3314.043,"Well, if the reasoning for reversing the First Circuit here would be that the police officer simply submitted it for the magistrate's judgment and it was reasonable for him to execute something that had been approved by the magistrate, that reasoning wouldn't apply at all to police making arrests or making searches without warrants?"
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,3314.043,3327.119,"Well, I think, Your Honor, with due respect, that that would beg the question, because you're saying that the reasonableness of the police... again, in this case we're not talking about the policeman who executed it; we're talking about the policeman who applied."
1985.84-1586,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3349.133,3350.902,"Well, only in the warrant process."
1985.84-1586,1,34329,leonard_decof,,3350.902,3352.854,"Yes, Your Honor, in the warrant process."
1985.84-1586,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3364.275,3367.863,"Do you have anything further, Ms. Sheadel?"
1985.84-1586,2,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,3367.863,3371.981,"Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1586,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3498.164,3499.831,"Thank you, counsel."
