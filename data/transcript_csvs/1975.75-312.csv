1975.75-312,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.445,"We’ll hear arguments first this morning in number 75-312 Young, the Mayor of Detroit against American Mini Theatres."
1975.75-312,0,36557,maureen_pulte_reilly,,17.252,21.286,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,151.451,159.621,"The category of regulated uses had been one that was part of the Detroit zoning pattern for many years, hasn’t it been?"
1975.75-312,0,36557,maureen_pulte_reilly,,159.621,160.737,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,179.377,182.107,Pool halls and shoeshine parlors and --
1975.75-312,0,36557,maureen_pulte_reilly,,182.107,186.492,"Motels, bars, those businesses which cater to transient- type patrons --"
1975.75-312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,186.492,188.462,As contrast with the neighborhood patronage?
1975.75-312,0,36557,maureen_pulte_reilly,,188.462,191.709,"That’s right, Your Honor."
1975.75-312,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,404.994,411.678,"That provision that you -- that policy is not directly before that Court, and was invalidated by the District Court and you took no appeals, is that it?"
1975.75-312,0,36557,maureen_pulte_reilly,,411.678,413.114,"We took no appeal, Your Honor."
1975.75-312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,416.999,417.38,Yes.
1975.75-312,0,36557,maureen_pulte_reilly,,421.244,422.372,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.75-312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,435.907,442.987,"Before the Court of Appeals, in other words, a fortiori this, the other one would be invalidated in your submission?"
1975.75-312,0,36557,maureen_pulte_reilly,,442.987,461.163,"That is correct Your Honor, the other point I wish to make is that this provision was needed by council and considered by council because it took into consideration the aspect of protecting the families, the youth in the neighborhood."
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,1788.985,1793.191,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-312,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1850.443,1853.618,(Inaudible) she decided below?
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,1853.618,1855.215,"The question of vagueness, Your Honor?"
1975.75-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1872.471,1874.152,Did they raise it?
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,1874.152,1875.86,"Yes, Your Honor, in the lower court."
1975.75-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1904.136,1907.47,"Well, does this store advertise itself as an adult bookstore?"
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,1907.47,1916.995,"Well, of course we’re dealing with an adult theater but assuming that we were talking about an adult bookstore, yes, it probably would identify itself as an adult bookstore."
1975.75-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1918.7,1920.47,It’s another pretty good definition then?
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,1920.47,1931.55,"Your Honor, I would beg to differ with you on this basis taking the definition as it stands that could apply to virtually to any kind of a bookstore selling any kind of a material because we don’t know where the line is to be drawn."
1975.75-312,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1979.866,1981.566,"Not Adult theater, is it?"
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,1981.566,1982.348,Pardon?
1975.75-312,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1982.348,1990.342,"There’s no question about ambiguity about what an adult theater is because I understand, it was agreed that you didn’t let minors in."
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,1990.342,1991.262,"That would be correct, Your Honor."
1975.75-312,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1992.404,1994.359,I think (Inaudible) did?
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,1994.359,2004.291,"If that be the basis that the city stands and we don’t know that, then we can simply say that any R-rated film as rated by Motion Pictures Association would --"
1975.75-312,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2004.291,2008.119,The impression that you excluded everyone but adults?
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2008.119,2009.399,That would be correct Your Honor.
1975.75-312,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2009.399,2012.523,So that ergo is an adult theater?
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2012.523,2017.071,"That is correct as in so far as the Nortown Theatre goes, that would be correct."
1975.75-312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2017.774,2019.778,"Within the definition of the zoning ordinance, is it?"
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2019.778,2021.512,Pardon?
1975.75-312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2021.512,2031.135,I have the -- I’m looking at the ordinance on page 81 of this petition for a writ of certiorari.
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2031.345,2031.91,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2040.788,2044.424,What’s page beginning on page 80?
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2044.424,2046.809,I believe that’s a different ordinance Your Honor.
1975.75-312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2059.954,2060.762,The same definition?
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2060.762,2062.524,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2062.524,2073.864,And that doesn’t say anything there about -- there is nothing in that definition or that definition certainly is not confined to a theater that does not admit minors --
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2073.864,2074.792,That’s correct.
1975.75-312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2074.792,2076.594,"It is in quite different language, isn’t it?"
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2076.594,2078.538,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
1975.75-312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2086.869,2095.811,"And the theater that did not admit minors would not be an adult theater within this per se, under this ordinance, would it?"
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2095.811,2097.309,"Your Honor, we don’t know, that’s the problem."
1975.75-312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2097.309,2098.35,"Well, it doesn’t say anything about --"
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2098.35,2098.844,That’s correct.
1975.75-312,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2108.867,2113.249,And a theater that does more paying customers.
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2117.441,2118.915,That may be true Your Honor.
1975.75-312,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2120.494,2133.053,"I think this way, is in fact that the theater itself restricts itself to minor a piece of evidence that can be considered as to whether or not it is an adult theater?"
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2133.053,2150.888,"Again, my answer to that would be no, because there are many theaters which based upon a particular movie which would come to that particular theater at a particular time would exclude minors and we don’t know whether that theatre then would be an adult theater."
1975.75-312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.059,2161.582,"You’re not claiming the ordinance is vague as applied to your clients, you are in effect making an overbreadth analysis, and you claim standing to assert to claim some other business establishments?"
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2161.582,2162.109,"No, Your Honor."
1975.75-312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2176.27,2182.192,Can we doubt about the fact that this ordinance applies to the businesses operated by your clients?
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2182.192,2192.193,"Again, we have stipulated (Voice Overlap) that we do show materials of sexual in nature, so if that be the definition, which is what we will get into in a moment, yes."
1975.75-312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2196.691,2203.97,"So, you are really asserting that it’s vague as applied to other uses different from those put on by your own clients?"
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2203.97,2209.748,I am also asserting that it’s vague both as to apply to my client and to other uses.
1975.75-312,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2308.729,2327.479,"Mr. Taylor, do you think that the City of Detroit could have said in an ordinance that regulated uses such as those conducted by your client and pool halls and the other regulated could not be established within 600 feet of an elementary school?"
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2327.479,2332.152,Your Honor I think that would depend upon the interest asserted by the City of Detroit.
1975.75-312,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2332.152,2339.896,But what if they had asserted the interest that they don’t want elementary schools students coming and going from the school to be exposed to those kind of use?
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2339.896,2347.407,"My answer to the Court would be no, based upon the definition laid out here by this ordinance and the way this ordinance is written."
1975.75-312,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2364.382,2365.321,"Well, I realize that."
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2366.311,2367.653,"Yes sir, you’re right."
1975.75-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2513.59,2517.946,"As of this time, on generalities, there’s nothing in the record about what you are saying now or is there?"
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2517.946,2532.433,"Your Honor, on the contrary, there is an affidavit submitted by, I believe it’s Mr. Ravitz who’s a professor which is the basis of the ordinances -- this is the basis."
1975.75-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2537.146,2540.844,"But your generalities that as a result of that, people let their property go down."
1975.75-312,1,42182,stephen_m_taylor,,2544.351,2558.776,"Yes, as a matter of fact, Your Honor, in his affidavit he said specifically that whether it’s true or not, that the property is going down, people will act as if it’s going down, as if there is an effect upon in the neighborhood which is deleterious."
1975.75-312,2,33573,john_h_weston,,2886.166,2894.165,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-312,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2948.033,2949.099,How far does your argument go?
1975.75-312,2,33573,john_h_weston,,2969.188,2969.59,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-312,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2969.59,2976.085,"But is it -- your claim, if taken to its logical stream would be that it could not exclude from such an area any bookstore?"
1975.75-312,2,33573,john_h_weston,,2976.085,2976.678,"No Your Honor, not at all."
1975.75-312,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2976.678,2977.622,Or movie picture theater?
1975.75-312,2,33573,john_h_weston,,2977.622,2978.019,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1975.75-312,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2978.019,2978.375,Correct?
1975.75-312,2,33573,john_h_weston,,2978.375,2990.416,"We do not quarrel with the right of this municipality or any municipality to be able to zone in traditional way and in fact Detroit, this has been pointed out, does have the traditional zoning breakdown."
1975.75-312,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2990.416,2991.49,Traditional?
1975.75-312,2,33573,john_h_weston,,2991.49,2992.127,"No, I suppose --"
1975.75-312,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2992.127,2996.991,Why does a status quo have to be frozen terms of land use and planning?
1975.75-312,2,33573,john_h_weston,,2996.991,2999.492,I would say there is nothing required about that of course Your Honor.
1975.75-312,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3034.722,3039.297,But why isn’t that -- why isn’t that a violation in the First Amendment?
1975.75-312,2,33573,john_h_weston,,3039.297,3040.163,There may be other --
1975.75-312,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3040.163,3041.095,Under your argument?
1975.75-312,2,33573,john_h_weston,,3041.095,3060.786,"Well, because what we are saying is that there is a new inability constitutionally on the part of the municipality or other form of Government to discriminate against theaters on the basis of content where that material is entitled to presumptive protection consideration as these materials are."
1975.75-312,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3075.536,3087.797,Why would you say that a single family residential zone is sustainable if it excludes pool halls and theaters from it for example?
1975.75-312,2,33573,john_h_weston,,3091.321,3102.94,"Well it seem Your Honor, in particularly in light of the recent decision of this court in the Belle Terre case that there are interests which are supportable constitutionally in our municipal areas --"
1975.75-312,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3102.94,3104.425,(Inaudible)
1975.75-312,2,33573,john_h_weston,,3104.425,3111.399,"Well, I suppose the language of the Court is clear to preserve a certain environment, a healthy environment, a protective environment for --"
1975.75-312,3,36557,maureen_pulte_reilly,,3758.678,3759.461,Thank you Your Honor.
