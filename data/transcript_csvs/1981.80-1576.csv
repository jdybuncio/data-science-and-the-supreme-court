1981.80-1576,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,2.079,"Thank you gentleman, the case is submitted."
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,70.053,76.095,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,98.325,105.394,"Well, Mr. Katzenbach, doesn't it also involve whether Princeton should be here at all?"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,105.394,108.69,"It -- it does, Justice Rehnquist."
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,116.191,116.437,Well --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,116.437,117.899,-- my argument definitely?
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,117.899,142.367,"Ordinarily, in a state prosecution to address this, the matter is tried in the criminal courts and in this case, the Supreme Court of New Jersey said, “Although we think perhaps the Federal Constitution would not prohibit trespass."
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,162.193,170.896,"Princeton gets in, Your Honor, because it was invited by the Supreme Court of New Jersey to intervene in the case."
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,174.765,177.536,"But does that mean you're here, too, as well as in --"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,177.536,179.063,"I think so, yes."
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,205.222,216.131,And you couldn't -- you couldn't enforce or even try to enforce your rule again without -- which you might had been able to do if you hadn't been a party.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,216.131,217.604,That's correct.
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,256.253,256.37,But that --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,256.37,258.466,-- of the Supreme Court to be an intervener because --
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,258.466,258.661,That also --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,258.661,260.726,-- we've lost our rights of appeal as a result.
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,260.726,265.829,That also creates -- is sufficient to create a case of controversy between you and somebody.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,265.829,268.239,"I think it is real, yes, Your Honor, I do."
1981.80-1576,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,324.12,336.57,Is it possible Princeton made an imprudent decision to accept the invitation to intervene instead of declining that and volunteering to file a brief amicus?
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,336.57,339.301,Is it possible that was a mistake?
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,371.459,371.958,Mr. Katzenbach --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,371.958,374.453,-- the criminal prosecutor to intervene.
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,374.453,377.547,You heard our colloquy about mootness in the last case.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,385.331,407.152,"I don't believe so because I don't believe -- it is clear to me, Mr. Justice Stevens, that the regulation that Princeton now has which are in the brief are not consistent with the interpretation of the New Jersey Constitution made by the court below and I think that's very obvious."
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,407.152,415.714,"Well, is that -- is that a test or is it -- if he did precisely the same thing he did here that gave rise to the trespass prosecution, do we now violate your present regulation?"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,415.714,417.539,"Yes, because he never even asked for permission."
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,417.539,418.165,"Oh, I see."
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,418.165,423.077,And they presently -- that rule still tell you must ask for permission.
1981.80-1576,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,425.906,430.978,"Your new regulation was a response to this case, was it not?"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,430.978,432.628,"Not to the decision, Mr. Chief Justice."
1981.80-1576,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,432.628,434.622,Not to -- to the problem.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,434.622,436.203,"To the problem, yes."
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,449.243,450.637,But it still require a permission.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,450.637,451.29,But it still requires permission.
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,451.29,455.61,To which the court below had said was -- was improper.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,455.61,457.842,"Well, at least, which they did not require from this case."
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,457.842,458.499,Yes.
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,458.499,474.232,But you couldn't say of the same of the City of Mesquite that they decided they would be better to repeal a part of their ordinance than to try and enforce it.
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,474.232,474.79,But you didn't feel you're --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,474.79,484.768,That's a -- there's a difference surely between changing the rule of a private organization.
1981.80-1576,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,502.403,515.693,"Is there anything in the New Jersey Constitution or law or the Federal Constitution to prevent Princeton from putting a 20-foot wall around and, in fact, making it like a monastery of the Middle Ages if they wanted to?"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,515.693,521.851,"There may be a borough ordinance, Mr. Chief Justice, on the height of walls, but apart from that, I don't know of anything --"
1981.80-1576,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,521.851,523.123,Make it an 8-foot wall.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,523.123,532.795,"That would not prevent it, nor am I clear at the -- under the New Jersey Constitution that if they said, “If you want to keep everybody out, that you can do so.”"
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,546.443,554.871,Why is New Jersey required to respect private property at all except under the Eminent Domain Clause?
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,554.871,556.453,I missed the word there Justice.
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,557.503,570.485,"Respect private or set up a system of private property at all, except under the Eminent Domain Clause?"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,570.485,580.093,"Well, I would suppose that -- if you're suggesting Justice Rehnquist is that the State could --"
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,580.093,580.317,Could the --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,580.317,583.695,"If it is a private property, then I assume it is state property."
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,583.767,584.269,Well --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,584.269,585.436,-- I don't know what's in between.
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,585.436,585.683,Yes.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,591.514,593.528,Doesn't have to.
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,593.528,604.159,That it doesn't provide for any recorder of deeds and it simply says all lands shall be held in common by the residents of a State.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,604.159,606.924,I would suppose that would be a taking.
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,606.924,612.314,"Well, but if it had started out that way, wouldn't be a taking?"
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.314,612.906,"Well, Mr. Katzenbach I thought --"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,612.906,615.686,"If I suppose today at least, it would be a taking."
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,615.686,628.673,"Well, I thought the major part of your argument was that New Jersey's refusal to apply its trespass laws may not violate your property rights but your free speech rights."
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,628.673,633.78,"That is, but I don't – it's not a refusal really to address this right to enforce the trespass laws."
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,633.78,634.583,"Well, no, it's --"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,634.583,635.932,It is -- it is saying --
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.932,637.002,Is -- is the judgment saying --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,637.002,639.529,-- that nobody has a right to be on our property.
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,641.075,644.45,I know but you -- you objected on grounds as I understand it that --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,644.45,644.967,Yes.
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,644.967,646.902,-- that is -- is on free speech ground.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,648.072,648.281,We object to --
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,648.281,648.961,-- property rights.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,648.961,653.574,"We object to it on both, but I think with one possible exception."
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,749.145,749.662,Mr. Katzenbach (Voice Overlap) --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,749.662,752.147,-- even the -- where they have been overruled.
1981.80-1576,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,752.147,755.643,You've put PruneYard and Marsh together?
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,755.643,761.628,I have put PruneYard and Marsh together Justice Marshall for only -- for only one purpose to serve.
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,830.017,842.794,"Mr. Katzenbach, it seems to me that you're arguing with the test they proposed might lead to situations in which the intruder makes an expression that's offensive to what the university wants to express and thereby offend the university's --"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,842.794,843.102,Yes.
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.102,844.154,-- rights to expression.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,855.773,859.782,"Whether what Mr. Schmid did or not, the -- the rule that they put."
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,859.782,860.521,But do we have anything before it?
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,860.521,861.113,"Well, I think."
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,863.414,868.46,"And the reason the case is here is because, if you lose, he can go back and do exactly the same thing all over again."
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,868.46,872.744,And so can anybody else.
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.744,873.103,And how does that interfere --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,873.103,874.318,And so can anybody else at Princeton --
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,874.318,876.426,How does that interfere with anything that you want to do with your property?
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,876.426,877.315,"Well, I would --"
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,877.315,879.831,Just this limited thing that he's done.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,879.831,897.97,"If Princeton is restricted as the New Jersey Court says it is, to governmental standards of time, place and manner, and it got that way because Princeton has such an open policy and let people up on the campus, then I assume that that is the only control."
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,961.187,974.959,"Mr. Katzenbach, you said a moment ago, if Princeton is to be reduced to the status of a governmental body like New Jersey, actually Princeton is in a sense a creature of New Jersey, is it not?"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,977.082,979.158,"Yes, Justice, the Dartmouth College."
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,979.158,979.399,Yes.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,979.399,980.474,"It did, yes."
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,980.474,999.114,So that -- I mean isn't it in a sense of business or a private institution that is regulated by the laws of the State subject to any constitutional provisions of the U.S. Constitution there -- to the contrary?
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,999.114,1006.89,"If I understand you correctly Justice Rehnquist, you are suggesting that it is in effect no different from a state university."
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1006.89,1007.211,Yes.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1007.211,1014.636,And I -- I don't accept that because I think that it is different from a state university.
1981.80-1576,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1030.366,1048.86,"I suppose if a GM has a plant in New Jersey, it derives its authority in some way from the states, either as a foreign corporation doing business or a New Jersey corporation, if so, would they fall under this band that has been discussed?"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1048.86,1051.162,I would -- I would think not.
1981.80-1576,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1052.677,1056.334,"In other words they could say, “We're making automobiles here, not speeches”."
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1056.334,1077.673,"Yes, but I think we're -- yes, and I don't see, they -- they would, but if the general public were invited under the GM premises at various times under the New Jersey decision then people would have rights to make various speeches there if those rights did interfere with the assembly line and so forth, and so on."
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1087.551,1090.144,I wonder if that's a fair statement there in the opinion.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1115.168,1116.812,"By time, place and manner only (Voice Overlap)."
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1116.812,1119.298,"Well, it -- I don't know exactly what they mean but they say --"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1119.298,1121.901,"That's what they say for Princeton, at least."
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1121.901,1122.177,Well --
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.177,1123.624,"It could say, “You cannot require --"
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1123.624,1129.421,It say -- it contained no standards aside from the requirement for invitation from -- they say you had no standards whatsoever.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1139.147,1140.091,But -- but the standard --
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1140.091,1143.195,"The only standard, as I understand it was permission."
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1143.333,1145.012,That he'd have permission?
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1145.012,1146.041,Plus invitation.
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.041,1148.174,Right.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1148.174,1148.349,And they --
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1148.349,1150.401,And they say you got to do something more than that --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1150.401,1150.482,They would --
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1150.482,1150.808,-- then they would say (Voice Overlap) --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1150.808,1152.502,They have to do something more than that.
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1160.553,1172.884,"Well, they say that if you want to operate a university and to say that the legislature passed such a statute that said, “Until you pass some kind of a -- of a regulation, you must let people on for reasonable expressive activities.”"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1175.126,1179.348,I believe -- I believe it would for two reasons.
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1179.348,1181.075,"So, I guess you have to be arguing that, yes."
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1181.075,1181.742,For two reasons.

1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1201.056,1205.727,"To -- yes, to require that."
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1205.727,1215.946,Just like saying to the newspaperman that you should -- he should be required to put certain kinds of things on your paper.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1215.946,1217.043,I think it goes that far.
1981.80-1576,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1221.361,1225.473,"Mr. Katzenbach, I'd like to ask you about two different areas."
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1246.835,1249.642,"Well, let me suggest Justice O'Connor."
1981.80-1576,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1357.249,1366.293,"So, if New Jersey were to say that no college or university campus may exclude anyone, you would be satisfied."
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1366.293,1373.651,"No, I would not Justice O'Connor unless there was a compelling state reason for it and I can't see it."
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1408.397,1416.907,It's got to do -- are private universities in New Jersey subject to any kind of certification or --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1416.907,1417.956,Yes.
1981.80-1576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1417.956,1419.577,By the state?
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1419.577,1422.469,"For accreditation on the (Inaudible) of giving, they are, yes."
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1422.469,1423.743,Well --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1423.743,1423.896,And that's about --
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1423.896,1437.22,"In that -- in that sense they tell you what kind of expression you can have at least indirectly, they don't order you this course or that course but you either live up to the standards or you're out of business."
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1437.22,1440.304,"As a practical matter, Justice White, that is true."
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1440.304,1440.686,Well --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1440.686,1441.049,That is --
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1441.049,1441.449,And how about the legal --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1441.449,1442.005,I think that (Voice Overlap) --
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1442.005,1442.109,How about a legal matter?
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1442.109,1443.944,-- they can't stop you from --
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.944,1445.541,How about a legal matter?
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1445.541,1446.777,"As a -- well, no."
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1447.615,1447.876,"Well, isn't this --"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1447.876,1448.237,-- I don't think they can stop you --
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1448.237,1448.968,-- isn't this a state --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1448.968,1449.749,-- from teaching it.
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1451.335,1456.682,Isn't this -- isn't this -- doesn't the state insist that you live up to a certain standard --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1456.682,1456.869,Minimal standard.
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1456.869,1458.403,-- in your expressive activities?
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1458.403,1459.285,Yes.
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1464.982,1465.901,Fraud reasons?
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1466.646,1468.084,But I would have problems with that.
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1468.084,1472.398,"You're saying if you want to purport to be an educational institution, you have to --"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1472.398,1473.104,Have certain minimal standards.
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1473.104,1474.475,You have to -- exactly.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1474.475,1474.892,Yes.
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1477.458,1480.017,Was that really much different in terms of the First Amendment than --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1480.017,1481.784,"Oh, I think tremendously --"
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1481.784,1482.269,Why?
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1485.449,1488.59,"Oh, we're not saying, they're not saying."
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1506.442,1506.716,Would you say --
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1506.716,1508.085,-- it was down to.
1981.80-1576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1508.085,1515.821,Would you say that New Jersey couldn't allow a police officer to come on the Princeton campus?
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1515.821,1517.621,"Of course not, I mean, of course not."
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1531.87,1533.252,Or offering a course.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1533.252,1536.239,Or offering a course or doing something of that kind.
1981.80-1576,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1569.171,1573.147,"Mr. Katzenbach, I'd like to go back to the standing issue again --"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1573.147,1573.463,Yes.
1981.80-1576,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1573.463,1576.066,-- if I may.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1590.964,1590.976,I believe --
1981.80-1576,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1590.976,1599.621,Don't we have to determine that question anew from a federal standpoint?
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1599.621,1602.695,I don't believe so Justice O'Connor.
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1626.964,1627.438,"Well, the argument --"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1627.438,1628.727,-- federal rules as well.
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1628.727,1652.654,"The argument you gave awhile ago though Mr. Katzenbach would have -- would have purported to suffice to -- that even if it's a federal question, I think you probably will find that it is a federal question but -- but you say that if it's a standing question and just an Article III question, in case of controversy, and you say that you've lost your --"
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1652.654,1653.318,That's right.
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1653.318,1654.847,-- that you're bound by a judgment.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1654.847,1655.943,That's right.
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1657.491,1657.762,Yes.
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1657.762,1665.542,"If you don't give standing, then you got to do something about not being bound by a judgment or it seems to me where you have been left and in a virtually --"
1981.80-1576,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1665.542,1668.084,"Well, it doesn't mean though that it's not a federal question."
1981.80-1576,0,37162,nicholas_deb_katzenbach,,1668.084,1668.98,"No, it does not mean."
1981.80-1576,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1694.984,1696.831,Mr. Levinson.
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,1696.831,1699.395,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1981.80-1576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1741.383,1755.774,"Mr. Levinson, do you think that the -- the result of this judgment is that -- is that -- and the main thrust of it is that Princeton is no longer permitted to keep this person off the campus?"
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,1755.774,1755.893,That --
1981.80-1576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1755.893,1757.507,Or use self-help against him?
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,1757.507,1761.263,That would certainly be one plausible reading of right duties.
1981.80-1576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1761.263,1768.766,"Well -- well, so that -- so that the case involves more than the constitutional right to have New Jersey enforce its trespass statute."
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,1773.065,1775.116,That is a potential issue.
1981.80-1576,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1860.404,1866.431,"Mr. Levinson, they haven't repudiated their position that they have they -- the man has to ask to come on the campus."
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,1866.431,1868.564,"We don't challenge that, Your Honor."
1981.80-1576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.564,1871.929,But they're barred from having such a provision.
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,1871.929,1876.665,They are barred from having a -- they are barred presumably.
1981.80-1576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.773,1933.488,"But you know what, in some cases from -- some cases from state courts when there has been a change of law after a judgment of the state court, we have, not always but sometimes, vacated and remanded for reconsideration in light of the new rule or the new statutory provision."
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,1935.583,1935.717,Because --
1981.80-1576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1935.717,1940.407,We then -- we then would -- we then -- they could then decide whether or not --
1981.80-1576,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1940.407,1942.849,These rules were before the judgment though.
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,1943.132,1943.943,"Yes, sir."
1981.80-1576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1946.916,1947.438,"Well, that's right."
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,1947.672,1948.607,-- of the New Jersey Supreme Court.
1981.80-1576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1948.607,1962.08,"And what did they -- and so -- but -- well then a fortiori, wouldn't they then require a -- or -- or outlaw any requirement that they ask for permission?"
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,1970.256,1989.921,"The prohibition -- I think it is true that if Princeton have not changed its rules at all not only with the trespass law not be enforceable but certainly, he would argue that a tort suit would be equally unenforceable."
1981.80-1576,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2010.852,2012.35,I am not sure they said that.
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,2018.348,2020.744,"Yes, sir, that's right, Justice Stevens but --"
1981.80-1576,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2020.744,2022.865,They didn't really pass on the validity of the new rule.
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,2022.865,2041.299,They did not legally pass on the validity in the sense of declaring that the rules are constitutional but I think the most plausible reading of that particular opinion is that the new rules are precisely the kinds of rules that would pass master in a proper case.
1981.80-1576,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2041.299,2045.37,And so that if the same problem arose again maybe Princeton would win.
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,2045.37,2050.833,"Oh, yes, in New Jersey under the existing rules of Princeton University."
1981.80-1576,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2190.051,2197.111,"Well it -- it is said that it will stay the hand of the State of New Jersey in prosecuting Schmid, hasn't it?"
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,2197.111,2197.613,"Pardon, Your Honor?"
1981.80-1576,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2197.613,2209.802,"I mean, the holding was it would -- it would stay the hand of the prosecutors in New Jersey from prosecuting Schmid under an ordinance for trespass."
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,2209.802,2211.74,"Yes sir, that's correct."
1981.80-1576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2891.835,2900.569,"Mr. Levinson, could Congress do the same thing here in the District of Columbia with respect to Georgetown and George Washington or Catholic University?"
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,2900.569,2921.85,"If one assumes as I recall that the constitution does give Congress the power to regulate of -- the District of Columbia, I would be prepare to argue, yes, if Georgetown came before this Court arguing, no, the reason would be free exercise, not academic freedom."
1981.80-1576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2921.85,2922.878,George Washington?
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,2922.878,2925.883,"George Washington, without a doubt."
1981.80-1576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2925.883,2926.918,"Without a doubt, what?"
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,2926.918,2933.018,That Congress could pass a law of -- in behalf of defending the values --
1981.80-1576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2933.018,2941.217,Saying that George Washington you must allow in your campus certain kinds of speech but you can keep others' speech off.
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,2941.217,2972.754,"Yes, you could keep those who wish to sell pizzas or engage in commercial speech off but Congress could, I think, require George Washington at least and perhaps at most to adapt the kinds of rules adapted by Princeton University subsequent to the initiation of this case and de facto upheld by the New Jersey Supreme Court in its decision that is before you."
1981.80-1576,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2972.754,2973.63,I'm not sure.
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,3013.734,3027.965,I am stating that the decision on appeal before this Court certainly does not extend that far because the opinion bends over backwards to what the educational policy of the institution in question.
1981.80-1576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3028.165,3029.489,What are you submitting?
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,3029.489,3046.474,What I am submitting is that the college raised in hypothetical by Chief Justice Burger could put forth serious free exercise claims that might well lead this Court to say that public power have gone too far.
1981.80-1576,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3106.455,3114.971,Let me change my hypothetical from advocacy of abortion to advocacy of Marxism.
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,3121.372,3122.345,A Marxist --
1981.80-1576,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3122.345,3127.587,-- to come over and say why we should convert to Marxism.
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,3127.587,3138.119,The facts of the case before us deal with someone participating in the American political process trying to pass out information for candidates --
1981.80-1576,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3138.119,3140.06,But I was asking a hypothetical question --
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,3140.06,3140.408,-- beyond --
1981.80-1576,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3140.408,3141.372,-- to test your argument.
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,3141.372,3175.989,-- someone -- if a state legislature or Congress in your initial hypothetical or the people in their constitution said that the importance of the free trade in ideas and exposure to diversity that has been emphasized as the root meaning of academic freedom of -- in opinions by this Court over many years that that commitment to diversity of expressing required entrée to a private university.
1981.80-1576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3180.283,3199.255,"And you would say -- and I think if you would say if it were -- if it were -- you would say there'd be a difference between a Catholic University and American University, you would say you would -- you would value the religious freedom claim higher than the free speech claim."
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,3199.255,3204.241,"I am saying that in one, there is a free exercise claim --"
1981.80-1576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3204.241,3205.196,Yes.
1981.80-1576,1,41681,sanford_levinson,,3205.196,3208.192,-- that poses serious constitutional problems.
