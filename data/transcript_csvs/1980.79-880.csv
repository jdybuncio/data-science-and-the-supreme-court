1980.79-880,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.795,We will hear arguments next in Kissinger v. Halperin.
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,78.157,81.749,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-880,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,309.048,313.734,Was that 21 months after it had been installed?
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,313.734,316.045,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.79-880,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,363.027,372.055,"I notice, Mr. Solicitor General, that the Respondents here are Morton Halperin, et al., and that's the members of his family?"
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,372.055,374.836,"These are his wife and children, yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.79-880,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,374.836,375.085,And that's it?
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,375.804,377.914,They are the respondents.
1980.79-880,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,377.914,379.225,The plaintiffs were all Halperins?
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,379.225,381.474,The plaintiffs are all Halperins.
1980.79-880,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,448.914,453.116,Can I just clear up one point of confusion on my part?
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,458.677,459.943,--We did not petition.
1980.79-880,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,459.943,460.756,--You did not petition that; right.
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,460.756,462.504,"That's correct, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.79-880,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,938.875,943.076,Does this go for the entire staff of the President?
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,943.076,950.417,"Mr. Justice White, we think that we can avoid that question here, because we submit--"
1980.79-880,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,950.417,953.181,You'll just go no farther than necessary down the line?
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,953.181,953.713,--That's right.
1980.79-880,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,953.713,970.892,"Well, is it your submission that it works both ways, that if... not only for advice to the President, but the execution of acts or duties or statements that the President directs a subordinate to commit?"
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,970.892,974.078,"We think Mr. Justice White, that these are separate things."
1980.79-880,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.56,983.497,Which one is that?
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,983.497,989.12,"Well, we feel that that should be the basis for the disposition of this litigation--"
1980.79-880,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,989.12,989.714,All right.
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,994.086,997.537,--We think there should be an absolute immunity for both.
1980.79-880,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,997.537,999.146,For both... either kinds of?
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,999.146,1008.112,"For either or both, but we think the Court can avoid determining whether the subordinate has an absolute immunity at all."
1980.79-880,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1008.112,1009.298,I understand that; I understand that.
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1015.39,1022.169,It's executing the orders of the President and so therefore it would be derivative of his absolute--
1980.79-880,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1022.169,1023.622,And so we don't need to get to giving him advice?
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1023.622,1027.636,--We submit it; it is not necessary to dispose of this case.
1980.79-880,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1027.636,1031.618,"Well, how big a list does that include?"
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1031.618,1036.975,"Well, we think, again... I can't answer that, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1980.79-880,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1036.975,1044.504,"Well, don't we have to in an opinion, say, that certain people have this great immunity end others don't?"
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1044.504,1045.862,I think we can focus--
1980.79-880,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1045.862,1049.314,Or do we leave the same worry in their minds?
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1049.314,1062.871,"--I think we can focus on the petitioners in this case and say that they have it, and we can wait until another day to determine whether someone with lesser rank in the executive department should enjoy it."
1980.79-880,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1062.871,1067.901,"Well, they have in this case because of the derivative immunity that they enjoy from the presidential immunity."
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1069.166,1073.242,"If we follow that approach, we needn't reach the question, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-880,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1073.242,1074.647,"Well, is that anybody the President asks?"
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1079.02,1081.801,"I would think not, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1980.79-880,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1081.801,1082.91,"Well, should we say so?"
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1082.91,1086.455,I think it's not involved in this case.
1980.79-880,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1089.141,1098.747,"I think the whole thing is... I personally think the whole thing's involved, as to how far a president can go in authorizing individuals to violate people's rights."
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1098.747,1113.052,"Well, the derivative immunity which we claim for him would protect these persons here without determining what inherent immunity they themselves possess."
1980.79-880,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1113.052,1123.252,"And this is true because they're acting in effectuation of a specific program for which he, personally, was specifically responsible?"
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1123.252,1124.362,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.79-880,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1124.362,1134.482,"And because the same argument, I suppose, could be made for any White House aide who's acting in accord with general authority given by a president."
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1134.482,1143.291,"We submit, to focus on another branch of government, it's clear that a judge acting in his judicial capacity has an absolute immunity."
1980.79-880,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1160.033,1165.658,What kind of derivative immunity have we allowed to members of the Senate or the Congress?
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1165.658,1184.853,"Where the... in the Gravel case, where the legislator himself would enjoy immunity, if the chief counsel of a committee acted at his direction, he would be protected by the derivative immunity."
1980.79-880,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.653,1221.885,Would that also apply to the FBI agents who did the actual listening?
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1221.885,1222.479,--I think it should.
1980.79-880,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1227.805,1228.258,And the phone company?
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1228.258,1236.334,"Well, the telephone company is out of the case, Mr. Justice Marshall, and I would prefer to let them speak for themselves if I don't have to."
1980.79-880,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1236.334,1242.191,"Mr. Solicitor General, you have mentioned the Speech and Debate Clause."
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1253.123,1266.821,"I don't think so, Mr. Justice Blackmun, although the opinion in this case and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia dwelled at some length on the absence of a specific constitutional grant of immunity."
1980.79-880,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1307.164,1315.896,"Mr. Solicitor General, I have a vague recollection that Chief Justice Warren addressed this question in some case; that is, the derivative immunity."
1980.79-880,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1319.659,1323.408,--It may have been the Gravel case.
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,1951.733,1959.01,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-880,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2052.441,2055.049,That was Colonel Haig at that time?
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2055.049,2055.565,I'm sorry.
1980.79-880,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2084.679,2088.584,To whom was that information conveyed by the FBI?
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2088.584,2096.253,In some instances it was related by Assistant Director Sullivan through Haig.
1980.79-880,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2148.343,2149.422,Who had possession of the logs?
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2150.92,2151.779,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1980.79-880,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2151.779,2154.262,The logs of the wiretaps.
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2155.403,2165.226,The actual logs were kept at the FBI summaries were made and sent over to the White House.
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2208.896,2218.455,"Could I ask, at some point in this process there was a presidential authorization or an order for the imposition of wiretaps?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2218.455,2218.924,Yes.
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.688,2225.765,"Well, now, there was an order like that?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2225.765,2226.421,There was an order.
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2226.421,2227.857,And he didn't do it out of the blue.
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2229.607,2230.092,That's right.
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.092,2232.466,And they advised him to do it?
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2234.855,2236.09,"No, no."
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.459,2253.896,He never ordered it?
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2253.896,2260.282,"But so far as we know, Nixon did not target Kissinger at the beginning of the wiretap."
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2260.282,2260.532,I know.
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2262.453,2266.327,The wiretapping of Halperin?
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2266.327,2269.638,"No, just any wiretap, for this purpose?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2270.685,2271.981,"He said, use it if necessary."
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2275.307,2275.964,All right.
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2279.572,2285.147,"He said... yes, he said that to... well, he very simply said, I want it done."
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2285.147,2293.91,"So, if Kissinger participated in the imposition of the taps, it isn't... you aren't suggesting that he was acting without authority?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2293.91,2298.735,In the selecting of people?
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2300.048,2306.857,So he was exercising the authority that the presidential order anticipated that he carry out?
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2306.857,2307.451,Yes.
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2313.324,2314.574,I understand you have--
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2314.574,2316.103,And Halperin fit Within none of those.
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2316.853,2323.601,"--But nevertheless, Kissinger was acting within the Scope of his authority?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2323.601,2327.551,"--Yes, except that he--"
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2327.551,2328.63,And within the scope of the order?
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2328.63,2335.44,"--Yes, subject of course to the limitation that the Fourth Amendment places on the exercise of this authority."
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.44,2336.626,"Oh, I understand that; yes."
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2336.626,2338.016,I didn't want to lose that.
1980.79-880,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2367.052,2370.988,"Well, that per se is not a constitutional violation, is it?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2370.988,2372.502,--No.
1980.79-880,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2373.642,2377.797,I thought your lawsuit was based upon a violation of the Constitution?
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2377.797,2380.047,--That's our cause of action--
1980.79-880,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2380.047,2380.469,The order.
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2385.763,2387.325,--Yes.
1980.79-880,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2405.364,2410.315,"Now, what you've told us might be a reason that it was a constitutional violation."
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2410.315,2411.127,--Yes.
1980.79-880,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2411.127,2413.846,And it wasn't a bona fide foreign security tap.
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2413.846,2414.157,Yes.
1980.79-880,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2536.67,2541.652,At this period was Dr. Halperin still on the staff?
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2541.652,2542.042,--No.
1980.79-880,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2579.839,2583.385,And did he ever thereafter return to government employment?
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2583.385,2584.073,"No, he hasn't."
1980.79-880,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2595.161,2604.704,"Mr. Lynch, for purposes of the President's immunity, is there a difference between the period from May, '69, to May, '70, and the period after May, '70?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2604.704,2608.563,"Our case gets... clearly gets much stronger after May, 1970."
1980.79-880,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2608.563,2609.889,"But legally, is there a legal difference between the two?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2609.889,2612.67,With respect--
1980.79-880,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2612.67,2616.81,"The difference is one just of motive, and motive would be irrelevant under absolute immunity."
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2616.81,2617.372,--That's right.
1980.79-880,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2623.073,2628.054,"So if you're right after May '70, you're also right before May, 1970?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2628.054,2629.32,--Yes.
1980.79-880,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2629.32,2647.047,"And of course, if there's absolute presidential immunity, there's absolute presidential immunity, and that would apply if a President should go out and put his hand over the mouth of a private citizen so the private citizen couldn't speak."
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2647.047,2647.358,Sure.
1980.79-880,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2654.231,2654.528,Exactly.
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2654.528,2656.84,We think that's no way to run a government.
1980.79-880,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2656.84,2670.193,"Is that a fair statement of the Government's position, because they argue there should be a functional analysis of what the President does, just as the judge would not be immune if he went out and wrestled somebody to ground in something totally unrelated to judicial proceeding."
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2671.333,2675.41,"They haven't suggested any limiting factor that I can discern, Your Honor."
1980.79-880,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2675.41,2676.879,--They do make this functional analysis--
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2681.423,2682.751,"But if... yes, yes."
1980.79-880,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2697.807,2701.259,"Well, would you say he's absolutely immune when he signs a bill into law, for example?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2701.259,2702.337,Yes.
1980.79-880,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2703.415,2707.163,"So, you would agree there is some absolute immunity for the President?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2707.163,2707.851,--I would.
1980.79-880,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2721.345,2722.47,"Well, there's no cause of action there?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2722.47,2725.578,--A district court would throw the case out very quickly.
1980.79-880,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2725.578,2733.872,"Well, it could very quickly, but is he entitled to absolute immunity, which would mean he's entitled to win on a motion to dismiss without any showing of facts other than that all he did was sign a bill?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2739.839,2742.76,"And it's a slippery slope, to try to decide where to draw the line."
1980.79-880,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2745.274,2746.102,"And I know you'd prefer not to, but--"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2746.102,2749.693,--with a very broad expansion in some areas.
1980.79-880,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2749.693,2752.973,--But do you seriously contend that he has no absolutely immunity?
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2757.065,2759.362,"Practically, I don't contend that; no."
1980.79-880,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2777.776,2781.228,But didn't you just admit the partisan political purposes are only relevant to motive?
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2784.555,2786.774,--That's true.
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2790.115,2806.577,"Well, Mr. Lynch, is there any decision in this Court or any other court that you know of that in talking about executive immunity that suggests that it ever has extended or should extend to criminal immunity... immunity from crime?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2806.577,2807.608,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2808.687,2812.653,"Aside from the Speech or Debate Clause, which is of constitutional dimension?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2812.653,2815.075,--And which is very limited to legislative activity.
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2815.075,2821.602,"So, you don't think the Government's suggesting that the President's absolutely immune under the criminal laws, do you?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2821.602,2824.68,"No, I don't think they do suggest that."
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2825.618,2828.412,"Then don't say that they are suggesting it, that their immunity is unlimited."
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2828.412,2831.364,"--Well, it's unlimited with respect to civil suits."
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2831.364,2841.908,"And even within the area of performing his presidential duties, I don't see any suggestion that he's immune from violating the criminal laws."
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2841.908,2844.906,"I didn't mean to suggest that, Mr. Justice White."
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2850.826,2859.212,"Well, then, but you said a minute ago the Government was suggesting that the President could go out and torture someone into making a confession and that he would be immune under their theory."
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2860.775,2863.18,"If, for a civil suit by the victim?"
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2863.18,2869.022,"No, I said, you said he would be immune from having subjected someone to torture."
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2869.022,2871.77,Under the Government's argument--
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2871.77,2872.88,You mean under civil liability?
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2872.88,2874.863,--Civil liability would be immune.
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2874.863,2875.316,Not criminal?
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2875.316,2875.799,Not criminal.
1980.79-880,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2882.75,2889.545,"Then, on the civil side, would you say that that automatically excluded any recovery against the Government as such?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2891.606,2897.837,That depends on the vagaries of whether you can recover under the federal tort claims actions.
1980.79-880,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2899.212,2902.117,"There may or may not be a recovery there, under the civil side?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2902.117,2902.804,--Yes.
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2907.537,2919.158,"And, Mr. Lynch, do you think the Government suggests that a course of conduct by the President is not subject to an injunction suit or a declaratory judgment?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2919.158,2920.437,"--No, they don't suggest that."
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2920.437,2927.279,"So that it's just damages we're talking about, not just immune from civil suit, but from damages?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2927.279,2927.638,They want to--
1980.79-880,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2927.638,2928.591,That's what we're talking about?
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2928.591,2929.091,--That's right.
1980.79-880,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3023.32,3025.99,But you seem to concede that judges are above the law.
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,3025.99,3027.615,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-880,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3092.151,3100.023,"Number one, you couldn't go publicly out in a courtroom or anyplace publicly and ask for permission to tap somebody's phone."
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,3102.302,3102.63,Of course not.
1980.79-880,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3104.052,3106.505,"Case number one, which makes it a little different."
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,3119.656,3122.217,"No, generally that has to be conducted privately."
1980.79-880,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3122.217,3134.884,"So that, while all of our proceedings and all other judicial proceedings can be conducted in the open, you concede that all the executive functions cannot be in the open?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,3134.884,3135.259,That's right.
1980.79-880,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3143.629,3146.581,does it not also argue equally for?
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,3146.581,3165.262,"Well, I think if you're worried about the disclosure of state secrets, for example, that privilege is absolute, and if a damage claimant runs into a properly claimed state secret privilege assertion, he may well lose the suit."
1980.79-880,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3266.549,3282.526,"What areas of the function of a governor must be conducted with great secrecy and privacy as compared with a President or the Secretary of State, and Secretary of Defense, for example."
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,3282.526,3292.601,"Well, for example, the government of Governor Rhodes in Scheuer was dealing with an insurrection at Kent State University, and he had to decide how to deploy the National Guard."
1980.79-880,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3292.601,3296.241,"That was a question, whether he was dealing with an insurrection, was it not?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,3296.241,3301.238,"Well, it was... it was a very violent and turbulent situation."
1980.79-880,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3307.11,3313.858,Do you consider that comparable to dealing with some of our active adversaries in the world?
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,3313.858,3333.85,"No, I think the President, because the President's responsibility in dealing in foreign policy is even more complex, more difficult to put your finger on the optimum right course, as Judge Leventhal called it, the President's immunity is very great at that level."
1980.79-880,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3343.44,3350.092,"Mr. Lynch, let's think about World War II."
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,3380.581,3392.389,"If it was... if the effort was solely to identify the source of the leak during World War II, I would say that's a national security foreign policy problem."
1980.79-880,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3402.228,3407.663,"So the purpose could shift, even though it started out quite properly, could it?"
1980.79-880,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,3407.663,3408.882,That's entirely possible.
1980.79-880,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3560.448,3562.367,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
