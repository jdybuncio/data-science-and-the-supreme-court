1974.73-820,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.342,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in Number 73-820, United States against Guana-Sanchez."
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,16.067,19.528,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-820,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,74.055,77.954,"To suppress the statements made, where and when were they made, or are you going to get to that I guess?"
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,77.954,83.5,"Yes, I'm going to go through the facts in some detail because I think it's very important to the resolution of the case."
1974.73-820,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,294.891,295.899,What was the question?
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,295.899,300.051,The question to the passengers was “Do you have any identification?”
1974.73-820,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,310.994,312.21,Respondent was the driver?
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,312.21,318.396,"The respondent was the driver, the other three, passengers in his car."
1974.73-820,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,466.562,468.835,He's free to leave alone --
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,468.835,469.784,Free to leave alone.
1974.73-820,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,539.863,541.288,That is the check of the driver's license --
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,541.288,541.665,Of the driver's license.
1974.73-820,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,541.665,543.09,-- of the respondent alone?
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,543.09,545.226,The respondent's license alone.
1974.73-820,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,603.753,606.368,"Well now, you speak of the respondent's arrest."
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,609.252,613.545,It's our position that -- we're talking about when they left the car?
1974.73-820,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,613.545,613.633,Yes.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,613.633,616.934,It's our position that respondent was not arrested.
1974.73-820,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,681.79,685.101,Let me see if I have the facts here now.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,694.886,696.373,That's correct.
1974.73-820,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,696.373,702.338,And the man who had -- the passenger who had identification and the driver followed in their car?
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,702.338,702.817,That's correct.
1974.73-820,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,702.817,704.763,Was a police officer placed in their car?
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,704.763,710.219,"No, there was not."
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,733.855,746.839,Aren't you assuming something though that the officers had the right to hold the respondent after he had identified himself?
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,746.839,747.096,Well --
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,747.096,750.09,And showed that he had his proper papers.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,756.576,758.024,They would let him go right away.
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,758.024,776.021,"Now so that assumed -- you were assuming that when you stop -- if the officer was entitled to go over and ask somebody driver a car to identify himself and show his license, you're assuming that they also have the right to have the passengers identify themselves?"
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,776.021,779.275,We're assuming that it's reasonable to ask passengers in a car to identify themselves.
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,779.275,782.167,"Yes, and let's assume that it is not."
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,802.435,805.449,Well we would not concede he was being held at all.
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,808.054,809.894,You've already said you wouldn't let them go.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,809.894,818.131,"No, what the officer said in his testimony was that he wouldn't be permitted to leave so long as the passengers were still with him."
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,818.131,818.319,Exactly.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,818.319,819.974,But if the passengers had been separated --
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,819.974,820.82,Let's assume though.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,843.009,850.262,"Well, I think it's difficult to assume that you have no business holding them for the brief time it would take to get them out of his car."
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,860.042,865.651,"You posted that he'd be able to drive away as soon as he identifies himself, and you said “No, just hold on a minute."
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,873.615,882.957,"Well, if four people are walking down the street and there's reason to arrest three of them, you can take those three people and separate them from the other individual."
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,890.869,896.107,-- get this question if you had some right and if you had some proper business with the passengers.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,896.107,897.193,"Well, that you --"
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,897.193,901.173,And that you may hold the driver while you complete your business with the passengers.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,904.077,910.878,"Well we think that the right to go up to some individuals, whether they be on a street or in an automobile and ask them some questions."
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,918.529,925.773,What -- now you're doing on an automobile and you're holding one person while you complete your business with another.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,928.266,936.179,"There's a case in the -- I remember a lot of stop cases of course, but --"
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,936.179,940.95,-- it seems to me a rather fundamental point in this case.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,940.95,943.283,Well we don't think that that point is in this case.
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,946.237,959.219,"-- it seems -- assuming that if you're dealing with the passengers as illegal, it seems to me whatever developed from the passengers is arguably at least a fruit of detaining the driver."
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,959.219,967.679,"Well, we think that the Court of Appeals did not deal with anything that happened in that car and say it was illegal."
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.382,983.987,Let me ask you something else.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1002.043,1007.919,Then we think it's certainly arguable that he's got standing to complain.
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1007.919,1016.356,"Yes, I would think he would because he is -- because they have invaded his car and in effect seized something out of his car which is a protected area."
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1016.356,1018.59,But the car is a protected area.
1974.73-820,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1019.526,1031.564,"Isn't that illustrated clearly in this case, because when they got to the police station, they found a revolver in the glove compartment of the car presumable belonging to the driver."
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1036.924,1037.56,That's correct.
1974.73-820,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1039.505,1059.655,"And it would be reasonably assumed can it that someone concluded that that pistol fit precisely under what Mr. Justice White has just postulated namely, they had come into the possession of that pistol by invading the privacy of the driver's car?"
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1059.655,1072.024,"Well let's assume that -- let's assume police break into a man's house illegally without a warrant but knowing that a henchman of his is there, and they arrest the henchman."
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1080.962,1084.116,I'm not sure that the answer to that is clear because I think you then get to this whole question --
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1084.116,1089.952,"Well it seems to me you have to say that they can use it, because they seized these passengers out of this man's car here."
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1089.952,1091.609,Well I don't think they seized them out of the car.
1974.73-820,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1109.619,1118.349,Nobody suggested that you've got probable cause to have arrested those people or to take them on the spot at all.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1118.349,1120.453,"Well, I'm perfectly willing to suggest that."
1974.73-820,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1130.507,1133.382,It's been kind of a long period of time.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1133.382,1141.457,"They stopped the car at 2:30 A.M., and all of these times were accurate because they're recorded in the radio log."
1974.73-820,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1150.608,1151.886,This was 17 minutes.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1156.834,1157.363,That's correct.
1974.73-820,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1183.238,1184.803,17 minutes?
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1184.803,1189.382,"It's a small town, and it's not that far to the police station apparently."
1974.73-820,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1189.382,1191.755,Got more than one building in the town.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1191.755,1192.334,Well --
1974.73-820,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1192.334,1195.009,"Well this is the respondent's evidence, isn't it?"
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1195.009,1197.183,"The radio log is, yes."
1974.73-820,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1197.341,1201.67,The radio log is the respondent's -- who kept the radio log?
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1201.67,1205.274,Well the police kept it at my recollection.
1974.73-820,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1209.614,1211.897,You said that the respondent put it in evidence.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1213.095,1215.011,I'm told that that's not correct.
1974.73-820,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1223.962,1225.477,I'm still in my own.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1240.127,1243.359,"Well, I would say, you know it's not entirely clear that it's satisfactory."
1974.73-820,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1243.359,1244.714,Well he's certainly loose.
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1244.714,1251.741,"But -- well in fairness, I would have to say that the record is unclear whether they would've turned him loose."
1974.73-820,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1251.741,1252.609,But didn't --
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1252.609,1254.136,They would've turned the driver loose.
1974.73-820,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1281.564,1284.806,"Well when they checked it, they put all three names in or two?"
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1284.806,1288.367,"When they checked with Immigration Naturalization, they gave them all three names."
1974.73-820,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1289.543,1291.816,"(Voice overlap) he was in custody, wasn't he?"
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1291.816,1294.89,I think that it's arguable that all three of them were in custody.
1974.73-820,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1373.158,1384.838,"Now you said that the outset that the issue in this case is a narrow one, namely, the standing of the driver to claim the benefit of some violation for the passenger's rights."
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1385.245,1388.808,"Well, we still think it's that narrow issue."
1974.73-820,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1479.185,1480.421,You're talking about the step two so far?
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1480.421,1481.277,Step two.
1974.73-820,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1481.277,1482.974,That that --
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1482.974,1487.373,If we want to talk about step two.
1974.73-820,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1487.373,1489.636,If that's what you're taking about?
1974.73-820,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,1489.636,1498.675,"Well I'm talking about it because I think that some people would like to talk about it, but if you talk about that."
1974.73-820,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1528.656,1545.94,Mr. Beeler.
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,1545.94,1550.741,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-820,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1618.285,1635.159,"Well, there's no indication that if the occupants in this car or any car had given their identity and that it checked out that they would've been taken to any station now, is there?"
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,1635.159,1649.524,"I think it's clear from the testimony in the case that if everyone in the car that has all four passengers had had identity documents satisfactory to the police officers, then they could've continued on their business."
1974.73-820,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1649.524,1664.759,"In this case, we're dealing with passengers who could not speak English against the background of, so the record indicates, a number of employers in that community hiring illegal Mexican aliens."
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,1687.074,1698.523,Precisely and I think it's important that the Court take careful note of how it was that the Spanish identity of these passengers was learned.
1974.73-820,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1996.119,2007.528,"Well what do you mean when you -- you don't mean to lay down absolute principle that he has the right to use the public highways free of any detention whatsoever, do you?"
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2007.528,2022.953,"What I'm talking about he has the right to use the public highways Mr. Justice Rehnquist, subject to the dictates of the Fourth Amendment which not only give him protection, but also permit reasonable police inquiry."
1974.73-820,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2060.676,2081.181,"Well what you're complaining about here, what your client's complaining about is that the two passengers in the backseat of the car testified in Sanchez trial that he had smuggled them across the border and into the United States, isn't that what you're complaining about?"
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2081.181,2094.59,The Government's proposed testimony is that these three witnesses who were found in his car would be used against him to establish the elements of harboring or transporting.
1974.73-820,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2094.59,2098.787,"And if there was any testimony, I think there was a motion to suppress and it was granted?"
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2098.787,2100.072,That's accurate.
1974.73-820,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2105.671,2118.33,"What you're complaining about is, or the Government is resisting is the fact that these witnesses were not permitted to testify that he had smuggled them in."
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2118.33,2121.104,I don't believe that's accurate Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-820,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2121.104,2121.584,Well then you --
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2121.584,2124.157,The Government would like to argue that.
1974.73-820,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2249.228,2256.701,"You don't suggest that this Court is now bound by what the Assistant United States Attorney argued in the Court of Appeals, do you?"
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2256.701,2258.014,I'm not suggesting that.
1974.73-820,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2263.079,2268.132,You do not agree then that the basic issue here is standing?
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2268.132,2268.691,I agree.
1974.73-820,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2313.059,2334.001,"Does any -- do you cite us any case in which the testimony of witnesses such as these two passengers in the car has been excluded or suppressed because of a violation of the rights, constitutional rights of some other person?"
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2339.099,2360.139,"Well, if I understand your question accurately, you're bringing us into the area of cases which seemed to take a case by case analysis to the question of whether or not a particular witnesses' testimony is fruit of the poisonous tree where that witness was discovered as a result of some police illegality."
1974.73-820,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2360.139,2372.114,"Tucker against Michigan involved that and once that case, in answer to the Chief Justice's question would be the decision of the Michigan Supreme Court in the Tucker case, isn't it?"
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2372.114,2374.539,The Tucker case was a Fifth Amendment case --
1974.73-820,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2374.539,2374.967,I know.
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2374.967,2377.729,-- in which compulsion is an important question.
1974.73-820,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2382.803,2385.096,What happened to the Tucker case?
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2385.096,2408.357,"Well, in the Tucker case, this Court held that the witness who was, rather whose identity was learned as a result of the custodial interrogation which was in no way compulsive, which was in no way in violation of the Fourth Amendment could be used because of its trustworthiness."
1974.73-820,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2421.695,2434.701,Is there any -- do you make any argument that the testimony of these two aliens in the backseat would be unreliable evidence?
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2434.701,2448.526,"I'm -- I think that it might well be, because of the circumstances in which their custody was obtained in the great interest that they would have inculpating someone else in order escape liability themselves."
1974.73-820,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2609.001,2619.807,But you not insist that on behalf of Mr. Sanchez that other people's testimony be suppressed because those other people weren't given Miranda warnings can you?
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2619.807,2639.096,"I mentioned the Miranda warnings simply to show that the Government can argue that the statements given by the aliens at the police station were voluntary or something that or a product of their individual will, memory, perception, volition, factors with --"
1974.73-820,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2639.096,2646.2,"Do you say if a witness wasn't given a Miranda warning, his statement by definition is not voluntary regardless of the circumstances?"
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2646.2,2670.902,"Not as a matter of law but I think it bears persuasively upon any analysis as to whether or not these witnesses caught in a foreign country in the middle of a crime being interrogated by a professional interrogator over the telephone, somehow came forth voluntarily to give testimony which purged the taint, their being discovered during the illegality."
1974.73-820,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2724.487,2734.462,To be there -- oh the problem as I have with this case is that you pointed out the Government has changed its argumentative position.
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2800.067,2800.546,That's it.
1974.73-820,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2814.256,2817.058,It was the Court of Appeals then adapted the theory really.
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2817.058,2817.328,"Quite frankly, I --"
1974.73-820,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2817.328,2822.176,The Court of Appeals have concentrated on what's been called here step three.
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2822.176,2831.566,"Quite frankly, I think the reason the Government petitioned for cert, they simply didn't like the way the Court of Appeals opinion was written."
1974.73-820,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2913.699,2923.747,Mr. Beeler does the record show that Mr. Sanchez objected to the brief theory of detention?
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2923.747,2928.617,There is nothing in the record to show that he made any protest.
1974.73-820,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2948.222,2949.378,They're in uniform?
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2949.378,2950.414,They were in uniform.
1974.73-820,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2986.517,2993.104,"In your colloquy with Mr. Justice Stewart, reference was made to the search."
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,2999.996,3017.448,"In addition to the detention of Mr. Sanchez, which resulted in the discovery of the witnesses, the procedure of interrogating the passengers can also be viewed as a search during the period of this detention."
1974.73-820,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3043.419,3059.818,"Would it have been different as has been suggested if these four individuals had been walking down the street and had stopped and appeared to have been lost, and two officers had come up and said “May we help you?”"
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,3076.527,3085.643,Assuming that all of the other facts would be about the same then we would assume that Mr. Sanchez was in custody.
1974.73-820,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3096.659,3099.623,"That's a speculation, isn't it?"
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,3099.623,3106.615,Well that would make your hypothetical equivalent to the situation that we do have in this case.
1974.73-820,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3116.366,3120.226,I thought he said he wasn't free to drive off with the passengers?
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,3120.226,3122.182,That's what Mr. Friedman says.
1974.73-820,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3159.75,3173.864,"It is clear that on the other hand that I suppose that had there been no passengers and everything else had transpired as it did, he'd been approached and given his identification, there wouldn't be no question about his freedom to leave and that's your case."
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,3176.838,3180.01,"If there had been no passengers, he could've driven right off."
1974.73-820,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3180.01,3181.116,And if --
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,3181.116,3182.411,Once he proved his own identity.
1974.73-820,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3182.411,3184.707,"And that's the knob of your argument, isn't it?"
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,3184.707,3186.831,That's the knob of it.
1974.73-820,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3186.831,3200.365,And do you think it sheds any light on the situation that the police told the two identified passengers to leave the car and come with them to the police station.
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,3208.397,3210.81,There was no testimony that they distinguished.
1974.73-820,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3213.674,3214.343,Physically.
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,3214.343,3216.776,-- one of the passengers physically.
1974.73-820,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3335.892,3338.285,"I don't want to be precisious, but he wasn't traveling."
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,3340.9,3347.175,He was parked for the purpose of a brief stop in his travel to get his bearings to the restaurant he was looking for.
1974.73-820,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3347.175,3350.493,But his travel wasn't interrupted by the police?
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,3350.493,3351.91,Not initially.
1974.73-820,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3365.969,3369.101,(Inaudible)
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,3369.101,3371.564,Villa Park isn't such a tiny little town.
1974.73-820,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3389.078,3392.322,"Mr. Beeler, the car really wasn't just on the side of the road."
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,3398.168,3411.351,"Mr. Justice Powell, it was in a cut-off between North and Adison Rd., and I've obtained defendant's exhibit A which I thought had been transmitted to the Supreme Court earlier."
1974.73-820,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3443.753,3458.802,"Well, be that as it may Mr. Beeler, my understanding is that it has been up till now that you don't object to the policeman approaching the car or interrogating the driver, or asking him for his identification or checking his identification."
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,3460.048,3460.585,You're right.
1974.73-820,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3464.485,3466.731,Right.
1974.73-820,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3466.731,3472.867,Does this record show at what stage the pistol was discovered in the glove compartment.
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,3478.963,3492.966,"As I understand the record, after the four arrived at the police station and they were “brought inside”, which is to use the words chosen by the police officer."
1974.73-820,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3515.901,3524.991,"Now was that -- I don't recall that this record shows, except that what happened to it, except there's a reference to the fact that it isn't in this case."
1974.73-820,1,29163,joseph_beeler,,3529.809,3547.675,"There was -- it's not in the record but in direct answer to your question, represented by different counsel, Mr. Sanchez pleaded guilty to the Illinois violation of possessing a firearm without having registered it."
1974.73-820,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3578.949,3579.448,Thank you.
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3581.155,3587.131,"Just a couple of minor points, first on our concession and all of that."
1974.73-820,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3594.972,3595.689,Do you mean in the Court of Appeals?
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3595.689,3603.741,"In the Court of Appeals which we don't feel bound by here is, the District Court reached a conclusion that the interrogation was a search."
1974.73-820,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3609.767,3612.33,Let's further assume that the respondent has standing to it.
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3612.33,3615.282,Has standing at that point if it were a search.
1974.73-820,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3636.036,3638.489,Now first if we agree with Mr. Beeler that's the end of this case.
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3638.489,3639.078,That's the end of the case.
1974.73-820,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3639.078,3642.14,"But if we agree with you, it's got to go back, doesn't it?"
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3642.14,3648.845,It's got to go back either with this Court looking at some of those other aspects or asking -- telling the Court of Appeals to look at some of those other aspects.
1974.73-820,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3648.845,3649.651,To clarify some?
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3649.651,3652.705,"To clarify what went on, on that second stage."
1974.73-820,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3719.121,3731.485,If you agree that the respondent from the time he was first stopped until the time they got into the police station and felt that he was sort of --
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3731.485,3731.754,Well --
1974.73-820,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3731.754,3734.19,"I mean, for example, he said “Will you come along with us.”"
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3735.396,3737.779,"He said “Fine, I'll come along.”"
1974.73-820,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3737.779,3744.966,Well I know what you do if 2:30 in the morning when a policeman armed says “Would you mind coming along?”
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3744.966,3750.625,Well it's also 2:30 in the morning when you're looking for a restaurant and the police come over and they don't say “You're coming with us.”
1974.73-820,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3753.837,3755.442,-- after that I mean.
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3755.442,3759.811,"Well, I think frankly that you have to look at it step by step."
1974.73-820,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3759.971,3762.823,And then what you would've done under this circumstance?
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3762.823,3763.083,What I would've done --
1974.73-820,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3763.083,3764.418,Would you have gone along?
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3764.418,3768.111,"Under the circumstances, I probably would've felt that there was no reason not to go along."
1974.73-820,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3768.111,3768.398,If you --
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3768.398,3770.604,But that doesn't make it an arrest.
1974.73-820,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3807.659,3812.614,"Well, the two men in the back seat, were they under arrest at that time?"
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3812.614,3814.241,They were being detained at that time.
1974.73-820,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3819.598,3821.455,So you really don't know what the arrest --
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3821.455,3822.8,-- arguable.
1974.73-820,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3822.8,3825.535,You don't know when either one of them was arrested?
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3825.535,3829.735,"Well, I think that you can view the facts on two different ways in regard of the passengers."
1974.73-820,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3831.26,3836.727,(Voice overlap) you take two men and put them in a car with the policeman and take them to the police station.
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3836.727,3837.506,"Okay, let's say it's an --"
1974.73-820,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3837.506,3840.907,You take another mind and said “Would you mind coming along?”
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3845.776,3847.54,I don't think they're all in the same position.
1974.73-820,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3847.54,3849.716,That is one difference.
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3855.37,3857.844,Well there's no evidence of anything like that in the setting Mr. Justice Marshall.
1974.73-820,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3857.844,3858.271,I know.
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3860.467,3861.223,I think that what happened --
1974.73-820,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3861.223,3865.575,-- the policeman says “Would you mind coming along?”
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3865.575,3869.665,Would you mind coming along is different from getting in the back of a squad car.
1974.73-820,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3871.28,3872.935,Indeed it wouldn't be any different.
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3872.935,3873.412,Pardon me?
1974.73-820,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3873.412,3875.159,What to be wouldn't be any different.
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3875.159,3876.794,I think it depends how it's said.
1974.73-820,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3877.97,3880.194,"Yes, well we don't know how it was said."
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3880.194,3881.41,We know what went before.
1974.73-820,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3883.883,3887.576,"-- said, because we don't have the -- we weren't there."
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3887.576,3890.658,But we -- there was un-contradicted -- testimony from the officer.
1974.73-820,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3899.714,3903.325,(Inaudible)
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3903.325,3910.768,"Well, he's free to take the stand to the suppression hearing without incriminating himself on way that can be used against him later on the trial."
1974.73-820,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3939.259,3949.054,"What case was it in this Court that held that the stop and frisk, and the patting down, the searching could be done without constituting an arrest?"
1974.73-820,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3949.054,3950.022,Adams.
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3950.022,3951.4,Adams versus Williams.
1974.73-820,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3951.4,3954.622,Well doesn't that resolve some of the questions that were --
1974.73-820,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3954.622,3962.125,"Well I think it certainly does, because there was some articulable reason at some point to ask them some questions."
1974.73-820,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4081.373,4082.509,Thank you Mr. Friedman.
