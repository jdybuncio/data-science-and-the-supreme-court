1983.82-973,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.738,We'll hear arguments next in Immigration and Naturalization Services v. Stevic.
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,13.471,16.884,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,332.933,335.103,Aren't there clear probabilities?
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,335.103,341.677,"Well, the terms ""clear probability"" and ""realistic likelihood"" have been used interchangeably by the Board of Immigration Appeals and the Court."
1983.82-973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,341.677,348.19,"So as long as you don't assign any difference to these words, difference in words, that's been a consistent standard."
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,348.19,356.986,"Yes, and I think the Board and the courts have used the words interchangeably over the years, which shows that there is no substantive difference in these catchword phrases."
1983.82-973,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,360.349,368.985,"Well, one standard, one use of words might declare it a minimum hurdle and another one declare something else."
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,368.985,376.089,"Well, the Board has always taken this to be the minimum standard that the alien must meet."
1983.82-973,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,378.34,379.432,"But that's the objective test, is it?"
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,379.432,380.083,--Excuse me?
1983.82-973,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,380.083,384.124,You're saying that the objective test is the one which the Board has said was the minimum.
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,384.124,385.196,Yes.
1983.82-973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,413.474,414.556,I was just reading it out of your brief.
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,414.556,415.026,Yes.
1983.82-973,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,457.473,472.614,"Mr. Geller, just as a matter of curiosity, has the Department ever indulged in any empirical evidence that would show what has happened to those who were deported and denied relief?"
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,472.614,474.003,"Not to my knowledge, Justice Blackmun."
1983.82-973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,492.245,495.397,May I ask one other question about the pre-1968 situation?
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,495.397,495.768,--Yes.
1983.82-973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,495.768,501.91,Does... what's the government's view as to whether the same standard was applied on deportation as on admission under--
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,501.91,503.172,"The same, the same standard--"
1983.82-973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,503.172,504.114,--The same standard under both.
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,504.114,508.796,"--Yes, the same standard was applied under 243(h), which is the withholding provision--"
1983.82-973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,508.796,509.617,As under 203(a)--
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,509.617,518.233,--As under 203(a)(7) which is... except that 203(a)(7) obviously had some other ideological and geographical restrictions.
1983.82-973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,613.215,616.246,--May I ask you a question about the protocol?
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,616.246,616.957,--Yes.
1983.82-973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,616.957,634.707,"Mr. Geller, the convention from 1951 requires that the alien have a well-founded fear, that is, be a refugee, and also that the alien's life or freedom would be threatened."
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,637.599,655.652,"I think that the well-found... the life or freedom would be threatened is simply a synonym for what we had called up until that point persecution, and the well-founded fear goes to the substantive standard that an alien must meet in order to show that he would be persecuted."
1983.82-973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,837.321,842.734,"So what this case is all about, in your view, is how one defines the term"
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,844.565,845.596,"Well, no."
1983.82-973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,863.887,871.113,"But that in turn must be decided, I suppose, upon what Congress meant by using the term ""well-founded fear of prosecution""."
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,871.113,887.534,"--Well, I think in part that is correct, and as I am saying, by adhering to the protocol which included the phrase 1968, we think Congress was obviously saying the phrase ""well-founded fear"" is the equivalent."
1983.82-973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.534,901.152,So the government's quarrel with the Court of Appeals opinion is not saying... is not that opinion saying that the standard is a well-founded fear of prosecution; its quarrel is with the Court's observation that that standard is a good deal more lenient than the earlier one.
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,901.152,911.9,"Exactly, exactly, and in fact, during the years 1968 to 1980, the courts and the Board used the phrase ""well-founded fear of persecution"" as a synonym, as a shorthand phrase for the--"
1983.82-973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,911.9,918.513,It doesn't seem to me that there is any doubt about what standard the Court of Appeals said governed this case.
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,920.095,924.287,--The problem is... there is no doubt that that is now the standard under the Refugee Act.
1983.82-973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,927.091,927.509,"Sure, I agree with you."
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,927.919,930.331,"The question is whether that means something different, and we think Congress explicitly--"
1983.82-973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,930.331,935.865,But the Court of Appeals didn't leave... didn't fail to define what the standard was.
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,935.865,937.026,"--Well, I think it did because it--"
1983.82-973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,937.026,937.677,"Well, it did."
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,939.366,952.325,"--It failed to give any... what it said was that the way that the Board and the courts had been applying that standard was erroneous, and it failed to tell the board what the new content of that standard is other than to say it is something less than what you had been doing up until now."
1983.82-973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,958.009,963.643,"Mr. Geller, the statute, 1253(h), doesn't use the well-founded fear language."
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,963.643,964.204,That's--
1983.82-973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,964.204,969.096,It refers only to the alien's life or freedom would be threatened.
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,971.427,972.148,--That's true.
1983.82-973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,983.518,985.138,And you think that even though it doesn't say it that--
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,985.138,985.579,--Yes.
1983.82-973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,985.579,989.349,--well-founded fear is somehow incorporated in that statute?
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,989.349,1012.745,"Yes, because if you can show a well-founded fear, then you would be entitled to asylum relief, for example, under Section 208 of the act, and since withholding of deportation relief is a lesser remedy than granting asylum, it seems logical that Congress couldn't have meant to deport someone who would be in... who would have... meet the eligibility standard under Section 208 for asylum."
1983.82-973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1014.828,1018.709,"You can get asylum if you are not within the country, can't you?"
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1018.709,1021.781,You have to be in the country or at a land border.
1983.82-973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1021.781,1022.762,At a land border.
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1022.762,1024.695,Or port of entry to get asylum.
1983.82-973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1099.843,1109.8,"Well, but Mr. Geller, it is true, isn't it, that the second circuit... maybe they were wrong... thought there were two different standards before '68, one for 203(a)(7), or whatever it is, and the other for--"
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1109.8,1110.488,They did feel that.
1983.82-973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1111.189,1112.969,--And that was sort of the source of their whole problem.
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1117.082,1118.803,"--Right, but the initial premise is completely wrong."
1983.82-973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1118.803,1121.855,"But that's the source of their trouble according to your view, I think."
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1121.855,1123.437,"Well, that is one of the problems."
1983.82-973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1223.803,1227.607,How did Congress express this view?
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1227.607,1235.21,"Well, in the... I have already read to the Court some of the provisions from the legislative history of the 1968 accession."
1983.82-973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1235.21,1242.824,Would you say that that absolutely forecloses a court from giving any different meaning to those words?
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1242.824,1249.8,"The only issue in this case is the intent of Congress in passing the Refugee Act of 1980, whether it intended to change the substantive standard in this area of the law."
1983.82-973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1249.8,1259.657,"Well, of course, one of the usual indica of what Congress means is the words it uses in the act rather than a lot of legislative history."
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1259.657,1263.921,"Well, well, but the words, the key words here, I assume, would be the well-founded fear language."
1983.82-973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1403.655,1409.189,"Mr. Geller, in deciding this case, do we have to say what the standard is, or do we just have to say it hasn't changed?"
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1409.189,1412.91,"Well, I think you would probably be answering the same question because--"
1983.82-973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1412.91,1421.855,"Well, if we say what it is, do we... is it the same or different as the one described in the United Nations handbook or that handbook that is discussed at some length?"
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1421.855,1432.924,"--Well, it would be inappropriate, I think, for this court to say that that is what the phrase means when Congress when it adhered to the protocol in 1968 said that it wasn't making any change in the law."
1983.82-973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1513.986,1517.589,"Well, I think I understand all that, but I just really am not sure I got your answer to my question."
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1526.775,1529.898,"--Well, it's not clear what the Handbook of Procedures is."
1983.82-973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1552.061,1553.823,So you say it is the same standard.
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1553.823,1556.385,"--Well, I'm not sure because--"
1983.82-973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1556.385,1556.906,I just want to know what your position is.
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1556.906,1560.496,--I'm not sure what the handbook says the standard is.
1983.82-973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1596.66,1602.975,"Well, I understand all that, Mr. Geller, but my problem is I can follow an argument very easily that says the standard has never changed."
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1602.975,1603.475,Yes.
1983.82-973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1603.475,1606.117,"Then you say yes, but you also have to tell us what the standard is."
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1606.117,1606.918,We think--
1983.82-973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1606.918,1609.8,"And then I ask you, can I look at the handbook to find out what it is, and I don't know what your answer is."
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1609.8,1612.131,"--Well, because I'm not sure that the handbook gives the right answer."
1983.82-973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1614.592,1616.145,"Well, so you say you don't know, I gather."
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1616.145,1631.114,"--No, I'm not saying I don't know, Justice stevens I think that the Court does... should say what the standard is, but I think it says that by answering the question that the standard has not changed because Congress, each time it changed the language in this area, specifically said we are not meaning to change the standard."
1983.82-973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1650.597,1666.885,"Well, I would suppose that if we agree with you, all we have to do is to say to the Court of Appeals that, or that as far as we should go, is that you said the standard had changed by the protocol, the Refugee Act, and you were wrong, it hasn't changed."
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1666.885,1667.516,--That's precisely right.
1983.82-973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.516,1668.618,And remand the case.
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1668.618,1670.258,That is what we think the relief should be.
1983.82-973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1672.74,1674.412,Let them figure out what the standard should be.
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1674.412,1675.591,"--Well, the standard... I don't--"
1983.82-973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.927,1687.749,"Well, I suppose the Court of Appeals must have thought it knew what the old standard was."
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1689.842,1690.571,"--Well, yes."
1983.82-973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1698.078,1700.869,"Well, I know, but if you tell them to go back to the old standard, they must have known what that was."
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1700.869,1702.388,"Well, I think the old standard is clear."
1983.82-973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1712.296,1712.786,"Well, Mr.--"
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1712.786,1714.076,--Mr. Stevic's case under that--
1983.82-973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1714.076,1716.429,"--Geller, under the old standard which you think is clear--"
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1716.429,1717.139,--Yes.
1983.82-973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1717.139,1729.247,--Can the United States in meeting it establish whole countries or whole categories of people that would meet the standard without an individual application?
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1729.247,1732.95,"Yes, and the INS has done that for certain categories."
1983.82-973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1809.079,1823.08,I take it the government has not established a categorical view of the members of this particular group from Yugoslavia.
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1823.08,1823.579,"Of this group, that's correct."
1983.82-973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1825.47,1832.533,And in how many areas or countries has the United States established one of these categories?
1983.82-973,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1832.533,1849.996,"I am not aware of the extent of the categorization, but in fair number, in fact, a handbook was just put out a few months ago to deal with people who are seeking refugee status from Southeast Asia which discusses at great length the categories that are entitled to refugee status as a matter of law."
1983.82-973,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1851.518,1859.723,Ms. Ritter?
1983.82-973,1,16853,ann_l_ritter,,1859.723,1863.406,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court:"
1983.82-973,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1925.035,1929.9,What did the congressional committees have to say about the change when they made it?
1983.82-973,1,16853,ann_l_ritter,,1929.9,1951.884,"--The congressional committee at the time that Section 243(h) was amended, the congressional committee reported that the changes in the Refugee Act had to be construed consistent with the United Nations protocol relating to the status of refugees."
1983.82-973,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2170.265,2177.519,"Well, didn't the INS after '68, in view of what Congress had been... take the position that there had been no change?"
1983.82-973,1,16853,ann_l_ritter,,2177.519,2181.603,"Well, that was curious."
1983.82-973,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2191.11,2191.48,Yes.
1983.82-973,1,16853,ann_l_ritter,,2191.48,2191.921,--Yes.
1983.82-973,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2657.695,2662.938,"Of course, you are not asking us to apply the standard ourselves, are you?"
1983.82-973,1,16853,ann_l_ritter,,2665.111,2666.202,"Well, pardon me?"
1983.82-973,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2666.202,2675.095,You are not suggesting that we apply whatever standard we find is applicable to the facts of Mr. Stevic's case.
1983.82-973,1,16853,ann_l_ritter,,2675.095,2675.676,No.
