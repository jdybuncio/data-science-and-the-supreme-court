1986.85-1347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.67,"We will hear argument now in No. 85-1347, Pennsylvania against George F. Ritchie."
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,10.003,17.959,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is before you today on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania."
1986.85-1347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,308.898,313.634,"Incidentally, Mr. Clark, Act 1975 was amended, was it not?"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,313.634,317.853,"I am sorry, I am not familiar with that Act."
1986.85-1347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,321.49,327.894,"No, I am speaking of the statute under which access is or is not--"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,327.894,329.177,"Oh, under the federal rules, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,329.177,330.577,--Yes.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,330.811,336.481,"Oh, the Pennsylvania statute, yes, it was amended in 1982, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,336.748,344.671,And under the ordered remand would access be governed by the old or the amended statute?
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,344.671,348.206,"I presume it would be under the amended statute, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,358.894,364.315,"Well, you might if we thought that that was a basis for saying that the case is moot, that we now have a new statute in front of us."
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,364.315,367.417,"Well, I don't believe the case would be moot, Your Honor, in this regard."
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.536,369.886,Why don't you tell us why it wouldn't be.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,369.886,397.971,"--We don't think that the amendments to the statute effectively have altered the basic ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which is that invariably these confidential records must be given carte blanche to a criminal defendant in this case."
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,397.971,407.494,The basic change in the statute as I understand it is that henceforth the prosecutor has access.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,413.148,420.052,The prosecutor has access to reports which have been given by the Children and Youth Agency to the prosecutor.
1986.85-1347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,451.69,459.427,"Well, if we reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in this case the result would be that the conviction stands affirmed, wouldn't it?"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,459.427,460.777,"--Absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,460.777,465.229,And certainly that I would think would prevent the case from being moot.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,465.229,468.949,"I'm sorry, I don't understand."
1986.85-1347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,471.199,473.817,"No, it seems to me that would prevent the case from being moot."
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,473.817,474.517,"Oh, absolutely correct."
1986.85-1347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,474.517,479.321,A decision here has some effect on the rights of the parties before us.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,479.321,480.205,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,483.874,487.51,Even though you didn't recognize it at first.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,494.997,498.199,"Not to my understanding, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,498.199,504.103,Because I notice the affidavit for in forma pauper is indicated he was unavailable and the lawyer didn't know where he was.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,504.103,518.03,"I believe there is a subsequent communication with the Court, Your Honor, involving, I believe they found the respondent and he subsequently signed an affidavit attesting to his pauper status."
1986.85-1347,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,518.03,518.63,I see.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,522.264,523.914,He is not incarcerated.
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,553.034,554.053,"Sure, you can get further review."
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,593.011,599.748,"I think in United States versus Ryan, Your Honor, those cases involve the absolute refusal to divulge and to deliver certain materials."
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.168,613.222,"That is an interesting difference, but does it bear upon whether the decision is final or not?"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,631.719,632.952,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,633.586,635.604,"Now, why was that not final and yet this is final?"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,635.604,638.456,"Well, the trial court here already had access to these records."
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,656.417,659.219,Have they been given to the attorney for the other side?
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,659.219,661.238,--They have not been given to the attorney for the other side.
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,661.238,662.605,"Well, then, they haven't--"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,662.605,663.138,They have not been ordered--
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.138,668.475,"--they haven't done what they have been ordered to do yet, nor have they categorically refused to do what they have been ordered to do."
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,679.281,697.625,--I think beforehand it would be a requirement of the respondent here to request the state Supreme Court to enforce its mandate before we... the Children and Youth Services is not in sort of some kind of limbo contempt situation here because it hasn't delivered these files yet.
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,700.344,703.446,There is no final action that has been taken against anybody.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,710.802,712.485,"A defendant has been convicted, Your Honor--"
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,731.548,733.465,"This prosecution is still proceeding, isn't it?"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,734.081,775.542,"I don't think it's over any more than the fact that as this Court did in South Dakota versus Neville where the State Supreme Court there had authoritatively adjudicated a federal constitutional issue and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings on another matter, and this Court determined that it still had Jurisdiction to decide the issue in view of the fact that no matter who prevailed at the trial court level, the issue would either be mooted or the state would be prevented from proceeding any further in the United States Supreme Court by virtue of the double jeopardy clause."
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,775.542,804.276,"As I understand it, the only way we can distinguish the next case where a litigant is ordered to turn over Information and he says that that order is incorrect, the only way we can turn down an appeal from that order without requiring him to take his chances and either lose the case or go into contempt, you say the distinction between that case and this one is what, that here... here what?"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,804.276,807.562,"Between Ryan and this case, Your Honor?"
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,807.562,809.514,"Yes, that is essentially Ryan I was describing."
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,809.514,814.667,"In Ryan the defendant absolutely refused to disclose these, to surrender his--"
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,814.667,815.5,And here?
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,825.056,828.391,"--The agency was directed to surrender those records initially to the trial court, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,831.629,833.512,"Well, isn't the--"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,833.512,834.747,The Supreme Court has... I'm sorry.
1986.85-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,834.747,839.799,--It there is a refusal to turn them over won't the conviction be set aside?
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,839.799,845.203,Presumably the prosecution would be dismissed at that point.
1986.85-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,845.203,858.077,"I would suppose it would because if they are turned over and there is something in them that the defendant should have had during the trial, there is going to be a new trial."
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,858.077,859.629,There will be a new trial.
1986.85-1347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,859.629,862.312,"Well, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has already ordered a new trial, hasn't it?"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,862.312,870.651,"The Supreme Court... no, it has ordered a remand, Your Honor, tot purposes of an evidentiary hearing to determine whether or not harmless error occurred."
1986.85-1347,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,870.651,878.091,But the court already has the records that are to be opened.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,878.857,881.226,The trial court at one time had custody of those records.
1986.85-1347,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,881.226,882.893,"Well, does the trial court have them now?"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,882.893,883.578,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,883.578,885.011,Who has them now?
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,885.011,886.78,Those records are with the Children and Youth Services Agency.
1986.85-1347,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,886.78,887.413,I see.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,887.413,896.052,That agency has not been ordered by the Court pending this appeal to surrender those records.
1986.85-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,896.052,900.854,That is the court that is going to look at them under this order.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,900.854,906.074,"In a largely ceremonial sense, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,906.074,910.728,"Well, I know, but who is going to determine whether or not there is something in the records that requires a new trial?"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,910.728,918.882,"Well, as I understand it from the Supreme Court's opinion, Your Honor, apparently trial counsel was to make that determination, a rather unusual--"
1986.85-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,918.882,922.369,"You mean the trial counsel will say, I found something in here that I think--"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,922.369,925.821,"--The trial counsel will second-guess the trial courts, the appellate courts."
1986.85-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,925.821,927.455,--He is going to have to argue with the trial court about it.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,927.455,928.19,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,928.19,930.407,And if the trial court agrees with them there is going to be a new trial.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,930.407,931.642,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,931.642,942.617,"xxx a new trial, will the prosecution under the amended statute want access to those records?"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,942.617,946.834,"Certainly, Your Honor, they would."
1986.85-1347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,946.834,947.584,They will?
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,947.584,948.786,I should think so.
1986.85-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,948.786,953.638,"If there is a new trial and he is acquitted, you will never be able to have this question raised in this case."
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,953.638,956.257,"It will never be raised here in this Court with that case, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,981.539,983.825,"I am sure counsel could have said that in Ryan, too."
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1000.667,1005.171,"It is not final in the sense, Your Honor, that there are further proceedings to come."
1986.85-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1009.606,1016.296,"But if you refuse, the conviction is going to be set aside."
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1016.296,1018.646,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1027.152,1028.936,"If and when it is set aside we could review it then, right?"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1035.339,1039.911,--If... in the event there is a refusal?
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1039.911,1040.493,Right.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1040.493,1041.144,"Is that what you are saying, Your Honor?"
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1041.144,1041.944,Right.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1041.944,1053.652,I believe that the mandate of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is that Children and Youth Services will surrender their records to the trial court.
1986.85-1347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1089.142,1094.046,"Mr. Clark, you might be well advised to move to the merits since you only have half an hour."
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1094.046,1094.696,"Thank you very much, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1333.652,1335.77,"Mr. Clark, what about Brady versus Maryland?"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1338.556,1340.872,"No, Your Honor, that is a due process case."
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1340.872,1349.262,"That doesn't require a specific description of what... in fact you often don't know what the prosecution or the government has, right?"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1349.262,1350.697,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.697,1359.136,And due process requires that if you ask the government for whatever exculpatory information it may have the government turn that over it that would be material.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1361.754,1365.956,"It could very well be, Your Honor, in this regard."
1986.85-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1402.462,1408.985,Your point is that the order here goes beyond Brady and it requires it all to be turned over whether in fact it is exculpatory material or not.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1408.985,1409.552,"That is absolutely right, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1419.574,1424.995,Certainly under the amended statute the Brady case would become pertinent.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1424.995,1445.306,"--It certainly would, Your Honor, and I am quite... the Commonwealth is quite content to represent that we believe the trial court is in a very excellent position to make these discriminating choices between extraneous material and matter which is certainly dangerous."
1986.85-1347,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1445.306,1450.276,"Mr. Clark, in this case to what extent did the trial judge actually examine the file?"
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1450.276,1460.918,"It is difficult to tell from reading the record, Your Honor, but it appears that I could imagine the trial judge, knowing him as I do, leafing through things."
1986.85-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1463.703,1467.155,Didn't the trial judge say he hadn't read those 50 pages?
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1467.155,1468.722,He said he hadn't read all 50 pages.
1986.85-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1470.44,1471.506,Of the nonmedical record?
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1471.506,1474.141,"--I believe the dialogue goes something like this, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1484.533,1485.566,He said there wasn't any.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1485.566,1494.555,"--and said, I don't see any medical records in there, and he apparently turned to the representative of the Child Protective Service Agency and said, are there any medical records in here that were representative?"
1986.85-1347,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1499.626,1504.595,May I ask you if you think what the trial judge did was constitutionally sufficient?
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1504.595,1509.582,"Absolutely, Your Honor, based on the proffer made by respondent's counsel."
1986.85-1347,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1509.582,1511.6,But he had no duty to look at the file?
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1511.6,1516.504,He had a duty to look in a file if he got a specific request for a specific kind of--
1986.85-1347,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1516.504,1518.754,Absent a specific request identifying particular material--

1986.85-1347,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1520.206,1520.722,--I see.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1520.722,1521.106,At that point no.
1986.85-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1521.106,1524.241,He wanted medical records.
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1524.241,1525.291,He wanted medical records.
1986.85-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1526.61,1527.51,"And the judge said, there aren't any."
1986.85-1347,0,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,1527.51,1528.31,--There aren't any.
1986.85-1347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1543.135,1544.404,"Very well, Mr. Clark."
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,1545.771,1580.076,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case provides an opportunity for this Court to reaffirm its concern for the integrity of the truthseeking function of state criminal trials."
1986.85-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1737.897,1753.906,"It seems to me the harm that the state statute or the state rule was designed to prevent, namely, the disclosure of these records, will... the harm will have been done."
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,1785.96,1792.614,"Well, Your Honor, if I may, I have two responses to that."
1986.85-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1860.026,1868.531,"Well, you agree, don't you, Mr. Corbett, that one of the bases of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's decision was its perception of how the Sixth Amendment should be applied."
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,1868.531,1869.381,--Absolutely.
1986.85-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1871.397,1878.57,xxx require turning over these materials to the defense attorney?
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,1878.57,1879.787,"--Yes, it did."
1986.85-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.958,1912.874,"Well, do you think that is--"
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,1912.874,1913.66,--one of which--
1986.85-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.66,1917.362,"--Do you think that has much to do with finality, how great the harm is?"
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,1917.362,1933.287,"--Yes, I think it does, whether or not the type of harm that the district attorney is propounding is irreparable I think is a concern that this Court must face here."
1986.85-1347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.487,2006.186,"Mr. Corbett, isn't it true that the kind of damage you are responding to that Justice White suggested will always occur in any of our cases such as Ryan, where we have insisted that the individual who asserts a right, even a constitutional right not to disclose information which the court requires him to disclose nonetheless go into contempt before he can bring it up here?"
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2029.785,2030.801,Yes.
1986.85-1347,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2032.237,2040.141,"Is there an exception in Ryan, though, when privileged information is in the hands of a third person?"
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2040.141,2051.282,"Well, that brings us to a difficulty with this case, and that is that the district attorney is really wearing two hats in bringing this case to this Court."
1986.85-1347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2083.085,2084.27,"Mr. Corbett, before you do--"
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2084.27,2085.288,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2085.288,2086.655,--is your client available now?
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2086.655,2096.409,"Yes, Your Honor, he is, As Mr. Clark pointed out, we had some difficulty in locating this individual."
1986.85-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2253.362,2267.888,"Well, are you contending, Mr. Corbett, that the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation confers something more than the right to examine a witness who is present in court and testifies?"
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2267.888,2298.926,"The Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, I think, gives the defendant the opportunity to develop the facts, to see where the truth lies, and does so by giving the... by giving the defense an effective opportunity to cross examine the witness."
1986.85-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2298.926,2304.711,And what Sixth Amendment case construing the confrontation clause of ours do you rely on for that proposition?
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2304.711,2328.946,"I think quite frankly our strongest case here is Davis versus Alaska, where in its broadest sense the case may be read to state that a state may not deny its confrontation claim or confrontation obligations simply by alleging that the evidence that it wishes to withhold is privileged by... under state law."
1986.85-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2328.946,2332.981,But in Davis the effort was to interrogate the witness on the stand.
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2337.968,2352.227,They were... in Davis they Mere also looking to... they were looking to obtain facts from which they could cross examine the witness during the trial.
1986.85-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2357.846,2361.6,"But the effort was to examine the witness herself, wasn't it?"
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2361.6,2363.717,"--In this case, yes."
1986.85-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2366.987,2367.904,"Well, in Davis."
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2367.904,2370.689,Yes.
1986.85-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2370.689,2378.26,"I mean, they weren't... were they seeking in Davis discovery of a lot of allegedly confidential records in order to enable them to prepare to examine the witness?"
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2378.26,2379.129,"No, they weren't."
1986.85-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2389.5,2399.542,Certainly our case of Delaware against Fensterer indicates that it is not the very broad view that you subscribe to for Davis that is controlling with us.
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2399.542,2401.792,That may be true.
1986.85-1347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2441.535,2448.439,The statements in that file did you say included statements by the complaining witness?
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2451.575,2452.225,We think they should.
1986.85-1347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2454.193,2456.879,Was this anything like Jencks versus United States?
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2466.234,2468.436,"--I think it is very similar to Jencks, yes."
1986.85-1347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2468.436,2471.804,"Well, of course, Jencks was not a constitutional decision, though."
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2471.804,2486.664,"Well, in this case I think that... I think that in order to cross examine this witness we have to be given access to that material."
1986.85-1347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2502.859,2504.992,xxx Jencks rule?
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2504.992,2505.894,--No.
1986.85-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2557.327,2559.21,But your claim is quite different than the one in Van Arsdall.
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2576.788,2601.522,"--Well, what I am complaining about is the fact that as in Davis the jury may very veil have thought that defense counsel's cross examination of the victim concerning this investigation in September of 1978 may have been a baseless ground of attack."
1986.85-1347,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2631.125,2644.099,"Well, Mr. Corbett, doesn't your claim fit a lot more easily under the compulsory process clause than the confrontation clause for right of access to information?"
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2644.099,2658.542,I think this case presents... I think both the confrontation and the compulsory process Issues go hand in glove.
1986.85-1347,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2658.542,2660.31,"Well, I just don't see that you were denied confrontation."
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2669.833,2675.32,Okay.
1986.85-1347,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2723.384,2734.691,How have you made a plausible showing to reveal the entire record as opposed to just verbatim inconsistent statements of the witness?
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2734.691,2738.309,"--Well, we have the CWS files."
1986.85-1347,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2749.265,2755.153,"Is the judge, is the trial judge incompetent to make the determination of what is material?"
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,2755.153,2761.841,"--No, I don't think it is a matter of declaring whether or not a trial judge is or is not incompetent."
1986.85-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3061.284,3064.252,Do you think Davis is the closest case to supporting you?
1986.85-1347,1,29733,john_h_corbett_jr,,3064.252,3076.746,I think Davis would be the closest case concerning the confrontation issue and possibly Washington versus Texas being the closest case on the compulsory process issue.
1986.85-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3078.762,3080.095,"Thank you, Mr. Corbett."
1986.85-1347,2,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,3084.397,3085.166,Thank your Your Honor.
1986.85-1347,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3125.474,3128.159,"Mr. Clark, may I just make one inquiry?"
1986.85-1347,2,22101,edward_marcus_clark,,3136.015,3139.467,"Absolutely no, we do not have that power."
1986.85-1347,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3235.178,3236.912,"Thank you, Mr. Clark."
