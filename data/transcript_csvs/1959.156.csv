1959.156,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,31.478,"Number 156, Honorable Julius H. Miner and Honorable Edwin A. Robson, Petitioners, versus H. Leslie Atlass."
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,34.686,38.886,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please this Honorable Court."
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,285.112,286.037,May I interrupt?
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,286.037,286.281,"Yes, sir."
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,286.281,288.498,Is that Southern District of New York?
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,288.498,296.402,Both the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York have Rule 32 sir as to dep -- oral pretrial deposition.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,296.402,297.359,Both the Southern --
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,297.359,298.172,And the Eastern.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,298.172,305.518,Whether the -- was that rule before the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit in Judge Clark's opinion?
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,305.518,307.421,In the Mercado case?
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,307.421,308.226,Yes.
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,308.226,309.154,"No, sir."
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,333.984,335.022,I'm not sure I understand.
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,337.415,339.815,So was the Kelleher if I remember correctly.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,339.815,351.392,Was -- was there a rule in existence promulgated by the Southern District Court of the Southern District prior to the adjudication in Mercado?
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,351.392,359.156,"If it was, sir, it is mentioned in the Mercado, but not discussed or taken as part of the -- as taken as part of the case."
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,361.09,363.206,But the -- but the decision --
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,363.206,364.622,"Is not based on that, sir."
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,364.622,365.768,"It's not based on that, but if --"
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,365.768,366.021,No.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,366.021,369.174,-- there was such a rule then the decision must be nullified.
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,372.672,372.895,No.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,372.895,375.714,"-- the Southern District of New York, there is such a rule."
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,375.714,382.363,"Yes sir, and it is the uniform and universal practice of all lawyers in New York to follow such rule."
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,382.363,384.829,You -- would you clear up my -- I don't understand.
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,389.515,390.839,"Right, sir, but --"
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,390.839,392.734,Well then how can it be still persisting?
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,392.734,393.164,No.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,399.801,400.455,It's not.
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,400.455,401.12,"No, sir."
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,401.12,404.275,Well has that been overruled by decision of the Court of Appeals?
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,404.275,407.787,By the -- by the local court rule.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,407.787,411.281,But how could the District Court overrule the Court of Appeals even in New York?
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,411.281,434.09,"Because sir it is a question -- in the first place, sir, the Mercado case passed on the proposition of whether or not, the Court had the right to accept a -- evidence deposition as evidence and not as to the taking of evidence."
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,434.09,437.686,Well I don't -- I get darker and darker on this subject.
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,438.037,438.964,I'm trying to help sir.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,438.964,441.307,-- this if we can't use it.
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,441.307,442.111,What is the point of the case?
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,442.111,446.699,What is the point of authorizing the taking of their position if it's inadmissible as evidence?
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,446.699,451.977,Because one is -- one is a pretrial discovery deposition --
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,451.977,452.118,Can it be used for trial --
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,452.118,467.055,-- for the purpose of discovery and the other is for the using of the -- of evidence -- of the deposition as evidence in a trial and there is a great distinction between the two.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,487.99,489.303,Well take your case.
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,489.303,489.492,I'd love --
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,489.492,492.693,"Are you -- what are you after here, the deposition?"
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,492.693,509.912,We're after a deposition so we can find out what happened because we have two men who have died and all the people who were around the scene belong to the boat who are employees and we can't get any information unless we ask them about it.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,509.912,514.873,Well the information that was authorized by Judge Miner and Judge -- well Judge Miner --
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,514.873,515.105,"Yes, sir."
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,515.105,517.24,-- would that be useful to get about the decision?
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,519.525,520.243,No sir.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,525.433,530.727,"The basis -- the basis on which subsequently, but you can't use it."
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,534.941,535.329,Unless --
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,535.329,536.249,-- as evidence?
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,536.249,538.634,"Yes sir, unless for two reasons."
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,550.243,553.025,"Well, can you use it -- at Miner of course."
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,559.234,560.215,"I'd say, yes sir because anything --"
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,560.215,563.783,Is it under the Mercado decision of Judge Clark?
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,563.783,566.995,"I don't consider the Mercado decision the law sir, because --"
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,566.995,567.422,Well --
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,567.422,568.847,-- because there has been so much.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,568.847,570.78,I don't know if it isn't the law.
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,588.74,589.246,Yes.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,589.988,592.101,"And so, it's important for me to understand --"
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,592.101,592.513,Since --
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,592.513,596.652,"-- what the practice, the allowable practice in New York is."
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,596.652,616.287,"I -- I thought I made the statement too, Your Honor that the practice in New York is that there is universal taking of discovery depositions in admiralty cases based upon the local rule."
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,616.287,628.446,"Now my question is whether with Mercado on the books, could a proctor in New York impeach, use the pretrial discovery materials for impeachment purposes?"
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,628.446,632.84,The question that I say is my -- this is my opinion.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,674.564,692.865,"Do I understand you to say that if this case -- if this question, the use a free trial discovery material for impeachment purposes came up before the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, Judge Clark sitting, he would say that the Mercado case doesn't apply."
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,692.865,694.661,I think so and I tell you why sir.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,694.661,696.47,Is there any decision on that?
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,696.47,728.222,"Because right within six weeks after he wrote the decision in the Mercado case, the Republic of France versus Belships case came up which -- where it was decided in that case and that -- the citation on that is District Court 1950 and the citation 184, F 2d 119."
1959.156,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,741.106,742.624,Is that after the Mercado?
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,742.624,743.751,Yes sir.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,784.993,795.666,Are you -- are you -- am I wrong or right in finding Judge Clark's opinion in Mercado and Judge Fee's opinion in Dowling in contradiction.
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,795.666,801.512,I'd said so yes on a different basis but I'd say that they are -- they are in contradiction.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,805.795,807.487,As a basis for what?
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,807.487,810.613,For permitting oral discovery depositions.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,810.613,812.407,And you're not citing Mercado?
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,812.407,813.071,No sir.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,813.311,819.163,"And you're not saying that the law of the dist -- of the Southern District of New York is the Dowling law, is that it?"
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,819.163,848.385,"The law of the Southern District of New York is the -- is the law that has been cited in the -- in the cases which I would be glad to -- which we cite in our brief but which hold that where there has been where there is a local rule in force, then you have the right to take an oral discovery deposition and that came up in the Ludina case."
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,848.385,864.388,"Well I'm sorry to break-in on your argument, but when you said the Southern District of New York, that naturally raised a very important question in my mind because if you're right about that then I must reread Mercado and get a different understanding of it."
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,864.388,876.192,"I -- If I -- In our petition for certiorari, if the Court please, we presented letters and I have many more from all the leading practitioners in admiralty."
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,878.093,879.38,I remember that.
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,879.38,879.82,And they have --
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,879.82,882.979,And I was surprised to see Mercado.
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,882.979,886.64,And they -- there isn't one who has followed that since.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,889.429,895.033,"You were stating when I interrupted perhaps very unwisely, you were giving the list of districts --"
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,895.033,895.133,Yes sir.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,895.133,898.554,-- in which the -- the use of them rule of the --
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,898.554,899.521,Local rule exists.
1959.156,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,899.521,903.502,"The local rule prevails and I stopped you, I'm sorry."
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,906.178,931.451,"New York and then there is Pennsylvania, Maryland, North Carolina, if Your Honor would want the rule numbers, I can give it to you, South Carolina, Virginia, Canal Zone, Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Ohio, Missouri, Alaska, California, Washington and Oregon."
1959.156,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,940.228,944.396,Is that material in your brief or many of the documents submitted?
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,944.396,948.205,Yes sir we have a notice to the statistics here.
1959.156,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,948.205,952.386,"Well, the rule -- the jurisdictions and the numbers of the rule."
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,952.386,956.756,"No sir, but I have them all here."
1959.156,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,959.557,962.724,How is this material to our question --
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,962.724,991.489,"Because sir, it's material in that if this rule, if the Court holds that pretrial oral discovery depositions are not permissible in admiralty cases, that means that everyone of these states which have local rules and which are the coastal states and which are the great lake states that handle all the admiralty cases are going to have change their whole practice and their whole procedures."
1959.156,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,991.489,994.917,You know whether there is uniformity among these rules?
1959.156,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,994.917,999.744,"Practically every rule, there is uniformity."
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,2937.931,2940.034,I'm not going to read all this --
1959.156,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2940.034,2944.872,(Inaudible)
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,2944.872,2949.713,I think we need a little housekeeping to start with.
1959.156,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3021.608,3023.199,Well he doesn't have the monopoly on that.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,3023.199,3024.304,I beg your pardon sir.
1959.156,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3024.304,3029.835,"He doesn't have the monopoly on that case, does he?[Laughter]"
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,3029.835,3036.153,Well no.
1959.156,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3129.109,3145.552,That enlightens me a little bit on what – on what the distinction that Judge Fee made without passing on it between the requirements of a party as against the witness.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,3145.552,3154.177,I shall have more to say to that if I -- as I go along.
1959.156,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3400.104,3401.204,Admiralty rule?
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,3401.204,3411.896,"Admiralty rules, yes sir, by Section 2073 of the new judicial code."
1959.156,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3579.197,3586.431,Am I wrong in recalling that the admiralty bar in its organized form was divided on this subject?
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,3586.431,3591.598,"The next page of the same document states, I quote again --"
1959.156,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3591.598,3592.753,Mr. Davis that --
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,3592.753,3603.303,"-- several members wish the “discovery” rules broaden like the civil rules, others do not."
1959.156,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3603.303,3605.566,What verses you read --
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,3605.566,3611.505,I'm reading sir from the – a report to the Maritime Law Association of the United States.
1959.156,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3611.505,3611.786,But the --
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,3611.786,3616.969,The occasion to which Mr. Justice Black referred when -- I beg your pardon?
1959.156,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3616.969,3619.386,"The date, the date."
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,3619.386,3624.891,"Oh forgive me I gave that, I didn't speak loud enough, April 1949."
1959.156,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3624.891,3626.517,Is that cited in your brief?
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,3626.517,3629.169,Sir the question arouse in the argument only.
1959.156,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3634.996,3637.733,I suspect the documents are in the possession of the Court.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,3637.733,3640.764,Your Honor I have a suspicion that they are.
1959.156,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3640.764,3642.233,Where did you get that?
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,3642.233,3647.399,I got that sir as a member of the Maritime Law Association of the United States.
1959.156,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3647.399,3648.25,And what is the ni --
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,3648.25,3652.91,"And also a member of its committee on the Admiralty Rules I may say, if you don't mind the personal reference."
1959.156,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3652.91,3665.714,Was that at the time that the Court sent inquiry with the different circuits as to the -- as admiralty business asking them to sound out the views of the bar.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,3667.268,3672.62,I'm not prepared to answer that question categorically from recollection.
1959.156,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3675.054,3677.318,What is the name of that report again?

1959.156,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3684.311,3685.546,Thank you.
1959.156,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3685.546,3687.816,Is that the association committee or --?
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,3687.816,3692.745,"That's the Maritime Law Association sir, not the committee of the Judicial Congress."
1959.156,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3692.745,3696.25,"Title 28, you say?"
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,3696.25,3697.076,No sir.
1959.156,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3697.076,3698.699,Report of committee on --
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,3698.699,3708.273,"Report of the committee on the revision of Title 28, U.S. Code."
1959.156,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4175.841,4176.55,Mr. Hayes.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,4176.55,4177.185,Yes sir.
1959.156,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4177.185,4178.937,"Could you please – might I ask you please sir, would it be my --"
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,4178.937,4179.633,Forgive me.
1959.156,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4179.633,4192.5,Would it be more -- would it be more rough to use the word in an admiralty case than it would be in a civil case in a law side?
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,4192.5,4192.68,Your Honor --
1959.156,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4192.68,4195.13,Or what do you have to say about that sir?
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,4195.13,4197.357,I have a good deal to say about it Your Honor.
1959.156,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4243.457,4253.018,"Now whether this Court found, is it a good idea or not has this Court authorized the -- such rule?"
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,4253.018,4258.373,Well counsel substantially concedes that you haven't done it.
1959.156,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4269.803,4272.205,The question isn't whether we've done it.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,4282.269,4297.289,"Well a district court's -- do District Courts require, I'm not trying to mince with Your Honor but I do think it's important to distinguish between the means by which District Courts acquire power."
1959.156,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4336.034,4352.454,Well there -- you said you would agree that there are rules which District Courts may promulgate for the conduct of admiralty litigation that clearly would not be in conflict with the promulgated admiralty rules of this country of 1939.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,4359.62,4363.372,"I know I apologize for it I guess, I understand."
1959.156,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4631.555,4632.749,How is it done now?
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,4642.533,4643.294,In admiralty?
1959.156,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4643.294,4646.086,Yes.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,4646.086,4649.198,I'll do my utmost on some now.
1959.156,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4676.989,4679.108,Can he file -- can he file the interrogatory?
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,4679.108,4682.068,"Yes sir, he can then file interrogatory."
1959.156,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4682.068,4683.558,And can you file an interrogatory?
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,4683.558,4686.089,I can file interrogatories.
1959.156,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4712.001,4714.13,Are they verified -- do they have to be verified?
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,4714.13,4715.008,They do sir.
1959.156,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4719.641,4721.385,If he does not answer.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,4721.385,4728.018,"If he does not answer, the Court may do anything to him including dismissing the suit."
1959.156,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4728.018,4729.954,(Inaudible)
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,4729.954,4732.09,By asking questions.
1959.156,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4732.09,4734.981,In the (Inaudible) question or not.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,4734.981,4738.008,"By asking him questions on interrogatories, Your Honor."
1959.156,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4738.008,4739.116,On interrogatories.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,4739.116,4740.834,Yes.
1959.156,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4740.834,4749.636,Up to 1913 that was substantially the course of procedure in equity suits until oral testimony was introduced.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,4749.636,4758.704,I'm interested that to the fact - in effect that Your Honor refers to equity.
1959.156,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5125.507,5127.907,"Mr. Hayes, may I ask you a question?"
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,5127.907,5128.315,Yes sir.
1959.156,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5128.315,5132.783,"It hadn't been discussed the practical part of it, I assume."
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,5135.859,5140.648,"I can call my friend to witness sir, I am."
1959.156,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5140.648,5142.313,I'm trying to find out how this works.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,5164.283,5169.802,May I give Your Honor an example right straight out of the book?
1959.156,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5361.627,5378.483,"Mr. Hayes, what do you to say about counsel's statement that this rule does exist in all these important ports like New York, Pennsylvania, and the Gulf Coast though, and out in the Pacific Ocean?"
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,5380.544,5385.729,My understanding is that they do not exist in the Eastern District of New York.
1959.156,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5396.554,5403.957,"I was just going to say by not being uniform, you mean not uniform in express verbiage or no --"
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,5403.957,5404.818,No I mean uniform in effect.
1959.156,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5404.818,5405.763,In substance.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,5405.763,5405.868,In effect.
1959.156,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5405.868,5405.99,In substance.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,5405.99,5406.873,In effect.
1959.156,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5406.873,5408.285,Yes.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,5408.285,5408.877,In effect.
1959.156,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5450.72,5453.818,May I just -- just make this one suggestion.
1959.156,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5464.987,5467.708,We couldn't get the text of the rules.
1959.156,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5467.708,5468.168,I beg your pardon.
1959.156,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5468.168,5470.359,We couldn't get the text of the rules.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,5470.359,5473.986,"I -- I -- Your Honor please, I can give you the source of it."
1959.156,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5481.056,5481.906,That's the provision.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,5481.906,5482.775,Yes sir.
1959.156,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5488.656,5490.588,"What is the effect now, Mr. Hayes?"
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,5491.042,5493.636,I can't give you that because there's many in this capital of law.
1959.156,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5493.636,5502.495,"I was going to say, Mr. Hayes, if you disagree with the -- with the statement in that regard, will you -- will you file just a brief memorandum on it?"
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,5502.495,5512.537,Well I'm not going to quarrel with what Mr. Benedict says if there -- I don't have time to get that research but I will file a list of ports where they don't exist if I may.
1959.156,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5512.537,5512.991,Yes.
1959.156,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5514.562,5519.558,He said Louisiana and you explicitly said it's not the rule in New Orleans.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,5519.558,5540.82,"I was on the telephone no longer ago than last week with a very good friend of mine who was well known to some members of this Court who said that if you try to do that before and he named the judges who sat there, you'd be disapproved of."
1959.156,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5546.53,5550.01,Louisiana that excludes Louis -- New Orleans is rather important.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,5550.01,5556.316,"Sir, it's the Western wherever New Orleans is, it's the Western District Louisiana Rule 30."
1959.156,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5556.316,5557.853,"But what Court is that, Mr. Hayes?"
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,5557.853,5559.711,I don't know sir.
1959.156,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5559.711,5561.71,The Western that would be --
1959.156,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5561.71,5563.213,Shreveport.
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,5563.213,5563.932,Shreveport.
1959.156,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5564.451,5564.974,Yes.
1959.156,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5564.974,5570.907,(Inaudible)
1959.156,1,22418,edward_b_hayes,,5590.745,5592.66,"Yes, that's true."
1959.156,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5602.182,5605.785,"Very well, we'll adjourn now."
