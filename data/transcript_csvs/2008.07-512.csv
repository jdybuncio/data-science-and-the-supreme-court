2008.07-512,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.904,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 07-512, Pacific Bell v. Link Line Communications."
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,8.856,24.365,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision because it conflicts with this Court's holding in Trinko and is contrary to principles regarding unilateral pricing decisions as explained in Brooke Group and elsewhere."
2008.07-512,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,24.365,28.567,"You are probably feeling pretty good about your chances since your opponent has given up, right?"
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,29.769,44.779,"Well, Your Honor, it's -- it is correct, as this Court observed in Roberts, that the Respondents' agreement that the legal position of the court below is incorrect certainly should provide this Court great comfort in reversing the decision of the Ninth Circuit."
2008.07-512,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,57.37,63.072,"Do you have any question, or should we have, about the Article III status of this aspect of the dispute?"
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,63.072,64.773,"--No, Your Honor."
2008.07-512,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,82.818,93.959,"Well, you might be right, but, you know, with respect to standing we've held that that is an issue-by-issue inquiry, not a live case broadly conceived."
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,93.959,103.399,"Well, in Laidlaw the Court said that it was for a particular type of relief that the plaintiff had to establish standing, but that's not at issue here."
2008.07-512,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,134.953,137.905,I thought they asked to have the Ninth Circuit decision vacated.
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,142.44,157.383,"--That is right, Justice Ginsburg, but the point is that if this Court were to disagree -- if the -- for example, it's well established that the Solicitor General's confession of error, for example, or a State attorney general's confession of error does not bind this Court."
2008.07-512,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,220.437,242.786,"When this comes up, we usually, if a -- if a party abandons a position in support of the decision, the court of appeals decision, we have appointed -- as you noted in your brief, we have appointed a friend of the court to represent the position of the circuit."
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,254.492,262.931,"--Well, that's true, Your Honor, but there is -- there is amicus arguing before the Court today defending the Ninth Circuit's decision."
2008.07-512,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,314.148,325.338,Is there any way in which the resolution of their price-squeeze claim would affect their Brooke Group section 2 claim?
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,325.338,327.506,"--Well, I think it could, Your Honor."
2008.07-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,380.741,382.693,May I just clarify one thing?
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,391.649,397.452,"Well, Your Honor, I believe I am challenging Judge Hand's reasoning in Alcoa."
2008.07-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,433.076,435.744,Was there such a duty in the Alcoa case?
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,435.744,440.565,"--Well, I think that the Alcoa case was wrongly decided, Your Honor, and in several respects."
2008.07-512,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,485.391,487.927,There's -- so there's regulation involved there.
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,507.424,508.307,--Well--
2008.07-512,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,508.307,510.793,That would -- suppose you had those circumstances.
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,515.28,534.508,"--It -- it -- it wouldn't, Your Honor, for the following reason: That I think it is -- it is true that the -- the key point is that the basis upon which the question -- the question presented has been granted and upon which the analysis has to turn is that there is no duty to deal at all at the wholesale level."
2008.07-512,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,551.286,556.005,"Well, that may be the assumption on this case, but that may not be the assumption on the next case."
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,590.161,594.797,"Well, Justice Souter, let me try to be clear about the relationship."
2008.07-512,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,595.649,598.767,"Well, the best way to do that is to start with a yes or no answer ----"
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,600.084,600.767,--I think that that's not--
2008.07-512,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,600.767,601.434,--so I know where you're going.
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,601.434,603.036,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2008.07-512,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,605.136,605.571,Okay.
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,605.571,613.975,"Our position is that in the absence of a duty to deal, one does not look at an allegation of insufficient margin as a potential section claim."
2008.07-512,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,613.975,614.344,Okay.
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,633.805,638.042,"Your Honor, I don't think that the Court has to anticipate that."
2008.07-512,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,680.036,687.69,"Well, that's it -- I mean, now maybe you can get me off what I am thinking, but now it sounds that the answer to Justice Stevens's question is yes."
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,701.033,701.65,Well--
2008.07-512,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,701.65,720.328,"It's quite a different matter if, in fact, the person who is injured, namely, the -- the fabricator who is complaining, has a place to go, such as the FCC or the Alcoa regulatory agency, because under those circumstances, he has a place to complain that these prices are out of line."
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,745.995,749.847,"--Well, Your Honor, the -- the answer to that is two-fold."
2008.07-512,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,763.357,765.107,Then I would say that shouldn't be the law.
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,802.232,817.258,"--I think the answer to that argument, Your Honor, is the one that Trinko offers, which is that it is very important in establishing antitrust rules to recognize the incentives that those rules will create for investment and for innovation."
2008.07-512,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,878.196,886.986,"Just out of curiosity, is there a place where, in this case, the plaintiffs could go, a place which has the label ""regulator"" under it?"
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,886.986,888.171,"--Yes, there is, Your Honor."
2008.07-512,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,888.171,889.754,And that person is--
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,889.754,891.706,The Federal Communications Commission.
2008.07-512,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,891.706,894.241,--So we needn't reach this issue in this case?
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,894.241,903.431,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the significance of regulation here is -- is not necessary."
2008.07-512,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,928.344,947.638,"With respect to your argument that there's going to be an upstream disincentive to investment in the monopolist if we do not come up with a clear rule that you want, are we at a stage or is the fashion of economics at a stage where we can say that there is a clear consensus supporting your argument?"
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,955.244,970.921,"Your Honor, I think there is a consensus in the -- in the -- in all of the scholarly literature that was cited by the American Antitrust Institute, there wasn't anyone who supported -- there was no scholar who supported the recognition of a price-squeeze claim under section 2."
2008.07-512,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,972.872,977.507,"For the -- for the reasons you gave, in effect, the investment disincentive reason?"
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,977.507,989.465,"--Well, I think the scholarly literature that explains that recognition of price-squeeze duty would be harmful does indeed rely on the sorts of -- of reasons that I--"
2008.07-512,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,989.465,995.821,"Is that, in effect, uncontested within the profession except -- you know, except at the margins?"
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,995.821,1001.808,"--I would assume that as -- as in any academic discipline, there are those who would try to find counterexamples."
2008.07-512,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1022.971,1024.421,"I mean, I follow the argument."
2008.07-512,0,16739,aaron_panner,,1045.251,1065.914,"Well, I think that the Brooke -- the Brooke Group decision and the reasoning behind that and then as reaffirmed in Weyerhauser explains the answer to that, Justice Souter, which is that there are a certain kind of conduct where it is possible to create a model where there would be some negative -- negative consequences of the conduct, but that the very search for it risks deterring conduct that is of obvious benefit to the consumers."
2008.07-512,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1108.241,1109.258,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1118.597,1145.181,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If a retail-level rival can state a section claim against a vertically integrated company by alleging nothing more than a margin-based price squeeze, one of two outcomes will result: Either the vertically integrated company will have to raise its retail prices to its consumers, or it will be forced to share the benefits of its lawful monopoly with its rivals by lowering its wholesale price."
2008.07-512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1164.262,1169.816,"Ms. Maynard, do you join in your colleague's suggestion that we should overrule the Alcoa case?"
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1169.816,1175.97,"--I do think the Alcoa case -- the government believes the Alcoa case is wrongly decided, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1175.97,1179.254,Do you think it's necessary to do so to decide this case?
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1179.254,1208.857,"I think it's -- I mean, one could say that Judge Hand didn't necessarily recognize a price-squeeze claim standing alone because he has some language about -- to the effect that perhaps this isn't an independent wrong, but the way that he analyzed it separately and the way courts have ruled -- have relied upon it to suggest that a mere margin-based price squeeze without more does state a section 2 claim is incorrect."
2008.07-512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1208.857,1214.392,My question is whether you think it's -- it's necessary to overrule that decision in order to decide this case correctly?
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1214.392,1216.261,"Well, I don't think technically it needs overruling."
2008.07-512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1222.331,1224.265,Do we have to say it was decided incorrectly?
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1224.265,1226.867,--I think the Court should say it was decided incorrectly.
2008.07-512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1226.867,1227.55,That's not my question.
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1228.319,1231.271,"Yes, Justice Stevens, I think it's incorrect."
2008.07-512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1231.271,1233.271,I know you think it's incorrect.
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1238.924,1252.1,"Yes, unless you're willing to say Judge Hand didn't hold that -- that a price-squeeze claim without more is an independent theory that supports a section 2 claim."
2008.07-512,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1263.223,1269.127,"Well, why -- why can't we just say Trinko was a case, as is this case, where there is a regulator?"
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1291.309,1298.229,"--The regulation, Justice Breyer, in Trinko was relevant for two reasons that are not relevant to the question before the Court here."
2008.07-512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1308.104,1308.621,Right.
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1308.621,1316.441,That holding is relevant here because it means that Petitioners' regulatory to deal -- duty to deal does not create an antitrust duty to deal.
2008.07-512,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1333.716,1338.204,But it -- it -- it said the issue in that case was a duty to deal.
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1381.281,1382.466,"--Well, a couple of things."
2008.07-512,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1419.472,1420.091,But--
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1420.091,1420.507,That takes--
2008.07-512,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1420.507,1422.657,"--No, I didn't -- I didn't want to interrupt your answer."
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1423.126,1423.426,--I'm sorry.
2008.07-512,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1423.426,1423.926,All right.
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1424.259,1432.732,"That takes the wholesale price and the possibility of lowering that, Justice Breyer, off the table; and without the top pincer as it were, there is no price squeeze."
2008.07-512,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1450.776,1477.344,"Isn't it -- isn't it the case that if, in effect, we -- we refuse to come down with a -- the kind of blanket answer, with a rule that you want, that the parties here can go out -- the complaining party here can go back to the FCC and say there's something wrong with your wholesale pricing order; look what's happening; and the FCC may adjust the wholesale pricing order as a result of that?"
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1487.283,1495.52,"Well, the government's view is that the current antitrust doctrine already forecloses this claim for the reasons that I was explaining."
2008.07-512,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1501.322,1508.411,"Well, you're -- you're certainly asking us to -- at the very least, to clarify the significance of Alcoa."
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1542.315,1555.475,"--Well, the -- the Respondents here were attempting to press, and the Ninth Circuit has allowed them to go forward on, a treble damages claim where they seek $40 million under a pure margin-based price-squeeze theory."
2008.07-512,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1678.321,1687.395,"So you are saying in practical terms that if there is a squeeze, it is highly unlikely it's going to be anything but a Brooke Group kind of squeeze, and therefore keep it simple."
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1687.395,1692.347,"--That if there is something anticompetitive going on, that section 2 cares about--"
2008.07-512,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1692.347,1692.713,Yes.
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1692.713,1722.819,"--they would need to allege that the Petitioners' retail prices are below some appropriate measure of the -- of the Petitioners' costs; and what they want to do is attribute -- and what Alcoa does, which is why it's mistaken, is it attributes -- it would attribute to Petitioners the wholesale price they are willing to sell their upstream input to others, and what Brooke Group makes clear is that the relevant cost is the internal cost to the Petitioners."
2008.07-512,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1722.819,1724.319,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-512,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1724.319,1730.405,If I could just ask -- everything you've said is applicable to a predatory price claim as well as a price squeeze?
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1730.405,1752.052,"We believe that if they can allege the elements of a predatory pricing claim under Brooke Group, then they would still have that claim even in the absence of a duty to deal, and that labeling it a predatory price squeeze doesn't add anything, that the court should clarify that there is no separate price-squeeze theory of section 2 liability, if that's all that is without more."
2008.07-512,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1757.94,1758.992,Yes.
2008.07-512,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1758.992,1759.858,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-512,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1759.858,1760.325,Thank you.
2008.07-512,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1760.325,1764.396,Mr. Blecher.
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,1764.396,1779.988,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I don't have a white flag and I don't think we particularly have given up, but let me start by suggesting that you don't need to decide the vitality of Alcoa."
2008.07-512,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1798.283,1800.4,I don't understand what you just said.
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,1808.922,1809.673,Not--
2008.07-512,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1809.673,1812.459,--to accept Judge Gould's position.
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,1812.459,1813.059,--Yes.
2008.07-512,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1813.059,1817.244,And how can we do that without saying that the majority was wrong?
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,1817.244,1821.315,There's a difference between being wrong and being incomplete.
2008.07-512,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1928.751,1931.453,"Well, you don't certify questions; you certify orders."
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,1942.075,1944.427,"--Partly, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-512,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1946.479,1955.735,"You made -- you made -- you made an argument, or did you not, that's consistent with what the court of appeals did hold in this case?"
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,1955.735,1960.806,"--Well, I question whether that's what they held."
2008.07-512,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1976.331,1981.719,Wasn't the court of appeals' decision consistent with the argument that you made to the court of appeals?
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,1981.719,1991.175,"--It's consistent, but it didn't say, we endorse Alcoa, and it didn't say we require a -- predatory pricing."
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2006.482,2007.684,"Counsel, I am confused--"
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2007.684,2008.717,And that's all they were deciding.
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2008.717,2013.005,"--I am confused about what you mean when you say ""the price squeeze claim""."
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2013.005,2013.921,A non-predatory--
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2013.921,2017.039,Is that any different -- is that any different than a Brooke Group claim?
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2017.039,2020.824,--A -- a non-predatory price squeeze case.
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2020.824,2024.193,So you still want to be able to argue that--
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2024.193,2024.643,No.
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2024.643,2027.228,--above-cost retail prices--
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2027.228,2027.764,No.
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2027.764,2028.897,--somehow violate Brooke Group?
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2028.897,2036.184,I am very content to go back to file an amended complaint purely under Brooke so there's no gamesmanship.
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2036.184,2037.786,And you -- you agree that requires--
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2037.786,2038.186,And we would--
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2038.186,2041.088,--That requires below-cost retail pricing?
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2041.088,2041.338,--Yes.
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2063.937,2083.249,"Is the wholesale price claim that the Ninth Circuit looked at in -- in the case below, in the decision below, a necessary or significant or partial element of your Brooke Group claim, or is it totally irrelevant?"
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2083.249,2085.851,More or less irrelevant.
2008.07-512,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2118.238,2119.005,Is the first--
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2119.005,2119.69,And this is not--
2008.07-512,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2119.69,2128.563,--Is the first time that you indicated that you were in agreement with the Gould dissent in your -- the brief that you filed here in this Court?
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2128.563,2133.515,"--Yes, directly, but we did have--"
2008.07-512,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2133.515,2134.034,But it--
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2134.034,2135.2,--a predatory pricing--
2008.07-512,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2135.2,2149.043,"--it seems to me that, in that instance, you seriously prejudiced the -- the Petitioners here, and that that should be weighed heavily against you when you ask to -- for permission to amend your complaint in the district court."
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2150.659,2151.492,--No--
2008.07-512,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2151.492,2153.392,--There have -- there have been costs and time--
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2153.392,2166.252,"--See -- see, Justice Kennedy, you granted certiorari and agreed to review a decision that was essentially moot, because the complaint that you're talking about in this case has been superseded."
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2187.515,2193.569,"Well, I guess it would have been nice, if you thought the case was essentially moot, to hear about that in the cert opposition."
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2193.569,2195.938,--I'm sorry?
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2195.938,2202.592,You didn't argue that the decision below was essentially moot in your opposition to certiorari here.
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2202.592,2208.346,"In -- in the opposition, that's correct."
2008.07-512,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2208.346,2215.315,--Nor did you give notice to the Petitioners' attorney that that was your position so that you could have asked for a stipulation on the point.
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2215.315,2229.742,"Well, I think what you are overlooking, though, is when we went to the Ninth Circuit, we endorsed Judge Wilson's suggestion that they decide the Brooke issue, so that, when we went back, we'd have guidance as to what the appropriate standard was."
2008.07-512,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2260.713,2273.438,"So can we write this following -- we say: In the district court, as of this moment, there is no complaint that alleges the price-squeeze theory of the majority of the Ninth Circuit."
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2297.219,2297.786,I think--
2008.07-512,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2297.786,2299.255,Is that a possible thing to say?
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2299.255,2300.638,--And -- and--
2008.07-512,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2300.638,2302.29,"Yes or no, please."
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2302.29,2303.357,--It avoids the need to--
2008.07-512,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2303.357,2305.19,"Is it yes, we could do that, or no--"
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2305.19,2305.573,--Yes.
2008.07-512,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.573,2306.04,"--Yes, we could?"
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2306.559,2307.092,"Yes, you can."
2008.07-512,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2307.942,2308.625,Isn't it -- is it--
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2308.625,2314.296,"--If you don't need to reach Alcoa here, because the Ninth Circuit did not endorse Alcoa."
2008.07-512,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2316.748,2320.95,--Has the Brooke Group complaint been allowed in the district court or--
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2320.95,2321.869,It was allowed.
2008.07-512,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2321.869,2323.102,--It has been tried?
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2323.102,2332.024,"Judge Wilson ruled that it was a -- quote, ""generously construed"", we stated a Brooke claim, and he would review it again at summary judgment stage."
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2339.963,2344.934,Justice Breyer's draft judgment said we would vacate the decision below.
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2362.109,2363.692,That certainly is an option.
2008.07-512,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2376.785,2379.737,The Ninth Circuit had a precedent that it thought it was following.
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2381.353,2382.186,Yes.
2008.07-512,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2383.269,2399.379,"--So isn't it important if we -- you think that they were wrong and we agree with you, that we get -- not just vacate but say: You were wrong on the law; you were wrong in this case, and you were wrong in Anaheim."
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2405.349,2413.388,"--Well, that's if you want to cross the Rubicon and decide that there can only be a price-squeeze claim if the price is predatory."
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2444.158,2454.096,You're saying we don't have to cross the Rubicon because your Brooke Group predatory pricing claim will show that the prices here were below cost?
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2454.096,2454.715,Correct.
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2454.715,2457.917,"So we don't have to consider, which I guess I thought we had to consider--"
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2457.917,2465.071,This is not a case where we are confronting you with the -- with the necessity of deciding the vitality of Alcoa.
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2467.273,2470.391,--And you're not going to amend your complaint to raise such a claim on remand?
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2470.391,2478.045,--I am going to file an amended complaint that will be limited entirely to a Brooke predatory pricing claim.
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2478.045,2482.116,Which you understand to require that the retail prices be below cost?
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2482.116,2484.567,And we are very comfortable with that.
2008.07-512,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2492.138,2506.748,"But if we follow your proposal, then you could, in a case filed next week or the week after we decide the case, assert exactly the claim that you asserted here originally, and that would be good law in the Ninth Circuit?"
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2506.748,2513.385,"The answer to that, Justice Alito, I think is that you can remand with the -- with direction--"
2008.07-512,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2513.385,2514.754,"No, I don't mean in this case."
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2515.92,2521.674,"--Oh, can some -- can we raise that, or can someone else raise that?"
2008.07-512,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2522.257,2524.374,Either you or anybody else in the Ninth Circuit?
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2524.374,2537.683,"--Well, I think if you abide my idea how to deal with this, the issue of Alcoa's vitality would remain open to be decided in another case another day."
2008.07-512,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2537.683,2539.718,We'd vacate.
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2542.185,2542.753,Yes.
2008.07-512,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2542.753,2543.27,Yes.
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2543.92,2563.334,"That's right, because a vacation can rest on the ground that the Ninth Circuit did not reach the issue, and -- but we're -- we're prepared to abide Judge Gould's view that, in a regulated industry, we can only have a, quote, ""price squeeze"" if the price is predatory."
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2563.334,2572.706,"But the reason you think we should vacate is not because the Ninth Circuit didn't decide the question, but because you are willing not to press it?"
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2572.706,2573.572,No.
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2589.901,2592.001,"So, I guess -- I guess it's where we are about to go."
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2602.126,2617.718,"--Or you can simply say that the case is remanded, the district court may decide the propriety of an amended complaint, except that the amended complaint cannot state a non-predatory price-squeeze claim."
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2619.42,2624.055,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-512,2,35427,maxwell_m_blecher,,2624.055,2624.755,Thank you.
2008.07-512,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2624.755,2636.697,Mr. Brunell.
2008.07-512,3,38650,richard_brunell,,2636.697,2649.873,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We think the proper disposition of this case is to vacate the decision below and to remand and let the district court decide whether the complaint should be amended or not."
2008.07-512,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2777.589,2779.657,"Well, that means they don't have to deal."
2008.07-512,3,38650,richard_brunell,,2782.026,2793.751,"--In our view, it means that a court has found that there's no liability in the event of a refusal to deal, which is what Trinko did."
2008.07-512,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2808.927,2811.879,You mean a Brooke Group retail-price-squeeze claim?
2008.07-512,3,38650,richard_brunell,,2811.879,2819.615,"No, I mean a traditional price-squeeze claim that doesn't have to meet the Brooke Group standard."
2008.07-512,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2826.971,2827.788,May -- may I ask?
2008.07-512,3,38650,richard_brunell,,2836.077,2842.564,--We've listed them in our brief.
2008.07-512,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2859.942,2870.215,Do you agree with your opponent's submission that antitrust scholars uniformly agree that the Alcoa case was incorrectly decided?
2008.07-512,3,38650,richard_brunell,,2870.215,2874.885,"No, I do not agree with that."
2008.07-512,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2904.721,2906.471,Does he support -- pardon me?
2008.07-512,3,38650,richard_brunell,,2915.41,2917.445,"--I believe he does, Your Honor."
2008.07-512,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2928.837,2931.289,Why do we -- why do we need to?
2008.07-512,3,38650,richard_brunell,,2931.289,2933.122,Why do we need to?
2008.07-512,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2942.494,2944.846,Why can't regulation handle it?
2008.07-512,3,38650,richard_brunell,,2944.846,2973.549,"Well, in this case, regulation -- simply the -- the regulation that is referred to is simply the prospect of the complainant going to the Federal Communications Commission and simply asking for some kind of post hoc relief, as opposed to a situation as in Town of Concord or in Trinko where the regulation at issue was quite extensive."
2008.07-512,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2986.939,2999.081,"So why couldn't you -- why wouldn't you -- couldn't you go to the FCC or the other regulator and say: Regulator, they are selling me this widget or line at a dollar."
2008.07-512,3,38650,richard_brunell,,3056.584,3058.134,"Well, the European Commission--"
2008.07-512,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3058.134,3060.202,I'm not saying the European Commission.
2008.07-512,3,38650,richard_brunell,,3079.597,3094.255,--The question of the relationship between the regulatory authority to address a question and whether an antitrust claim exists is normally decided on the basis of implied antitrust immunity.
2008.07-512,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3107.478,3111.966,"Well, would you say that absent the regulatory regime, there would be a duty to deal here?"
2008.07-512,3,38650,richard_brunell,,3111.966,3117.251,"Absent the regulatory regime, would there be a duty to deal?"
2008.07-512,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3128.292,3128.876,No.
2008.07-512,3,38650,richard_brunell,,3145.52,3158.911,--Whether there's a duty to deal can only be answered by asking whether a violation -- a refusal to deal would constitute an antitrust violation.
2008.07-512,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3175.307,3182.294,"It's still seems to me that -- that you, therefore, must rely on the regulation to establish the initial predicate of a duty to deal."
2008.07-512,3,38650,richard_brunell,,3198.238,3206.309,"--Well, the mere fact that there's a regulatory duty to deal does not completely oust antitrust."
2008.07-512,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3224.39,3226.69,Would that lie here first?
2008.07-512,3,38650,richard_brunell,,3240.165,3241.232,--No.
2008.07-512,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3244.701,3245.553,They wouldn't permit it.
2008.07-512,3,38650,richard_brunell,,3257.694,3266.383,"There certainly is the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, which arises typically when the agency is already dealing with a problem and not--"
2008.07-512,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3266.383,3268.267,"Well, they are dealing with the problem there."
2008.07-512,3,38650,richard_brunell,,3273.453,3276.405,"--They certainly don't approve the retail pricing, no."
2008.07-512,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3540.221,3541.59,You can finish your sentence there.
2008.07-512,3,38650,richard_brunell,,3541.59,3571.942,"The notion that they would respond to a price-squeeze complaint by raising their retail price, rather than lowering their wholesale price, I would submit is certainly as belied by the facts of the Alcoa case which in the district court reflect that when the government started looking into the price squeeze and the price squeeze was ended, it was ended voluntarily by Alcoa lowering its wholesale price, not raising its retail price."
2008.07-512,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3572.559,3573.026,"Thank you, counsel."
