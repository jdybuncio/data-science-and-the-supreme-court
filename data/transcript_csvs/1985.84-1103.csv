1985.84-1103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,88.456,"Mr. Lassiter, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,88.456,100.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue presented in Hill v. Lockhart is rather a technical and narrow issue, but one T think is significant in the daily workings of the criminal courts."
1985.84-1103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,140.074,142.693,"What page does that appear at, Mr. Lassiter?"
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,142.693,145.31,It's at 8 and 9 in the joint appendix.
1985.84-1103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,148.762,152.547,Mine only goes to page--
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,152.547,154.13,Eight and 9.
1985.84-1103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,154.13,154.963,"--Oh, 8 and 9."
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,154.963,155.863,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1985.84-1103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,155.863,157.863,Thank you.
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,157.863,166.135,He also indicated that his lawyer told him that the Court would impose a 35-year sentence.
1985.84-1103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,185.548,194.321,Does he allege that he had told... or told his lawyer all of his factual background so that his lawyer would know that Act 93 was applicable?
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,194.321,198.523,"Justice Rehnquist, that does not appear in his pleading."
1985.84-1103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,205.677,211.181,But it wasn't in his petition for habeas that we're reviewing here?
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,211.181,212.2,That's correct.
1985.84-1103,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,229.225,242.985,Does the record reflect that Mr. Hill understood when he entered the plea that had he gone to trial he would serve half of whatever sentence was imposed?
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,242.985,245.171,"No, the record does not reflect that."
1985.84-1103,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,253.61,262.548,But the law in Arkansas at the time was that had he gone to trial he would serve half of any sentence resulting from a conviction?
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,262.548,270.636,"Regardless of whether he pled or went to trial, he would be parole ineligible until serving one-half, less whatever good time had accrued."
1985.84-1103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,270.636,281.158,"As I understand it, Mr. Lassiter, your client here does not make any claim that his guilty plea was not intelligent or knowing."
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,285.044,290.764,"We allege voluntariness, he alleges, we allege that the plea was not voluntarily entered."
1985.84-1103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,290.764,295.667,By reason of erroneous advice from the lawyer?
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,295.667,296.684,That's correct.
1985.84-1103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,296.684,299.286,No claim of erroneous advice from the Court?
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,299.286,310.094,"That's correct, and we also do not claim that the Court was under a duty to advise Petitioner as to potential parole eligibility."
1985.84-1103,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,341.565,345.35,"Mr. Lassiter, who was the lawyer, now deceased?"
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,345.35,346.8,His name is William Patterson.
1985.84-1103,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,348.386,349.219,Patterson?
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,349.219,350.469,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1103,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,354.004,367.097,Would you mind explaining what the law in Arkansas is on alleging and proving prior convictions to enhance or determine parole eligibility?
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,376.619,377.202,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1103,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,377.202,383.523,"That's a determination to be made by the parole board after the conviction and the sentence, is that right?"
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,383.523,387.075,It is determined by the Arkansas Department of Corrections.
1985.84-1103,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,564.589,575.628,"Well, under this plea the highest potential sentence that could have been imposed was up to 50 years, is that correct?"
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,575.628,577.247,"--Five to 50, or life."
1985.84-1103,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,577.247,597.143,"And had the judge given the maximum sentence, then this Mr. Hill would not have had to serve longer than the time he is objecting to here, isn't that true?"
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,621.425,635.601,"Well, the allegation is that he entered the plea based on advice by counsel that he would receive the 35 years, and he did receive the 35 years, and that he relied on that in entering the plea."
1985.84-1103,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,653.794,666.535,"But, now, when the judge asked him whether any promises were made to him to get him to enter the plea agreement, his response was, no, nothing that didn't appear on the agreement."
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,701.792,732.163,"Well, I think I have to address the issue of what sentence that the lawyer told him he would get, in order to demonstrate that the lawyer's advice concerning potential parole eligibility was not just an estimate or a prediction, if he were in the situation where nobody knew what Mr. Hill was going to receive when he walked up there and pled."
1985.84-1103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,732.163,735.365,"Well, he really didn't, did he?"
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,740.734,752.124,"He could have, but that was not that judge's practice and counsel advised him that the Court would impose whatever the recommendation was."
1985.84-1103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.945,763.099,Let's assume he expected to get 35 years and the judge gave him 50.
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,771.621,790.599,"It depends on what happened before and if it was a negotiated plea where the judge had in no manner whatsoever participated in it, and if counsel had not advised him that he was going to get 35 years and he walked up there and the judge gave him 50 years."
1985.84-1103,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,791.082,794.236,"Mr. Lassiter, you keep changing the question."
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,812.964,813.348,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1103,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,813.831,820.887,"So, you are arguing something now that I didn't understand was encompassed in this question at all."
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,832.125,832.944,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1103,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,834.027,842.65,"So, we don't have to consider this discussion this morning about a promise of 35 years maximum, right?"
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,842.65,843.2,That's correct.
1985.84-1103,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,843.2,844.0,Okay.
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,844.0,844.502,That's correct.
1985.84-1103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,854.791,867.349,"Now, in the habeas petition, Mr. Lassiter, did your client make the contention that had he been properly advised as to parole eligibility he would not have entered into this plea bargain?"
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,867.349,869.716,"Your Honor, he does not in his habeas petition."
1985.84-1103,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,894.166,912.127,"Is it your argument that the Constitution requires that in plea bargaining, in hearing before the trial court, that always there is a right, a constitutional right to know the earliest date at which parole may be pursued?"
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,912.127,912.843,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.707,942.676,Let me ask one other factual question.
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,955.484,956.367,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,956.367,958.769,"I mean, there's no way you could testify to this."
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,969.843,976.58,"Well, if you take it as it is, he prepared this pro se petition."
1985.84-1103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,995.811,998.577,"See, one other fact kind of puzzles me a little bit."
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1002.981,1003.865,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1003.865,1009.534,Is it clear that the lawyer who is row deceased was advised about the existence of the prior felony conviction?
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1009.534,1010.534,Not on the record.
1985.84-1103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1010.534,1017.39,"So, you really don't know if the lawyer did anything but tell him, according to his best knowledge, what the law was?"
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1024.628,1025.58,That's correct.
1985.84-1103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1025.58,1028.03,But apparently the judge thought it was a third.
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1034.352,1043.875,"Again, as I said a moment ago, I think counsel is under a duty to inquire about prior convictions even if we had a situation here where petitioner didn't tell him."
1985.84-1103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1046.659,1049.028,Just one other observation.
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1064.121,1066.171,"--Well, yes."
1985.84-1103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1069.289,1092.635,"Mr. Lassiter, couldn't your client have amended his habeas corpus petition if at the time you were objecting to the Magistrate's report it appeared to you that it had not said enough on the subject of whether he would have entered this plea had the advice been correct?"
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1092.635,1100.555,"I believe he could, and as I say i raised that in the objections."
1985.84-1103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1100.555,1102.824,But it's not in any verified way.
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1102.824,1103.241,That's correct.
1985.84-1103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1103.241,1105.443,You certainly can't speak for him.
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1105.443,1109.978,"Well, that would be my error, that that was not done."
1985.84-1103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1109.978,1113.549,"So, we really don't know that by his statement."
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1119.203,1126.107,Not based on the allegations that appear in the original petition.
1985.84-1103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1127.407,1141.532,"Well, not based on any other statement by him in the record, isn't that correct?"
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1141.532,1157.476,It does not appear at page 8 and 9 in his allegations.
1985.84-1103,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1227.036,1255.039,"Mr. Lassiter, assuming that the Court were to feel that the allegation somehow rose to the level that a hearing would be appropriate, what standard should be applied to determine, what legal standard should be applied to determine the ineffectiveness of assistance claim in a plea bargain situation?"
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1255.039,1279.67,"I think we can take Strickland v. Washington and place it on this situation and ask, first of all, was counsel diligent in his representation of the defendant, did he breach some duty owed, some investigatory duty or some other duty owed to the defendant, and we would ask that question first."
1985.84-1103,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1282.572,1286.676,Or perhaps ask first whether there was prejudice.
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1286.676,1298.068,"--That's the second problem with the test, and the prejudice here would be that he would not have entered the plea except for this advice and that he waived his right to go to trial."
1985.84-1103,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1298.068,1302.036,If the facts appear that he had made such--
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1302.036,1303.972,"Yes, of course."
1985.84-1103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1303.972,1311.226,"--May I ask one other... I'm sorry to take so much of your time, but your brief refers to the previous Florida conviction."
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1317.63,1319.696,It doesn't appear.
1985.84-1103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1319.696,1320.698,It does not appear?
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1320.698,1321.698,"No, I don't--"
1985.84-1103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1321.698,1332.222,"Well, is it conceivable... I'm not suggesting this happened, that the defense counsel knew about the Florida conviction but the prosecutor and the judge didn't and he thought it would be a little smarter not to mention it?"
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1336.207,1342.411,--It's possible but it would have been very ill-advised because the Department of Correction would have caught it once he arrived there.
1985.84-1103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1342.411,1345.547,"Yes, but on the other hand, maybe if they'd known... I don't know what that conviction was."
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1366.543,1378.684,"I would have to assume that... again, we would speculate here, but I would have to assume that the prosecutor was aware of that because routinely they run an FBI check on people that are charged with serious crime."
1985.84-1103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1378.684,1383.886,"Well, is it your suggestion the prosecutor didn't know about Law 93 either?"
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1397.728,1407.87,"Yes, it certainly is, and that's one of the first things that your client wants to know if you are negotiating a plea."
1985.84-1103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1484.601,1496.944,"I suppose we can assume that the testimony of the prisoner, who is not here, would be just as it is set out in your brief, that is, that he was misadvised?"
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1496.944,1498.228,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1498.228,1504.347,"And the lawyers... suppose the lawyer says, no, that's not so, contrary testimony?"
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1511.787,1513.653,"That's where it would lodge, at that point."
1985.84-1103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1514.655,1515.922,"Well, except the lawyer's dead."
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1515.922,1517.607,That's correct.
1985.84-1103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1517.607,1521.809,I'm speaking of the general rule of cases that you would make out of this?
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1521.809,1527.111,"That's right, it would simply be the lawyer's testimony against the Petitioner's."
1985.84-1103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1527.111,1531.331,"Well, that wouldn't be the end of it, even if you believed him."
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1531.331,1540.937,"That's correct, in that you would have to show that he wouldn't have entered the plea unless--"
1985.84-1103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1540.937,1550.559,Wouldn't the ineffectiveness claim really boil down to the same issue as the voluntariness of the confession?
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1550.559,1553.494,"--Yes, I believe so, voluntariness of the plea."
1985.84-1103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1553.494,1554.446,"Of the plea, yes."
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1554.446,1556.03,"Yes, I think so."
1985.84-1103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1556.03,1574.642,Did the State ever raise in its defense of this kind of provision the habeas rules that allows dismissal of habeas where the delay in bringing it in has prejudiced the State's ability to defend against the claim?
1985.84-1103,0,31469,jack_t_lassiter,,1574.642,1596.921,"I would like to point out that the initial circuit court pleading which Mr. Hill filed, which he styled a Mr. Patterson's death."
1985.84-1103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1601.639,1603.241,Very well.
1985.84-1103,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1610.395,1617.149,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the facts in this case are simple and direct."
1985.84-1103,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1703.255,1713.796,"General Clark, just so I can find it in the record, the plea agreement is the one on 28 and 29 of the joint appendix, and where is it that he says ""no"" as the prior convictions?"
1985.84-1103,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1716.765,1723.751,"--Your Honor, on the plea agreement, it is a form and there is a space which says ""prior convictions""."
1985.84-1103,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1724.187,1730.757,--Would you just tell me where it is in the record so I can look at... is it 28 and 29?
