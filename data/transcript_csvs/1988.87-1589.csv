1988.87-1589,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,19.795,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-1589, Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Company v. Railway Labor Executives' Association, and No. 87-1888, Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Company v. Railway Labor Executives' Association."
1988.87-1589,0,40733,richard_l_wyatt_jr,,19.795,22.966,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1589,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1338.915,1356.637,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1589,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1372.148,1373.806,That makes it even more complicated.
1988.87-1589,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1374.227,1375.659,"Perhaps, your Honor."
1988.87-1589,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1412.773,1421.328,"What is the government's position, Mr. Minear, with respect to whether or not the district court should have entered a status quo injunction in this case?"
1988.87-1589,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1421.328,1423.071,"The problem here, your Honor, is--"
1988.87-1589,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1423.071,1423.98,Does it have a position?
1988.87-1589,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1423.98,1427.523,"--I believe it does have a position, but it's complicated--"
1988.87-1589,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1427.523,1428.885,What is that... what is the position?
1988.87-1589,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1428.885,1437.861,"--When this case arrived at the district court, there was a request for a status quo injunction, but it wasn't clear what exactly the status quo was."
1988.87-1589,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1466.979,1475.254,"Could the district court have, as it did here, forbade P&LE from going ahead with the sale?"
1988.87-1589,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1475.254,1478.276,"I think only in one circumstance, your Honor."
1988.87-1589,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1483.789,1489.663,"And if the collective bargaining agreements didn't prohibit that, then it should not have prohibited the sale?"
1988.87-1589,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1489.663,1490.805,We think not.
1988.87-1589,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.805,1496.728,"So the judgment here in your mind should be reversed, at least to that extent?"
1988.87-1589,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1496.728,1498.85,At least to that extent it should be reversed.
1988.87-1589,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1499.691,1510.587,"And I take it that if they have to bargain over effects, if as soon as they close the transaction, the bargaining duty is over?"
1988.87-1589,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1510.587,1511.819,"Yes, that's right, your Honor."
1988.87-1589,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.347,1547.59,"Well, the railroad just has to bargain in good faith."
1988.87-1589,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1551.763,1553.035,"That's correct, your Honor."
1988.87-1589,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1608.862,1620.259,"Do you think the notice that was served by the unions in this case was proper in all respects and just covered effects bargaining as you see it, or did it go beyond that?"
1988.87-1589,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1620.259,1624.991,"Well, that's a difficulty here that I don't think the United States is in the best position to address."
1988.87-1589,2,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2811.812,2820.235,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court:
1988.87-1589,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2884.147,2892.833,Do you think that going out of business necessarily involves changing of rates of pay and rules and working conditions?
1988.87-1589,2,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2892.833,2896.206,"As that term is used in the statue... in the Railway Labor Act, yes, your Honor."
1988.87-1589,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2898.436,2905.16,Even though the railroad agrees to until it makes the sale maintain the status quo?
1988.87-1589,2,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2905.16,2916.109,"Yes, your Honor, because what is going to happen as a result of that sale is that P&LE will continue... under the terms of this sale P&LE Railco would operate the railroad."
1988.87-1589,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2925.504,2929.117,"If they just went out of business and sold it to nobody, then it would be different?"
1988.87-1589,2,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2929.117,2930.279,Your Honor--
1988.87-1589,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2930.279,2931.969,"Because then there would be no work, no working conditions."
1988.87-1589,2,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2931.969,2937.673,"--Your Honor, at that point it would still be a change in the collective agreements, as that term is used in the statute."
1988.87-1589,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2937.673,2939.055,"Yeah, but not a change in working conditions."
1988.87-1589,2,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2939.055,2940.173,"It is, your Honor."
1988.87-1589,3,40733,richard_l_wyatt_jr,,4595.515,4602.178,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1988.87-1589,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4602.178,4603.38,Could I just ask you a question?
1988.87-1589,3,40733,richard_l_wyatt_jr,,4607.901,4609.313,"--Oh, absolutely."
1988.87-1589,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4611.694,4612.015,Yes.
1988.87-1589,3,40733,richard_l_wyatt_jr,,4612.015,4616.419,--the ICC in the P&LE proceeding to ask the ICC to allow them to buy the railroad.
1988.87-1589,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4616.419,4619.01,But did they ever ask that the exemption be revoked?
1988.87-1589,3,40733,richard_l_wyatt_jr,,4619.01,4620.4,They asked the exemption be revoked.
1988.87-1589,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4629.877,4633.67,"And if they had asked for labor protection and it had been turned down, I suppose that was subject to judicial review?"
1988.87-1589,3,40733,richard_l_wyatt_jr,,4633.67,4635.751,--That would have been subject to judicial review.
1988.87-1589,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4639.054,4642.326,Judicial review under an arbitrary and capricious standard?
1988.87-1589,4,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,4642.326,4645.579,I believe that's correct but I can't be certain.
1988.87-1589,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4648.18,4653.522,"That was Judge Hutchinson's point in his dissent in the Third Circuit too, wasn't it?"
1988.87-1589,5,40733,richard_l_wyatt_jr,,4653.522,4655.462,"I'm sorry, your Honor."
1988.87-1589,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4655.462,4659.856,Wasn't that part of Judge Hutchinson's point in his dissent in the Third Circuit?
1988.87-1589,5,40733,richard_l_wyatt_jr,,4659.856,4661.436,That was exactly his point.
1988.87-1589,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4724.087,4729.501,"Well, actually, on their theory they don't... they wouldn't have to serve a notice."
1988.87-1589,5,40733,richard_l_wyatt_jr,,4735.154,4736.076,That's right.
1988.87-1589,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4744.261,4749.714,I know you have some things you want to say but what about... isn't there another case before us?
1988.87-1589,5,40733,richard_l_wyatt_jr,,4749.714,4750.515,"Yes, your Honor."
