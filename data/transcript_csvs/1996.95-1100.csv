1996.95-1100,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.061,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-1100, Board of the County Commissioners... the spectators are admonished, do not talk until you get out of the courtroom."
1996.95-1100,0,45131,wallace_b_jefferson,,39.499,42.421,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-1100,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,81.116,87.591,"Mr. Jefferson, would you just straighten me out on how much money is at stake?"
1996.95-1100,0,45131,wallace_b_jefferson,,109.324,110.546,"No, Your Honor, I think that's incorrect."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,1727.191,1738.408,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-1100,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1745.103,1745.624,But it could.
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,1749.786,1752.577,"--Absolutely not, because the instructions came right out of the Canton case."
1996.95-1100,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.8,1872.541,It doesn't say State action.
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,1876.805,1877.376,The--
1996.95-1100,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1877.376,1878.195,"--custom, or usage."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,1878.195,1885.932,"--Your Honor, the statutes of Oklahoma clearly provide that the sheriff is the final decisionmaker on matters of employing deputies."
1996.95-1100,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.824,1910.505,"That may be true, but was it under color of that statute?"
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,1916.69,1925.065,"--This Court has never interpreted section 1983, as Justice Souter indicated, to require that the action by the municipality be facially unconstitutional."
1996.95-1100,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1927.228,1933.89,But we also decided in Monell that a municipality could not be held liable unless there were a policy.
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,1933.89,1941.136,And this Court in Pembaur looked back on Monell and interpreted Monell as... Monell wanted to preclude respondeat superior.
1996.95-1100,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1975.587,1993.059,"Oh, yes, he personally would have been acting under color of a statute, or of a law, but when you try to place liability on the municipality for the municipality's failure to have higher standards for the recruitment of police officers, you have to refer to something else."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,1996.832,1999.324,That's not what this Court said in Pembaur.
1996.95-1100,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1999.324,2001.317,"Well, that's certainly what we said in Monell."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2004.797,2006.109,I am not questioning your decision in Monell.
1996.95-1100,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2006.75,2013.455,"Well, but then, you see, your argument so far, as I interpret it, is a strictly respondeat superior argument."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2021.859,2023.579,--Your Honor--
1996.95-1100,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2023.579,2030.375,"--than respondeat superior, and we're asking whether or not you... and you seem to disagree with that."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2030.375,2030.756,--No.
1996.95-1100,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2089.643,2095.027,"Mr. Serr, I assume that you would win this point if we analyzed the case in either of these two ways."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2134.522,2135.042,When there's--
1996.95-1100,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2135.042,2144.348,"--because the county can act in no other way, and we don't require multiple instances because there's no question of attributing this act to the ultimately... ultimate policymaker."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2152.423,2156.527,--It matters to me whether you come out in our favor.
1996.95-1100,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2156.527,2157.719,I realize that.
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2164.203,2165.083,What was road A again?
1996.95-1100,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2165.083,2174.61,"--Road A is that when the policymaker intentionally acts contrary to the stated policy, that action establishes a new policy."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2174.61,2174.94,Sure.
1996.95-1100,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2175.511,2176.69,So it still falls within--
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2176.69,2177.08,--We would agree with that.
1996.95-1100,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2177.08,2177.552,--All right.
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2180.322,2182.152,We win under either of those analyses.
1996.95-1100,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2182.152,2185.786,"No, but does it have any implications for your case other than winning or losing?"
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2189.358,2194.241,"Other... under either one of those roads, I think we win in this case."
1996.95-1100,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2201.537,2224.682,"The difficulty that I'm having with this, frankly, is if you take either of those lines, what... it would end up with the cities being held responsible for the actions of their higher level employees even when those higher level employees are really going against the preexisting policy or just making a mistake, or just being negligent or grossly negligent."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2250.819,2256.082,"Well, for one thing, liability can only be premised on deliberate indifference."
1996.95-1100,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2290.385,2307.566,"Mr. Serr, don't you recognize any difference between a prosecutor who says, go seize that evidence illegally, and a city that says we're going to put guns in the hands of police officers and not train them in its use--"
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2307.566,2308.217,--Sure.
1996.95-1100,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2308.217,2315.17,"--and this case, where the record shows assault, but it turns out to have been an incident on a college campus?"
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2315.17,2333.754,This Court in Canton looked at the language of section 1983 and decided that section 1983 admits of no distinctions between actions of the municipality that directly authorize or command constitutional violations or actions that just are deliberately indifferent and directly cause constitutional violations.
1996.95-1100,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2351.144,2357.378,"Well, I'm talking about that causation requirement, because it seems to me that it was a lot closer in Canton than it is here."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2357.378,2358.359,--You mean in Pembaur?
1996.95-1100,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2358.359,2360.581,"But... well, certainly in Pembaur."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2366.815,2367.045,Okay.
1996.95-1100,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2402.328,2423.652,"Well, that was the allegation here, the use of excessive force that turned on that, and yet the instruction given on deliberate indifference, as I understand it, required the jury to assess whether it was so obvious that Sheriff Moore's decision would lead to violations, plural, of constitutional rights, plural."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2450.36,2450.839,"Well, deliberate--"
1996.95-1100,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2450.839,2452.201,How is it focused here?
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2452.201,2458.175,"--Your Honor, the deliberate indifference instruction came right out of the language in the majority opinion in Canton that the--"
1996.95-1100,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2458.175,2458.515,Well--
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2485.433,2500.952,"--Well, that was precisely the problem faced by this Court in Canton with respect to failure-to-train cases, that it would be easy for a plaintiff to manufacture a situation of respondeat superior: if you had only trained the officers in Canton to recognize severe emotional disturbance, this wouldn't have happened."
1996.95-1100,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2515.342,2521.835,But these instructions nowhere focused on precisely what it was that was going to be the basis of the liability.
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2529.892,2549.884,"The instructions focused the jury on the training and the hiring of Stacy Burns, and the constitutional right that was at issue here, as the jury knew, well knew, was excessive force, violations of Fourth Amendment rights, and the deliberate indifference must, that's true, directly cause the deprivation."
1996.95-1100,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2556.789,2556.878,Well--
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2556.878,2558.24,--and the deprivation that occurred.
1996.95-1100,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2558.24,2567.385,"--perhaps you could have offered instructions that would have clarified it, but under the instructions that were given, I don't see why it wasn't open to the jury to base it on--"
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2567.385,2575.111,"Your Honor, I suppose it's always possible for the judge to give more specific instructions, to spell it all out."
1996.95-1100,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2577.033,2577.551,"--Well, you're the plaintiff."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2583.485,2585.359,--We think these instructions do the trick under Canton.
1996.95-1100,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2589.629,2605.521,"--Well, do you think Canton supports the proposition that deliberate indifference is the standard with respect... across the board, or just with omissions by... it seemed to me that Canton was more talking about omissions to do something on the part of the supervisor."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2605.521,2630.546,"Well, we would certainly assert that it can't be more difficult to prove municipal liability for omissions than for affirmative exercises of municipal power, that if deliberate indifference supports municipal liability for omissions, for failures to act when the notice is there, when the notice is apparent, that certainly that deliberate indifference model supports municipal liability for affirmative exercises of official municipal power so long as--"
1996.95-1100,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2630.546,2634.329,What there existed in Canton was a training program.
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2660.356,2664.079,"--Your Honor, there is no requirement of a program."
1996.95-1100,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2704.415,2711.329,"But why insist on... if what you say is true, why insist on going up to the level of the policymaker anyway, then?"
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2715.272,2726.95,"--Because in order to avoid respondeat superior, liability must flow from the acts or omissions of the municipality itself and not merely from the deprivations committed by the low-level employee."
1996.95-1100,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2735.666,2737.777,Unless it's committed by somebody high enough up in the municipal hiring--
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2737.777,2738.017,No.
1996.95-1100,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2758.92,2760.38,--Can I ask about that?
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2782.737,2783.188,Recently.
1996.95-1100,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2783.188,2783.768,All right.
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2783.768,2784.446,Recent bad things.
1996.95-1100,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2784.446,2795.933,"Right, but then... so I thought what would be relevant, I'd like to look at the piece of paper that the sheriff had in his hand so that I could make a judgment, perhaps, at a great distance, about what he should have done, or what the jury thought he should have done."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2798.156,2799.617,It is in the record.
1996.95-1100,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2799.617,2802.779,"All right, well, your associate--"
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2802.779,2805.15,"Actually, it's not in those volumes."
1996.95-1100,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2805.15,2808.121,"--Well, can you supply it to the clerk afterwards?"
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2808.121,2808.562,Yes.
1996.95-1100,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2814.076,2820.381,"I just wanted to look at the piece of paper that the sheriff looked at when he supposedly, in your view, made a mistake of not going further."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2820.381,2831.366,"Mm-hmm, and we would submit that that's also a jury question, that the length of that, how red the red flag was... was it just pink, or was it real red?"
1996.95-1100,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2871.724,2885.613,"Why, in the face of a custom or usage in the past of checking on records, why should this single deviation violate that statute?"
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2885.613,2893.728,"Because the deviation was a conscious, deliberate decision made by the ultimate vessel of county authority on a matter within his sphere of policymaking--"
1996.95-1100,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2893.728,2897.241,"Why does that make it a policy, a single departure for a relative?"
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2901.604,2907.088,"--Well, again, that goes back to Monell and what Monell meant by the use of the word policy."
1996.95-1100,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2942.151,2958.87,"Well, what if the supervisors in this case, so there'd be no question of a single... what if the supervisors had said, we always check out the records of people we're going to hire, but in this case it's the chairman's nephew, so we're going to depart in this case."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2961.662,2976.573,"--Mr. Chief Justice, if you take that line of thinking far enough, every political subdivision in the country... counties, cities, school districts... they all get to deliberately, knowingly hire one bad apple."
1996.95-1100,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2976.573,2980.205,"Well, if you take your thinking far enough you're right back to respondeat superior."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2980.205,2981.086,No.
1996.95-1100,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2987.451,2992.794,"Well, you know, if you're talking about what you find in the statute, where do you find criminal recklessness in the statute?"
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,2992.794,3024.356,"Well, in the Canton case, and I guess this traces back to Justice O'Connor's opinion in Kibbe, there was a concern by this Court about what to do with those policies that are not facially unconstitutional, or those policies, actions of a municipality that do not directly authorize constitutional deprivation, the failure to train cases, the bad hiring cases, and Justice O'Connor articulated in her opinion in Kibbe that the reason we need a deliberate indifference requirement is to satisfy that causation requirement in the statute."
1996.95-1100,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3025.175,3031.9,"In answer to the Chief Justice's question in the hypothetical that he put you where they hire the nephew, was that a policy?"
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,3031.9,3033.42,--Absolutely.
1996.95-1100,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3038.285,3049.09,"And then if they... suppose they said, we're too busy today and we're just not going to check the references, would that be a policy?"
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,3049.09,3053.054,"That would be negligence, perhaps grossly negligent."
1996.95-1100,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3074.777,3078.881,I don't see how the state of mind of the actor can make something a policy.
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,3094.661,3107.209,"The majority in Pembaur actually reported several dictionary definitions of policy in a footnote, and those dictionary definitions of policy even refer to a single decision."
1996.95-1100,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3122.499,3130.953,"But let's go back to Justice Souter's question, because here there is a policy over a 6, 7 year period of being careful about who is hired to be a police officer."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,3135.027,3135.347,In--
1996.95-1100,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3135.347,3137.448,--from the policy become in itself a policy?
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,3137.448,3157.321,"--The Court spoke directly to that in Canton, that when you have genuinely adequate municipal decisionmaking, the fact that one person negligently slips through the cracks or accidently slips through the cracks, no problem, but if that one person deliberately, indifferently, criminally, recklessly slips through the cracks, then you've got a problem under Canton."
1996.95-1100,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3182.368,3182.758,It's a lawsuit.
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,3182.758,3183.459,--Pardon?
1996.95-1100,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3183.459,3184.088,But it's a lawsuit.
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,3184.088,3185.551,It's a lawsuit.
1996.95-1100,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3186.85,3189.812,"It may be cheaper to... you know, to settle than to litigate."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,3189.812,3200.11,"--Sometimes, Your Honor, the job description and the applicant behavior, the preemployment applicant behavior known to the county decisionmakers just doesn't match the job description."
1996.95-1100,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3419.222,3419.953,"Thank you, Mr. Serr."
1996.95-1100,1,18014,brian_serr,,3419.953,3420.875,--Thank you.
1996.95-1100,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3420.875,3422.225,The case is submitted.
