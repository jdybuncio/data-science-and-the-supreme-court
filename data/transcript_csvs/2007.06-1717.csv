2007.06-1717,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.189,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-1717, Richlin Security Service versus Chertoff."
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,11.039,33.804,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Circuit affirmed an award of attorney fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, or EAJA, to Petitioner Richlin Security Services Company, but it denied Richlin an award for paralegal services at market rates on the ground that statutory attorney fees do not include work done by paralegals."
2007.06-1717,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,91.491,98.295,"Mr. Wolfman, what about the cap that's not present in 1988 and is present in EAJA?"
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,98.295,105.583,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, that really is, when we get down to it, what the government's argument boils down to."
2007.06-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,144.108,144.941,Excuse me.
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,151.695,152.297,Absolutely.
2007.06-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,152.297,153.181,They couldn't go above the cap.
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,153.181,157.499,"There is no question about that because... because, Your Honor, they are attorney's fees."
2007.06-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,157.499,158.035,Okay.
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,158.035,158.585,That's our submission.
2007.06-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,167.574,172.961,"May I just ask on that last point, does the government agree that the paralegals' fees are subject to a cap?"
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,172.961,179.465,"--Well, the government would certainly agree that if there are attorney's fees, they are subject to the cap."
2007.06-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,181.734,182.601,"Indeed, would insist."
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,182.601,183.934,"Yes, indeed, Your Honor."
2007.06-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,184.852,188.97,But they do not agree with the bottom line that they are subject to cap?
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,188.97,191.672,"--Well, what they believe... the government--"
2007.06-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,191.672,192.456,--attorney's fees.
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,192.456,193.808,--And I'm sure they can explain this better than I can.
2007.06-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,197.76,198.16,Right.
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,198.16,200.545,--reimbursable only at the cost to the lawyer.
2007.06-1717,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,222.909,225.894,But you... isn't that one of the problems with your argument?
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,238.885,245.522,"--Well, again, that's... that's... I took to be Justice Ginsburg's question and let me try to answer it."
2007.06-1717,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,258.781,265.535,"No, I'm looking at it from the perspective of the original enactment on your theory at that moment."
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,275.358,276.993,"--Well, I don't believe it's odd."
2007.06-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,298.072,298.738,"Well, agent fees--"
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,298.738,299.122,By and large--
2007.06-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.122,308.844,"--I mean, the problem exists whether or not you make paralegal fees attorney's fees, because agent fees are also subject to the same cap."
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,308.844,309.394,--That is true.
2007.06-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,309.394,312.596,And agents were paid a good deal less than that.
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,312.596,313.279,That is true.
2007.06-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,331.723,338.46,You began... and it's not just because of my notepad but because I'm interested... you told Justice Ginsburg there are two reasons--
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,338.46,338.877,Yes.
2007.06-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,338.877,340.193,--why the government's cap is wrong.
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,344.581,346.483,"I would love that opportunity, Your Honor."
2007.06-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,369.08,369.696,But may I ask you this?
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,369.696,370.263,--Yes.
2007.06-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,370.263,381.054,"Supposing at the time the statute was enacted, paralegals' fees were not generally treated as lawyers' fees, but rather were disbursements, does that make a difference?"
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,381.054,383.923,"That might have made a difference, but that was not the case, Your Honor."
2007.06-1717,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,471.028,471.745,I'm sorry.
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,476.949,477.465,No.
2007.06-1717,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,498.113,500.215,Too much money proportionally.
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,500.215,500.715,--Proportionally.
2007.06-1717,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,500.715,501.148,Okay.
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,501.148,501.665,Exactly.
2007.06-1717,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,565.658,575.096,"If... if paralegal charges are not fees but are other expenses, what would be the standard for determining the rate at which they would be compensable?"
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,580.5,584.035,"Well, that's... that's an excellent question."
2007.06-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,646.007,647.943,"This problem is going to exist anyway, isn't it?"
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,656.549,656.882,--But--
2007.06-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,656.882,660.667,You're going to have to have this same problem... and what about the overhead and so forth?
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,660.667,678.378,"--No, that is... with respect, Justice Scalia, that is not correct because the problem here is... and I'm using your words... is that the government is cramming a in-house professional services... service into a place where no court virtually in the history of American jurisprudence has ever put it."
2007.06-1717,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,679.761,710.314,"Well, if... if it's simply reasonableness... because I don't see anything in the statute that says that all non-fee expenses are compensable at cost... if it's simply reasonableness, would it be possible to say that what would be reasonable would be a rate that preserves the ratio between attorneys' fees and paralegal fees that existed at the time when the statute was enacted so that you wouldn't have the problem of attorneys being compensated at the same rate as paralegals?"
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,710.314,732.813,"--Let me... let me answer that in two ways: If you were to preserve the ratio, then it seems to me that the... in many markets, the paralegals are going to get right near the cap anyway or, you know, between $75 and $100, because we know that many lawyers' rates are well above the cap... if you preserve that ratio--"
2007.06-1717,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,732.813,733.229,No.
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,746.523,747.773,--Yes.
2007.06-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,757.51,767.234,"Am I to understand, you claim that even if they are expenses, they should... they should be paid for at market rate, don't you?"
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,767.234,772.935,"--Well, not quite market rate, but this goes to... I said I had two responses to Justice Alito's question."
2007.06-1717,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,844.798,866.627,"Mr. Wolfman, if there's any discretion in the district judge in setting the amount of the fee, then why wouldn't it be appropriate to say, now there's a cap for the lawyer is $125 an hour, but we know the true market rate for that lawyer is $200?"
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,879.369,890.641,"Well, the reason for that is... is that there... there is no suggestion at all that that's what was being contemplated in this statute."
2007.06-1717,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,915.542,918.744,"But isn't it likely that when Congress said that, it was not thinking of paralegals."
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,918.744,919.46,No.
2007.06-1717,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,968.427,968.943,I'm sorry.
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,975.762,976.212,--No.
2007.06-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.127,1033.717,"Of course, that's no loss to the government because when you put it into the lawyer's rate, you hit the ceiling for the lawyer's rate that much sooner."
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1033.717,1035.032,That is true--
2007.06-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1035.032,1036.669,It seems like that would be--
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1036.669,1037.419,--but that was not true in 1980.
2007.06-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1037.419,1038.234,--Right.
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1038.234,1039.152,And that's the point we are making here.
2007.06-1717,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1043.071,1043.405,I'm sorry.
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1050.326,1050.792,--Absolutely.
2007.06-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1092.236,1101.527,"Assume that our decision will in part drive the market either way, what we do will effect the way paralegals are used, the way billing is done."
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1114.669,1115.802,I'm not sure I understand the question.
2007.06-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1115.802,1119.337,"--Rather than follow EAJA, I mean follow 1988, follow Jenkins."
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1119.754,1125.24,"Well, I certainly think there's utility in doing that, and Congress can revisit this."
2007.06-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1141.833,1150.706,"Are there some disutilities from an economic standpoint in having two structures: Jenkins for one kind of cases, EAJA in the other cases as the government wants?"
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1150.706,1151.475,Is there some--
2007.06-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1151.475,1155.927,Are there some disadvantages to the system?
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1155.927,1166.984,"--I... of course, we don't think there are, but the... to be candid, the... the Federal Circuit pointed to one purported disadvantage."
2007.06-1717,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1181.208,1183.66,But that's... I saw that analysis.
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1194.818,1197.837,"--I certainly agree that it is unlikely, but as we point... very unlikely."
2007.06-1717,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1246.218,1253.756,"That point makes some assumptions about the relative abilities, say, of junior associates and senior paralegals, and I'm not sure are well founded."
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1254.506,1260.41,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I will... I believe that you have greater experience on that than I do."
2007.06-1717,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1383.289,1386.76,Is that pertinent... is that pertinent on the cap questions we've been discussing too?
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1392.997,1393.43,No.
2007.06-1717,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1460.622,1469.562,"I would not say no one else, but not everyone else places the importance on legislative history that I do, but I do."
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1479.251,1480.068,Well--
2007.06-1717,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1480.068,1489.29,"And I know it was there, but it doesn't matter to me it was on a bill that was later not passed, and then unless there is something different--"
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1489.29,1489.809,--Well--
2007.06-1717,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1489.809,1506.585,"--for that reason, because in my own mind I'm thinking there were a group of people on the committee, they went through the issue, they reflected views of their principles, they work it out, and unless something changed that makes me think that isn't the working out of it, I would put a lot of weight on it."
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1506.585,1507.118,--Well--
2007.06-1717,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1507.118,1508.703,"And now you're going to tell me what there is, I hope."
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1508.703,1511.055,"--I'm certainly going to do that, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-1717,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1557.37,1560.738,And of course they may mean... may have meant costs to the client.
2007.06-1717,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1560.738,1568.909,"And that is... and that is my next point, Mr. Chief Justice, which is that it said ""at cost"", but at whose cost?"
2007.06-1717,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1593.643,1594.493,"Thank you, Counsel."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1600.28,1612.505,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: EAJA authorizes Federal agencies to award two distinct categories of litigation expenses against the United States: fees and other expenses."
2007.06-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1646.892,1650.963,"You say the relevant one was of course on a legislation that wasn't passed, right?"
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1650.963,1664.603,"--Actually this is even before EAJA lacks the first time, this is upon EAJA's initial enactment in 1980, there was a Senate report and a House report and both have functionally identical language."
2007.06-1717,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1704.764,1706.414,What is cost?
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1743.055,1750.726,"Justice Ginsburg, the government agrees that more than simply salary would be reimbursable at cost."
2007.06-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1773.125,1775.444,Well and it might be quite different for private practitioner.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1809.582,1813.902,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not sure that I agree with some of the premises that you had."
2007.06-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1835.065,1838.85,"Well, in most firms an engineering report would be outside the--"
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1838.85,1843.754,"--Well, that's an engineering report, except for maybe, some intellectual property firms but--"
2007.06-1717,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1843.754,1847.639,"It seems to me the question is a valid one, that you're running away from the question."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1847.639,1848.173,--Well--
2007.06-1717,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1848.173,1849.991,And I'll let you answer.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1868.952,1871.988,"--Well, there is now two questions in the air."
2007.06-1717,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1871.988,1876.475,"They both... they both apply, they both apply to outside experts."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1876.475,1884.462,"Well, when a paralegal is outsourced, which is your question, there is two potential situations."
2007.06-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1895.454,1897.306,"--Well, but that wasn't Justice Kennedy's question."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1901.424,1910.613,"The outsourced paralegal is better, it may be that the actual cost to the firm is the cost that the firm pays for that paralegal to the third party."
2007.06-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1910.613,1921.754,"Well in that case it would bill the paralegal in the same way it would bill, I take it, the expense of, let's say, having water tested in a pollution case."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1927.158,1928.058,In fact that's right--
2007.06-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1928.058,1928.641,And add--
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1928.641,1930.943,--And not add profit on to that... that paralegal as well.
2007.06-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1930.943,1937.764,--They don't add a profit and they don't add a profit on to... to travel expenses and things like that.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1937.764,1938.383,Right.
2007.06-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1938.383,1967.7,"And... so if that is so, in each case cost means cost to the client, and you're coming up with a new category of expense, which is cost to someone else, and why should there be a subcategory of expense, in which cost does not mean cost to the client when every other category of expense does mean cost to the client?"
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1967.7,1972.902,"Justice Souter, every other category does not mean cost to the client."
2007.06-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1982.71,1985.226,Because there is a separate provision for fees.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1985.226,1987.476,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1987.476,1987.876,Yes.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1987.876,2016.578,"But in that context a client does not incur any legal fees, have any obligation to pay any fees, and courts routinely award EAJA fees when there has been no cost to the client in fees, and similarly, even if the client has an obligation to pay the cost in those circumstances... where for instance a firm is providing pro bono services or a legal services organization is providing pro bono services to a client, the client does not have to incur or pay the costs."
2007.06-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2023.684,2024.934,"At this discretion, let me ask this question."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2050.132,2053.619,It would be the rate that is ultimately paid.
2007.06-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2058.871,2068.045,Do I understand the government's position that the... the result would different if a firm uses its own paralegals as opposed to outsourcing?
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2068.045,2070.663,"--The result is not different, Your Honor."
2007.06-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2073.764,2074.467,No.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2081.204,2083.322,--It wouldn't necessarily be the market rate.
2007.06-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2086.175,2088.491,"Well, they are not market to make business."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2092.428,2093.36,If they did.
2007.06-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2093.36,2095.28,I assume that they also charged the market rate.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2095.28,2096.03,It may be.
2007.06-1717,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2100.648,2104.136,"But again, you're not answering the hypothetical."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2127.349,2143.459,"--There should be a difference, Your Honor, because with respect to outsourced firms, there is no concern that a firm is going to add, well... if the firm is only going to bill at its cost, the firm is not going to add additional profit to the outsourced paralegal."
2007.06-1717,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2153.297,2156.099,But under your... they can't even charge $85 an hour.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2156.099,2160.217,"--Well, that's correct if their cost, actual cost would be less in house."
2007.06-1717,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2211.833,2239.083,"I know you said that a few times and you have authority for it, but it seems to me odd if you look at 1988 and if the attorney's fees and costs... and costs is very limited in the statute in 1920... and if you have attorney's fees and other expenses, other expenses is a much larger category than costs within 1988."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2246.154,2271.204,"--Justice Ginsburg, under Jenkins' rationale, Jenkins recognized that when there is not another... another box of other expenses, where in a statute which was intended to be fully compensatory, that attorney's fees necessarily must include compensation for all types of costs that a lawyer might incur in the presentation/representation of a client."
2007.06-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2292.035,2299.372,"Counsel, your... this question only arises when the position of your client was not substantially justified."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2321.602,2334.528,"--Mr. Chief Justice, the reason that you would adopt our construction is because Congress is balancing more than the intent to provide compensation for prevailing parties in EAJA."
2007.06-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2343.099,2359.16,"It's kind of a stretch to suggest in a situation where they pass a law that only applies to individuals or small businesses where they put a cap in and so on, that another way that we are going to prevent damage to the fisc was to treat paralegal expenses as costs rather than at market rate."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2361.945,2367.833,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think the legislative history illustrates that, in fact, paralegals and other costs--"
2007.06-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2367.833,2373.653,"Well, it assumes that when they said ""costs"", that they meant costs to the firm as opposed to costs to the client."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2376.439,2388.912,"--Well, the relevant page of the legislative history in 1984 that you're talking about explains that Congress wanted to adopt the views of the Administrative Conference in its model rules, and goes on to quote the Administrative Conference--"
2007.06-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2388.912,2393.483,Not to belabor the point it meant that the people who drafted the Senate report may have meant that.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2393.483,2397.102,"--Well, that's a problem with all legislative history."
2007.06-1717,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2397.102,2398.685,I don't think it is a problem with legislative history.
2007.06-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2410.176,2419.532,"Do we know what the President's view was on that question when he signed the legislation into law, which is what he was required to do before it became law and which he did not do under the prior bill?"
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2419.532,2432.005,"The President did not express a view, but what we do know is that the legislative history in 1984 dealt with language that was identical to that ultimately passed by the Senate... by Congress and signed by the President."

2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2455.871,2457.821,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2457.821,2458.337,Good.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2458.823,2465.06,"This Court has twice cited unanimous opinions, the same report that we cite here, one of which was in the Jean opinion."
2007.06-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2471.547,2472.281,When was that?
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2472.281,2472.997,Jean?
2007.06-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2472.997,2473.932,Yes.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2473.932,2485.021,Pardon my--
2007.06-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2485.021,2485.54,Never mind.
2007.06-1717,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2487.673,2509.253,"--I mean that wouldn't be surprising would it, that wouldn't be surprising because you have, in fact, very complex bills that have 14 sections and section of the B bill could have been vetoed... been vetoed because of problem with Section 14 and repassed without Section 14, in which case the legislative history for the other 13 sections would be highly illuminating as to what they mean."

2007.06-1717,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2519.608,2527.714,The question that I had in respect to this statute is... is that my impression and here... I'd like to know how they bill secretary's times.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2590.971,2601.263,"--Well, the theory of the bill was that attorney's fees would be based at prevailing market rates, and that prevailing market rates would embody a certain set of costs that might be reimbursed."
2007.06-1717,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2626.044,2635.067,Am I right that when this language first came in... this is in relation to Justice Breyer's question... there was no cap?
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2638.936,2644.423,The cap in EAJA was imposed from the very beginning.
2007.06-1717,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2644.423,2644.673,It was.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2644.673,2645.306,Yes.
2007.06-1717,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2657.581,2662.968,"It would be a lot of weight to be put on three little words: ""Billed at cost""."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2683.131,2703.962,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, we are relying not only on the 1984 but also on the 1980 legislative history, which although it does not specifically refer to paralegals, explains that in connection with the term ""attorney's fees"" and the ceiling on attorney's fees... and I'll quote again from the Senate report, which was the first: Ceiling on attorney's fees relates only to the compensation of lawyers themselves."
2007.06-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2791.347,2791.93,May I go back--
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2791.93,2792.58,--that Congress intended--
2007.06-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2792.58,2797.965,"--May I go back to the point, because I think you were cut off before you went into the full legislative history."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2811.624,2820.313,"--Well, the legislative history when you... again, if you look to what Congress was talking about, both the Administrative Conference rules and the quotation of the Administrative Conference rules--"
2007.06-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2820.313,2820.947,Which took place when?
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2820.947,2822.515,--This was in 1984.
2007.06-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2822.515,2829.253,At that time were they billing paralegal's fees at cost to the client?
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2829.836,2844.763,"In fact, Your Honor, there was a dispute that the legislative history speaks to the controversy that evolved regarding the... whether other expenses of the term would include more than what was specifically enumerated in the statute."
2007.06-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2922.965,2929.119,--Every expense that's reimbursed at cost has a profit element in it for whoever performed the service.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2929.119,2932.821,--But when it's within the control of the firm--
2007.06-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2932.821,2933.504,Business or otherwise.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2933.504,2938.807,"--within the control of the firm, there is a particular danger that the firm can inflate its own costs."
2007.06-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2942.776,2948.413,"Well, maybe this is the same question Justice Breyer asked, but I haven't... I didn't grasp the answer."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2971.879,2976.164,You're asking about the incentives that firms might have.
2007.06-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2976.164,2991.257,"Well, I'm just saying if we adopt your position, isn't it going to be, I guess, worse for your client because firms will, as I've been told firms sometimes do, charge separately for things at a higher rate than their cost?"
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2997.827,2998.393,Overhead profit.
2007.06-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3017.491,3023.978,"Well, I would say... I would say that it's now traditional for firms to charge, say, more for their photocopy services than it cost them."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3023.978,3041.32,"Well, if that's the case under our reading, of course, we would... we would say that that is... that is not a type of expense that was contemplated by EAJA, because Congress already provided for profits that attorneys get from representing a party within the attorney fee and cap that."
2007.06-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3063.25,3065.352,"But the cap doesn't apply to expenses, does it?"
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3065.352,3066.721,--I didn't catch you.
2007.06-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3066.721,3070.756,The cap does not apply to reimbursement expenses at cost?
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3070.756,3079.777,"Precisely, because in our view expenses are at cost and it is not... you don't have the same danger of having firms imbedding profit within their own rate."
2007.06-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3079.777,3082.913,It seems to me just the opposite just as the Chief Justice suggests.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3094.787,3107.345,"But again, and under our view if they were to... if a firm were to charge, say, 50 cents for a photocopy and it only cost 10 or 15 cents for that photocopy, under our view the firm would only be reimbursed for our for the 15 cents."
2007.06-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3110.214,3113.666,"No, because other costs reasonably interpret to include overhead."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3118.069,3122.771,"--Overhead, we don't believe, is fairly attributable to a particular case."
2007.06-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3127.592,3128.992,"Well, I think you missed my point."
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3143.185,3151.458,I guess you're right to some extent there would be incentive to shift out costs even though there would be less of an incentive than shifting out costs plus profit.
2007.06-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3195.133,3200.085,When you have a... you can submit it a letter.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3210.809,3213.344,It's at 496 U.S. 154.
2007.06-1717,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3229.838,3240.412,I'd like to go back to a question that Justice Kennedy asked of Mr. Wolfman.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3276.049,3282.739,"As a general rule, in fee-shifting statutes that are like Section 1988, that is in fact the rule."
2007.06-1717,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3324.296,3329.915,"Well on that point, does the statute say that all non fee expenses are compensable at cost?"
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3336.188,3345.626,"--It's either a, it can be a study or analysis or at least analogous to that type of a... a--"
2007.06-1717,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3345.626,3349.261,"Which is it, is it a study analysis or project?"
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3351.197,3366.707,"--It can be... it can be a project, for instance in this case, the paralegal compiled the relevant information regarding how much wages needed to be developed, repaid on the merits of the case, how much taxes needed to be reimbursed."
2007.06-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3373.777,3379.145,"Counsel, there are occasions, aren't there, when the government is entitled to attorney's fees?"
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3379.145,3381.097,There are occasions.
2007.06-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3381.097,3385.133,Do you know how you bill paralegal times... time in those situations?
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3385.133,3387.101,We often don't bill them separately.
2007.06-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3387.101,3391.387,You often don't bill them separately.
2007.06-1717,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3391.387,3393.239,I... I asked this question.
2007.06-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3417.787,3419.037,"Thank you, Mr. Yang."
2007.06-1717,2,18166,brian_wolfman,,3421.62,3425.774,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-1717,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3607.699,3617.657,"Well, but I think Justice Breyer is correct, isn't he, that there was no reason for the Senate to sort of redo a report that they had already done on a bill that was substantially identical?"
2007.06-1717,2,18166,brian_wolfman,,3617.657,3622.442,"That might be true in some circumstances, but that's not what happened in 1985."
2007.06-1717,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3628.798,3631.482,There was no Senate report because they had done it just the previous year.
2007.06-1717,2,18166,brian_wolfman,,3631.482,3632.417,"--I think not, Your Honor."
2007.06-1717,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3655.163,3657.115,"Thank you, Counsel, the case is submitted."
