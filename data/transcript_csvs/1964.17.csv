1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,19.849,23.009,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court."
1964.17,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,298.563,299.648,What is a Patrolman (Inaudible) --
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,299.648,303.889,A patrolman is like a representative of the union at the ports.
1964.17,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,343.452,346.141,Is it just one patrolman in each port or are there several?
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,346.141,357.629,"Well, there are different divisions there.A patrolman who is known as a patrolman is also a business agent for the particular port to -- who has a different status, but more or less serves in the same capacity."
1964.17,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,357.629,371.467,"Mr. Scribner, as to the (Inaudible)?"
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,371.467,373.688,He can nominate himself.
1964.17,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,519.876,535.758,Suppose your pear is the right to run for President of the organization and -- is this under your theory of the case is there inequality here?
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,542.274,555.433,"Well first on the fact sir and at the -- record would show that any person who had previously held any office whatsoever or any time paid -- elected or paid, would be eligible for that."
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,749.221,757.078,"Well, Mr. Scribner, what the -- what is the -- is there a -- is the right to nominate guaranteed somewhere in the law?"
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,757.078,758.103,An equal right to nom --
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,758.103,760.403,"I didn't answer that, the right to nominate?"
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,760.403,767.737,"Well, the -- in Section 401 (e) the same Section that has the qualifications, they talked about a reasonable opportunity."
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,773.855,780.368,So would you confine Title I or Section 101 to -- just the equality face or is it --
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,780.368,781.504,That's exactly right.
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,781.504,781.526,And the --
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,781.526,783.152,"And as a matter of fact, the congressional history supports that."
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,783.152,787.776,"And the scope of the right itself, under Title IV, is that it?"
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,787.776,791.862,The scope of the right itself as it involves all the aspects of the election procedure --
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,791.862,792.534,"No, first of all, what (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,792.534,793.138,-- would be entitled.
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,793.138,800.434,-- what is involved in the right to nominate for example to the -- is it reasonable to say that you can nominate only yourself?
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,800.434,802.023,"Well, it so happens that the Secretary --"
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,802.023,806.761,"Now, what -- yes, but what if that question is told to -- who solves that?"
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,806.761,808.4,The Secretary of Labor would solve that.
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,811.486,812.002,Section 101 --
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,812.002,812.717,-- question.
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,812.717,816.65,Section 101 says that people still have the equal right to nominate.
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,819.406,826.331,"I would say that under those circumstances, you might have a sort of interplay between the two Sections."
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,864.114,881.17,And he says that -- he says the Section not only guarantees equalities but it guarantees a right to nominate and the right to nominate is more -- it certainly includes more than the right to nominate yourself --
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,881.17,888.925,"Well, I'll be frank to say Mr. Justice White that on that particular subject, there maybe a question."
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,890.314,890.773,Isn't that --
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,890.773,891.408,-- why I say that.
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,891.408,893.004,Isn't that question right here?
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,893.004,893.315,No.
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,894.913,895.247,"Well, not --"
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,895.247,895.357,As I --
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,895.357,896.931,-- necessarily but isn't it?
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,896.931,900.143,"Its here only in respect, if its here at all."
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,941.449,941.573,Yes.
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,954.235,958.632,"Well, not only don't I think so but I don't think the Second Circuit thought so."
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,965.936,967.739,"Well, they just didn't get to that part?"
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,967.739,983.182,What they decided was that a combination of the qualification procedure as well as the self-nomination procedure in itself caused what it considered to be a denial of the equal rights to nominate.
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,983.301,987.633,But what if there was no right to nominate in any one?
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,993.493,993.548,Well --
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.548,996.964,"-- and then, they just didn't have a right to nominate anybody?"
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,996.964,999.06,"Oh, I don't -- I would have no problem at all if (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,999.06,1006.817,"Well, then -- yes, but what's the source of the right in somebody to nominate, is it 101?"
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,1006.817,1016.066,"Well, the basic source of the right, I would say isn't 401 (e) because that relates as I said to the entire election process and I think that is the intent of Congress."
1964.17,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1091.391,1103.084,(Inaudible)
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,1103.084,1109.318,"This case was initiated in 1963 and it was not there, sir."
1964.17,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1109.318,1119.386,"Now, with the (Inaudible)--"
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,1119.386,1119.555,"Yes, indeed"
1964.17,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1119.555,1120.311,(Inaudible)
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,1120.311,1121.222,"Yes, indeed."

1964.17,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1125.117,1126.201,(Inaudible)
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,1126.201,1127.147,Exactly.
1964.17,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1268.136,1270.177,(Inaudible)
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,1270.177,1270.985,Exactly sir.
1964.17,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1589.115,1590.912,Did you say it was the matter (Inaudible)?
1964.17,0,21524,david_scribner,,1590.912,1592.345,I understand so.
1964.17,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,2162.544,2165.157,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.17,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2181.009,2181.154,You may --
1964.17,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,2181.154,2189.901,"I obtained it Friday and I sir, gave a copy of it to my friend as quickly as I could which is yesterday morning at 11 o'clock."
1964.17,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2497.908,2498.621,"Mr. Hall, before you continue --"
1964.17,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,2498.621,2500.374,Yes.
1964.17,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2500.374,2507.192,-- tell us what the Act (Inaudible)?
1964.17,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,2507.192,2512.726,"The -- by the time the Court of Appeals acted, an election had begun."
1964.17,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2565.694,2576.65,(Inaudible) revised constitution?
1964.17,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,2576.65,2594.177,"I don't know that any future election will be held under the revised constitution but at a convention held this year, there are annual conventions, the constitution was revised and certainly certain changes were made which do changed the nomination's requirement, make them more liberal."
1964.17,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2756.285,2763.853,(Inaudible)
1964.17,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,2763.853,2764.341,"Oh, no."
1964.17,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2780.061,2784.02,"What is the term, the maximum term (Inaudible)?"
1964.17,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,2784.02,2784.868,Three years.

1964.17,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2834.163,2839.864,(Inaudible)
1964.17,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,2839.864,2843.743,To some degree but it doesn't infringe the Section 101 (a) (1) right.
1964.17,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2883.169,2889.302,(Inaudible)
1964.17,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,2889.302,2897.73,There's no need for evidence because what the complaint alleges are simply the existence of these two -- these various provisions in the constitution and bylaws.

1964.17,2,21524,david_scribner,,3755.348,3767.929,"First, I'd like to clarify the situation as it affects the question by Mr. Justice Goldberg on the status of the election itself."
