1995.94-9088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.148,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-9088, Meirl Gilbert Neal v. The United States."
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,22.235,23.447,Thank you.
1995.94-9088,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.425,131.587,Mr. Bergerson--
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,131.587,132.088,Yes.
1995.94-9088,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,132.088,146.016,"--if all we had before us were the facts in this case and this Court's Chapman interpretation of the statute, would we consider the weight of the blotter paper?"
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,146.016,156.512,"If all... Justice O'Connor, if all the Court had before it were simply Mr. Neal coming up and asking the Court simply to reconsider Chapman in the absence of commission action--"
1995.94-9088,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,156.512,157.424,Right.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,157.424,158.715,--Would you reconsider?
1995.94-9088,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,159.196,176.527,"Well, you didn't... are you asking that we now overturn Chapman to reach the result, or are you arguing that you can leave Chapman where it is but the sentencing guidelines changes means the statute should be interpreted differently?"
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,176.527,177.707,"First of all, I am--"
1995.94-9088,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.707,178.688,It's not clear to me.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,178.688,179.109,--Okay.
1995.94-9088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,185.413,185.823,Well--
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,189.834,192.276,"Of the former proposition, which is revisiting Chapman."
1995.94-9088,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.939,203.833,--But do you think that the commission has power to redefine statutory terms that this Court has already defined?
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,203.833,205.426,--I think that the commission has--
1995.94-9088,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,205.426,207.176,And that we should defer to that?
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,207.176,211.259,--I believe that this Court should defer to the--
1995.94-9088,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.259,212.341,Is the answer yes?
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,212.341,215.992,"--The answer is yes, Justice O'Connor."
1995.94-9088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,226.709,236.264,And you think that vested the Sentencing Commission with the authority to define a term of the... a statutory term differently than this Court defined it?
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,236.264,238.277,--I don't believe that the Sentencing--
1995.94-9088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,238.277,240.117,Can't you answer the question yes or no?
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,240.117,246.221,"--No, I do not believe that the Sentencing Commission has the power to define a statute in a way different from the way this Court--"
1995.94-9088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,246.221,249.664,When we have already defined the meaning of a statutory term in Chapman.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,249.664,270.068,"--This Court in Chapman held that in answer to the question of whether to include blotter paper in the weighing of LSD, in answer to the specific question, does mixture or substance refer to pure LSD, this Court held that one must include the blotter paper because Congress adopted a market-oriented approach for purposes of sentencing under 841."
1995.94-9088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,280.594,284.596,Contrary to what this Court interpreted it as in Chapman?
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,284.596,287.118,"Your Honor, words like--"
1995.94-9088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,287.118,290.01,"Well, but can you answer yes or no?"
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,301.948,303.3,--No.
1995.94-9088,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,318.31,323.302,What was the judgment that the Court... was it a judgment that the Court affirmed?
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,325.724,327.885,In both cases the Court affirmed the Seventh Circuit.
1995.94-9088,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,327.885,329.607,"Yes, and what was the judgment?"
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,334.249,342.964,There was language in Chapman which was not necessary to the resolution or solution of the case which said that all the blotter paper should be weighed.
1995.94-9088,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,342.964,347.859,Wasn't this a question of a conviction and a sentence that had been entered in Chapman?
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,347.859,348.327,Yes.
1995.94-9088,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,348.327,365.801,"And if the position that you are now taking, that all the Court said was that you give some weight, not necessarily full weight, to the blotter paper, then wouldn't the judgment have to have been vacated so that it could be modified to reflect something less than full weight?"
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,365.801,366.94,No.
1995.94-9088,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,393.397,394.799,And the meaning couldn't be plain.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,397.21,404.534,"--Well, but the meaning can change in the context of the statute, because the statute refers to the drug market."
1995.94-9088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,404.534,405.115,Well--
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,405.115,407.626,"And that's what the commission studied, was the drug market."
1995.94-9088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,407.626,433.545,"--Well, what if in a totally different context this Court had said we take the plain meaning of the word employee, in a case that Justice Breyer wrote for the Court a few weeks ago, and then a great convention of lexicographers came along and said, well, we really want to get to the bottom of this thing, and we now think that employee means something different, could the next party come along and say, well, this case should be modified because you are wrong in deciding what employee meant?"
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,433.545,442.16,"No, because there is no congressionally delegated convention of lexicographers tasked with precisely the task that you've outlined in your hypothetical."
1995.94-9088,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,442.16,442.661,But Congress could do that.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,458.661,463.953,If Congress designated a convention of lexicographers with the same thoroughness as it did--
1995.94-9088,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,463.953,464.544,Right.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,464.544,466.495,"--the Sentencing Commission, then the answer would be yes."
1995.94-9088,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,466.495,468.598,"Gee, I feel a lot less important than I did before."
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,484.988,493.202,"Your Honor, this is not a case of stare decisis, and those cases all deal with stare decisis, and it's not a case of stare decisis for two reasons."
1995.94-9088,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,510.325,515.307,"Did the length of the sentence in Chapman depend on the actual weight, including the weight of the blotter paper?"
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,515.307,517.969,What was at issue in Chapman--
1995.94-9088,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,517.969,518.46,Yes or no.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,518.46,522.443,--The length of the sentence under the statute did.
1995.94-9088,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,527.606,532.719,"So that the answer is yes, the sentence depended on the actual weight of the mixture or substance."
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,532.719,534.58,--The sentence in Chapman--
1995.94-9088,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,534.58,534.95,Well--
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,534.95,535.711,--given the two alternatives--
1995.94-9088,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,535.711,536.583,"--the answer is yes, isn't it?"
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,536.583,537.043,--Yes.
1995.94-9088,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,545.839,548.07,"Well then, that was the holding of the case."
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,558.946,570.003,"--Right at the time, but now the term, mixture or substance, has been revisited by the Sentencing Commission which was tasked with the task of--"
1995.94-9088,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,570.003,575.167,"Which means, on your view, the Sentencing Commission can, in fact, modify the holding of the case."
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,575.167,577.368,"--That is not my position, Justice Souter."
1995.94-9088,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,588.355,592.839,"And when reality has been explored, what is left of the holding in Chapman?"
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,592.839,601.795,"--What is left of the holding in Chapman is the essentials of section 841, to wit that there is a market-oriented approach to drug sentencing, that the--"
1995.94-9088,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,601.795,604.917,But not the rule that the actual weight will be considered.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,605.556,607.238,--That would be--
1995.94-9088,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,607.238,608.697,That has yielded to reality.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,608.697,610.38,--That has yielded--
1995.94-9088,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,610.38,610.921,Right?
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,610.921,611.71,--to the new plain meaning--
1995.94-9088,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,611.71,612.01,Yes.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,612.01,628.563,"--of the term, and the reason that it yields to the new plain meaning of the term is because mixture or substance, as defined as gross weight blotter paper, with no input from the Sentencing Commission's expert study of the issue, is inconsistent with section 841(b) as framed by Congress."
1995.94-9088,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,628.563,642.531,"I'm not sure that it matters, but when we're talking about reality, is it correct to say, as I think the Government has pointed out, that the putative weight adopted by the commission is approximately 1/20th of the characteristic average weight?"
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,642.531,643.8,It is in fact.
1995.94-9088,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,643.8,656.65,"Mr. Bergerson, not only do I have some doubt whether we have to follow the Sentencing Commission, I have some doubt whether the Sentencing Commission doesn't have to follow us."
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,686.71,692.794,"Not under the delegation that's been given to the commission, Justice Scalia, to establish sentencing guidelines."
1995.94-9088,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,695.035,697.927,No matter how irrational those sentencing guidelines are?
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,709.074,714.637,"--However, the totally different basis is entirely in keeping with the language of the statute because it punishes LSD in a--"
1995.94-9088,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.637,721.041,"Theirs is and ours is, but you have the two of them working, and you say the commission's ought to prevail over ours."
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,735.871,741.875,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and the Government can go to Congress and ask Congress to change the Sentencing Reform Act for 1984."
1995.94-9088,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.875,744.286,Congress doesn't change things just because they're illogical.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,747.779,748.48,Nonetheless.
1995.94-9088,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,748.48,749.312,"I mean, we do."
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,750.782,758.357,Congress has given to the Sentencing Commission the power to do what it did and reserve for itself the power to do what the Chief Justice is suggesting.
1995.94-9088,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,758.357,761.988,"Did it exercise that power, assuming it had it?"
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,808.009,809.97,I would respectfully disagree with that interpretation.
1995.94-9088,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,836.337,858.483,"But if I were on the commission and were doing this thing, which is pretty radical, trying to change a case of the Supreme Court, interpreting a statute of Congress, which I can't remember an instance where the commission would try to do that, wouldn't the commission at least tell people what they were trying to do and explain it, rather than putting a sentence in the guideline that implies to an ordinary reading the contrary?"
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,858.483,884.068,"Well, the sentence is in the commentary to the guideline, and to the degree that it's inconsistent with the guideline it's not binding on this Court under this Court's Stinson decision, but my submission would be that the guideline is plain enough and the delegation to the commission to do what it did is plain enough that the commission need not have said anything, and simply proclaiming that it is trying to be consistent with section 841 and this Court's reasoning in Chapman is nothing more than the commission's own statement of its own limitations."
1995.94-9088,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,884.068,885.46,There's another question that you may have.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,968.833,981.823,"In the Chapman dissent there is a footnote, footnote 12, which indicates that if you strip away the paper, then the doses become equivalent for all the drugs listed in section 841(b)."
1995.94-9088,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1000.244,1001.254,"Yes, but this is quite later."
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1024.81,1031.164,The DEA's pre-1986 and post 1986 statements all weigh LSD in terms of pure LSD.
1995.94-9088,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1032.826,1034.215,It doesn't matter how you weigh it.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1046.464,1052.158,"--In answer to Your Honor's question, the DEA did not provide input to Congress on the question that Your Honor has asked."
1995.94-9088,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1084.869,1086.379,Mr. Bergerson--
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1086.379,1086.75,Yes.
1995.94-9088,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1086.75,1109.587,"--are you making at least as a fallback argument the suggestion that the Court has ruled one way in Chapman, it should be enlightened but not bound by what the Sentencing Commission has done, and therefore reconsider and modify Chapman?"
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1121.993,1123.995,"That is one position, Your Honor."
1995.94-9088,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1134.802,1154.354,"I find it powerfully hard to take the term plain meaning, which should mean the word means something plain, and then say because there was an expert commission that gave this a lot of study, then the plain meaning, the meaning that people, ordinary people would understand, changes."
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1154.354,1156.697,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-9088,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1170.515,1181.442,"We couldn't possibly have interpreted the statute to mean anything resembling what the commission says it's going to use for purposes of sentencing, could we?"
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1184.114,1191.83,"On the record presented to you in Chapman, you could not, Your Honor, because Chapman involved no comment from the Sentencing Commission, having undertaken expert study."
1995.94-9088,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.83,1198.923,"Even with a comment or without a comment, we can't read, you know, the word mixture to mean, you know, so many doses."
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1204.566,1207.599,"Your Honor, we submit that it is not legislating."
1995.94-9088,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.023,1214.744,How would you have us interpret the language in Chapman?
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1220.969,1224.462,--What we would submit is that--
1995.94-9088,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1224.462,1226.131,"The language in question is what, mixture?"
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1226.131,1231.395,"--Well, the language in question is the statute as a whole, but turning to mixture in the context of the statute--"
1995.94-9088,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1231.395,1231.886,Mm-hmm.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1231.886,1246.585,--I would submit that a mixture or substance containing LSD means that quantum of LSD which yield sentences consistent with the obvious intent of Congress to regulate street drugs in like quantities with like mandatory penalties in the form they're sold on the market.
1995.94-9088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1246.585,1252.128,"You deduce that just from the language, a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of LSD?"
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1252.128,1255.38,I deduce that from the market-oriented approach of the statute--
1995.94-9088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1255.38,1255.781,"Well, but--"
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1255.781,1258.443,--which is where this Court achieved its deduction in Chapman as well.

1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1335.923,1339.446,--Chapman posed a different issue.
1995.94-9088,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1353.866,1354.236,Wow.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1354.236,1356.528,--and to cure penalties with other penalties for like drugs.

1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1361.44,1366.174,"Not in a vacuum, Your Honor, but Congress established the Sentencing Commission to do precisely what it did here."
1995.94-9088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1366.174,1370.174,But it didn't establish the Sentencing Commission to amend the provisions of the Criminal Code.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1370.174,1370.925,Nor did it.
1995.94-9088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1370.925,1372.307,The Criminal Code remains what it is.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1372.307,1378.271,"Absolutely, and that's why the Sentencing Commission proclaimed that its findings were consistent with Chapman and with the statute."

1995.94-9088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1416.626,1417.788,But you're saying it did.
1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1417.788,1425.111,I'm saying that the Sentencing Commission has come up with an interpretation of mixture or substance as it exists in the real drug markets.

1995.94-9088,0,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,1468.031,1477.825,My answer is that the Sentencing Commission did not do what... it did not define the terms in the statute.

1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1614.965,1625.203,"--Well, for sentences that are less than 1 gram, the penalty statute doesn't apply, so it doesn't... the statute only applies for 1 gram or more, or 10 grams or more."

1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1743.361,1764.822,"What the commission did within its own bounds, the guideline is certainly valid, and it has the effect of considerably lowering the sentences for LSD trafficking both below the 1-gram threshold and between... between the 1 and 10-gram threshold it brings most of them down to 5 years, and then above the 10-gram threshold it brings many sentences down."
1995.94-9088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.15,1861.317,"You'd think that the more mixture you got, the more punishment you'd get, and what the commissioner has said is, no, that's not true, even though we have said the statute is based on what the mixture weighs."

1995.94-9088,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1991.292,1992.993,It's not so unusual.
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2026.845,2045.665,"--The courts take into account the objective the Congress was seeking to accomplish when it enacted the statute when it gives content to the terms, and whether it considers whether a result in a particular case is demonstrably at odds with what Congress intended, and comment by the commission can be useful to the court."
1995.94-9088,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2064.168,2098.483,"So I agree with that, but then that... this is my... what I'm trying to lead up to basically is the Government must have in its file somewhere the information that Congress had in its mind, whether staff or Congressmen, at the time this statute was passed, and did Congress believe that they were putting in prison for 5 years people who distributed 125 doses of LSD, or did they think they were putting in prison for 5 years people who distributed 2,500 doses of LSD?"

1995.94-9088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2171.479,2173.34,That was the argument the Court rejected in Chapman.

1995.94-9088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2443.761,2465.175,"--and the statute says mixture or substance, and that's how we interpreted it, and I don't know why the commission can conclude that really Congress was looking at... you know, it's like the prohibition law that somehow it's... as far as I was aware, it applied to whether the liquor was 40 proof or 100 proof."
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2466.037,2474.492,"--That is correct, and that was the original approach under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, that substances were punished."

1995.94-9088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2572.792,2593.424,"That may well be, Mr. Wolfson, but I have the distinct impression that if any other agency that I know of interpreted a statute this way, that the minimum applies to the mixture or substance, but the incremental penalty does not apply to the mixture or substance but to the number of grams in the mixture or substance, we would say, you can't have it both ways."
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2593.424,2595.666,"--Well, of course--"

1995.94-9088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2623.217,2624.618,"--There would have been nothing inconsistent with any law, however."

1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2791.47,2806.697,"No, the Government has... in other cases, the Government... there are cases currently going on in the Federal system where the Government is challenging the validity of a guideline, not as inconsistent with... not as inconsistent with a separate penalty statute--"
1995.94-9088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2806.697,2807.699,Yes.
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2807.699,2813.302,"--that the Sentencing Commission does not have authority to construe, but as inconsistent with provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act."
1995.94-9088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2813.302,2823.601,"But it is the Government's position that the guidelines can be as inconsistent as you like with the substantive criminal statutes, including minimums."
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2826.422,2845.943,"If they are inconsistent in the sense... if they are inconsistent in the sense that they interfere with the ability of the minimums to apply, obviously not, but if they are within the Sentencing Commission's own sphere, own domain, as is the case with less than 1 gram here, that that... the Sentencing Commission is not--"
1995.94-9088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2845.943,2851.347,Why can they not be unlawful because they are incompatible with the substantive criminal statute?
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2851.347,2865.007,--Because the Sentencing Commission is not under a statutory obligation to bring those guidelines into conformity with the... with 841(b) for offenses that don't meet the threshold for that statute to apply.
1995.94-9088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2868.27,2869.57,"Well, then you have a problem with me."
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2877.724,2883.937,"--Well, now, Justice Scalia, let me point out that, of course, Congress could have decriminalized LSD altogether under 1 gram."
1995.94-9088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2896.045,2896.807,Congress could be irrational.
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2904.243,2913.33,"--Well, on its own terms, of course, there's... what the Sentencing Commission has done, the scheme that they have set up is not arbitrary."
1995.94-9088,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2932.753,2937.415,"Nothing in the submission of this case raises any question about the rationality of the guidelines, does it?"
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2941.169,2942.32,--That is correct.
1995.94-9088,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2942.32,2948.294,"He said he should have been sentenced under the guidelines and the district court refused to do so, and the court of appeals upheld it."
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2948.294,2949.443,"That is correct, so--"
1995.94-9088,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2949.443,2952.365,"Well, the guidelines did have an impact to this extent."
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2953.357,2953.838,--Yes.
1995.94-9088,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2953.838,2960.242,--than he did when the commission was interpreting the guideline in sync with the way this Court has interpreted the statute.
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2960.242,2961.121,"Yes, and we agreed--"
1995.94-9088,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2961.121,2962.563,"There was a lot of months difference, wasn't there?"
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2962.563,2962.994,--Yes.
1995.94-9088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.691,2975.201,Mr.--
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2983.807,2988.72,"Well, of course, Congress could have adopted a determinate sentence approach as well."
1995.94-9088,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3013.785,3035.24,"Mr. Wolfson, if the Government did think that what the guidelines... what the Sentencing Commission did in adopting a particular guideline was irrational in light of the statutory language and the scheme that's in place, exactly what is it that the Government can do to challenge it?"
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3043.395,3044.136,Two things.
1995.94-9088,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3048.969,3057.235,"And failing that, if that is not done, you just were asleep at the switch over there in looking at it, what later could you do?"
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3057.235,3075.217,"--In another... in a case involving a different issue, we... the Attorney General has instructed the U.S. attorneys to oppose application of a guideline in particular cases and to appeal sentences if they're based on the guidelines, because in that case we believe they're inconsistent with the Sentencing Reform Act."
1995.94-9088,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3075.217,3080.129,"With the statute, and therefore irrational and arbitrary and invalid."
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3080.129,3082.821,"I would say contrary to law, is how I would describe it."
1995.94-9088,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3082.821,3088.033,"And then if you prevail in that, what happens if the guideline is simply obliterated?"
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3090.426,3091.806,"Well, in that case--"
1995.94-9088,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3091.806,3092.648,In this other case you're--
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3092.648,3093.336,--Right.
1995.94-9088,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3113.111,3114.441,--Then sentencing--
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3114.441,3115.763,--counting prior convictions or not.
1995.94-9088,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3115.763,3118.345,--And sentencing is just held in abeyance until there's some new guideline.
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3118.345,3122.458,In that case we think there's only one possible interpretation of the statute.
1995.94-9088,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3122.458,3124.368,I see.
1995.94-9088,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3124.368,3133.463,"In sum, as earlier, we argued that the Chapman rule remains the controlling interpretation of section 841, and we would request the judgment of the court of appeals be affirmed."
1995.94-9088,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3133.463,3135.285,"Thank you, Mr. Wolfson."
1995.94-9088,2,20596,donald_t_bergerson,,3137.318,3139.588,Thank you.
1995.94-9088,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3217.607,3219.129,"Thank you, Mr. Bergerson."
