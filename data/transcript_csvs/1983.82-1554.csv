1983.82-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.154,We will hear arguments next in Strickland against Washington.
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,67.692,94.343,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue before the Court today is whether the Eleventh Circuit's en banc decision setting forth the standards by which prejudice and the competency level of a defendant in a collateral action, the manner in which that standard should be applied is up for consideration."
1983.82-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,194.625,196.51,May I ask you a preliminary question--
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,196.51,196.81,Yes.
1983.82-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,196.81,198.195,--because it is right on that point.
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,208.968,212.67,It came about at the federal evidentiary hearing.
1983.82-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,238.653,242.772,But that claim was raised for the first time at the federal habeas corpus proceeding.
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,243.522,246.391,"--Well, but again, the claim wasn't per se raised."
1983.82-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,255.163,256.097,There was not a Gardner violation?
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,256.097,257.165,--There was not... right.
1983.82-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,257.165,262.353,The Court of Appeals said that claim was raised for the first time in the federal habeas corpus proceeding.
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,262.353,264.203,That is correct with regard to--
1983.82-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,264.203,272.391,"Now, do you concede that there was jurisdiction in the federal habeas corpus proceeding notwithstanding the fact that the petition contained an unexhausted claim?"
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,272.391,278.795,"--The state would contend that as the posture of the development of this case developed, that in fact it was a ruse."
1983.82-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,298.876,299.726,"Well, I agree."
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,304.263,304.546,"That's right, Your Honor."
1983.82-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,305.33,309.048,"And if there had been an unexhausted claim, what would your position be?"
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,309.048,321.307,"The state, because of the nature of the case and the posture the case was in... this case happened to be under an outstanding death warrant in Florida... the state would have waived--"
1983.82-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,321.307,323.641,Do you think it is something you can waive?
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,323.641,328.461,"--Yes, Your Honor, and as a matter of fact, we have... there is a case out of the Eleventh Circuit which holds to the contrary."
1983.82-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,333.782,341.536,The state of Florida's position is that an unexhausted claim does not deprive the federal court of jurisdiction if the state is willing to proceed?
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,341.536,342.138,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1554,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,656.542,674.337,"Ms. Snurkowski, was the Florida trial court's determination that the new evidence was insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances as a matter of law a determination of Florida law in your view?"
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,674.337,675.087,I believe it was.
1983.82-1554,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,685.276,697.433,"Okay, so you think the Florida trial court determined as a matter of Florida law that the new evidence could not have overcome the aggravating circumstances?"
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,697.433,698.118,"--Affected the outcome, modified--"
1983.82-1554,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,698.118,706.891,"Well, do you think that the Florida death statute could remove discretion from the sentencer and be constitutional?"
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,706.891,708.524,--Remove?
1983.82-1554,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,710.276,712.31,Remove the discretion from the sentencer?
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,712.31,714.795,As opposed... you mean--
1983.82-1554,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,714.795,723.484,"That would be the effect of the holding as a matter of law then, to remove all discretion from the trial court to be able to sentence to death."
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,723.484,724.817,"--I don't believe that is... No, I don't believe that's what we're doing."
1983.82-1554,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,745.147,755.269,"Well, if as a matter of law the new evidence could not overcome the aggravating, then aren't you saying that the sentencer must give the death sentence?"
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,755.269,756.805,"No, I don't believe we are saying that."
1983.82-1554,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1434.259,1438.063,How do you think the standard should differ on direct review?
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1438.063,1440.33,On direct review?
1983.82-1554,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1458.559,1458.976,I know.
1983.82-1554,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1464.797,1481.823,"Yes, I probably would, only to the extent that collateral litigation... we have had a hallmark of what collateral litigation is to do as opposed... you know, we are going to be truth finding."
1983.82-1554,1,40442,richard_e_shapiro,,1949.174,1975.574,"Your Honor, the public defender of New Jersey is my boss, and I was handling this case when I was in the south representing people in death row cases, and when I came to the office, because of its importance to New Jersey's new capital sentencing law and to standards for effective assistance of counsel nationwide, the New Jersey public defender allowed me to present the case to the Court."
1983.82-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1975.574,1976.574,On his behalf?
1983.82-1554,1,40442,richard_e_shapiro,,1976.574,1977.876,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1977.876,1979.226,Thank you.
1983.82-1554,1,40442,richard_e_shapiro,,1979.226,1996.171,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, before discussing the legal standard for assessing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, it is essential to point out what the District Court found as the reason for counsel's lack of investigation."
1983.82-1554,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2070.986,2085.311,"Mr. Shapiro, in that regard, do you agree that counsel could have been called at the ineffectiveness hearing to testify what his client told him in the course of preparing the defense?"
1983.82-1554,1,40442,richard_e_shapiro,,2085.311,2086.545,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1983.82-1554,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2086.545,2091.632,Can the attorney himself be called at the hearing--
1983.82-1554,1,40442,richard_e_shapiro,,2091.632,2092.182,Yes.
1983.82-1554,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2092.182,2093.167,--on the ineffectiveness claim?
1983.82-1554,1,40442,richard_e_shapiro,,2093.167,2093.884,Yes.
1983.82-1554,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2093.884,2096.619,To testify as to what his client told him?
1983.82-1554,1,40442,richard_e_shapiro,,2099.155,2101.438,"Yes, there is a waiver of the attorney-client privilege in those circumstances."
1983.82-1554,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2103.707,2115.515,Was that evidence admitted in this case as to why the attorney did what he did?
1983.82-1554,1,40442,richard_e_shapiro,,2115.515,2115.615,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2135.909,2151.438,"Does your case turn... To what extent, I will put it this way, does your case turn on the failure to call the family, the former employers, and friends in the mitigation?"
1983.82-1554,1,40442,richard_e_shapiro,,2151.438,2152.654,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2177.869,2181.754,"That is the mitigation, what we are talking about."
1983.82-1554,1,40442,richard_e_shapiro,,2181.754,2182.337,"--Yes, the mitigation hearing."
1983.82-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2182.337,2185.039,"Well, now, how should he have demonstrated that?"
1983.82-1554,1,40442,richard_e_shapiro,,2185.039,2194.295,"Well, Your Honor, at the sentencing hearing, Mr. Tunkey argued at Page 322 of the joint appendix that David Washington"
1983.82-1554,2,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,3828.508,3829.443,"I just have... oh, thank you."
1983.82-1554,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3958.493,3963.128,Your time has expired.
1983.82-1554,2,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,3963.128,3963.478,That was it.
1983.82-1554,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3964.397,3965.347,"Thank you, counsel."
