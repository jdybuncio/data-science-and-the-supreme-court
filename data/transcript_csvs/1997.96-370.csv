1997.96-370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.136,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-370, the Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corporation of California."
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,9.356,12.139,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,156.674,160.598,Does interest run on withdrawal liability?
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,160.598,168.442,"Interest runs on withdrawal liability payments, but in an odd way that was described by this Court in Schlitz."
1997.96-370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,178.109,181.192,So interest would not run from the date of withdrawal.
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,181.192,200.255,"--It doesn't run from the date of withdrawal, and if the fund does not assess the withdrawal for some period of time it runs only, as described by this court in Schlitz, as if the payment was made on the first day of the date following withdrawal no matter when they're actually made, even if it the demand isn't to make them until sometime later."
1997.96-370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,330.917,336.828,"So under your view, I mean, there would be a separate cause of action for each instalment payment."
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,336.828,343.283,"--Well, that's correct as well, although it was the third point that I was going to make, and--"
1997.96-370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,343.283,349.677,And that means that in theory it could continue on for 26 years or so.
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,349.677,352.229,--There are two things to be said about that.
1997.96-370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,378.239,382.902,And I suppose if there's an early default the plan's sponsor could accelerate the balance.
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,382.902,383.212,--Correct.
1997.96-370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,406.74,416.837,So under your theory the statute of limitations in this case would have started to run 6 years after the nonpayment of the first instalment.
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,416.837,447.917,"On the first instalment, and on each instalment as it came due, because the debt was not in fact accelerated and because of the additional fact that under the more specific aspects of the statutory scheme it actually could not have been accelerated because although, as I said before, there is a permissive acceleration clause, it was not operative during the relevant periods in this case, and it wasn't operative because first it was too early, that is, the 60 days had not run at any period of time outside--"
1997.96-370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,447.917,456.842,"Ms. Berzon, you keep mentioning the 60 days, but as I understand it, that's... that has never been passed on by any court."
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,466.479,467.361,--That's correct.
1997.96-370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,467.361,486.873,"The argument that you made in your brief about the 60-day period as I understand it was not passed on by any court below, so you may be wrong, or you may be right about it, but you are asking us to take a first view of that question, which ordinarily we don't."
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,486.873,488.436,Let me see if I can understand.
1997.96-370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,520.087,524.169,Why should we reach that question when the court we're reviewing hasn't reached it?
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,543.794,545.384,--That's true.
1997.96-370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,569.45,579.828,"But if you're right about the 60 days, so your whole thing would be timely, this other question about each instalment is academic in your case because it wouldn't matter."
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,579.828,580.299,It's--
1997.96-370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,580.299,581.728,The whole thing would be timely.
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,581.728,604.734,"--If... then I think that you are assuming a second issue, other than the time by... than the periodic-payment-by-periodic-payment issue, and that is whether or not the first payment... this lawsuit was timely with respect to the first payment, and we do argue that it was timely with respect to the first payment, and--"
1997.96-370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,604.734,610.596,"Yes, and if you're right about that, that... the rest of it doesn't matter because you're in under the wire."
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,610.596,611.227,--That's true.
1997.96-370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,627.489,649.842,"Yes, and that's something that you have urged and that has not been passed on by any other court, so I understand that the first question is certainly before us, but I don't understand that anything else is because it hasn't... we would be acting as a court of first view, not a court of review."
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,649.842,661.98,"--All right, but that is separate from the issue of whether we necessarily prevail without deciding that question, and the answer is we do not necessarily prevail because of the schedule here, and perhaps I can clarify that."
1997.96-370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,730.978,744.417,"But if you're right about even the first payment, that you were timely, then why should we get to the question of instalment or not?"
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,744.417,747.659,"Well, if I'm right on the first payment being timely then you don't need to."
1997.96-370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,757.485,784.284,"Is... am I correct in understanding that the option that you think is correct is not any of the four that you listed in your cert petition, because you said your... first is the withdrawal date, second the date when the payment becomes overdue, you're not relying on that, then for each payment due, on the date the payment becomes overdue unless the plan's sponsor elects to evoke the statutory provision on acceleration or some other date, at some other date you think is right, is when the demand--"
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,784.284,784.524,--No.
1997.96-370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,791.139,795.029,"--And... but when does it become overdue, when it was not paid, or when you made a further demand?"
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,795.029,798.892,"--When it was not paid is when that particular payment is not due, but that--"
1997.96-370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,798.892,801.116,"Well, then you're not in time for the first payment."
1997.96-370,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,801.116,806.8,"--I sort of hate to get side-tracked on it, because it's a $345 problem."
1997.96-370,1,46433,william_f_terheyden,,1001.224,1010.269,"It's Mr. Terheyden, Your Honor... oh, I apologize, to Mr. DuMont, and to the Court."
1997.96-370,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1010.269,1015.072,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-370,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1070.889,1091.802,Why don't you take the position that counsel for the petitioner does that the 60-day rule with respect to the first payment actually makes the date of adverse consequence the date upon which it could have been demanded... the date upon which it could have been collected rather than the date upon which they demanded the payment to be made?
1997.96-370,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1091.802,1096.077,We... that is a conceivable reading of that section of the statute.
1997.96-370,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1146.822,1153.307,"But would... if they sued on the stated day, which was before the sixty-first day, would they be subject to a motion to dismiss?"
1997.96-370,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1153.307,1157.801,--We believe the payment is due on the day that is specified in the schedule--
1997.96-370,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1157.801,1158.711,So the answer is no?
1997.96-370,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1158.711,1167.285,"--The answer is that suit would be timely if it was before the sixty-first day, but after the day that the payment was due under the schedule."
1997.96-370,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1167.285,1181.917,"Well, so you're saying that even though the schedule set forth a date before the sixty-first day, suit would be timely 6 years after the sixty-first day, and that there was a failure to pay?"
1997.96-370,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1181.917,1182.385,No.
1997.96-370,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1195.215,1206.392,"So you are rejecting their 60-day--under your reading of the statute, the first... they sued too late to recover the first payment, is that--"
1997.96-370,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1206.392,1228.787,"That's correct, which is why in our view of the way the statute is best construed it is necessary for the Court to reach the question passed on by the Seventh Circuit, which is, was there only one cause of action and therefore when the first payment was missed was there a sort of automatic acceleration back to that point, so that if you missed the first payment you missed everything."
1997.96-370,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1228.787,1237.954,"--Then you think that 60-day is so clearly wrong on the petitioner's part that it shouldn't be something that we should remand to the court of appeals, which never considered it?"
1997.96-370,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1237.954,1249.8,"I think it's perfectly within this Court's options to reject the rule that the Ninth Circuit came up with, which was running from the date of withdrawal, and to leave all the other issues for resolution below."
1997.96-370,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1267.285,1283.244,"This 60-day dispute for purposes of the present case is only relevant as to the first payment, but the issue, the issue of whether the 60 days is what counts or not, applies to every payment set under this scheme, doesn't it?"
1997.96-370,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1283.985,1284.365,That's correct.
1997.96-370,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1288.62,1304.218,"Well, that's what I'm... as I read the statute, it says the failure of an employer to pay any overdue withdrawal liability payment, any payment, not just the first, within 60 days after the employer receives written notification from the plan's sponsor that the payment is overdue."
1997.96-370,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1306.909,1307.2,"Well, no."
1997.96-370,3,46433,william_f_terheyden,,1599.154,1605.227,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-370,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1640.503,1644.145,But the extension to 26 years would be only for the last $350.
1997.96-370,3,46433,william_f_terheyden,,1644.145,1644.864,--No.
1997.96-370,4,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3277.841,3281.961,I'd like to address two things.
1997.96-370,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3411.342,3417.047,"No, but according to the letter it would have been due before... they gave them... you gave them up to February 10, 60 days from December 12."
1997.96-370,4,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3417.047,3420.037,"--It was actually 60 days from when they received the letter, so it would have been a little after that."
1997.96-370,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3420.037,3422.941,"Well, but in any event you gave them beyond February 1."
1997.96-370,4,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3422.941,3423.449,Exactly.
1997.96-370,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3423.449,3428.514,So that the... under his reading and my reading of that paragraph you lose the first payment.
1997.96-370,4,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3428.514,3430.805,I--
1997.96-370,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3430.805,3433.166,Because they had no obligation to do anything--
1997.96-370,4,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3433.166,3433.537,--That may be if you do it on a payment-by-payment--
1997.96-370,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3433.537,3438.219,"--because they had an option to pay in full on February 8, because that's what you asked for."
1997.96-370,4,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3438.219,3443.204,--On February 8 they didn't have an obligation to pay in full.
1997.96-370,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3443.932,3444.763,"They didn't have an obligation, they had an option."
1997.96-370,4,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3450.768,3453.209,"--That's correct, but on February--"
