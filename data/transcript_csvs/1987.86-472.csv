1987.86-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.141,"We'll hear argument next in No. 86-472, Church of Scientology of California versus the Internal Revenue Service."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,55.468,58.301,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1987.86-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,206.516,209.884,"Well, how about your position, Mr. Hertzberg?"
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,225.994,233.167,"Your Honor, returns themselves are separately nondisclosable under the statutory scheme."
1987.86-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,248.943,249.259,Okay.
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,259.048,259.584,Sure.
1987.86-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,320.19,333.164,"So supposing the Freedom of Information Act request was for the number of people who had reported a gross income of $76,855 last year?"
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,334.95,339.834,"--I would, Your Honor, if it could in no way be linked to a particular taxpayer, of course."
1987.86-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,339.834,343.221,"And that the government should have to collect that information for you, in effect?"
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,343.221,347.757,"Well, that would turn on whether it was a proper request under the Freedom of Information Act."
1987.86-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.077,358.148,And is it your understanding that the government would say that is not required to be disclosed?
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,358.148,361.683,"And in fact, under the terms, yes, yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,382.013,389.1,"Let's stay away from the peculiarities of the Freedom of Information Act, and concentrate on the tax aspects."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,400.558,401.158,Yes.
1987.86-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,449.123,455.895,"What, to the extent that you can, did the Court of Appeals mean by it being reformulated?"
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,455.895,461.382,"Well, Your Honor, that is one of the fundamental problems, here, because they were extremely vague."
1987.86-472,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,491.152,500.507,"I would think the Government would surely say the number of people, certain level of income, would be disclosable."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,502.29,503.625,I am not sure.
1987.86-472,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,505.092,506.911,"Well, all they do is count."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,513.498,527.456,"--Your Honor, then perhaps I misunderstood Chief Justice Rehnquist's question, because I understood him in the hypothetical that he furnished to be asking for the data of that level of income."
1987.86-472,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,527.456,541.132,"But if the question was how many people reported an income of $100,000, you would agree if they just came up with a number?"
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,541.132,542.667,"Just a number, yes."
1987.86-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,549.321,561.462,"Does any example readily occur to you of things like what we're talking about where you think it should be disclosed and the government doesn't, some kind of concrete case?"
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,561.462,562.462,"Well, our case."
1987.86-472,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,562.462,563.081,Yes.
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,564.381,565.95,All right.
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,628.356,629.74,Can I interrupt you just a minute to get the example.
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,640.581,642.498,"--Yes, if it refers to the petitioner."
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,642.498,648.769,Are you therefore contending that that tax return at the time of the request is not return information?
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,648.769,650.42,At the time of the request?
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,660.494,664.529,"Well, in other words, a part of the return is return information and part is not return information."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,664.529,664.979,--That's right.
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,666.029,673.052,So is there anything in your view in the concept of return information other than the names of taxpayers?
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,673.052,674.585,Certainly.
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,674.585,679.389,Or things that will specifically identify a return with a particular taxpayer?
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,679.389,689.93,"If I understand the question correctly, anything in the files that the Internal Revenue Service maintains is potentially return information."
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,689.93,707.975,"Well, but potential, I'm talking about at the time of the request, because I'm not talking about subsequent reformulation or... see, I think there's a big difference between reformulating in response to an FOIA request and reformulation that took place by the government preceding the request when it prepared some statistical study."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,721.116,721.866,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1987.86-472,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,721.866,739.077,"But if the government just makes a copy of a return in its entirety, and then redacts, crosses out any identifiable information, is that return information, what's left?"
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,739.077,741.529,Yes.
1987.86-472,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,743.815,745.431,Yes.
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,749.552,750.202,No.
1987.86-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,778.286,779.654,But how do you tell that?
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,790.896,801.085,"We would maintain that in most circumstances, the Agency would have to agree that just a figure would not identify the taxpayer."
1987.86-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,841.562,865.344,"So if I give $25 to the Church of Scientology ten years ago, and you come in and ask IRS for any file that mentions the Church of Scientology, they should disclose the fact that an unknown taxpayer gave $25 to the Church of Scientology according to a return in their possession ten years ago?"
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,865.344,875.902,"If the Church of Scientology is mentioned in there, and the $25 donation can be disclosed without any chance that it will identify or be associated with the taxpayer--"
1987.86-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,875.902,879.27,How does the IRS know whether there's any chance it'll identify me or not?
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,879.27,917.979,"--Your Honor, this is the kind of determination I think you're alluding to perhaps the informed requester argument that the government makes, this is the kind of decision that agencies make all the time under the Freedom of Information act, and they work in conjunction of course with the de novo review that the Courts have of these determinations to make informed decisions that information will not identify somebody, or under other subsections of the Freedom of Information Act, for instance, like subsections 4, 6 and 7, that they will not constitute unwarranted privacies or lead to furnishing information about investigations that are underway."
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.649,927.518,May I ask you another question about that hypothetical?
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,952.818,953.502,At that moment?
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,953.502,955.468,It's clearly return information.
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,955.468,956.468,"It is return information, Your Honor."
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,956.468,959.003,"If it's return information, then it's exempted from the Statute."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,959.003,968.876,Except that you cannot divorce in our view the Statute that we're talking about in the Internal Revenue Code from the duty to segregate and delete--
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,968.876,971.228,"Yeah, but there's no duty to segregate in the Internal Revenue Code."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,971.228,973.43,--But it is in the Freedom of Information Act.
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,973.43,974.53,"Now, explain that to me."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,974.53,974.963,All right.
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,974.963,982.118,Where in the Freedom of Information Act is there a duty to make something that is return information into something that's not return information?
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,982.118,1005.132,"Well, I would say that the duty flows from the segregability and deletion requirement of Section 552(b) of the Freedom of Information Act which says that, exempt material which can be deleted and segregated... excuse me... when exempt material can be deleted from nonexempt material--"
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1005.132,1008.067,"That's right, but the whole return is exempt when you start from it."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1008.067,1008.603,--I'm sorry?
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1008.603,1012.221,"But at the time of the request, the whole return is exempt material."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1012.221,1025.778,"Yes, but first of all, the Court below, Your Honor, found that the section 6103(B)(2) was a Freedom of Information Act (b)(3) exemption statute, so they must be read together."
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1025.778,1026.564,[inaudible]
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1026.564,1029.23,That's correct.
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1063.07,1066.122,"Yes, but my hypothetical is that the whole tax return is return information."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1066.122,1072.093,"--Well, Your Honor, tax returns per se cannot be disclosed under Section 6103(a)."
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1072.093,1073.276,I understand.
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1076.561,1078.663,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1111.134,1115.538,"Then returns are never disclosable, you're saying, even if you redact them?"
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1115.538,1116.238,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1116.238,1119.59,"So the example we gave, you'd say that was not returnable even if you redacted the names?"
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1119.59,1121.959,"That's correct, if it's a return."
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1121.959,1122.842,If it's a return.
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1122.842,1123.542,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1123.542,1129.196,So no information that's in the tax returns themselves under your view of the case must be produced?
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1129.196,1130.214,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1130.214,1131.064,I see.
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1131.064,1132.514,And I'm sorry because I think that I--
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1132.514,1134.083,That's not the answer you gave to the hypothetical.
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1134.083,1135.083,--I was just going to say.
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1141.003,1149.509,So you're only seeking information that is in supplementary papers in a file but no information that's in tax returns themselves?
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1149.509,1150.209,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1150.209,1151.378,I hadn't understood that before.
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1151.378,1153.747,It's my fault I did not make that clear.
1987.86-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1154.73,1160.417,Including the $25 contribution on the return to the Church of Scientology?
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1160.417,1164.103,"If that is in the return, would it be excluded?"
1987.86-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1164.103,1165.036,"Yes, in my hypothetical return."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1165.036,1165.721,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1201.394,1207.065,"Now, the Freedom of Information Act doesn't have any standing requirement, does it?"
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1220.372,1239.186,"Your Honor, you couldn't do that without implicating, associating and identifying material, because if you name somebody else, and you get a response, then any information you get in response to the request which named a taxpayer would clearly always be identified with that taxpayer or associated with that taxpayer."
1987.86-472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1307.08,1338.265,"Mr. Hertzberg, I think where I get confused in this whole matter as far as your presentation is concerned is how to properly relate the Freedom of Information Act provision that says reasonably segregable portions of a record shall be provided with the exemption provision for return information, together with the Haskell Amendment."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1385.03,1386.48,"I don't agree, Your Honor."
1987.86-472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1386.48,1387.115,No?
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1387.115,1396.721,The phrase in the Haskell Amendment says that data which doesn't identify and can't be associated with a taxpayer is not return information.
1987.86-472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1399.756,1406.26,"If it's already in that form, then it is not exempt; it's disclosable."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1406.26,1422.538,"--Well, you know, the government's position and the Court of Appeals' position below was that even a piece of information or data in a file which in its original form is not combined with any identifying material is also still return information."
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1492.81,1496.781,"No, but Mr. Hertzberg, you overlooked something in Justice O'Connor's question."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1516.008,1519.194,"Well, Your Honor, we think that the plain language supports our position."
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1526.966,1528.75,Already in a form.
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1536.404,1551.663,"We would maintain that, in a form, means, and could mean nothing more than in the manner of, that if it's disclosable in a manner which does not identify, we think that's a plausible reading which cannot be associated with a taxpayer or identify the taxpayer."
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1568.541,1572.427,"Then it includes everything, of course."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1574.129,1579.349,"I'm not sure if I understand when you say, that would include everything?"
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1587.872,1595.542,"No, but you can always redact whatever it is necessary to preclude identification with a particular taxpayer."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1596.542,1597.558,"Yes, you could."
1987.86-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1598.258,1599.66,--sometimes you've got to take a little bit more off.
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1603.962,1607.766,"--Not always, because if it cannot be reasonably segregated, then it doesn't have to be disclosed."
1987.86-472,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1634.417,1645.975,"Well, why don't you say that you could take an actual return and redact any identifying materials and then give the return to the requester."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1645.975,1648.843,"Your Honor, Congress exempted returns."
1987.86-472,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.843,1654.229,"Well, I know, but you have to read it with the Freedom of Information Act, you tell us."
1987.86-472,0,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1662.334,1669.671,"Because the general prohibition in the Statute, Your Honor, would act as an absolute withholding under the Freedom of Information Act as well."
1987.86-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1685.949,1687.915,"Thank you, Mr. Hertzberg."
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1689.567,1701.375,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1855.757,1857.542,That's because of the Freedom of Information Act?
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1857.542,1861.577,"That's because of the FOIA, there's no requirement for an agency to create a document."
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1879.205,1888.894,"Well, let's suppose that there is a document in the file that's not a return, but by anybody's definition, that document has return information in it?"
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1888.894,1894.548,"Well, the document is return information if it is a document created by the IRS in connection with the determination of liability."
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1894.548,1895.048,Yes.
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1895.048,1898.869,It's not just the numbers but the document itself is return information.
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1898.869,1905.189,"Well, it's got some identifying information in it, and it is return information."
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1915.962,1916.312,No.
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1920.698,1921.582,"Yes, it's just a like a return."
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1925.519,1926.019,Yes.
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1938.077,1940.362,"Well, the statute exempts return information."
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1940.362,1940.862,Right.
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1940.862,1944.148,And just like it does returns.
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1950.968,1951.435,That is our position.
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2074.027,2076.73,Are you defending the Court of Appeals decision in this case?
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2076.73,2077.646,--I think that does it for us.
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2077.646,2078.612,Sir?
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2079.848,2080.331,Yes.
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.3,2082.949,Are you defending--
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2082.949,2086.768,--What they want is redaction of individual taxpayer information.
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.038,2091.322,--Are you defending then the Court of Appeals decision?
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2092.839,2096.041,"I think that was what Judge Scalia, then-Judge Scalia, reasoned."
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2104.195,2105.73,What about the--
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2105.73,2106.897,"--which I'll get to now, if you like."
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2106.897,2108.699,--I was hoping you would get to it.
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2108.699,2117.788,I think the best place to start is from Senator Haskell's introduction of this thing on the floor.
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2121.239,2121.923,"You don't need this argument, do you?"
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2121.923,2122.239,--I'm sorry?
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.239,2124.375,You don't need the reformulation argument?
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2124.375,2132.214,"Well, I think it will inevitably be true that most of the documents covered by that exemption will be reformulated."
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.999,2138.868,Okay.
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2139.151,2140.051,"He said introducing it,"
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.076,2205.593,We've got the language.
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2205.593,2211.313,--We have to kind of come to that last because the language is the most difficult part.
1987.86-472,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2217.217,2223.205,He said the idea was to confirm an existing practice of the IRS?
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2223.205,2224.638,"That seemed to be his intention, exactly."
1987.86-472,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2276.839,2281.808,But it might also be in such a form even though it hadn't been so-called reformulated.
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2281.808,2284.26,"Well, that's right."
1987.86-472,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2299.686,2300.104,Exactly.
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2300.104,2301.604,And not be a compilation.
1987.86-472,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2305.156,2306.192,Right.
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2306.192,2312.512,"Say an agent was auditing somebody who had a bible tax shelter, and he cut out the things in the newspaper, didn't mention the taxpayer, just some article and stuck it in the file."
1987.86-472,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2317.381,2318.583,Right.
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2318.583,2326.404,"But I think that reading should be rejected in favor of Judge Scalia's reformulation test, because of Senator Haskell's remarks."
1987.86-472,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2338.377,2356.273,"Well, but the sponsor also referred to the tax model, and as I understand it, before 1981, at least, the tax model included material that was actual nonaggregated tax return information, and it was routinely furnished."
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2356.273,2358.258,Okay.
1987.86-472,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2508.856,2522.433,Are you saying that the pre-1981 versions of the tax model are reformulated in fact within the meaning of the opinion of the Court of Appeals below?
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2522.433,2523.683,I think.
1987.86-472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2552.202,2552.952,But what if he were wrong?
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2570.763,2574.983,"Well, the tax model we think is covered by the language of the Amendment, because we think it is in a form--"
1987.86-472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2574.983,2576.383,"I mean, it would be even if it were not a compilation."
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2578.935,2582.821,"--Well, because that's what Senator Haskell said his amendment was meant to do was to protect the continuous exposure--"
1987.86-472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2582.821,2583.756,"Well, I understand that."
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2598.933,2600.216,"--Well, the return would not be."
1987.86-472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2600.216,2608.205,"No, but this tax model, which is some thing's used for some other purpose, just happens to be a copy of an anonymous taxpayer's return?"
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2615.875,2616.477,No.
1987.86-472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2620.196,2621.979,--And would be even if it were not a compilation.
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2628.035,2629.768,"You mean if you only had one, rather than 100,000 of these things?"
1987.86-472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2629.768,2630.152,Yeah.
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2630.152,2631.154,Okay.
1987.86-472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2676.099,2678.968,"Yes, but take the other side of the coin."
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2699.631,2700.131,Yes.
1987.86-472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2705.768,2707.085,Why is that?
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2707.085,2710.87,"--Well, that's how we keep our records, basically."
1987.86-472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2749.245,2756.232,"Well, I was thinking of a possible case where copies of those instructions got in one agent's file in connection with his audit work."
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2760.251,2760.803,"Well, theoretically."
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2959.248,2966.236,"Well, I take it they do not say you need to redact a return, and then deliver the rest of the return?"
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2966.236,2969.788,"--Right, but the return may be only one of 70 documents in that file."
1987.86-472,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2969.788,2970.14,Right.
1987.86-472,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2971.806,2984.548,"No, they've agreed... well, they don't highlight it because it's bad for their argument, but they've agreed all along because of the way the statute's drafted, the Haskell Amendment only applies to (b)(2), that is, return information."
1987.86-472,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3143.998,3146.883,"Thank you, Mr. Lauber."
1987.86-472,2,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,3149.502,3164.012,The Baldridge case is fairly illustrative of a different kind of statute and a dispositively different kind of result was reached in that case because the statute itself was a blanket prohibition against the release of census data.
1987.86-472,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3282.804,3285.071,Why doesn't it apply to a return?
1987.86-472,2,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,3285.071,3297.379,"--Your Honor, Congress, for reasons that I cannot discern from the legislative history and which was specifically not referred to by my colleague here, made a distinction between returns and return information in the Statute."
1987.86-472,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3297.379,3301.033,"I know, but return information is also exempt if its identified."
1987.86-472,2,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,3301.033,3303.7,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-472,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3303.7,3304.069,All right.
1987.86-472,2,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,3314.775,3316.543,With a return?
1987.86-472,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3316.543,3317.377,--No.
1987.86-472,2,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,3319.412,3326.582,"Return information because that's exactly what the plain language of the Haskell Amendment... the Haskell Amendment says if it doesn't identify, it's not return information."
1987.86-472,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3326.582,3331.736,"Well, it is identifying in the form that you find it in the file, absolutely identifying, just like the return is."
1987.86-472,2,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,3331.736,3332.586,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-472,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3351.447,3352.883,"Thank you, Mr. Hertzberg."
1987.86-472,3,17245,alfred_wong,,3354.799,3360.601,"The Honorable Court is now adjourned until tomorrow, at 10:00 o'clock."
