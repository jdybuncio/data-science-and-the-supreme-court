1985.85-632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.916,"Thank you gentlemen, the case is submitted."
1985.85-632,0,28424,h_reed_witherby,,43.26,45.129,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1985.85-632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,575.635,578.503,We'll resume there at 1:00 o'clock.
1985.85-632,0,28424,h_reed_witherby,,592.761,594.346,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.85-632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,748.679,749.579,--Very well.
1985.85-632,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,759.385,762.837,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,833.683,838.404,"Yes, but isn't it true that the ""same methodology"" language wasn't in the statute at that time?"
1985.85-632,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,838.404,840.087,It was not.
1985.85-632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.097,859.65,"Of course, that's really the issue, isn't it, whether the ""same methodology"" language has bearing on the spenddown?"
1985.85-632,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,861.467,864.269,"That's ultimately an issue that we get to, that's right."
1985.85-632,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1199.003,1204.907,Mr. Reixach.
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,1204.907,1208.859,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.85-632,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1785.716,1788.834,You say it's not entitled to any particular degree of deference.
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,1796.09,1802.828,"--It's entitled to some weight, but certainly not the degree of controlling weight that would be given to a conference report, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.85-632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1849.09,1850.975,Let me just stop you there.
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,1859.081,1861.867,"--There's a parenthetical listing, which we say simply--"
1985.85-632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1861.867,1862.833,Which includes this provision.
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,1862.833,1863.783,--It includes this provision.
1985.85-632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1919.303,1920.736,Maybe they shouldn't have referred to that statute.
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,1927.825,1933.546,"--Well, we submit that it's not, because, number one, they didn't say they were approving the regulations."
1985.85-632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1967.45,1982.777,"But couldn't one also make the contrary argument, that if they generally thought everything should be done on a one month basis and they listed a regulation that authorized a six month period for determining, how can you say they're disapproving the six month rule?"
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,1984.479,1994.501,"Well, I think that the example of their attempted reaffirmation of regulations issued under another statute indicates that it was perhaps just sloppy wording."
1985.85-632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1994.501,1999.154,"See, because your view, if I understand it correctly, is that one month should apply to everything."
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,2008.944,2010.296,"Well, Your Honor--"
1985.85-632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2010.296,2011.762,Maybe I missed something.
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,2011.762,2030.274,"--of course, what happened here, recall, is that the OBRA changes, the changes for example from quarterly budgeting in SSI to monthly budgeting, had not gone into effect... that particular change had not gone into effect until April 1, 1982."
1985.85-632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2297.042,2299.327,Let me ask you one other question about the legislative history.
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,2308.383,2310.218,"Well, that was his statement, Your Honor."
1985.85-632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2331.132,2333.333,I understand you've given me a hypothetical that that wouldn't fit.
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,2338.921,2342.606,"--I'm not familiar with that page of it, Your Honor."
1985.85-632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2342.606,2344.991,"I didn't find it in his brief, either."
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,2344.991,2347.677,So I really can't speak to that.
1985.85-632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2398.026,2402.828,But it wasn't part of it for your clients.
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,2405.264,2405.614,Yes.
1985.85-632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2405.614,2407.716,--But not for the medically needy people.
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,2407.716,2408.316,That is true.
1985.85-632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2414.67,2422.641,"But Congress must have known that there were states that did use the six month period for medically needy eligibility, didn't they?"
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,2425.26,2426.193,--There were a lot of states that did it.
1985.85-632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2534.146,2535.998,Let me interrupt once more.
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,2551.674,2560.03,I think that they were aware that they were changing the... they were certainly aware that they were changing the cash programs in 1981.
1985.85-632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2560.03,2560.763,"Yes, no question."
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,2560.763,2578.242,"There were certainly aware in 1982, and based on the legislative history, that they were linking, re-linking, if you will, the Medicaid program to the eligibility determination process for the cash programs."
1985.85-632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2579.942,2582.877,But you still haven't told me whether you think they're aware of the issue in this case.
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,2582.877,2587.347,"--Whether they were aware of this precise issue, I can't say that they were, Justice Stevens."
1985.85-632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2670.335,2671.835,"Counsel, I must have missed something."
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,2681.225,2696.068,"--Prior to 1981, Justice O'Connor, the statute had language in it in Section (a)(10) referring to eligibility according to standards promulgated by the Secretary."
1985.85-632,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2846.283,2849.049,May I interrupt you just long enough to ask this question.
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,2855.389,2860.357,We rely on changes in the statutes in 1981 and in 1982.
1985.85-632,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2860.357,2860.774,Right.
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,2860.774,2863.543,The change to monthly eligibility in 1981.
1985.85-632,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2863.543,2864.328,Let me just follow up.
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,2878.652,2879.854,"They are, Your Honor."
1985.85-632,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2879.854,2880.92,And I wondered what your argument is.
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,2880.92,2892.312,"Well, Your Honor, our argument is that the Hogan case in the First Circuit and the De Jesus case in the Second Circuit are incorrect, that they applied the wrong analysis."
1985.85-632,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2983.068,2987.789,"In order to rule with you, do we have to say that Judge Friendly was wrong?"
1985.85-632,2,40293,rene_h_reixach_jr,,2987.789,2993.36,"In order to rule with me, I'm afraid you might have to do that."
1985.85-632,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3010.52,3013.738,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Witherby?"
1985.85-632,3,28424,h_reed_witherby,,3013.738,3015.255,A few brief points.
1985.85-632,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3141.571,3144.171,"Thank you, gentlemen."
