2004.04-5928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.536,"We'll hear argument now in No. 04-5928, Jose Medellin versus Doug Dretke."
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,68.444,75.187,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2004.04-5928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,115.049,119.665,Ordinarily do not think of that as covered in this Court.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,119.665,133.471,"--Well, the Court of Criminal Appeals did not specify; but we find, of course, ourselves in an unusual posture, in the sense that the sequence of events here are such that even... the Court of Appeals has decided the Avena judgement claim, the Court has--"
2004.04-5928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,133.471,136.098,"But has this Court ever just said,"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,141.829,144.355,"--Well, it's an... it is, in fact, an unusual posture."
2004.04-5928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.648,149.847,"I mean, it would be more likely that we would dismiss this, improvidently granted."
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,149.847,154.945,"--Well, the case, though, has not been improvidently granted, with the greatest respect to the Court."
2004.04-5928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.206,188.197,"Well, it's so odd, because usually what happens, if there is something that could occur at the state court level, is the state court itself would hold off until this Court had resolved whatever the case was."
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,191.29,195.362,"We recognize that it's an unusual request, because of the unusual circumstances."
2004.04-5928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,203.423,214.992,"Well, I think... I think granting a stay could be seen as validating the position of the government without ever having an opinion on it."
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,214.992,220.996,"--Well, actually, I think that a stay would actually show respect to each of the relevant actors here."
2004.04-5928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,221.729,224.923,"Well, why shouldn't we just go ahead and decide the case, if we can?"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,224.923,243.461,"--Well, we believe that there are, in fact, firm grounds on which this Court could grant... could decide the question presented, because, in fact, for the reasons... there are really three points here... for the reasons we've laid out, the Court, under the direct command of the Supremacy Clause, has... can give effect to the Avena judgement as the rule of decision."
2004.04-5928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,313.762,316.941,How about the creation of a private right of action?
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,316.941,323.557,"Well, there is a... there is a... there are basically three objections that the Respondents made."
2004.04-5928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,354.012,358.571,"Well, the courts... the courts usually do that, don't they?"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,358.571,359.948,That's exactly right.
2004.04-5928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,373.323,375.749,That doesn't speak to the private right of action--
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,375.749,386.301,"--The private right of action is found here in the habeas statute itself, which provides that a person in custody in violation of laws, treaties, or the Constitution of the United States can seek--"
2004.04-5928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,386.301,394.73,"So, presumably, that could provide some cause of action, quite irrespective of the ICJ decision."
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,394.73,399.345,"--Well, it could... it... the cause of action is, itself, provided by--"
2004.04-5928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.345,399.736,"Yeah, I mean, you don't--"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,399.736,399.961,--the rest of the--
2004.04-5928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.961,405.135,--you don't really have to get into whether that judgement is enforceable here.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,405.913,406.096,--Well--
2004.04-5928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,406.096,410.024,--we could look at... look at it from the perspective of the habeas statute.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,410.024,410.889,"--Well, that's right."
2004.04-5928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,413.978,445.214,"But is it right... I mean, you couldn't... you could not... unless the ICJ decision gave a right to an individual, and you had no claim under the federal habeas statute... and it is unusual, is it not, for a judgement of the International Court of Justice to recognize the right of an individual, as opposed to being just a judgement between nations?"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,445.214,454.379,"--Well, it may be that, because of the character of the typical dispute that the International Court of Justice hears, that it does not typically address such a question."
2004.04-5928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,469.373,480.777,"How many... how many times has the ICJ held that, that a treaty, apart from being contract between the signers, confers individual rights?"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,480.777,487.114,"--Well, it has, of course, held, in... first, in LaGrand and then here in Avena."
2004.04-5928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,510.542,512.418,But there was no individual in that case.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,520.162,525.493,"--But, in fact, in that case the United States did assert the rights of its nationals who were held hostage."
2004.04-5928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,529.999,547.492,"Well, that's what I asked, if this... I know that, certainly in the context of the Vienna Convention, there have been the series of decisions you mentioned; but I was wondering whether, outside the Vienna Convention, there has been any similar judgement of the ICJ that operates directly on individuals."
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,547.492,557.978,"--Well, for example, in the Barcelona Traction case, which is another case where, again, there were rights of a particular company and a particular national decided with... under the guise of diplomatic protection."
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,601.925,619.532,"Do you think... do you think that the President can enter into a treaty, with the approval of Congress, that would provide that, in a particular combat, the Commander in Chief will be somebody other than the President of the United States?"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,619.532,629.35,"--Well, the Court has recognized that the only limitations of the treaty-making power are affirmative litigations... affirmative limitations within the Constitution, itself."
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.35,629.702,Right.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,629.702,630.301,And if--
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,630.301,636.677,"And you think that the Constitution provides the President shall be Commander in Chief, and, therefore, that can't be given away."
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,636.677,637.604,--Well--
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,637.604,637.9,Right?
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,637.9,641.525,"--no, the... obviously, a treaty would not be able to amend the Constitution."
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,641.525,641.723,Right.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,657.87,663.579,"Well, a treaty would not be... this treaty does not do that."
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,664.974,669.335,It does if we're bound by the determination of Avena.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,677.961,692.902,"--Well, but the... but the Court has... it... the Court has regularly... and it has never been an objection to Article III power to give effect to a judgement that has been rendered in another sphere by another adjudicatory authority."
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,694.879,697.224,Not a question concerning United States law.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,697.224,698.47,--But this is a question--
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,698.47,704.76,"You're talking here about a question of United States law, What is the meaning of this treaty that the United States has entered into?"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,715.781,724.445,"--Well, what the Court would be giving effect to is the determination by the political branches themselves to enter into the treaty."
2004.04-5928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,724.445,735.79,"Well, I have a question that is much along the same lines, whether this Court must apply Avena as the rule of decision, or perhaps say,"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,748.402,751.104,"Well, the treaty does take effect as American law."
2004.04-5928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,751.445,751.735,"And, can--"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,751.735,752.087,--in fact--
2004.04-5928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,752.087,756.517,"--is it open in this case to... for this Court to apply that, not Avena?"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,756.517,759.459,"--Well, the Court could, in fact, apply the treaty."
2004.04-5928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,765.805,766.788,Is that open in this case?
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,766.788,771.146,"--Well, it surely would be open in this case, but it would not be open at this point."
2004.04-5928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,786.421,788.252,"Well, suppose we think it can't control?"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,790.756,797.832,"--Well, if the... if the Court decided that the Avena judgement did not control, then it would obviously go to the terms of the treaty itself."
2004.04-5928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,810.467,815.249,"Well, can the President give an interpretation of the treaty unilaterally that is binding on us?"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,825.719,828.501,"--Well, the Court has--"
2004.04-5928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,828.501,828.929,Can he do that?
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,828.929,836.621,"--Well, no, the treaty... the Court has traditionally accorded deference to the Executive's determination, but has not... has not given that--"
2004.04-5928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,836.621,836.885,Right.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,847.765,859.42,"--Because it's not just the President that's done that; it's the treaty-makers, it's the President acting with the advice and consent of the Senate in a context in which they are empowered to authorize a treaty... enter into a treaty."
2004.04-5928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,860.09,864.643,"Well, is the constitutionality of the President's action here before the Court in this case?"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,864.643,866.642,"--Well, the--"
2004.04-5928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,866.642,867.556,Only peripherally.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,870.582,871.911,--The question that we'd ask--
2004.04-5928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,871.911,873.114,I hadn't thought so.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,874.274,879.523,"--Well, the... we've asked that the Court take account of the President's determination in this respect."
2004.04-5928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,932.266,932.769,What's the case--
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,932.769,932.957,--on the Respondent's--
2004.04-5928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,932.957,947.169,"--what's the case that you're citing for this proposition, that the President and the Senate can, in effect, confer on an international tribunal the obligation to bind this Court with reference to an interpretation of a treaty?"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,949.351,952.669,"--Well, it goes to the Supremacy Clause itself, Justice Kennedy."
2004.04-5928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,953.322,955.09,So you're telling me you don't have a case.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,955.09,960.525,"--Well, I'm not suggesting that there is direct precedent in this Court for this circumstance."
2004.04-5928,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,965.194,977.468,Were you saying 51-case set?
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,992.984,995.535,"--Well, he has, in fact, come--"
2004.04-5928,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,995.535,996.395,"Is that right, or not?"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,996.395,996.892,"--Well, that's right."
2004.04-5928,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1001.591,1021.341,"Well, if it is... what I'm wondering is if this is similar to that insurance case out of California, where, in fact, we gave considerable deference to Mr. Eisenstat's interpretation of the relationship of the treaty to the insurance laws of California."
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1021.341,1022.653,"Well, it... that is true."
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1023.695,1028.319,"That was not an interpretation that ousted this Court of jurisdiction over the matter, though, was it?"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1028.319,1029.032,"--Well, the--"
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1029.032,1030.279,Don't you think that's a little bit different?
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1030.279,1033.157,"--But the Garamendi case did, in fact, endorse the President's power."
2004.04-5928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1034.679,1046.723,"--Yes, but in that case it was overseeing arrangements that were made by our government, not... they didn't have that much local authority."
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1046.723,1056.562,"--Well, that's... that is a distinction in the cases, but they still come down to a notion that... both Garamendi and Dames & Moore... to the President's authority to give effect to international obligations."
2004.04-5928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1056.562,1057.056,"Well, but--"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1057.056,1057.507,And here we have--
2004.04-5928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1057.507,1062.618,"--doesn't the President, in Dames & Moore, enter into an agreement with Iran?"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1062.618,1064.682,"--Well, that's right."
2004.04-5928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1074.437,1079.895,"But we decided, in Dames & Moore, that he was acting pursuant to the agreement."
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1079.895,1086.5,"--Well, they did act pursuant to the agreement, and that's what the Court decided, but that's precisely what the President is doing here."
2004.04-5928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1095.591,1096.456,But we didn't--
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1096.456,1096.635,So if--
2004.04-5928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1096.635,1101.75,"--we didn't decide it on the basis that President Reagan says,"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1106.27,1112.516,"--That's true, but... and the Court looked at the... the Court did not reexamine the terms of the agreement."
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1123.455,1134.005,That doesn't... that doesn't involve an interpretation of the treaty that is rendered by somebody else and that is binding upon this Court.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1150.419,1156.519,The treaty itself is what the United States has committed itself to.
2004.04-5928,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1159.097,1162.979,We have to look beyond the President's interpretation of the treaty.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1192.862,1205.248,"--Well, that's precisely why we've said, in fact, what... there are two independent sources of authority here, because, by operation of the Supremacy Clause, the ICJ, the interpretation and application of the Avena judgement would be given effect."
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1209.075,1211.556,Except that the President doesn't think that the remedy is in federal habeas.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1215.157,1220.614,"Well, the President has said that it should be given effect, and hasn't... and hasn't said that it shouldn't be in federal habeas."
2004.04-5928,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1224.636,1243.893,"Well, your position, I take it, is that if somehow we follow your suggestion so that the President's suggestion may be put into effect in the state courts, that there would still be a habeas jurisdiction, ultimately, over the result if you're dissatisfied with what happens in Texas."
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1245.025,1245.895,"That's right, there would be--"
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1245.895,1246.104,"Now, that--"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1246.104,1247.468,--there would surely be habeas jurisdiction.
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.468,1248.488,--that's an interesting question.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1274.662,1279.822,"Well, at this point, of course, the Court need not address that question on this... on this petition."

2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1285.137,1286.121,--question would be answered without--
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1286.121,1292.911,"--that question to be a jurisdictional question, as far as the lower court is concerned; and, therefore, I think it's a jurisdictional question for us."
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1292.911,1298.587,"--Well, of course, for the reasons we've laid out in our brief, we do not regard it as jurisdictional for this Court."
2004.04-5928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1304.238,1304.603,"No, no."
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1304.603,1305.171,But even if it--
2004.04-5928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1305.171,1305.743,No.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1313.038,1314.355,"--No, but--"
2004.04-5928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1314.355,1314.959,"You don't say,"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1317.878,1318.582,--But this--
2004.04-5928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1318.582,1318.772,See?
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1322.377,1326.789,--But the COA is a jurisdictional requirement for an appeal in the Court of Appeals.
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1330.765,1331.221,"Yes, but--"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1331.221,1332.323,--and on a petition from that.
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1332.323,1333.521,--Do you know of any--
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1333.521,1334.12,"And so, the question raised by--"
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1334.12,1346.986,"--do you know of any case in which a lower court did not have jurisdiction, but we do have jurisdiction on appeal from in a... from a court that didn't have jurisdiction?"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1346.986,1355.139,--But the Court... the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to entertain an application for Certificate of Appealability.
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1361.56,1362.083,"Well, if the--"
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1362.083,1362.504,And in that posture--
2004.04-5928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.504,1363.305,--had jurisdiction to--
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1363.305,1364.851,--the Court can decide the question presented.
2004.04-5928,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1364.851,1370.146,You're simply saying that any court has jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1387.274,1411.368,"Well, first of all, we believe that in the posture that this case comes to this Court, there has been a substantial denial of a constitutional right, even in the terms that Texas defines the statute, because what we have here is a claim based on the Avena judgement... I mean, the ICJ's interpretation and application of the Avena judgement that the Court of Appeals held in effect that had been defaulted prior to its coming into existence."
2004.04-5928,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1425.775,1426.671,So you're saying the--
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1426.671,1427.095,--That is--
2004.04-5928,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1427.095,1430.243,--the constitutional violation is the violation of the Supremacy Clause.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1430.243,1431.091,"--Well, in that--"
2004.04-5928,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1431.091,1431.658,Is that what you're saying?
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1431.658,1435.54,"--Well, it's a violation here of both the Due Process Clause and the Supremacy Clause."
2004.04-5928,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1436.065,1436.933,Due Process Clause because?
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1436.933,1444.972,"--Because it was an arbitrary denial of a forum in which to hear the Avena judgement claim, not simply the... a different source of right."
2004.04-5928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1470.764,1471.459,How do you answer--
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1471.459,1471.976,In addition it's a violation--
2004.04-5928,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1471.976,1497.179,"--the related... the related question that... well, assuming the Vienna Convention is certainly law, and treaty stands on the same footing as law, but I believe that the... Texas and the Government have said the AEDPA statute is the later-in-time provision, and when you have two provisions with a statute treaty, the later-in-time prevails."
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1507.903,1517.075,"--With respect to this claim, AEDPA itself would be, in our view, ousted by The Charming Betsey Principle."
2004.04-5928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1532.602,1536.745,And you're talking about denial of a right that didn't exist.
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1540.67,1541.338,"Well, that's--"
2004.04-5928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1541.338,1543.682,"If the right didn't exist, it should have been denied."
2004.04-5928,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1543.682,1565.382,"--And perhaps... but the effect of that... and perhaps a more prudent way to put it is that the effect of that is to deny Mr. Medellin a forum, an... arbitrarily deny him a forum on the effect of the Avena judgement, because the effect was to deny the Avena judgement claim based on a procedural default before the Avena judgement had been rendered."
2004.04-5928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1567.814,1569.82,"Very well, Mr. Donovan."
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1572.07,1578.647,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-5928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1590.851,1592.38,"They really are interesting, you know."
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1593.104,1594.527,"They are, indeed."
2004.04-5928,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1613.251,1613.632,Before we--
2004.04-5928,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1613.632,1613.875,Can that--
2004.04-5928,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1613.875,1614.291,--before we--
2004.04-5928,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1614.291,1614.984,--be waived?
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1620.186,1624.425,"Justice O'Connor, Texas did not explicitly waive this ground before the Fifth Circuit--"
2004.04-5928,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1624.425,1627.933,"But it wasn't raised in the Fifth Circuit by Texas, was it?"
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1627.933,1629.711,"--That's correct, it was not."
2004.04-5928,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1630.263,1634.353,"And I assume, although we haven't so decided, that that can just be waived."
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1634.353,1639.954,"--Well, this Court has characterized the standards for a COA as jurisdictional in a threshold inquiry."
2004.04-5928,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1639.954,1642.294,--But this is also a jurisdictional.
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1686.602,1693.674,"Justice Breyer, there are alternative jurisdictional grounds this Court could address, but the COA ground is straightforward."
2004.04-5928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1720.927,1731.169,"Well, of course, we wouldn't even have to venture into... possibly have to venture into this issue of law if Texas were interested in following the determination of the President."
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1747.54,1759.415,"--We do not believe the Court should stay this action, because whatever the resolution of the subsequent proceedings that are now filed in Texas, the resolution of that question will not control the federal-law questions here."
2004.04-5928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1759.415,1764.998,"Well, but does Texas have a position in response to the President's determination?"
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1764.998,1770.505,"Our first position would be, as Justice O'Connor said, that that question is not presented in this case."
2004.04-5928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1774.113,1778.978,You said... you said that something has started in the Texas courts.
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1789.622,1806.828,"Justice Ginsburg, this weekend, Medellin filed a subsequent state habeas application with the Court of Criminal Appeals, in which he asked the Court of Criminal Appeals to stay its hand, pending this Court's decision whether this Court should stay its hand, pending the Court of Criminal Appeals' resolution--"
2004.04-5928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1812.475,1818.188,"And after the Texas court stays its hand, then what action is asked?"
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1818.188,1830.406,"--Well, what it asks for is to authorize a subsequent state habeas proceeding based upon the President's determination, which he characterizes as the predicate for a new claim."
2004.04-5928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1837.646,1840.63,"Well, but we don't... we may not reach that, if Texas says,"
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1847.764,1856.729,"With respect to whether the presidential determination is authorized, any... that matter will be resolved in subsequent state court litigation."
2004.04-5928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1858.493,1862.667,"Well, I'm sure it will be, but does Texas have a position on that, at this point?"
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1862.667,1875.599,"--We would respectfully submit, as would any responsible state attorney general, that there are significant constitutional problems with a unilateral Executive determination displacing generally applicable criminal laws."
2004.04-5928,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1883.011,1887.188,"Well, that was my next... my question, and it follows on the question Justice Souter asked."
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1899.568,1906.933,There absolutely are Texas procedures in which the question of the validity of the President's determination can be litigated.
2004.04-5928,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1909.43,1909.699,But that--
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1909.699,1910.033,--and resolved--
2004.04-5928,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1910.033,1915.799,"--Yeah, that's what I'm trying... I'm trying to get to, which is, What is actually the practical thing to do now?"
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1978.454,1980.211,--Whatever the resolution--
2004.04-5928,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1980.211,1980.713,What do you think?
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1981.29,1982.988,--I do not believe the Court should stay it.
2004.04-5928,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1986.836,1988.855,"Well, why do you believe we shouldn't stay it?"
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1989.471,1990.404,--I don't believe the Court should--
2004.04-5928,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1990.404,1991.35,"--as an opinion, it's based on what?"
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1991.35,2008.959,"--Because whatever the resolution in the State Court litigation, the resolution of that question will not impact the legal question before this Court now, which is, on first federal habeas, a claim that was filed that did not rely on Avena when it was filed, did not rely on the presidential determination--"
2004.04-5928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2008.959,2015.019,"Yes, but is it not true that it's entirely possible that the Texas proceeding would make this issue moot--"
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2015.019,2016.625,--That is true.
2004.04-5928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2016.625,2020.901,"--and, therefore, avoid the necessity for deciding a lot of very difficult questions?"
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2020.901,2022.186,That is true.
2004.04-5928,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2028.066,2037.607,"And is it also true that, in the Texas proceedings, they necessarily would involve a federal question on which this Court could, if it chose, grant certiorari on direct review?"
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2037.607,2038.65,Absolutely.
2004.04-5928,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.625,2077.078,--Is the question... how difficult is the question?
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2104.783,2119.567,"We would agree that the fact that the President has acted underscores the point made by both Texas and the United States, that the responsibility for determining the remedy to the Avena judgement is found in the political branches."
2004.04-5928,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2137.784,2146.314,"Well, Mr. Cruz, maybe the treaty becomes part of federal law if it's properly ratified and signed, as this one was."
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2161.459,2164.057,"--Justice O'Connor, that's--"
2004.04-5928,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2164.057,2164.677,Isn't that right?
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2164.677,2166.31,"--that's absolutely correct, that this Court--"
2004.04-5928,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2166.31,2177.207,"I mean, it would be open to this Court, presumably, to say, that treaty became part of federal law when it was ratified, and Congress can enact subsequent laws."
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2185.196,2191.473,"--To be sure, this Court could certainly determine that the Vienna Convention gives rises to the individual rights."
2004.04-5928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2211.663,2213.878,Did the Breard case speak to that issue?
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2213.878,2219.225,"--The Breard case simply made reference to... that there was, arguably, individual rights."
2004.04-5928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2255.088,2273.944,"Well, if we came to the conclusion that the treaty, by its own force, did not create enforceable individual rights, then we would have to get to the question of whether the President's proclamation changes that result."
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2273.944,2289.899,"Only in the most threshold sense; because, on its face, the President's proclamation, or determination, is focused only on state courts, and what the President says is that he has determined that the Avena decision will have binding effect in state courts."
2004.04-5928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2297.598,2308.301,"But that seems to be topsy-turvy, that a treaty would have effect in state courts but not in federal court."
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2308.301,2314.324,--We don't disagree that the Executive could have chosen other avenues.
2004.04-5928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2330.283,2337.026,But isn't what the President's memorandum says exactly what the Avena judgement said?
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2380.131,2386.831,"Well, certainly under the terms of the President's order, where the President said that he's determined it shall... should be given effect, quote,"
2004.04-5928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.89,2421.7,"But, Mr. Cruz, let me just make a suggestion."
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2449.13,2464.9,"Respectfully, if we were to lose, and if Medellin were to prevail, his position could potentially open the door to the reconsideration of the over 100 foreign nationals that are on death row across this country, and, beyond that, to thousands--"
2004.04-5928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2464.9,2466.156,"Well, so could the President's order, the same thing."
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2466.156,2470.27,"--But the President's order is, by its term, confined to the 51 Mexican nationals."
2004.04-5928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2478.953,2481.93,"But that can't be, in light of the United States' most recent action."
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2486.696,2487.255,--Fifty-one.
2004.04-5928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2487.255,2487.727,Okay.
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2490.558,2493.324,That's true with respect to the Executive determination.
2004.04-5928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2509.254,2521.199,"But this... but if there's a claim here based on the Avena judgement, it is that the United States agreed to the ICJ's jurisdiction in Vienna Convention cases."
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2535.37,2553.58,"But Medellin's theory that Avena should be applied as a binding rule of judgement, even without subsequent proceedings before the ICJ, could be taken to support granting habeas relief in other proceedings for individuals whose cases weren't litigated, particularly given that the ICJ in Avena purports--"
2004.04-5928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2553.58,2565.832,"Well, you have to... you have to recognize that there is a distinction between this case, which is, in large part, based on a judgement of the ICJ, and other cases that would not have the benefit of that judgement."
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2565.832,2566.494,--Surely.
2004.04-5928,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2582.811,2596.397,"Why isn't this... the United States did consent to the jurisdiction of the ICJ in these Vienna Convention cases, and that tribunal issued a judgement."
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2603.724,2612.071,"Under the terms of the applicable treaties, the ICJ has jurisdiction to determine, as a matter of international law, if there is a treaty breach."
2004.04-5928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2680.318,2685.594,"Well, what difference does that make, since this... the issue to which it is addressed has not been raised either?"
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2694.931,2697.966,He might conceivably have brought a due-process claim.
2004.04-5928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2712.109,2723.621,"Well, I can understand the argument, that he shouldn't be allowed to raise due process here if the argument also goes to your... the permissibility of your raising 2253."
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2723.621,2724.722,But 225--
2004.04-5928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2724.722,2725.528,What's sauce for the goose--
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2725.528,2729.354,--but 2253 is a jurisdictional bar to this Court.
2004.04-5928,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2729.354,2729.718,--Okay.
2004.04-5928,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2734.539,2736.348,Because he didn't bring that case.
2004.04-5928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2763.8,2766.685,"Thank you, Mr. Cruz."
2004.04-5928,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2769.022,2774.408,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-5928,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2794.243,2803.206,Have there been any cases in the Circuits holding that the state can waive the jurisdictional limitation on COA?
2004.04-5928,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2803.206,2814.443,"There have been cases in the Circuits, Justice Kennedy, that have held that once a COA has issued, the Court of Appeals may consider a claim that would otherwise be beyond the jurisdiction of the courts."
2004.04-5928,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2829.342,2832.829,But is their whole question of the COA waivable?
2004.04-5928,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2832.829,2838.364,"I don't think so, Justice O'Connor, because a COA is a jurisdictional requirement."
2004.04-5928,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2918.929,2926.132,"Mr. Dreeben, could this question of the effect of the Avena Treaty be brought before the Court?"
2004.04-5928,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2948.519,2989.682,"I do think that the Court would have the option of availing itself of extraordinary jurisdiction, but, as the Court made clear in the Felker case, its exercise of extraordinary original writs would be informed by the limitations that the AEDPA imposes upon the grant of habeas corpus relief; and, therefore, the Court should look to at least the additional jurisdictional obstacle that the United States and Texas has raised; and, namely, that is that the decision that the Texas courts raised... issued in this case is not contrary to any Supreme Court decision or a misapplication of any clearly established federal law."
2004.04-5928,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2989.682,2992.122,So all those are... there are a lot of reasons.
2004.04-5928,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3031.414,3037.821,"Justice Breyer, I do not think that the Court should hold the case, pending the outcome of the Texas proceedings."
2004.04-5928,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3037.821,3038.02,Because?
2004.04-5928,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3038.02,3042.214,The Texas proceedings can consider the Avena claim and the claim in reliance--
2004.04-5928,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3042.214,3054.108,"Yeah, but suppose you lose... see, I'm thinking, suppose you lose in the Texas proceeding, it comes here, and, for whatever reason, suppose you lost again... you might not, but you might... in which case, then what do we do?"
2004.04-5928,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3054.108,3059.036,"--Well, the Supreme Court would have the option of granting cert to review whatever the Texas courts--"
2004.04-5928,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3059.036,3060.522,"No, no, but suppose we thought they were right?"
2004.04-5928,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3069.92,3096.09,"--I think it would be close to issuing an advisory opinion for the Court to decide an important issue of federal law in which there is a clear jurisdictional bar to the issuance of a Certificate of Appealability, and I don't think that a treatise creates enough of a doubt that AEDPA, means ""constitutional"" for this Court to embark on a wide-ranging exploration of potentially very significant issues with constitutional overtones."
2004.04-5928,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3176.602,3186.855,"Well, is, though, a treaty that's been duly ratified and signed enforceable as part of our federal law, as this one is drafted?"
2004.04-5928,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3186.855,3194.836,"--It is, Justice O'Connor, but it should... properly construed as not conferring privately-enforceable rights on a criminal defendant in a criminal case."
2004.04-5928,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3223.348,3232.959,"Mr. Dreeben, how many... how many states are we talking about for these 51 individuals involved in the case?"
2004.04-5928,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3234.827,3237.957,"--I'm not sure of the exact number, Justice Scalia."
2004.04-5928,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3259.948,3262.799,"It's conceivable that those five or six states could say,"
2004.04-5928,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3271.395,3273.118,That is absolutely correct.
2004.04-5928,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3327.205,3327.792,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2004.04-5928,3,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,3332.108,3334.834,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.04-5928,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3620.336,3620.677,"Thank you, Mr. Donovan."
