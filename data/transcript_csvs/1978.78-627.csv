1978.78-627,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,80.843,"We'll hear arguments next in 627, Dayton Board of Education against Brinkman."
1978.78-627,0,20882,david_c_greer,,84.356,85.409,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.78-627,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,369.675,378.289,"Now the District Court, on remand of this case, Judge Rubin found that there wasn't a system-wide violation, didn't he?"
1978.78-627,0,20882,david_c_greer,,378.289,379.679,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.78-627,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,379.679,384.201,"And he ultimately dismissed the case, didn't he?"
1978.78-627,0,20882,david_c_greer,,384.201,386.422,He dismissed the case flat..
1978.78-627,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,386.981,393.203,Did he find any specific isolated constitutional violations?
1978.78-627,0,20882,david_c_greer,,393.203,395.96,"In three areas, he did."
1978.78-627,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,418.812,419.379,Only?
1978.78-627,0,20882,david_c_greer,,419.379,421.039,Only.
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1428.048,1432.645,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1498.718,1505.947,And what were the District Court's findings on the 1972 situation again?
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1510.535,1517.487,The District Court found no extant condition requiring a constitutional remedy.
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1517.487,1518.942,It found no violation.
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1518.942,1522.132,"It found no -- no, well, it found violations."
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1522.132,1525.676,"No violation as of the time of the lawsuit, didn't it?"
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1525.676,1527.028,"Well, I'm not exactly sure."
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1532.73,1533.894,"Had been, had been?"
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1533.894,1535.492,But none had any --
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1535.492,1536.387,At the time of the lawsuit.
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1536.387,1538.189,-- continuing effect at the time of the lawsuit.
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1538.938,1542.461,And it -- I -- would seem to me would have to have found that to dismiss the complaint.
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1542.461,1549.102,"That -- I think that's at least implicit, if not explicit, in the District Court's opinion."
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1572.603,1574.765,And that had taken place when?
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1574.765,1578.006,Between 1912 and 1954 and during that period --
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1578.006,1580.041,That's (Voice Overlap) period.
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1580.041,1581.029,I'm sorry?
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1581.029,1584.629,It -- some time between that -- in those some 40 years --
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1584.629,1586.354,The --
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1586.354,1587.108,42 years --
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1587.108,1595.073,These schools were converted as a need arose to segregate and confine the black population as the black population grew.
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1615.94,1616.531,And this process --
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1616.531,1617.458,And this process was repeated.
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1617.458,1619.382,It went over a 42-year-period.
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1619.382,1625.809,"That's correct, and these schools were full-blown state imposed segregative schools at the time of Brown."
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1625.809,1636.912,"I'm not stating -- I mean, not the State of Ohio, technically because the State of Ohio since the 1880s had prohibited precisely what you tell us that Dayton was doing, isn't that correct?"
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1636.912,1638.164,"I cannot agree with that, Your Honor."
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1638.211,1639.121,As a matter of the students?
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1639.121,1644.343,The State of Ohio acting through its agency with jurisdiction over this problem --
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1644.343,1645.135,How about acting through its legislature.
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1645.135,1647.88,"Imposed -- not acting through its legislature, but if --"
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1647.88,1653.285,Hadn't it been the law of Ohio that these things were illegal that you told us?
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1653.285,1653.538,That's correct.
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1653.538,1654.614,That's what I thought.
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1654.614,1657.573,That's correct.
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1699.664,1718.334,"Well, all of these things that you've told us happened in spades in those -- in those -- that region of the country where the legislatures required them to happen, and does that mean that school districts in those areas of the country are always going to be carnivorous, will always be tainted by their historic illegal unconstitutional action?"
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1718.334,1724.434,"Your Honor, I -- it will be until they've done something to undo this horrendous wrong that they've committed."
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1738.887,1745.874,"Mr. Caldwell, you say -- what you're trying to convince us of -- but ordinarily we don't sit as finders of fact."
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1745.874,1755.711,I should've said what the Court of Appeals found was that they had committed that same wrong and therefore under the same constitutional duty.
1978.78-627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1755.711,1758.448,Of course there we come back to what has been mentioned before.
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1766.436,1772.689,The -- I was curious about that question in the Columbus case.
1978.78-627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1782.795,1789.419,"Or if you're sending the case back with some instructions, is that not, more often than ever?"
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1789.419,1801.73,"I -- in -- as I read the clearly erroneous decisions, they almost always -- the Appellate Court arrives at a judgment unless there's some other issue aside from the clearly erroneous findings of fact at issue."
1978.78-627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1802.994,1810.599,"These are -- the cases you're talking about are usually cases where you have a single issue or two issues, not a whole maze of issues, isn't that so?"
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1810.599,1811.622,"Oh, I don't think so."
1978.78-627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1831.764,1833.911,You're not speaking of the more recent --
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1833.911,1834.703,Not the more recent U.S. versus Jefferson.
1978.78-627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1834.703,1836.747,"-- no, U.S.-Jefferson."
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1836.747,1838.415,The 1948 decision.
1978.78-627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1838.415,1871.707,"Mr. Caldwell, in your submission, I believe and I'm confident that it's the case in your counterpart's -- your colleague's submission in the Columbus case, the school board after a finding of a violation is entitled to shoulder the burden of proof that the violation did not cause an incremental segregative effect so as to be system-wide, is that correct?"
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1871.707,1873.316,That's correct.
1978.78-627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1874.696,1875.206,Yes.
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1875.206,1876.163,-- bearing that burden.
1978.78-627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1876.163,1897.372,"Since Judge Rubin found there was no violation here presumably there was never any hearing at all on remedy and -- so, shouldn't the Court of Appeals at the very least, even under its own hypothesis, have sent the case back to the District Court so that the school board could've been heard on the issue of remedy?"
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1897.372,1912.414,Ordinarily that would be the case in the situation where a school board was making the assertion that it wanted to meet its burden of showing that the system-wide violation had less impact than intended.
1978.78-627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1923.307,1933.261,I thought -- I understood your opponent to argue at some length that the violations -- whatever violations existed were not system-wide.
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1933.261,1937.693,That is his contention Your Honor.
1978.78-627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1949.636,1955.272,You regard those as two separate stages of the proceeding.
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1955.272,1961.88,"Well, I think it depends on the circumstances of each case perhaps whether you have a separate inquiry."
1978.78-627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1973.01,1992.264,Wouldn't you a school board counsel in this case after succeeding in getting your -- the complaint dismissed in the District Court on the violation issue have been somewhat surprised by a Court of Appeals decision which not only said there was a violation and we now impose this remedy?
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,1992.264,2008.856,Not in this case Your Honor because in the Court of Appeals we challenged the board to point out any part of the remedy which it thought was excessive if we were right about the violation.
1978.78-627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2020.677,2025.623,But isn't that something the District Court in the first instance?
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2025.623,2038.579,Not if the school board is not making the contention and if the school board were to make that contention or had made it in the Court of Appeals I would agree that the ordinary course would be to send it back for a hearing on that issue.
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2173.096,2181.724,"Wouldn't it be true in almost every big city in the United States, New York or Chicago?"
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2181.724,2183.559,"It -- would what be true Your Honor, I'm sorry."
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2183.559,2188.41,That there was a great deal of de facto concentration of one race or another in various schools?
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2188.41,2191.752,"Well, I -- in my case, I'm talking about de jure concentration."
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2197.269,2209.928,"In New York City, if every time they build a new school in Harlem, I suppose, it could be reasonably anticipated that that would be populated a 100% by Negro children, couldn't it?"
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2209.928,2211.32,"Oh, it's certainly possible."
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2216.086,2216.989,"No, I don't either."
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2216.989,2219.102,Although there had been some school boards --
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2219.102,2225.281,It just occurred to me that what you're telling us was probably characteristic of every sizable city in the United States.
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2225.281,2227.636,"Well, if it is Your Honor, it's a sad state of affairs because --"
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2227.636,2228.253,"Well, I --"
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2228.253,2233.496,Because these people did the same thing that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education did.
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2233.496,2235.893,Perhaps so.
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2235.893,2235.915,And this should be (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2235.915,2244.198,"The issue in this case is whether or not there was a constitutional violation at the time the lawsuit was brought and if so, what the appropriate remedy should be."
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2244.198,2245.87,"I'd -- what was the first part of your question, I didn't --"
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2245.87,2251.32,"Whether or not there was a constitutional violation and if so, and only if so, what the appropriate remedy should be?"
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2251.32,2256.717,At -- this system that was -- that existed at the time of Brown was expanded --
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2256.717,2258.148,"No, no, at the time of this lawsuit."
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2258.148,2261.25,-- expanded and maintained throughout that period.
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2314.608,2316.458,And when did this happen?
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2316.458,2323.957,This policy was in effect from 1951 until 1969 when HEW intervened pursuant to Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2323.957,2333.9,"So, that situation didn't itself exist apart from the vestiges of its effects but it didn't itself exist at the time the lawsuit was brought."
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2333.9,2335.499,But it -- but its vestiges --
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2335.499,2335.945,"Well, that's --"
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2335.945,2336.757,-- were rampant.
1978.78-627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2336.757,2339.503,Yes.
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2339.503,2351.544,The board engaged in a massive pattern of school construction on a racially segregative basis and the Court of Appeals concluded that two things during the period between 1954 and the time of trial --
1978.78-627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2351.544,2376.149,"Mr. Caldwell, you say the board engaged in a massive program of school seg -- construction on a segragative basis, supposing the board has to build a school out in a newly developed area which the population of which is 99% white and it picks a site out there and it knows that 99% of people going to school are white."
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2380.012,2383.331,"If it does that in a vacuum Your Honor, it's one thing."
1978.78-627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2398.473,2403.658,But where is that finding?
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2406.87,2416.16,"No, the Court of Appeals made that finding with respect to a number of the board's practices and they found that the entire -- that the board was operating a system-wide program of segregation."
1978.78-627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2416.16,2420.392,"Well, where did it -- where is the finding as to funneling by school constructions?"
1978.78-627,1,44363,william_e_caldwell,,2420.392,2422.978,"Well, I'll give you one example of such a finding."
1978.78-627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2648.972,2656.992,Very well Mr. Caldwell.
1978.78-627,2,21546,drew_sdays_iii,,2658.808,2672.734,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to respond to a question that Mr. Justice Stewart put to my colleague.Essentially, does a school board get out from under the responsibility for certain segregatory practices?"
1978.78-627,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2693.738,2698.545,"Well, it'd be a very difficult burden it seems to me to carry."
1978.78-627,2,21546,drew_sdays_iii,,2723.344,2724.495,I don't believe it's impossible.
1978.78-627,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2801.611,2803.611,You speak of hundreds of cases.
1978.78-627,2,21546,drew_sdays_iii,,2848.173,2866.749,"I do Mr. Justice Rehnquist because I read that language in context, in the context of showing not just one such act creating a segregative effect but a pattern of that conduct in the context of other showings of segregative intent."
1978.78-627,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2883.244,2891.687,"But Oliver says -- it's not a -- doesn't just say it permits an inference, it says it's a presumption that becomes proof unless it's rebutted."
1978.78-627,2,21546,drew_sdays_iii,,2891.687,2895.425,"Well, I would -- I'm not here to defend the Sixth Circuit, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.78-627,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2994.136,2996.749,"We'll resume there at 1:00, Mr. Days."
1978.78-627,2,21546,drew_sdays_iii,,2996.749,3025.904,Thank you.
1978.78-627,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3115.395,3124.738,"Won't you have to say there, I take it, Mr. Drews, is that the segregated faculty which terminated, when, back in 1969?"
