1985.85-664,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.058,"Mr. Larkin, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,12.058,21.329,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on a writ of certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit."
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,69.66,70.846,But it could do both.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,70.846,71.746,Correct.
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,90.808,105.25,"But if it did the latter, adopt the tolerances, it couldn't proceed in order to... it couldn't in a specific case insist on a lower tolerance?"
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,105.25,106.016,That's correct.
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,119.474,123.045,"But pending the setting of a tolerance, they could proceed on a case-by-case basis?"
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,123.045,123.895,Correct.
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,123.895,127.247,And by these so-called... what do you call them?
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,127.247,128.797,"They are called action levels, Your Honor."
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,128.797,133.984,"Yes, action, they could proceed on that until a tolerance is adopted."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,133.984,134.684,That's correct.
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,141.94,144.874,May I just interrupt before you do?
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,152.647,153.88,"No, Your Honor."
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,153.88,154.397,You don't.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,156.599,161.753,"I am sorry, and I would like to be precise about this, because I think respondents have attempted to confuse the two."
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,165.788,168.324,"I understand that, but they are not regulations."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,168.324,170.709,"Correct, they do not have the force and effect of law."
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,173.911,179.382,They are basically a policy statement that we will not prosecute if you don't exceed this action level.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,179.382,198.759,"Well, it is more than just a policy statement, Your Honor, because the action levels represent the agency's judgment based on the available scientific data as to what level of contamination will result in adulteration, so the action levels also represent the agency's judgment as to what it can prove in an individual case will result in adulteration."
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,198.759,205.699,"Well, that may be, but legally they have no different effect than just an announcement of a policy that we won't prosecute above this level."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,205.699,206.632,That's correct.
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,206.632,211.769,"And they may go through a lot of thinking before they come to the conclusion, but none of that is statutorily required."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,211.769,219.689,"Correct, the statute does not require the establishment of action levels, and the statute does not impose any legal consequences upon the violation of an action level--"
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,219.689,221.439,And their published--
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,221.439,222.255,--Correct.
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,222.255,223.891,--Everybody knows about them.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,223.891,224.807,Correct.
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,224.807,233.247,"But if a manufacturer relies on one, it isn't going to do then much good if you in an individual case don't adhere to your action level."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,233.247,235.33,"Well, the reason we made--"
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,235.33,242.436,"You may not want to, but suppose the prosecutor, he couldn't defend on the basis that he is in compliance with the action level."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,242.436,256.945,"--That's correct, because if the agency has new data that leads the agency to believe that its prior action level was insufficient to protect the public health, that in fact a lower level of contamination may result in adulteration."
1985.85-664,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,256.945,259.647,"Now, how are the action levels published?"
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,259.647,262.43,"They are published in the Federal Register, Your Honor."
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,278.959,282.643,You could just sue and say this is a new action level.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,282.643,287.547,The agency has the authority to prosecute before it lowers its action levels as well.
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,287.997,292.868,But it couldn't do that if a tolerance had been--
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,292.868,294.001,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.85-664,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,321.019,325.339,--What sort of a pattern of adjustments of the standards exist?
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,330.057,335.361,"They are relatively infrequent both for... primarily historical reasons, but also practical reasons."
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,350.971,355.275,"That is the only one you... that is the only tolerance level there is, isn't it?"
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,355.275,357.144,There is one other tolerance level for PCBs.
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,360.845,366.332,How many substances are there really that might be the subject of a tolerance level?
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,366.332,384.294,"--There are at least eight substances that the FDA has action levels for at present, and it has 21 action levels for these eight substances, because the different substances may be ingested in different foods, different foods may be consumed in different quantities, and different foods may be--"
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,384.294,392.032,"And if you went at it by the business of setting tolerances, you would have had to set 21 tolerances?"
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,392.032,403.772,"--We believe that we would have to at least set that many different tolerances, and for substances for which we do not yet know, every time a substance is discovered we have to set a tolerance level under the Court of Appeals construction of the statute."
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,403.772,407.659,"Yes, but meanwhile, while you were setting them, you could have your action level."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,407.659,415.83,"That is true, but the agency has long concluded that the public is not materially benefitted by virtue of having tolerances in effect."
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,415.83,416.765,I know.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,421.817,428.757,"I agree, and for that I would like to, if I could, return to the four primary reasons why we believe the Court of Appeals erred."
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,428.757,431.775,"--Let me ask one more question, if I may, before you get into the argument."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,448.284,453.522,The pesticides are now primarily regulated under Section 408 or 346.
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,453.522,454.907,Where they do have tolerances in every case.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,454.907,460.811,"I believe the EPA sets the tolerances, and I am not sure if there is a tolerance set in every case."
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,466.363,467.898,Let me state the question a little differently.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,479.122,483.574,"--Yes, the eight action levels deal with substances that are either necessary or unavoidable--"
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,483.574,484.474,Okay.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,484.474,487.692,--The four reasons are as follows.
1985.85-664,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,503.587,504.953,How far back does that go?
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,504.953,514.009,"The construction goes back at least to 1940, when in a published letter that was sent to certain private parties the agency made clear its position."
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,603.686,613.875,"I suppose in the process you will explain why Congress thought... ever required tolerances, or ever provided for them."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,613.875,621.48,Congress provided for tolerances because the agency believed that the ability to adopt legislative rules would enhance its ability to protect the public health.
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,621.48,623.047,And you decided otherwise later.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,623.047,631.034,"No, the agency with the initial problem of dealing with pesticides adopted a pesticide tolerance in 1944."
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.564,920.837,"I must say, if you just read it on its face, you would think that shall meant something."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,920.837,924.772,"We believe that the verb ""shall"" has to be read in conjunction with the phrase,"
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,962.98,966.866,"Well, you would hardly draft it that way today."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,971.17,980.542,"It may not be in that sense, but the problem, the issue here really is that no one at the time thought that that made a difference."
1985.85-664,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,980.542,983.478,And how has it been treated since then?
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,983.478,990.215,"Since then, this is the first Court of Appeals to have held that the agency cannot rely on its action levels."
1985.85-664,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,990.215,990.648,I am not speaking of the Courts.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,991.448,996.702,The agency has consistently construed it from the day it went into effect as being discretionary.
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1019.115,1022.484,"May I ask, Mr. Larkin, your view?"
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1070.75,1072.9,"I think I understand your question, Your Honor."
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1077.987,1081.372,It is only unsafe if it exceeds an established tolerance.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1082.058,1088.044,--It is only unsafe under Section 406 and Section 402(a)(2)(A).
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1088.044,1088.46,Right.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1088.46,1090.377,If it exceeds an established tolerance.
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1090.377,1101.285,"And if there is no established tolerance, and therefore it doesn't exceed an established tolerance, and you also cannot prove unsafeness within 402(a)(1), it is not adulterated."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1101.285,1102.018,Correct.
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.018,1105.47,And that is regardless of whether it is below or above an action level.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1105.47,1110.873,"If it is above the action level, that means we can probably prove that it is adulterated."
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1110.873,1112.492,"If you can prove, but you still must."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1112.492,1113.125,Yes.
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1113.125,1124.831,"And I am saying... I am positing a case in which you cannot prove in a particular case on safeness, but then it is as a matter of statutory construction not unsafe."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1124.831,1125.949,That would be correct.
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1130.385,1136.138,"Whereas if you have a tolerance, then the answer to the unsafeness question depends on whether it is below or above the tolerance."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1136.138,1136.821,--Right.
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1136.821,1137.388,It is as simple as that.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1137.388,1139.34,The tolerance would provide the answer in every case.
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.34,1143.292,"And if you lose one case, you will probably bring another, hoping to be able to prove it in that way."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1148.612,1152.231,It may depend on the type of evidence that was adduced in the particular case--
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1152.231,1152.498,Yes.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1152.498,1159.567,--Let me turn to the statute then so that I can explain why we believe the Court of Appeals erred.
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1182.083,1186.219,"I know you said that about the Court of Appeals opinion, but I didn't find that in the Court of Appeals opinion."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1186.219,1191.373,We think that at three different places the Court of Appeals makes that position clear.
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1233.552,1235.302,"You don't disagree with that sentence, do you?"
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1235.302,1239.17,--We disagree because they confuse to contepts there.
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1239.17,1243.24,"The existence of the regulation would operate to render it legal, unadulterated."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1243.24,1250.06,"It would, if the contaminant were an amount below the tolerance, but the second half of that sentence doesn't follow from the first."
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1285.9,1290.285,"All that really demonstrates is, that is an incorrect reason for the result they reached."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1290.285,1306.063,"That's correct, and in fact respondents have now abandoned that argument themselves, but in addition, the Court of Appeals' construction of the statute also renders the general adulteration standard in Section 402(a)(1) superfluous, reasoning as follows."
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1332.064,1335.583,You left the exception out of the first sentence of 406.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1345.122,1352.877,"--No, I am saying the first clause in Section 406, it is intricate, and I am trying to refer to--"
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1352.877,1354.361,Is it the except clause you are talking about?
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1354.361,1357.579,"--No, from where it begins, ""Any poisonous or deleterious substance""."
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1357.579,1360.465,"And it says, ""except where it is unavoidable""."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1360.465,1362.333,That is right.
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1512.664,1514.116,May I interrupt you again?
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1524.971,1529.291,402(a)(1) does deal with added or inherent substances.
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1529.291,1533.093,"With no additive present, so it is not totally redundant."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1536.862,1543.116,"But it is clear that Congress intended 402(a)(1) to apply to added substances, and to have some effect there."
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1543.116,1545.985,"Yes, but that is the general basic prohibition in the statute."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1545.985,1546.587,That's right.
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1546.587,1547.353,It covers everything.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1552.991,1554.591,It is redundant insofar--
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1554.591,1555.841,Insofar as it relates to additives.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1555.841,1557.124,"--Yes, added substances, and--"
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1557.124,1560.043,And there is an elaborate code on additives of which 406 is a part.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1560.043,1563.261,--But there is no reason to believe that Congres intended it to be--
1985.85-664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1563.261,1564.463,To be partially redundant.
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1564.463,1566.08,--to be partially redundant in this respect.
1985.85-664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1566.08,1580.389,"Mr. Larkin, I know that both sides agree that aflatoxin is an added substance, but it isn't immediately apparent to me why it should be considered an added substance at all."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1583.507,1594.613,It is the FDA's position that it is not an inherent constituent of food because it is not the natural product of the genetic code of whatever is the food that is at issue.
1985.85-664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1594.613,1599.684,So anything that isn't part of the genetic code of the substance is added?
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1599.684,1605.504,Or anything that would be added either by man or nature the agency has construed it in this fashion.
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1607.872,1627.001,"One more... there is no redundancy... even if you had to adopt tolerances, 402 wouldn't be redundant because you would resort to it to control a situation until the tolerance was adopted."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1627.001,1631.155,We would submit that it doesn't serve solely as a transitional device.
1985.85-664,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1634.274,1639.226,"You said it would be redundant, though, which it certainly wouldn't be."
1985.85-664,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1639.226,1650.867,"--Unless it was to serve solely as a transitional device, it would be superfluous, because the tolerance would always provide you with an answer to whether a food was adulterated."
1985.85-664,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1650.867,1660.572,"Mr. Schultz, you may proceed when you are ready."
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,1660.572,1683.938,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case raises important public policy issues concerning the process to be used by the Food and Drug Administration in setting a standard for poisonous and deleterious substances which are unavoidable and which are added."
1985.85-664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1872.243,1875.795,Are those things that we presume Congress wanted from the agency?
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,1875.795,1881.801,--I don't believe we need to presume it.
1985.85-664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1887.019,1889.555,What difference does it make whether it is a good idea or not?
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,1891.471,1892.59,--That is precisely the issue.
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2269.449,2274.935,"Wouldn't you have to say the only reading of the statute, the only sensible, rational reading?"
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2274.935,2276.718,That would certainly be my position.
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2276.718,2277.285,Not just the better.
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2277.285,2279.054,Yes.
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2294.98,2319.179,"Well, the FDA has read that language, has thought forever that that section would bear a construction different from yours, and you say just no rational person could possibly read that language the way the FDA has for 50 years?"
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2319.179,2322.314,"Well, I suppose I look at the history a little bit differently than they do."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.314,2323.749,The history?
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2324.449,2325.899,I meant their practice.
1985.85-664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2328.285,2334.622,Can you say that it is absolutely irrational to read the thing as modifying something that close to it?
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2334.622,2350.9,"I think it is stretching the language to a very large degree, and I think you can see that if you look at another section of the statute, Section 401, which Congress adopted in the same statute in 1938, because there--"
1985.85-664,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2350.9,2353.768,Then the agency has been irrational for nearly 50 years.
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2355.335,2361.874,"--Well, that is why I was saying I regard the FDA's actual practice a little differently than they do."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.566,2434.154,When was the first time they ever resorted to action levels?
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2434.154,2439.208,"They actually used action levels even before 1938, so that was--"
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2439.208,2449.064,"It is your position then, I take it, that it just couldn't directly bring an enforcement action absent a tolerance?"
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2449.064,2483.92,"--No, what we would say is, the statute plainly requires the FDA to issue tolerances, but that until it has done so, it may bring case-by-case enforcement action under Section 402(a)(1), the general adulteration provision, and so the Congress provided a comprehensive scheme that really provides for both, and the problem here is not so much the use of action levels, but the use of action levels in place of the tolerances that Congress, we think, plainly required."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2483.92,2494.093,How many tolerances has the FDA actually issued under 406?
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2494.093,2499.097,"Two, one in 1944 and one in the 1970s."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2500.949,2502.481,And that is the very last one.
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2502.481,2503.4,Yes.
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2513.772,2524.23,When did it first become clear that the agency wasn't about to regularly issue tolerances?
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2524.23,2526.697,"Well, that is hard to say, Justice White."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2526.697,2527.28,In the forties?
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2527.28,2547.36,"Well, in 1977 they issued a final rule setting out their practice for action levels and tolerances, and if you read that rule you would think that they in fact intended to use tolerances when the evidence was static, and in fact they began a proceeding to issue a tolerance for aflatoxin in peanuts."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2547.36,2553.93,"But it also was perfectly clear that where that wasn't so, they weren't about to issue tolerances."
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2553.93,2564.386,"One thing that I think was clear certainly by the 1970s is that they read these sections as discretionary, and that they didn't believe they had to issue tolerances."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.386,2567.904,Wasn't it clear before that time that that was their view?
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2567.904,2570.023,I think it may have been.
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.759,2575.493,"Well, it is discussed here."
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2578.645,2593.138,"--Well, yes, they do say that, but if you go and look at the testimony they are talking about, in each case the testimony says Section 406 authorizes the FDA to issue action levels."
1985.85-664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.077,2604.196,"You mean it authorized them to issue tolerances, not action levels."
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2604.196,2605.696,"--Excuse me, tolerances."
1985.85-664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2679.393,2685.462,"Mr. Schultz, what do you do with your opponent's argument that the tolerance is really kind of a two-edged sword?"
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2706.46,2709.428,"I agree with part of the argument, but I believe it is overstated."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2756.406,2763.912,"Yes, but what exempts it from going through the regular procedure for amending a regulation?"
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2763.912,2765.045,"Nothing, Your Honor."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2769.33,2776.936,"Calling for comment, publication, putting out a proposal, going through their regular administrative procedure."
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2776.936,2777.553,--Yes.
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2779.971,2781.488,Subject to judicial review.
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2781.488,2787.374,"--Subject to judicial review, but the agency's decision would be effective prior to judicial review."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2787.374,2789.66,"Well, not necessarily."
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2789.66,2801.099,"That would be up to the Court, but there certainly is authority in the statute to make the agency's decision effective immediately at the time it is rendered."
1985.85-664,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2820.512,2828.618,Do you agree that normally it takes many months in some cases years to go through the regulation adoption procedure?
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2828.618,2835.105,"The one time the FDA has done it, it did, but that was not an emergency situation."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2854.649,2861.719,"But the choice was... when was the Congressional choice that you claim was made, about when?"
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2861.719,2865.671,"1938, when it issued Section 406."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.671,2869.04,"Well, they had never of a lot of these substances at that time, had they?"
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2869.04,2871.759,No.
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2874.894,2880.264,But isn't there an awful lot being learned about some of these substances that was never known before?
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2880.264,2886.434,"Yes, but in 1938 there were over 100 substances that came under the statute."
1985.85-664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2894.524,2898.826,"Congress had never heard of the Administrative Procedure Act in 1938, had it?"
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2898.826,2908.034,"It hadn't been adopted, but that is why when Congress wanted public participation it adopted the specific procedures in Section 701."
1985.85-664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2908.034,2910.017,They were adopted in '38?
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2910.017,2912.069,"At the same time, in 1938."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2924.909,2942.771,If there is a new substance provided obviously they can use action levels or direct enforcement until there is a tolerance established.
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2943.623,2944.357,--I agree with that.
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2988.569,2998.424,"Well, if the Secretary under your view, the Secretary is supposed to establish a tolerance."
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,2998.424,2999.376,Yes.
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2999.376,3014.469,"But until... and he is supposed to get started, but until then he can prevent by action level or just by direct enforcement the sale of what he calls adulterated foods."
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3014.469,3016.153,"That's correct, and--"
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3016.153,3030.729,"Why couldn't he, if he had issued a regulation, why couldn't he then by the sane token say, I want to amend this regulation, I have discovered some things I don't want to, and until I amend this regulation I can use a different action level?"
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3030.729,3037.566,"--The problem is that there is a specific provision in Section 406, it is the middle sentence, that says,"
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3045.655,3054.927,He really is... things become rather inflexible when a tolerance is adopted.
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3054.927,3074.972,"They become less flexible than with an action level, but this is the same procedure that Congress has adopted for a variety of substances that the FDA licenses, drugs, food additives, color additives, animal drugs."
1985.85-664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3109.578,3116.501,"You referred earlier to the experience with pesticides where they had 100 different action levels, and they were going to get tolerances for all of them."
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3128.309,3129.475,It is unclear.
1985.85-664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3130.992,3139.162,"And there is no initiative from the farmers, I guess, here to get tolerance level for this particular additive."
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3139.162,3146.585,"No, I think it is fair to say that up to now the industry is satisfied with the way the FDA is regulated."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3287.86,3290.662,How often... perhaps you have already said it.
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3292.762,3295.714,I didn't say it.
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3303.201,3306.486,I thought the action levels were published.
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3306.486,3315.775,"The agency has recently adopted a practice of publishing action levels, but in the past it didn't even do it in one place."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.393,3324.214,Does anybody know when they are about to change an action level or are considering changing it?
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3324.214,3338.207,"--In the case of aflatoxin, when the FDA is granted an exemption, it did it at the request of the industry, so the industry knew they were considering it, but no one else did unless they heard it through the grapevine."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3345.361,3352.467,"But to make an action level... to enforce an action level, they have to enforce."
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3362.906,3369.226,Amicus briefs saying that that was unacceptable?
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3369.226,3376.832,"Well, unless the entire industry was in agreement with the action level, I would suppose they would say so."
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3376.832,3380.951,"Well, I think they are in agreement with the action level."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.951,3382.753,That is one way of public participation.
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3382.753,3400.631,"But part of the problem is the rest of the public has been excluded from participation, and there is, you know, we still don't have the advantage of an explanation by the FDA... let me answer the question this way."
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3429.967,3441.108,"Well, your client wouldn't be excluded from any... from an amicus position in an enforcement action, would he?"
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3441.108,3445.576,"No, but--"
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3445.576,3447.695,You could get your licks in somewhere.
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3447.695,3453.682,"--Well, we have to do it in hundreds of cases all around the country, I suppose, is part of the problem, and--"
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3453.682,3458.403,Just like the FDA would.
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3458.403,3463.288,"--Well, if the tolerance are adopted, the--"
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3463.288,3464.974,"Well, a tolerance is a different matter."
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3464.974,3466.09,--That is true.
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3483.116,3483.633,Yes.
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3483.633,3486.753,So in that sense the tolerance is far more efficient--
1985.85-664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3486.753,3487.253,Yes.
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3487.253,3489.219,--than the procedure that the FDA has chosen.
1985.85-664,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3489.219,3490.538,Very well.
1985.85-664,1,46316,william_b_schultz,,3490.538,3491.371,Thank you.
1985.85-664,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3491.371,3494.657,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Larkin?"
1985.85-664,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,3494.657,3495.609,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-664,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3652.392,3653.308,"Thank you, gentlemen."
