1985.84-801,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.512,We will hear arguments first this morning in Midlantic National Bank against New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,17.728,32.83,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents to the Court the question of the scope of the abandoned tower rented to a trustee in bankruptcy under Section 554(a) of the Bankruptcy Code."
1985.84-801,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,211.962,221.459,"Mr. McEnroe, what are the legal consequences of the bankruptcy law of abandonment, insofar as the title to the property goes?"
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,228.516,234.061,"In this particular case, the property can be abandoned to anyone with a possessory interest."
1985.84-801,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,241.622,246.494,Are there liens on the property?
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,246.494,248.712,"Well, there are two different properties."
1985.84-801,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,272.202,277.591,But the legal effect of abandonment is to have the title of the property revert back to the debtor.
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,277.591,278.278,That's correct.
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.792,289.118,"Under the new Bankruptcy Act, does... I know under the old title was vested in the trustee."
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,289.711,290.242,"--No, it is not."
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,290.242,291.101,It is not.
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,293.022,296.724,"It remains in the debtor, and possession and title after abandonment are in the debtor."
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,296.724,300.239,"Well, and before and after, then, the technical title--"
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,300.239,300.677,Title does not change.
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,300.677,301.255,--Yes.
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,303.175,308.328,The trustee has custody of the property while it is in--
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,308.328,311.702,And with all the powers to do with it what the bankruptcy law gives it.
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,311.702,312.358,--That's correct.
1985.84-801,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,380.799,393.544,"Mr. McEnroe, do you concede that there may be some limitation on the power of abandonment to meet public safety concerns?"
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,411.053,415.598,"No, Your Honor, other than the burdensome and inconsequential value set forth in the statute."
1985.84-801,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,435.683,446.539,"Do you mean that the trustee could abandon a burning building, or a great excavation that would attract a nuisance and a hazard?"
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,446.539,451.474,"In all cases, the analysis by the trustee would be the same."
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,493.864,497.69,That may be true about what the trustee should do.
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,507.296,508.03,Yes.
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,508.03,520.682,"He cannot say, well, wait a minute, you can't abandon it without taking some precautions against having this property be a public danger?"
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,520.682,528.758,I think the Bankruptcy Code as it is written says that the court must consider only the standards of burdensome and of inconsequential value.
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,528.758,531.663,"Bankruptcy Courts are courts of equity, I suppose, aren't they?"
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,531.663,539.644,"They are courts of equity, but in doing their... exercising their equitable powers, they cannot act contrary to the Bankruptcy Code."
1985.84-801,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,574.27,586.202,"Is there no obligation even in the interim for the trustee to take emergency measures to prevent something in the estate from constituting a public nuisance, for example?"
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,586.202,591.638,"In the interim, the trustee should do what is necessary if he has the ability to do so."
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,606.788,635.824,"Well, suppose he has some... suppose there are assets in the estate that hopefully would be distributed later to pay the claims of unsecured creditors, but while he is waiting for the action on the abandonment petition, he thinks he has to spend some money to keep the property in decent shape, and he spends some money."
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,637.822,640.728,If he spends money in the interim?
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,640.962,648.178,"And which would deplete the assets available to unsecured creditors, I suppose."
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,648.178,649.193,"That's correct, it would."
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,649.193,655.519,But you think he would be breaching his duties if he used those free assets to clean up the site.
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,655.519,665.734,"If it is clear that the asset will never be of any value to the state, that the cost of cleanup will exceed the value of the estate, and in a clean state would never generate any benefit for the estate."
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,665.734,684.757,"Well, what if... so it means that he... so it means... well, suppose the assets available to creditors are plenty to clean up the site, and the site would then be worth something."
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,684.757,687.833,Then he would clean up the site.
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,687.833,688.661,He would.
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,696.472,703.094,"If it is clear that after he expended the assets to clean up the site, the value of that property would exceed what he expended on it."
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,703.094,705.327,"I know, but there may be liens on the property."
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,705.327,707.124,"Well, that is a different situation."
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,714.12,718.65,So the creditors would then just have an interest in the property instead of the other assets.
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,718.65,720.226,--That's correct.
1985.84-801,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,720.226,723.195,May I pursue that?
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,742.422,742.906,That's correct.
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,742.906,748.107,"That is inconsistent with what you said, isn't it?"
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,756.167,761.165,"That particular asset, again, is of no value to the estate."
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,761.165,761.821,I see.
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,761.821,763.445,And he could abandon.
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,768.6,769.708,Yes.
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,769.708,775.691,The trucks contained certain residues of PCB's which in order to sell the property needed to be cleaned up.
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,785.812,786.031,I see.
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,786.031,788.513,I believe that is the distinction there.
1985.84-801,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,788.513,809.13,"I suppose if the state has a law that gives the state a first lien on property which it has to clean up and restore and expend its funds to do so, that that state's first lien can take priority over the secured creditor?"
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,809.13,814.018,I believe it would depend on the time.
1985.84-801,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,828.185,831.372,But that wouldn't be settled in the Bankruptcy Court.
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,831.372,839.79,"No, once the property was abandoned, and the bankruptcy judge recognized that when he refused to consider that issue, once it was abandoned it was beyond his jurisdiction."
1985.84-801,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,841.21,851.41,But as a matter of state law it is possible that the state can give itself a first lien that would come in ahead of any security interest on the property.
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,852.035,859.47,"Well, that involves an interpretation of state law and the rights of creditors, which... or the rights of lienholders, which is not, I don't believe--"
1985.84-801,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,859.47,861.796,But you concede it is possible.
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,861.796,862.968,--It is certainly possible.
1985.84-801,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,862.968,870.667,Were any of these sites covered by the mortgage?
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,872.59,875.992,"Yes, the New York real estate was subject to a mortgage lien."
1985.84-801,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,882.272,887.895,"The mortgage would attach to the excess value, if any."
1985.84-801,0,44586,william_f_mc_enroe,,887.895,888.785,That's correct.
1985.84-801,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,901.25,908.667,Mr. Terrell.
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,908.667,931.877,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Midlantic National Bank asked this Court to reverse the decision of the Third Circuit because in its opinion the Third Circuit decision effectively destroys its admittedly valid and existing security interest, and the inventory, certain equipment, and accounts receivable of the debtor."
1985.84-801,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,952.197,956.461,How does that disadvantage Midlantic as a secured credit?
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,956.461,962.942,"Well, Justice Rehnquist, here we have an estate that is valued at about $400,000."
1985.84-801,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,982.637,985.557,So your lien isn't on any particular property?
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,985.557,995.867,"Our lien is on the inventory which included the good waste oil in this case, certain equipment which the trustee sold, and accounts receivable, of which there were none."
1985.84-801,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,995.867,1001.427,"Well, did the Third Circuit say your lien was subordinated then to the cleanup costs?"
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1001.427,1008.565,"It did not in so many words, but I think the net effect of their opinion, and especially Footnote 11, comes down to that."
1985.84-801,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1031.336,1040.958,"What would have happened if no bankruptcy had been filed at all, and the corporation had dissolved?"
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1049.783,1063.73,"First of all, Justice O'Connor, our lien covered personal property in New Jersey, and personal property in New York, but it never got that far because that personal property was never sold by the trustee."
1985.84-801,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1067.791,1071.038,"Well, let's talk about the theoretical--"
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1071.038,1071.71,Fine.
1985.84-801,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1071.71,1073.882,"--possibilities, if you would for a minute."
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1076.943,1077.349,"Yes, I do."
1985.84-801,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1077.349,1077.818,--go ahead and answer it.
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1077.818,1100.309,"Under state law, in New Jersey, our lien would have priority to any other liens, including that of the state of New York, and so under state law, if the corporation went defunct, we could have foreclosed under New Jersey law and sought sale of those assets to pay for our secured interest."
1985.84-801,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1101.574,1106.261,"Is it possible, of course, that a state could give itself first priority?"
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1106.261,1108.197,"--Yes, you are absolutely right."
1985.84-801,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1143.855,1150.742,"May I ask at that point, did your lien also include, also attach to the property that the trustee sought to abandon?"
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1150.742,1152.32,"Yes, it did."
1985.84-801,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1154.71,1163.752,"So basically what you are saying is, you could foreclose your lien by taking the valuable property and ignoring the... you could make a selective foreclosure."
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1163.752,1165.516,"--Yes, I believe state law permits you to do that."
1985.84-801,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1350.32,1366.515,"Could I ask, when a secured creditor has a... well, he has a lien on real or personal property, and he wants to foreclose the debtors in bankruptcy, you must get permission to foreclose?"
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1366.515,1368.656,"If the debtor is in bankruptcy, that's right."
1985.84-801,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1370.374,1377.761,"But the only time you wouldn't get it is if the property is worth more than the debt, I suppose."
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1377.761,1379.511,"No, that is not the only reason."
1985.84-801,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1383.182,1384.884,"No, this is straight bankruptcy."
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1384.884,1385.837,--Straight bankruptcy.
1985.84-801,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1390.6,1402.469,"If there is no equity in the property, couldn't the trustee say if the secured creditor is... couldn't the trustee say, I want to abandon this property?"
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1402.469,1405.266,"--Well, the trustee must go to the Court to--"
1985.84-801,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1405.266,1405.859,Exactly.
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1409.655,1411.357,--Certainly that happens every day in the--
1985.84-801,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1411.357,1412.872,Why shouldn't it have happened in this case?
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1419.181,1424.665,"--Well, it is worth more than the personal property, but there was a combination of assets here, Justice White."
1985.84-801,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1427.773,1428.319,You had no lien on.
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1428.319,1429.365,--We had no lien.
1985.84-801,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1440.549,1441.033,Thank you.
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1441.033,1456.213,"There is, as I indicated, there is an important consideration here about how the state can go about cleaning up the site other than reaching into the pockets of either the trustee or secured lenders."
1985.84-801,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1616.445,1620.538,"Mr. Terrell, you mentioned the fact that the New Jersey site was leased."
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1620.538,1621.349,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-801,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1621.349,1623.396,The lease was terminated.
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1627.847,1629.784,He is not according to this case.
1985.84-801,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1631.268,1636.094,And no action has been instituted against... him?
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1636.094,1645.293,"In the Bankruptcy Court, not this case on appeal, there was a separate action started by the landlord."
1985.84-801,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1680.576,1683.934,"He would be an unsecured credit, or would he?"
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1683.934,1688.214,"Well, he claims he is entitled to administrative rent."
1985.84-801,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1688.214,1688.777,Landlord.
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1688.777,1697.678,"Yes, he claims that he has an administrative lien for rent, but his claim was dismissed by the Bankruptcy Court, and that is all the farther that has gotten."
1985.84-801,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1699.083,1701.723,"Well, did he claim priority over your lien?"
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1701.723,1705.722,"No, he did not claim priority over our lien, but he claimed an administrative lien."
1985.84-801,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1705.722,1707.017,Expense.
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1707.017,1707.814,Expenses.
1985.84-801,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1708.064,1711.986,"Mr. Terrell, could I ask you about your signal to the financial community."
1985.84-801,1,17131,a_dennis_terrell,,1729.588,1731.93,"I don't disagree, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-801,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1786.986,1788.423,Very well.
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,1791.593,1802.167,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, seven years ago Congress codified the power of a trustee in bankruptcy to abandon worthless, burdensome property."
1985.84-801,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1884.4,1885.509,Why are you here?
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,1885.509,1904.251,"--We are here, Your Honor, to reaffirm what we think is an essential police power of the state, the ability of the states to step in in an emergency situation to get an order maintaining the status quo and preventing a situation where toxic wastes are leaking into the Hudson River and the court of equity is powerless to do anything about it."
1985.84-801,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1904.251,1911.435,So you... did you go into the Bankruptcy Court and attempt to have this effected?
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,1911.435,1912.482,"Yes, we did, Your Honor."
1985.84-801,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1914.231,1915.294,On that ground.
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,1915.294,1922.948,"--Well, the situation was not simply that the trustee proposed to walk away from dangerous property."
1985.84-801,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1951.969,1956.013,"Well, how are you any worse off than before Quantas' bankruptcy?"
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,1957.917,1963.853,"Well, Quantas in this situation, Your Honor, was completely without assets to do anything about the situation."
1985.84-801,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1963.853,1967.102,But I presume that was the case on the day it filed for bankruptcy.
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,1967.102,1978.676,"I believe that the situation deteriorated substantially over a period of eight months in New York, and over more than a year, I believe, in New Jersey."
1985.84-801,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2003.464,2011.272,What you wanted to effect was to make the trustee use whatever assets he had to minimize the danger.
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2011.272,2012.225,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1985.84-801,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2015.662,2020.223,I suppose you wouldn't have come in if you thought he was absolutely without any assets.
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2020.223,2020.738,--That's right.
1985.84-801,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2022.346,2027.703,Assets such as... some of the assets were under a lien.
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2027.703,2028.641,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-801,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2028.641,2032.03,"You claim a right to those security assets, too, I take it."
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2032.03,2033.046,"That is right, Your Honor, we do."
1985.84-801,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2033.046,2038.263,"Well, isn't this really a question of priority of claims?"
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2043.354,2046.039,"Well, Your Honor, we don't think it is."
1985.84-801,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2061.049,2067.266,"Well, in the present posture of the case, money has been expended by New Jersey and by the city of New York."
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2074.029,2075.764,"--That's correct, but that's not the issue we--"
1985.84-801,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2075.764,2077.466,So it really is a priority claim.
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2077.466,2079.685,--But that is not the issue before the Court now.
1985.84-801,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2091.196,2091.944,After the abandonment.
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2091.944,2093.366,After the abandonment took place.
1985.84-801,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2095.973,2102.393,What if the corporation had just chosen to dissolve and walk away from all these assets?
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2113.546,2114.233,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1985.84-801,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2114.233,2119.903,And why should the filing of a bankruptcy change that outcome?
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2119.903,2132.912,"Well, the debtor here was seeking to avail itself of some of the protections of the Bankruptcy Code which would not otherwise have been available in a dissolution proceeding."
1985.84-801,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2185.844,2203.945,"But certainly if the state of New York were concerned with emergency environmental situation, and wherever this place was in New York, it wouldn't be logical to go to the trustee in bankruptcy and say we need emergency action in the next 12 hours, you take it."
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2207.085,2210.662,"I think that's right, Your Honor, but we are asking essentially for status quo relief."
1985.84-801,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.278,2238.4,You mean the Court shouldn't act on the abandonment petition until all that is sorted out?
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2238.4,2248.35,"Well, I think the abandonment provision itself provides for notice in a hearing, and the hearing, we believe, should consider those public health and safety consequences."
1985.84-801,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2248.35,2248.631,Why?
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2248.631,2252.755,In the same way that any other emergency situation is dealt with by a court of equity.
1985.84-801,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2252.755,2257.549,"That may be so, but what do you mean, you have to have a hearing to see what assets are available?"
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2257.549,2266.749,"Well, we are accepting it at face value for purposes of the hypothetical here, that there were no assets in the estate to stabilize the situation in the short term."
1985.84-801,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2289.771,2296.33,"General Hermann, do you think the equities in any sense enter into this balance?"
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2312.027,2312.871,"That's true, Your Honor."
1985.84-801,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2347.295,2352.34,Do you think the old equity doctrine of in pari delicto would encourage comes into play here at all?
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2352.34,2369.458,"I don't think in this situation that we were in pari delicto, because one of the things that was clear here is that on the record, this particular debtor was notorious, was subject to consent orders in both New York and New Jersey for violations."
1985.84-801,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2443.537,2454.314,"I thought a moment ago, General Hermann, that you were suggesting this was kind of an interim type of thing, that the trustee was... you are attacking him here for having made matters worse since he took over."
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2454.314,2454.548,--That's right.
1985.84-801,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2454.548,2464.967,I would sense from what you just said that you would fault the trustee for things that Quantas had done in the past.
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2464.967,2481.459,"No, I am merely pointing out, Your Honor, the breadth of the argument, that it goes not simply to ignoring state environmental concerns, but also to ignoring federal environmental concerns as well, and essentially granting them an unfettered right to abandon property which he regards as worthless."
1985.84-801,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2481.459,2484.957,But that is what the Bankruptcy Court may well do.
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2488.285,2489.488,"That's right, Your Honor."
1985.84-801,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2526.925,2543.825,"Are you suggesting that the abandonment should just have been put off, so that the trustee could continue to take care of the property and avoid damage, or are you saying, go ahead and let him abandon it, but then the trustee would have to spend money to keep the property from deteriorating after abandonment?"
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2547.308,2552.524,"What we are suggesting, Your Honor, is that in the short term the trustee should be required to do what he had been doing for eight months."
1985.84-801,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.524,2553.446,What short term?
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2553.728,2564.847,"Until the court can hold a hearing and determine how serious the problems are, how much it would cost to clean those problems up, what assets are really available in the estate, what prospects there are for--"
1985.84-801,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.847,2568.003,That isn't what the abandonment power says.
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2573.375,2575.983,"--That's right, Your Honor, but there are also other statutes which come into play here."
1985.84-801,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2602.597,2604.972,May I ask this?
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2623.588,2627.962,"No, I don't think our position goes quite that far, Your Honor."
1985.84-801,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2629.476,2632.257,Do you think there would come a point when something would be left for creditors?
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2632.257,2651.688,"I think there is authority, Your Honor, if that would be... the situation were such that it could be stabilized, and there could be an orderly winding up of the estate, and responsible parties were on the scene, to handle the situation and prevent it from getting out of hand."
1985.84-801,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2660.559,2666.447,You have to find somebody other than the state to clean up the sites.
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2666.447,2674.195,"In many situations, reality forces us to recognize that the private parties are simply not in a position to do it."
1985.84-801,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2708.524,2728.515,"Mr. Hermann, I am puzzled by your response to Justice Powell, and I really can't think it through, perhaps, but are you contending, though, that the state's interest in recovering the cleanup costs... forget for a moment the costs of maintaining the guards, the temporary problem, but the large amount spent cleaning it up, are you contending that that comes ahead of the first lien in all--"
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2728.515,2732.076,"No, New York does not have a first lien statute, as New Jersey does."
1985.84-801,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2737.481,2748.149,"--Do you disagree with the suggestion by one of your adversaries that the lienholder could make a selective foreclosure and just foreclose on the good assets, and just ignore the liability aspect?"
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2748.149,2748.414,"Yes, we do."
1985.84-801,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2749.944,2755.037,"I am not clear, then, on why you don't think they are able to foreclose."
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2764.564,2765.439,It doesn't.
1985.84-801,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2765.439,2765.893,--under your view?
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2765.893,2768.313,I don't believe it does.
1985.84-801,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2768.313,2770.123,Maybe I have asked too much for the time... when you don't have any time.
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2771.561,2771.795,I don't believe it does.
1985.84-801,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2771.795,2773.998,It doesn't affect it at all.
1985.84-801,2,39471,robert_hermann,,2773.998,2774.779,"No, I don't believe it does."
1985.84-801,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2774.779,2775.746,Yes.
1985.84-801,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2775.746,2778.917,"Your time has expired now, counsel."
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2787.508,2791.913,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1985.84-801,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2825.227,2828.945,"I am not sure I track that, Ms. Jacobson."
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2844.75,2856.933,"It is an issue... the effect on the creditors is something that we don't know at this point, because the Bankruptcy Court has not looked at that issue on remand."
1985.84-801,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2868.756,2882.97,"Do you include... your insistence is that even with respect to the inventory that is covered by the bank loan, that that inventory could have been used by the trustee to clean up."
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2882.97,2886.485,--We would make that argument before the Bankruptcy Court.
1985.84-801,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2886.485,2887.296,"Well, you are making it."
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2887.296,2887.936,Yes.
1985.84-801,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2887.936,2903.367,"And do you think New York shares this view, that it could... that the... even the assets with a lien on it could be dissipated, not dissipated, but used to clean up?"
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2903.367,2922.141,"New York in their brief raised the possibility that under Section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, it is possible under some circumstances that the state through the state could reach the assets of secured creditors."
1985.84-801,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2922.141,2922.391,"And that is your view, too, I gather."
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2922.391,2927.218,That is one of the views that we would press before the Bankruptcy Court.
1985.84-801,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2945.506,2960.064,"Well, Ms. Jacobson, assuming that what you say may well be correct as to the priorities, why should all this marshalling of assets discussion turn on whether or not the property is allowed to be abandoned?"
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2969.357,2972.604,"Well, it certainly goes beyond the abandonment issue."
1985.84-801,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3005.701,3012.823,Are you saying that he cannot through the process of abandonment relieve himself of those custodial responsibilities?
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,3012.823,3019.663,We are saying that the Bankruptcy Court should not allow abandonment until the public health and safety concerns are addressed.
1985.84-801,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3019.663,3022.304,That means your answer is yes.
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,3022.304,3028.005,And this may be different given any... given the particular circumstances of the case.
1985.84-801,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3066.816,3069.16,May I interrupt with a question?
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,3094.134,3099.459,It seems to be part of the same continuum.
1985.84-801,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3113.407,3113.767,I understand that.
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,3122.076,3128.948,That is an issue that we want to raise with the Bankruptcy Court.
1985.84-801,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3132.369,3134.695,"Well, then, are you agreeing that they do present separate issues?"
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,3144.363,3148.956,"--Well, we see it as the threshold part of the same issue."
1985.84-801,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3173.992,3178.942,"Your view then, as I understand it, is that cleanup costs should take priority over all other claims of creditors."
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,3178.942,3182.379,That is the view that we want to press before the Bankruptcy Court.
1985.84-801,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3183.285,3200.716,"Well, if you just... considering that part of the problem of preventing further deterioration, if the trustee is going to have to maintain guards and what-not, that means that he can't abandon the property."
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,3205.417,3206.417,That is correct.
1985.84-801,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3206.417,3216.506,"So it just means essentially that if you must spend... if you must prevent the property from deteriorating further, you just can't abandon it."
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,3216.506,3220.301,"That's correct, and that's essentially what the Third Circuit held."
1985.84-801,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3220.301,3221.176,"Yes, it is."
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,3221.176,3228.517,"That where you have an imminent public health and safety threat, you can't abandon property without regard to that threat."
1985.84-801,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3228.517,3237.887,And you must use whatever assets that's available to the trustee to prevent that hazard.
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,3237.887,3242.511,That is an implication of the decision which--
1985.84-801,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3242.511,3243.136,A pretty strong one.
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,3243.136,3248.165,--which absent factual findings it is hard to play out in this case.
1985.84-801,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3421.924,3437.84,"Could I ask you, why do you think that the costs of cleanup or of avoiding some public health hazard should be paid by the secured and unsecured creditors?"
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,3467.421,3470.967,"Well, in this case the creditors certainly did take the risk."
1985.84-801,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3471.951,3473.45,Both the secured and unsecured creditors?
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,3473.45,3479.199,"--Certainly the secured creditor in this case, Midlantic National Bank."
1985.84-801,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3489.631,3493.646,"Were there any wage claims in this case, do you know?"
1985.84-801,3,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,3493.646,3494.66,--I don't know.
1985.84-801,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3494.66,3505.811,"But you say that regardless of who the unsecured creditor is, his claim should be subordinated to the administrative expense of cleaning up."
