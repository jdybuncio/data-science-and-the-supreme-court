1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,172.069,188.841,The Court of Appeals actually took the principle of Palermo out of context and applied it in its naked existence to a -- an entirely different factual situation and they did that in this manner.

1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,229.989,251.165,"Well, if Your Honor please, we felt that we did not -- we were not in a position where we should have been required to call the agent as our witness and -- because the witness testified in this case that the agent summary was not precisely as he had stated it."

1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,390.293,393.779,-- loss of either willfulness or negligence or anything.
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,393.779,403.583,"Well, we would have no way of knowing that but we make no suggestion that anything is improper occurred, if that encompasses Your Honor's question."
1960.53,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,403.583,413.83,"That is to say, you mean the instruction or proscribing of the FBI agent's imposed after his reports were prepared, is that what you mean?"

1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,455.072,456.243,Precisely.
1960.53,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,456.243,461.028,Did the agent himself type those -- typed the summary?
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,461.028,472.061,"The agent himself, Your Honor, as I understand it from what we do have, dictated it and it was prepared by some secretarial help at the Bureau."

1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,506.896,508.091,Did you examine it?
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,508.091,508.875,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,508.875,512.356,And were there any limits put on the questions you could put therein?
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,512.356,515.471,"Well, I -- I can read it for you verbatim so that you will have it now."
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,515.471,516.7,Please just tell me where it is.

1960.53,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,519.539,521.538,-- are you talking about the agent or the witness?
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,521.538,522.58,"Not the agent, the witness."
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,522.58,523.868,I'm talking about the agent and --
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,523.868,524.3,"Oh, I'm sorry."

1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,526.595,527.965,Was the agent a witness for anybody?
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,527.965,530.302,The agent was not a witness for anyone.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,535.987,539.047,I understood that to be as to this subject matter but --
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,539.047,539.753,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,550.815,554.93,But would it appear whether he was available?
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,554.93,571.717,I would say that it appears that the court said something about the U.S. Attorney would have him available and it was the contention of myself and my colleague at that time that we would not call a special agent as our witness once we complied with the requirements of the statute.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,571.717,572.968,I'm not talking about the statute.
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,574.733,577.956,He was not in court either as a witness or a spectator to the knowledge of counsel.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,577.956,586.775,"And he wasn't kept from testifying by the Government so as to lead you to say to the jury, point out the fact that the Government didn't call him."
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,586.775,591.148,We would have no cause to argue the absence of the witness.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,591.621,592.683,There wasn't any.
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,592.683,592.706,That's --
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,592.706,595.853,He wasn't withheld --

1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,598.738,599.352,That's right.
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,599.352,600.908,That's correct.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,602.131,602.815,Was he alive?
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,605.02,608.19,"Yes, I understand he's an agent in charge of a district office at the present time."

1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,613.052,614.487,"It appears, yes, Your Honor."
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,614.487,614.967,Alright.
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,614.967,616.381,Not in that many words.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,618.264,619.862,"Well, I know but --"
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,619.862,623.108,It was merely stated that the agent was available.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,639.141,652.992,"Now, where in the record is there a description or what -- where can I find a description of the -- of the destroyed document or the non-existing document?"

1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,666.827,667.426,Yes.
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,667.426,671.407,"There was, apparently, an imperfection in the printing at the bottom number."
1960.53,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,694.207,695.313,Who is the witness?

1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,722.094,729.57,"It says ""When you said you had a conversation with the FBI some time less than a week after July 18th, did they write down what you had to say then?"""

1960.53,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1027.296,1027.367,You did.
1960.53,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1027.367,1028.511,After they denied you?

1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1071.874,1086.877,"No, I do not.I just take the position that if the Government removes the situation from the confines or the four corners of the statute, then we go back to the common law and find ourselves back into the Jencks case."

1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1277.876,1279.19,Comes within the statute.

1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1402.689,1403.872,"Well, that's probably so."

1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1434.732,1435.599,That's correct.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1435.599,1435.771,Alright.
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1435.771,1439.418,Certainly.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1686.885,1690.629,Let's see if I -- if I understand your argument.
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1707.448,1708.385,Yes.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1708.385,1723.422,I also understood you to answer quite clearly to Justice Brennan that you do not think the existing document which was denied to you does not come as such within the Jencks statute --

1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1723.726,1728.207,-- and could not be called for under the Jencks statute.
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1728.207,1729.406,That's right.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1729.406,1750.981,"Therefore, I do not see why you recur to what the statute requires because the statute conceded, as I get the Government's faith, would have required the production of the nonexistent document and the statute concededly also by you as such would not require the existing document."
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1758.877,1761.195,"Well, we have a right to obtain sanctions."
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1767.613,1767.876,But if all (Voice Overlap) --
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1767.876,1769.684,We are entitled to sanctions.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1769.684,1787.075,"But they derive from two statements that I -- that I put to you to find out whether you agree or not, namely the destroyed document concededly could have been called -- the nonexistent document concededly could have been called for and the existing documents concededly is not callable under the statute."
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1787.075,1788.535,"In the first instance, that's so."

1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1811.29,1822.843,"That is exactly so, Mr. Justice Brennan, and I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter put the question to me that ""outside of this situation, would you concede that this statement did not come within the statute as such?"""
1960.53,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1828.0,1831.088,Was the statement ever made available to you?

1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1851.543,1853.706,At the time of the hearing for the Court of Appeals.
1960.53,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1853.706,1853.758,Yes.
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1853.758,1854.062,That's correct.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1854.062,1856.964,What was the reason for that?
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1856.964,1865.389,The Court of Appeals clerk's office just told me the Court of Appeals was not bound by an impoundment order of the District Court and they opened it just like that.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1865.389,1884.492,"Well, did you -- did you, on the basis of that knowledge, make any move either before the Court of Appeals in the light of knowledge to show that real prejudice would -- would result from -- or did result from your -- from the failure to make that available at the time?"
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1884.492,1885.256,Certainly.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1885.256,1885.796,What?
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1885.796,1886.213,Certainly.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1886.213,1886.898,Where is that?
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1897.331,1904.82,"In our matter of -- in the -- one of our points in the appeal to the Court of Appeals, we claimed it was error and showed that inferences to be taken from that --"
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1904.82,1905.137,I understand you --
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1905.137,1905.765,-- could have resulted in cross-examination.

1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1922.072,1922.251,If your --

1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1923.776,1928.984,"If your question means, Your Honor, did we do something in addition to the perfection of our appeal, the answer is no."
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1928.984,1929.338,Yes.
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1929.338,1933.112,We continued with our appeal and that being one of the points of our appeal.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1933.112,1942.244,"Yes, but when you appealed at the time -- at the time you appealed, when you perfected your appeal, you did not know the contents of the document, did you?"
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1942.244,1942.866,No.
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1942.866,1962.081,"But afterwards, you did know the contents of the document and my question is whether, on the basis of that knowledge, having been put in possession of a content, it might demonstratively show that you suffered for not having been allowed to produce that document before a jury."
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1967.257,1982.518,"No, the court had in camera inspected that document and had full knowledge of it and we had no reason to believe he would make any different decision on a motion than he had originally upon our demand both for the document to strike the testimony and for production of the summary."
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1982.518,1988.895,But you couldn't ignore what the Court of Appeals with Judge Magruder and Judge Hartigan and Judge -- who was the third?
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1990.884,1997.12,"Obviously, from the very short nature of their opinion on this point, they didn't do very much."
1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1997.12,2002.584,I'm saying that you couldn't have known what they would have done if you said --
1960.53,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,2002.584,2002.823,I couldn't have anticipated --

1960.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2015.857,2017.911,"Well, it's the fact that you didn't do it, isn't it?"

1960.53,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2536.42,2539.26,I can well understand the legal proposition doesn't make any difference.
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2543.321,2543.853,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.53,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2544.104,2551.021,"Mr. O'Donnell, as I understood your -- your associate, I -- I may be entirely mistaken about it."
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2574.667,2575.16,That's precisely my point.
1960.53,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2575.16,2582.83,"Now, if -- if he said more than that, I -- I didn't correctly understand him but that's all I understood him to say."
1960.53,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2582.83,2588.612,He explicitly disavowed wrongdoing by the Government in an answer to a question by me.
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2590.449,2592.354,"May I say this, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1960.53,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2704.941,2711.102,But you did have an opportunity and means of reconstructing the statement --
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2711.102,2711.98,May it --
1960.53,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2711.98,2712.945,-- by calling a witness.
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2712.945,2714.2,The FBI agent?
1960.53,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2714.2,2714.934,Yes.
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2714.934,2716.839,"Now, I say --"
1960.53,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2716.839,2728.297,"You say the Government has got to suffer the consequences of failing to produce which, by hypothesis, let's presume for a moment, was a perfectly honest failure to produce."
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2747.614,2749.607,"Yes, Mr. Justice Harlan."
1960.53,3,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2751.963,2774.196,"Is it true -- does the Act -- a conference in chambers while Mr. Staula was on the stand, counsel for the Government advised you that there had never been a different statement by the witness at all, as cited in Footnote 3 of the Government's brief on page 10?"
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2774.196,2775.635,That there had never been --
1960.53,3,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2775.635,2796.656,"There's never been a -- that -- that counsel for the Government states several times that the original note of the FBI agent were no longer in existence and that there never had been a different statement by this witness, citing transcript one statement 05."
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2796.656,2796.984,Yes.
1960.53,3,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2796.984,2797.56,Is that the right statement?
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2797.56,2798.748,"Mr. Justice, yes."
1960.53,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2818.291,2822.774,"Well, if there wasn't a written statement, how can you get a written statement that doesn't exist?"
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2824.024,2832.398,"It was written by the agent and adopted by the -- the government witness, Dominic Staula."
1960.53,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2832.398,2834.755,You mean the statement that was unavailable?
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2835.381,2836.324,"Yes, Mr. Justice Harlan."
1960.53,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2836.324,2838.219,Not the other case?
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2838.219,2839.552,Yes.
1960.53,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2839.552,2845.509,(Inaudible)

1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2853.844,2855.418,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1960.53,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2916.009,2918.077,This witness may have had a vivid memory.
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2920.398,2941.796,"Well, Mr. Justice Harlan, that -- the particular witness that we're talking about, Staula, on the stand, made a statement in answer to the trial court that this caption ""FBI Agent Interview Report,"" he said it was inaccurate --"
1960.53,3,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2941.796,2941.819,(Voice Overlap) --
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2941.819,2942.802,-- from this particular witness.
1960.53,3,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2942.802,2948.813,"He said it wasn't that a -- if that's the true copy of what he said, isn't that what he did?"
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2948.813,2949.8,Yes.
1960.53,3,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2949.8,2950.093,"Now, there --"
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2950.093,2952.908,"They -- he said there were things turned around, may it please the Court."
1960.53,3,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2952.908,2958.83,How do you explain the testimony of record 201 and 202 after your colloquy there?
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,2991.095,3002.232,"I would qualify that, Mr. Justice Whittaker, as that colloquy indicates that he had doubts as to his signature, merely his signature."
1960.53,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3029.726,3038.198,Am I right in -- in saying that the crux of your argument will be that your argument reducibly fell to this.
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,3060.334,3061.248,Yes.
1960.53,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3061.248,3062.828,"It must be of acquiescence, doesn't it?"
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,3062.828,3068.986,"Yes, but I'd say, in this case, may it please the Court, in the Government brief, they cite a -- a relevant hypothesis."
1960.53,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3074.293,3092.55,"Well, it doesn't make -- if it's-- if, according to your argument, I see no difference how the non-availability of the document is brought about, whether through carelessness, except -- except purposeful design to defeat the ends of the law."
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,3092.924,3093.941,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.53,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3093.941,3116.086,"If the document is -- ceases to be, for the most unassailable reason, the witness -- the person whose -- with reference to whom the statement is made that is no longer producible cannot be availed of the witness by the adverse party."
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,3116.086,3116.935,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.53,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3116.935,3119.005,That's the case.
1960.53,3,34915,lawrence_f_odonnell,,3119.005,3131.0,And I would say that the Government adopts the petitioners' contentions.
1960.53,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3257.386,3271.818,Mr. Connor.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3271.818,3277.051,"Mr. Louison, Mr. O'Donnell, and may it please the Court."
1960.53,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3287.579,3289.295,The statement in the statutory sense.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3289.295,3307.801,"In the statutory sense, that no statement that's alleged to have been destroyed here or was ever shown to exist sufficiently to require a reversal here or to bring into play the doctrine which has been asserted by counsel for petitioner."
1960.53,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3307.801,3322.805,"I wonder if you tell the Court that since Palermo, there have been any administrative internal rules or regulations or change of practice for the destruction of the original notes and putting them into summary for so long?"
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3322.805,3328.469,"Your Honor, I have consulted with the officials of the FBI in preparation for this argument."
1960.53,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3353.115,3355.338,Is there any change made after Palermo?
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3355.338,3356.544,"No, Your Honor."
1960.53,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3373.086,3390.828,(Inaudible)
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3390.828,3409.076,"Well, Your Honor, the term ""raw files,"" as used by the Department, I'm sure, referred to a typewritten matter which is put in the files and which may contain all sorts of things of a hearsay character describing investigative techniques."
1960.53,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3433.081,3436.819,(Inaudible)
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3436.819,3437.581,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.53,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3437.581,3457.306,(Inaudible)
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3457.306,3467.377,"Well, Your Honor, I think there -- there's been a misconception of just what did happen there or what Staula's testimony on this point is and our brief develops it."
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3499.67,3505.543,Was he sure that he'd been -- it had been shown to him and that he had approved it?
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3505.543,3506.115,"No, no."
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3617.724,3618.35,But whether it's --
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3618.35,3619.121,-- the best inference to be drawn.
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3619.121,3629.57,"-- whether it's hieroglyphics or -- or whether it's in English, if -- if it is recorded, it might be shorthand."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3640.277,3666.721,"No, Your Honor, because these notes have never been considered to be a statement in the sense of a -- a written statement signed by the witness nor are they a recording of -- are they a verbatim transcription of any kind or a verbatim statement and they have never been thought by us to have any value as -- as a producible statement under the Jencks Act."
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3666.721,3670.013,Why does the agent asked him then if that's what he stated?
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3670.013,3679.309,"Because in the process of interviewing a witness, the agent wants to make sure that he understands the story correctly and he may confirm certain points with him."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3693.461,3696.643,"It's difficult, Mr. Connor."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3724.243,3724.854,"No, Your Honor."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3724.98,3726.322,Am I wrong about that?
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3726.322,3728.315,We -- we do not agree with that presupposition.
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3728.315,3730.663,"Well, I don't understand your questioning."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3783.452,3785.308,"Well, that is our position, Your Honor."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3785.308,3787.221,"Well, that isn't what you say anywhere."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3787.221,3787.324,"Well, in our --"
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3787.324,3788.21,(Inaudible)
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3788.21,3800.727,"-- in our brief, we have a counterstatement of the question involved and perhaps, I was direly tearing up beginning with that because we do not agree that a complete foundation for it is made or was made in this case."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3808.56,3809.686,That's what I read it for --
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3809.686,3809.721,Yes.
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3809.721,3810.639,-- that's what I read it from.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3810.639,3811.511,But -- but we -- we differ on this.
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3811.511,3825.466,"And that means to me, the -- that -- the implication is clear that if the notes that were not in existence had been in existence, they were not challenged to be non-producible."
1960.53,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3834.548,3842.758,I understood you to answer with me that the notes were in existence but the summary was the only one that was at the trial.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3842.758,3844.666,"No, no, Your Honor."
1960.53,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3851.309,3852.693,He said he didn't have them but that --
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3852.693,3865.883,"Yes, and he doesn't say affirmatively, the Assistant doesn't, in the record that he talked to the agent but we assumed that he made some inquiry and this is what he understood to be the case."
1960.53,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3879.76,3880.031,"Well, then --"
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3880.031,3880.301,-- which can be --
1960.53,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3880.301,3884.709,"-- if the notes are always destroyed, that was what my original question was aimed at then --"
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3884.709,3885.267,Yes.
1960.53,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3885.267,3890.435,-- Palermo gives us an around -- a way around the entire statute.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3890.435,3891.604,"No, no, Your Honor."
1960.53,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3895.406,3895.844,I'm not saying in purpose.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3895.844,3896.98,-- defeat the statute.
1960.53,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3896.98,3905.795,"I mean, I don't say that's the purpose of the destruction of notes but if that is the fact, if that is the system, then the -- the statute is -- has no force in the fact."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3905.795,3913.082,"Well, that -- that is so only on the assumption that the notes always come within the scope of the Palermo -- of the statute."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3913.082,3913.452,"That is right, Your Honor --"
1960.53,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3913.452,3913.881,"Well, the summary --"
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3913.881,3914.451,-- but that is --
1960.53,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3914.451,3918.176,It's clear from Palermo that the summary never does come within.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,3918.176,3924.714,"That is correct, Your Honor, but the FBI has not stopped taken written statements where it's appropriate."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4015.965,4021.908,"Well, of course, the word ""notes"" and the conception of notes is itself a very ambiguous term --"
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4021.908,4021.931,"That's right, Your Honor."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4021.931,4025.791,-- from the record that has come before this Court entirely here.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4036.64,4038.341,"No, and we don't call them notes, Your Honor."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4104.606,4112.395,"Well, they're not only -- these notes often are also interluded with comment by the agent."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4113.663,4114.586,"Yes, indeed."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4114.586,4118.964,"They -- they make comments that this fellow, ""I don't believe him"" and so on, all sorts of things."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4118.964,4125.923,"Oh, the agent might note that the witness is nervous or any number of things like that."
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4140.751,4147.238,"Well, he'd hardly -- hardly show the witness that kind of notes and ask him to sign up though, would he?"
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4147.238,4152.644,"No, he wouldn't and I don't know of any FBI practice of a witness signing notes."
1960.53,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4160.179,4161.536,"Well, that was just Staula."
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4161.536,4161.582,Do they have any --
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4161.582,4166.136,Except where -- where a witness might draw a sketch or something like that.
1960.53,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4169.161,4176.638,"So if Staula's recollection that he did sign this is correct, then it would follow that these things were more than just simply notes."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4176.638,4177.397,That is correct.
1960.53,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4191.594,4195.97,(Inaudible)
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4195.97,4196.613,"Well, then --"

1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4197.276,4200.636,-- then we have a question of whether it is a statement adopted by the witness.
1960.53,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4200.636,4202.58,(Inaudible)
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4202.58,4205.786,"Yes, I certainly do, Your Honor because the notes may be very incomplete."

1960.53,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4221.262,4223.341,I'm talking about the summary.

1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4224.829,4226.185,-- the report of interview here.
1960.53,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4226.185,4226.933,Yes.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4226.933,4228.835,"Well, if he had read that over and approved it --"

1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4230.122,4233.232,"I think that, certainly, that would come in."

1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4246.046,4247.93,What is wanted is the authentication.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4247.93,4249.294,That is correct.
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4249.294,4261.947,"But this was your witness who said that to take your -- your own view of the testimony as most favorable of the Government, that he thought it was handed to him."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4276.113,4276.761,"No, Your Honor."
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4290.819,4291.148,Yes.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4291.345,4292.075,-- and on another occasion --
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4292.075,4292.4,-- but --
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4292.4,4293.542,-- he wasn't sure.
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4293.542,4295.279,"Yes, I know, but this is your witness."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4298.261,4299.629,That is correct.
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4299.629,4303.018,And you're bound by what your witness says.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4303.018,4304.18,"That is correct, but I -- I don't think --"
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4304.18,4311.684,"Then why aren't you bound by the things that he says in favor of the defendant, as well as the things that are said in favor of the Government?"
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4311.981,4313.074,I --
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4313.074,4317.857,"-- if you are, why isn't this a statement that qualifies under Jencks?"
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4327.764,4328.25,And he --
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4328.25,4328.346,-- if you wanted --
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4328.346,4328.73,-- and then after that --
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4328.73,4339.566,"-- to disprove that that was -- wasn't the fact, why couldn't you -- that that was the fact, why couldn't you have brought the agent there to say, ""Well -- well, I didn't show it to him."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4341.845,4344.014,"For a very good reason, Your Honor."
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4371.195,4372.329,Is that in the record?
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4372.329,4376.315,"Yes, Your Honor, it's in the transcript which we have filed with the Court."

1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4383.527,4391.779,"No, Your Honor, because we didn't know the -- the existence of this transcript until after the petition for certiorari had been granted here."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4494.284,4495.805,What -- what were they talking about?
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4503.096,4503.13,Well --
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4503.13,4504.794,This is a right -- I don't know what the conflict.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4504.794,4509.58,Because Toomey could offer no substantive evidence in the case.
1960.53,4,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4510.808,4513.223,"That's what the judge was talking about, Judge McCarthy."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4513.223,4514.727,That's right and secondly --
1960.53,4,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4514.727,4518.604,The question of whether he could have testified to the contents of the statement --
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4518.604,4518.618,Yes.
1960.53,4,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4518.618,4520.016,-- is an entirely different matter.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4520.016,4531.111,"That's right and secondly, if -- if it's a question then of impeaching Staula, the Government can't bring in Toomey and put him on the stand unless it thinks that it must impeach the witness."
1960.53,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4531.111,4551.464,(Inaudible)
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4551.464,4554.851,"Yes, he probably could have but apparently, it didn't occur to him."

1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4557.002,4562.812,"Well, I -- I think he could have but -- but I don't think that injects error into this case."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4562.812,4565.133,"No, but I want to know what this footnote is about."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4567.676,4569.94,"Well, the conference is lengthy."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4569.94,4570.203,I know.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4574.415,4583.006,"They adjourned because at the end of one trial day, Staula was on the stand and counsel then made their demand and the Government info -- said --"
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4583.006,4586.197,Demand for -- for what you had called us for a note.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4586.197,4586.797,That's right.
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4586.797,4596.404,Suppose they agreed to call the non -- of the nonexistence or not available document notes and the document which is in existence a statement.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4596.404,4600.404,"Well, the document which is in existence is what we call a report of interview."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4600.404,4601.691,"Alright, report of interview."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4613.197,4618.732,I -- the discussion in chambers revolved around the original notes --
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4618.732,4618.738,Alright.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4618.738,4626.726,"-- made by the agent and also, around this question of then shouldn't this also be produced in that the notes are not available."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4629.743,4639.758,"Now, I want to know why Agent Toomey was -- why Judge McCarthy said he couldn't be called."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4639.758,4640.306,"Well, he --"
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4640.306,4657.563,"As just -- Justice Brennan just indicates, he certainly could be called to testify whether the so-called notes were read and supplied to or rather signed by the petitioner, couldn't he?"
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4657.563,4657.587,I think --
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4657.587,4658.552,No doubt about that.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4658.552,4662.156,-- I think that Judge McCarthy indeed could have called him in camera --
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4662.156,4662.356,"So, it couldn't have been --"
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4662.356,4663.91,-- and examined him.
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4663.91,4665.274,Were they talking about that?
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4665.274,4665.905,No.
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4665.905,4666.703,That's what he told me.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4666.703,4673.92,"No, Mr. Louison suggested that the Government call him and Judge McCarthy pointed out that the Government couldn't do that."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4678.594,4680.944,You say that he didn't sign it.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4680.944,4686.914,"No, no, but to put him on the stand and have him tell about what the witness told him at the interview may tend to support the witness."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4688.132,4695.468,"No, but -- but this is -- this is a preliminary inquiry as whether certain documents should be produced."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4697.449,4698.08,That is correct.
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4698.08,4707.505,We're -- we are in the judge's chamber who's to decide whether a call for document should be heeded.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4707.505,4708.234,That is correct.
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4708.234,4720.219,"Now, and on that issue, I don't understand why Toomey wasn't avail -- or wasn't an admissible witness in that preliminary inquiry before Judge McCarthy."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4720.219,4724.182,I think he would have been but I don't think he was offered or -- or --
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4724.182,4728.717,That's -- that's -- I can't tell from this footnote what -- what it's all about.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4728.717,4728.921,"Well, it was --"
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4728.921,4738.578,"He wasn't offered by the Government but counsel for the defendant insisted that he should be -- should be in there and the Government refused to -- to produce him, isn't that right?"
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4738.578,4740.716,"No, Your Honor, I don't think the Government refused to."
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4740.891,4741.42,Well --
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4741.42,4744.792,"-- that the judge said that ""You may subpoena him as a witness."""
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4747.001,4747.283,"Well, in other words --"
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4747.283,4748.19,You may subpoena Toomey so he --
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4748.19,4758.375,"-- in other words, a -- they -- he said it's the obligation of the defense to bring him instead of the obligation of the prosecution."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4758.877,4759.952,That is correct --
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4759.952,4760.064,Well --
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4760.064,4760.969,-- because --
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4760.969,4761.977,And --
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4761.977,4762.588,-- because the Government put him --
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4762.588,4768.54,"But you don't mean that, if you'd wanted to, you couldn't have brought him."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4768.54,4770.152,"Well, I think he was available."
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4771.187,4771.944,"No, no, I don't mean physically."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4771.944,4773.138,-- at the outset.
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4773.138,4794.449,"I don't mean physically but I mean if you wanted to establish in camera before the judge on this proceeding that the -- the notes had not been shown to the witness, that he had not been asked to approve them and that he had not signed them, you could have brought the agent there, could you not, and -- and had him testify?"
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4796.108,4801.39,"Well, I don't know what the explanation for that is."

1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4805.832,4809.975,"Well, whatever reason it was, you didn't want to do it."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4810.278,4812.414,"Well, I don't know his reasons."
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4812.414,4813.225,I didn't ask the reason.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4813.225,4813.588,No.
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4813.588,4816.415,I said you didn't want to do it.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4816.415,4817.948,"Well, no, I don't think he did."
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4817.948,4819.645,"Well, alright."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4819.645,4842.804,"One would have to read, at least I would have to read, what's repeated, what -- how this conference to which footnote on this page occurs, what it was about and what it is that Judge McCarthy had in mind when he said, ""You couldn't call the agent to give evidence."""
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,4884.438,4901.968,"Well, I -- I think that if Your Honor reads that transcript, you will see that the court was trying to apply the statute, struggling for an interpretation of it in applying it in this case and perhaps, it didn't occur to him to call Agent Toomey in."

1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,5221.429,5222.153,That is correct.
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5224.059,5227.574,How is that established in the record?
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,5227.574,5230.477,"Your Honor, the fact that they were destroyed?"
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5230.477,5232.135,That -- yes.

1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5350.482,5358.55,"Well, the judge was in a colloquy there with his law clerk and [Laughter] that's -- that's the way we make the record."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5358.55,5359.047,Let me ask you this.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,5359.047,5359.809,"Well, the judge --"
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5360.231,5360.688,How did this --
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,5360.688,5367.098,-- stated on the record that the conference was to be very informal and that everyone was to feel relaxed because they were in his chambers.
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5367.098,5372.161,When -- when did it develop that there was in existence this report that is in existence?
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,5377.114,5379.369,You -- that there was an Interview Report?
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5379.369,5380.105,Yes.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,5380.105,5383.31,The Assistant U.S. Attorney proffered it to the court.
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5383.46,5385.413,But where is it printed at?
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,5385.413,5386.214,Pardon?
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5386.214,5387.907,Just turn to that in the record.

1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5404.93,5406.447,212?

1960.53,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5408.355,5410.093,212 at the bottom.
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5410.093,5415.629,That is the -- that is the statement but where -- where -- how did it come into the record?
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5416.882,5424.75,"My question is, how did the existence of that -- how did the existence of that disclosed?"
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,5424.75,5432.448,"Well, when the -- when the court called on the Assistant U.S. Attorney to produce any documents he had, he gave them this."
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5432.448,5433.492,Where is that page?
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,5435.344,5437.361,It's -- it's here.
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5437.361,5440.783,I think that answers the Chief Justice's question and mine.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,5456.801,5472.882,"Your -- Your Honor, on page 201, at the bottom, the court says ""Have you got in your possession any statement that was copied by an FBI agent which, in any way, would reflect a statement that this witness made?"
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5480.043,5481.109,"Well, he's quite wrong."
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,5481.109,5484.38,"He is the clerk to the Assistant U.S. Attorney, isn't he?"
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5487.863,5488.216,What?
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5489.593,5489.826,No.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,5489.826,5493.712,"Well, they told me law clerk and I misunderstood them to --"
1960.53,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5493.712,5497.357,He's an Assistant -- he's an Assistant US Attorney of a lower rank.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,5497.357,5499.607,"Excuse me, Hobley and Hurly are two different people."
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5499.607,5499.963,Yes.
1960.53,4,38976,roger_g_connor,,5499.963,5502.347,So --
1960.53,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5502.347,5504.277,"Who's the clerk, Hobley or Hurly?"
1960.53,5,36239,melvin_s_louison,,6818.629,6818.914,I think --
1960.53,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6818.914,6823.247,"Mr. Louison, before you start, would you mind just clearing up in my mind."
1960.53,5,36239,melvin_s_louison,,6857.675,6857.696,That's --
1960.53,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6857.696,6859.276,There -- there is a difference.
1960.53,5,36239,melvin_s_louison,,6859.276,6861.228,That's precisely what I intended.
1960.53,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6878.068,6896.567,"Did you ever suggest anywhere, anywhere before this answer, not that you suggested now, did you ever suggest anywhere either, one, that there might have been wrongdoing or two, that this is a nice way for the Government to get out of the Jencks case?"
1960.53,5,36239,melvin_s_louison,,6900.792,6904.28,"Yes, the second thing you stated, Your Honor, is precisely what I have suggested --"
1960.53,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6904.28,6904.78,That is my belief.
1960.53,5,36239,melvin_s_louison,,6904.78,6908.267,"-- even to that conference in lobby, and I can read it for you which is just what I wanted to read."
1960.53,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6908.267,6910.265,"Yes, I know, but it's my belief to that."
1960.53,5,36239,melvin_s_louison,,6918.832,6919.622,Did I throw it?
1960.53,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6920.184,6921.355,Alright.
1960.53,5,36239,melvin_s_louison,,6921.355,6922.113,No.
1960.53,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6925.246,6925.33,Your point was that it was immaterial --
1960.53,5,36239,melvin_s_louison,,6925.33,6927.328,-- want the FBI agent as my witness.
1960.53,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6927.328,6927.765,-- isn't it?
1960.53,5,36239,melvin_s_louison,,6929.078,6933.1,"That's right, that there must be compliance with the statute or there's a vacuum."
1960.53,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6935.502,6936.877,I understand that.
1960.53,5,36239,melvin_s_louison,,6936.877,6948.929,"And if I may, if -- if it please the Court, read at this time, Judge McCarthy did say ""I have a great-- "" page 1806 of their transcript, ""I have a great deal of confidence in this Bureau."
1960.53,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6990.246,6994.451,That's a very different thing from what Mr. O'Donnell said at the bottom of this Court.
1960.53,5,36239,melvin_s_louison,,6994.84,6994.923,All I say --
1960.53,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6994.923,7001.176,-- with regards to wrongdoing and you specifically disavowed it when I put it to you.
1960.53,5,36239,melvin_s_louison,,7001.176,7003.807,I don't wish to engage in quarrel with His Honor.
1960.53,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7021.216,7021.375,But your associate had suggested that --
1960.53,5,36239,melvin_s_louison,,7021.375,7024.931,"Therefore, I was not going to engage in quarrel with the Federal Bureau."
1960.53,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7024.931,7028.696,But your associate had suggested in words explicitly.
1960.53,5,36239,melvin_s_louison,,7028.696,7030.267,He said that there was an inference.
1960.53,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7038.626,7043.536,"Therefore, we ought to be slow in making charges against even government people, unless there's some (Inaudible)."
1960.53,5,36239,melvin_s_louison,,7043.536,7046.965,[Laughs]
1960.53,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7050.631,7052.239,"Well, when the red light comes on."
1960.53,5,36239,melvin_s_louison,,7052.239,7052.261,I see.
1960.53,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7052.261,7056.635,"You do have two or three minutes more, I think, if you wish to use it."
1960.53,5,36239,melvin_s_louison,,7056.635,7058.646,"Then I wish to say this, Your Honor please."
