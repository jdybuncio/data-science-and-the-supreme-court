1977.77-888,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,22.037,We will hear arguments next in Vitek v. Jones.
1977.77-888,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,24.916,25.638,Thank you Your Honor.
1977.77-888,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1333.863,1337.211,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors and may it please the Court."
1977.77-888,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1365.75,1374.043,Do you suggest that the state of Nebraska has any responsibility for either his custody or his treatment at the present time?
1977.77-888,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1374.043,1375.141,Yes Your Honor.
1977.77-888,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1389.966,1391.839,That was a condition of his parole.
1977.77-888,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1391.839,1397.775,"Condition of his parole, but if he should choose to violate that, he would be back in the state of Nebraska."
1977.77-888,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1397.775,1406.398,"If he escaped from the Veterans Hospital in Illinois he would be in violation of the conditions of parole and would be a fugitive, would he not?"
1977.77-888,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1406.398,1417.507,"That is correct Your Honor, but also if he were to probably not take his medication, I would suggest that he would probably come back to the state of Nebraska also."
1977.77-888,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1417.507,1431.152,Is there any reason to believe that the Veterans administration has some bias against him or is treating him improperly in any way?
1977.77-888,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1431.152,1432.701,I have no knowledge of that.
1977.77-888,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1439.738,1446.048,"You suggested a moment ago that if he did not take his medication, he would soon be back in Nebraska?"
1977.77-888,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1452.375,1453.532,Somewhat Your Honor.
1977.77-888,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1472.6,1477.125,That is true with lots of other complaints besides psychiatric ones as I understand.
1977.77-888,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1499.012,1508.111,I would suggest Your Honor that one has an inherent right to refuse medical treatment whether he would be a civilian walking around the street or whether he would be in prison.
1977.77-888,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1529.194,1545.573,"What if it was LSD in the experimental phases that one reads about in the newspapers experimental drugs, are you suggesting that that is permissible, but something other than medication is not?"
1977.77-888,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1545.573,1547.842,Who would be administering this experimental drug?
1977.77-888,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1547.842,1549.761,The doctors?
1977.77-888,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1549.761,1554.375,I would say that the patient will have the right not to take it.
1977.77-888,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1554.375,1560.023,You got appendicitis and they take you to a city hospital you could object to that?
1977.77-888,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1560.023,1563.689,"Most people would not, but I think they would have the right to."
1977.77-888,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1563.689,1568.209,You said you usually have the right to commit suicide.
1977.77-888,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1568.209,1572.747,You are going to have a hearing to see whether he should have his appendix removed?
1977.77-888,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1572.747,1577.16,We do not need a hearing for that because I think there is a right --
1977.77-888,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1577.16,1583.964,What if he says he is a Christian scientist and will not submit to any surgery?
1977.77-888,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1583.964,1588.113,I think he should have that right not to submit to the surgery and his incarceration should not make any difference.
1977.77-888,2,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,3211.627,3214.398,I would just like to get on track and summarize Your Honor.
1977.77-888,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3223.394,3225.538,"General Kammerlohr, can I ask you a question on that?"
1977.77-888,2,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,3225.538,3226.613,Yes Your Honor.
1977.77-888,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3226.613,3250.296,"Supposing during a criminal trial the trial judge knew quite a bit about psychiatry and at the end or maybe even a medical psychiatrist and at the end of the trial the trial judge said well I have heard all the evidence and instead of sentencing you to the prison I talked to my law clerk and we have decided it would be better for you to go the mental hospital, could he do that?"
1977.77-888,2,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,3250.296,3250.964,No Your Honor.
1977.77-888,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3250.964,3252.52,Why not?
1977.77-888,2,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,3263.574,3268.366,"Yes Your Honor, I think so."
1977.77-888,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3268.366,3272.854,"They might want more than a law clerkâ€™s opinion however, might they not Mr. Kammerlohr?"
1977.77-888,2,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,3272.854,3306.191,"They might, but assuming I know what Mr. Justice Stevens is getting at his dissent as whether or not there is a residual after the conviction, any residual rights such as right to religious study and right to regional medical treatment and those things and as to that Your Honor, I am saying even if there is a residual that the method in this statute satisfies rather than this hearing that lower court tried to outline."
1977.77-888,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3306.191,3308.927,We do not have to be concerned about the method in this statute.
1977.77-888,2,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,3341.903,3343.735,It is not my position that --
1977.77-888,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3343.735,3352.858,We do not have to worry about the adequacy of the hearing at all because there is no constitutionally protected interest in not being sent to a mental institution as opposed to another prison?
1977.77-888,2,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,3352.858,3358.81,It is my position that the way to attack that then comes later and it is the same --
1977.77-888,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3358.81,3360.92,It is matter of grace by the state.
1977.77-888,2,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,3368.21,3384.066,"I do not believe he could be sentenced for a death in a term or term in the mental hospital if you were then found after you arrived there that he was not mentally ill, I think he could be sent there the same as these prison for examination study and treatment if necessary."
1977.77-888,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3384.066,3394.699,But does the constitution guarantee him a hearing after he gets to the mental institution or is that just a matter grace given by the state?
1977.77-888,2,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,3394.699,3403.726,"In constitution, the only thing that we have gotten so far as far as this Court is concerned that I can recall is reasonable medical treatment."
