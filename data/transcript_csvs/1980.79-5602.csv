1980.79-5602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,We'll hear arguments next in Fedorenko v. United States.
1980.79-5602,0,17655,brian_m_gildea,,67.125,77.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-5602,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,264.138,277.129,"Counsel, just as a matter of practical information, if Mr. Fedorenko loses this appeal or this review, what happens to him?"
1980.79-5602,0,17655,brian_m_gildea,,279.547,293.157,"Your Honor, if his citizenship is taken away, he would be subject to further proceedings under the Deportation Section of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, which would require further proceedings."
1980.79-5602,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,343.507,345.541,Within three weeks of his induction?
1980.79-5602,0,17655,brian_m_gildea,,345.541,346.959,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-5602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,422.559,428.962,"Mr. Gildea, just so I can follow this correctly, are you telling us what the District Court found or what your client testified to?"
1980.79-5602,0,17655,brian_m_gildea,,433.264,450.659,"These are facts that I'm stating to the Court are not only the testimony of my client but the finding of the lower court that he did in fact serve involuntarily and that he did, in fact, go to these various camps."
1980.79-5602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,450.659,454.761,"Why is that relevant now, here?"
1980.79-5602,0,17655,brian_m_gildea,,454.761,457.646,"Your Honor, it's only relevant in the sense--"
1980.79-5602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,457.646,462.6,"The question here is whether he concealed relevant information, is it not?"
1980.79-5602,0,17655,brian_m_gildea,,462.6,464.219,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-5602,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,801.835,806.887,"Now, as I understand it, Mr Gildea, Jenkins was also a vice consul, was he not?"
1980.79-5602,0,17655,brian_m_gildea,,806.887,807.822,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-5602,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,807.822,817.528,"And he testified, did he not, that a guard who served in a concentration camp was ineligible as a of law for a visa, did he not?"
1980.79-5602,0,17655,brian_m_gildea,,817.528,819.047,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-5602,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,819.047,819.913,And that's what he testified.
1980.79-5602,0,17655,brian_m_gildea,,843.611,845.044,I believe it would.
1980.79-5602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,991.039,994.891,"Well, didn't the 5th Circuit hold, though, that,"
1980.79-5602,0,17655,brian_m_gildea,,1007.798,1009.316,"Excuse me, I'm sorry; I didn't--"
1980.79-5602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1009.316,1013.952,"Didn't the 5th Circuit hold at page 118 of the Appendix,"
1980.79-5602,0,17655,brian_m_gildea,,1027.878,1029.23,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-5602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1035.801,1038.02,"Well, isn't that the only issue here now?"
1980.79-5602,0,17655,brian_m_gildea,,1038.02,1039.57,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-5602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1040.636,1041.672,The concealment.
1980.79-5602,0,17655,brian_m_gildea,,1041.672,1042.988,--That's correct.
1980.79-5602,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1321.469,1326.506,"Mr. Gildea, I fell off the wagon in your last comment."
1980.79-5602,0,17655,brian_m_gildea,,1351.157,1356.309,"--That is, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals said that the Government"
1980.79-5602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.309,1386.244,"That's a test more favorable to you, isn't it?"
1980.79-5602,0,17655,brian_m_gildea,,1386.244,1388.461,"The first half of it is, Your Honor."
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,1931.676,1936.23,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-5602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2213.441,2224.297,"General Civiletti, when you say the facts would have been useful, is that the equivalent of meaning that they would have triggered an investigation?"
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2224.297,2228.367,"I think so, Your Honor."
1980.79-5602,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2228.367,2239.24,"But the second half, Mr. Attorney General, is ""might"", not ""would"", have discovered fact which would have led to the denial of citizenship."
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2239.24,2252.649,"I think that the Court stated in Chaunt the second investigative test in two separate ways which, I think, have the same meaning."
1980.79-5602,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2330.346,2347.956,"As I understand the Government's position, it is not that the Government has to prove that the investigation would have turned up facts that would have required the denial of citizenship, but rather that it might have required a denial of citizenship after an investigation."
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2347.956,2349.908,"--That's exactly right, Justice Brennan."
1980.79-5602,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2399.073,2418.987,"While I have you interrupted, Mr. Attorney General, if Jenkins' testimony had been believed, namely, that had it been known at the time a visa was applied for that this chap had been a guard at the camp, he would not have been given a visa."
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2428.01,2429.793,"--Yes, and I think--"
1980.79-5602,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2429.793,2438.198,Are you urging here that this Court turn this case on that testimony?
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2438.198,2473.304,"--I will urge in my second point that the District Court erred in substituting its judgment as to what would have happened back in 1950 under the application and interpretation of the law then and practice then, as testified to by Jenkins, that a guard at an extermination camp would not have been found to have been eligible under the Displaced Persons Act; yes."
1980.79-5602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2473.304,2484.946,"Mr. Attorney General, as I listen to your statement of the test for which the Government contends on the second half of Chaunt, I think it is this... and you tell me if I'm wrong."
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2498.087,2498.856,Substantially.
1980.79-5602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2498.856,2507.543,That is the test for which Justice Clark in dissent in Chaunt contended should apply.
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2513.23,2516.75,I do not think that they rejected the test.
1980.79-5602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2609.077,2615.147,Is it your view that Justice Clark in dissent and the majority in Chaunt were applying the same test?
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2615.147,2615.531,No.
1980.79-5602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2690.11,2696.433,"There'd still be a difference because the first test is very simple: if the concealed fact itself would result in denial, that's it."
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2722.064,2723.166,"--Oh, I don't think so."
1980.79-5602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.211,2756.851,"Is there a statutory authority for denaturalizing a person on the ground that even though his application was completely true, there was at the time of the application a fact in existence which if known would have disqualified him?"
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2756.851,2758.47,--I think so; yes.
1980.79-5602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2760.203,2762.005,"Well, that was not the basis, in any event, on which this person was denaturalized."
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2762.005,2763.438,That's right.
1980.79-5602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2763.438,2771.294,"This petitioner was denaturalized for concealment of material facts or deliberate misrepresentation, was he not?"
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2771.294,2773.313,That's correct.
1980.79-5602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2782.919,2788.656,"But in the statutory language he was denaturalized on the grounds that I stated, was he not?"
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2788.656,2790.173,"--On the grounds, what, Your Honor?"
1980.79-5602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2790.173,2791.608,That I stated; denaturalized.
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2791.608,2792.725,"Yes, Your Honor, he was."
1980.79-5602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2799.378,2803.63,"Well, Mr. Attorney General, the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit said that"
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2828.129,2830.081,It is perfectly consistent with it--
1980.79-5602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2830.081,2836.151,Even though Justice Clark suggested that the majority had rejected a very similar test.
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2836.151,2837.084,--Yes.
1980.79-5602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2845.573,2872.741,"But in any event this test that the Court of Appeals applied wouldn't require actual proof of facts that would have resulted in denial of citizenship but it would require the Government to prove that they might have found facts, and the burden of the Court of Appeals argument as I understand it is that the Government must need some protection from the disappearance of facts."
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2872.741,2901.344,"Certainly many of these cases, both this case and many other cases in the field, are cases brought six, eight, ten, 15, 20 years or more after the operative facts, particularly if the concealment and misrepresentation takes place and is not only perpetuated in the naturalization but takes place at the time of entry or the time of establishing eligibility under Displaced Persons Act or under immigration quotas or other facts."
1980.79-5602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3002.809,3007.863,"Well, first of all the Government has to show that there was concealment, doesn't it?"
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3007.863,3009.148,--Exactly.
1980.79-5602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3009.148,3024.691,"Now, this isn't a case... and I don't know if there is a statute which says that regardless of how honest the applicant was, if there were in fact circumstances that would have made him ineligible for citizenship he can be denaturalized."
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3026.095,3027.312,This is not such a case.
1980.79-5602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3027.312,3028.688,This case is based upon his concealment.
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3028.688,3029.171,Yes.
1980.79-5602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3044.4,3047.088,"Mr. Attorney General, one other minor question."
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3057.112,3070.036,"Yes, he did commit a crime at the time he filled out and made his statements under oath in 1949 to the Commissioner of Displaced Persons."
1980.79-5602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3070.036,3074.59,"And is there a statute of limitations on that offense, do you happen to know?"
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3074.59,3077.459,I'm certain there must be.
1980.79-5602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3077.459,3080.628,But there's no statute of limitations on the right to denaturalize?
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3080.628,3085.163,There is no statute of limitations on the right to denaturalize; that's correct.
1980.79-5602,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3085.163,3090.45,"Mr. Attorney General, Justice Clark was not alone in dissent Chaunt, was he?"
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3090.45,3092.985,No.
1980.79-5602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3092.985,3097.203,I think I'm the only survivor.
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3099.122,3133.109,"Let me move to the second point, which is essentially that the lower court found facts and the 5th Circuit affirmed those facts without articulating it, which in and of themselves were proved by clear and convincing evidence, which would have amounted to or warranted a denial of citizenship."
1980.79-5602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3229.007,3256.507,"General Civiletti, I refer you to page 117 of the Appendix which is a part of the 5th Circuit's opinion, and it's difficult for me to tell whether the Government is arguing that the 5th Circuit found the District Court's findings were clearly erroneous or whether they simply took part of them and rejected another part of them; particularly if you look at that footnote there."
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3256.507,3257.424,On 117?
1980.79-5602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3257.424,3278.087,"On Jenkins' testimony about what would have triggered an investigation, on page 117 of the Appendix."
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3278.087,3279.753,At that point--
1980.79-5602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3279.753,3286.174,Because the District Court didn't credit all of Jenkins' testimony.
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3286.174,3286.707,--Yes.
1980.79-5602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3487.602,3491.737,"Mr. Attorney General, can I ask you a question about the the first theory."
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3514.603,3515.439,"Oh, sure."
1980.79-5602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3526.727,3529.012,But let me just finish my point.
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3535.999,3537.682,Initially--
1980.79-5602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3537.682,3538.199,And isn't it true that any--
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3538.199,3546.188,--and then would have resulted in the denial of his naturalization if it had been revealed at the time of his application for naturalization.
1980.79-5602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3546.188,3548.907,"--Well, he would never have been in a position to apply for naturalization."
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3575.224,3578.676,Depending on whether or not the--
1980.79-5602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3578.676,3583.23,It was a material fact because it would have prevented his getting the visa.
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3583.23,3590.984,--It depended on whether or not that continued until the present time and there was no change or no modification.
1980.79-5602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3590.984,3591.534,But it was never revealed.
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3592.419,3618.736,"I think the answer to that question is the Government feels that fraud conducted at that time, which ties and relates to the ground for his lawfully being in the United States for five years... which is a condition for naturalization, we can reach back and denaturalize him for that fraud and that that is the scheme and structure of the statute in 12... 1451."
1980.79-5602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3618.736,3624.64,So the test in the denaturalization proceeding is whether the concealed fact in the application for visa would have resulted in the denial of the visa.
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3628.092,3635.446,"I think it would relate if you are unlawfully here because your visa is unlawful, that is--"
1980.79-5602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3635.446,3637.048,Right; you didn't admit you were married--
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3637.048,3644.618,"--a precondition to, and one of the criteria for naturalization."
1980.79-5602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3677.858,3679.358,"--Well, I assume that in my case."
1980.79-5602,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,3684.743,3685.862,"Thank you, Your Honors."
1980.79-5602,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3685.862,3686.545,"Thank you, gentlemen."
