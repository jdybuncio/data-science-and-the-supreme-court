2012.12-135,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.42,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-135, Oxford Health Plans v. Florida."
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,9.439,11.891,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-135,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,73.096,81.0,"But -- about the parties never considering it, when this case was in the New Jersey courts, Oxford explained -- this is in the red brief at page 27 that's quoting Oxford's counsel then, that"
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,108.0,110.602,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, two things."
2012.12-135,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,145.608,146.508,Mr. Waxman--
2012.12-135,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,146.508,149.076,Finish your answer.
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,149.076,176.06,"--Yes -- that bilateral arbitration was what was requested, and -- but there was similarly no dispute that both parties -- certainly Oxford took the position based on an understanding of New Jersey law at the time, because this Court hadn't decided class action question, that the decision would be submitted in the first instance to the arbitrator as it was in Stolt-Nielsen."
2012.12-135,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,177.829,179.045,--That's my question.
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,187.368,188.887,"In the first instance, no."
2012.12-135,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,188.887,199.243,"And do you take the position that this is a -- always an arbitrator's question when all disputes are supposed to be submitted, or was just -- was there just a mistake here?"
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,199.243,201.545,"Well, I think there was a mistake here."
2012.12-135,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,207.831,213.518,So why should we rewrite our standard of review to accommodate your client's error?
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,216.787,217.906,--I'm--
2012.12-135,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,217.906,226.643,More than once we have said an error of law or fact is not a basis to say that an arbitrator exceeded his or her powers.
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,226.643,238.736,"--Oh, Justice Sotomayor, we are not asking the Court to vary in any material respect the highly deferential standard that's reflected in Section 10(a)(4) of the Federal Arbitration Act."
2012.12-135,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,275.326,287.15,"So your rule is that although we must defer to an arbitrator's interpretation of the contract, in this case, there is an exception because?"
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,287.15,300.81,"--Well, in this case, you defer, as you always do, but you -- you -- you -- you have to provide -- there is some level of review."
2012.12-135,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,337.899,347.172,"So -- so we make that rule just with reference to the word “ arbitration ” when it's in the class action context, or does this apply to other words as well?"
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,347.172,348.957,"Well, I think--"
2012.12-135,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,348.957,350.909,I'm -- I'm just not sure what the--
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,350.909,368.419,"--So, I -- I think -- I mean, this Court has recognized repeatedly that class -- that the question of class versus bilateral arbitration is a special kind of question under the FAA as to which the Federal Arbitration Act itself applies a rule of decision."
2012.12-135,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,409.161,418.803,"But there was no -- in Stolt-Nielsen, the parties stipulated that the contract said nothing on the issue of class proceeding."
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,422.255,423.071,--Correct.
2012.12-135,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,423.071,443.001,"--and the arbitrator is interpreting a term of the contract, the ordinary rule is that -- that the arbitration -- arbitrator's interpretation of a contract term, wrong or right, unless it's off the wall, is -- is not to be overturned."
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,443.001,471.651,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, the -- everyone agrees in this case, as one would have to, based on the holding in Stolt-Nielsen, that if the -- this arbitration clause in this case just said all disputes will be arbitrated, not litigated, that the arbitrator could not -- the arbitrator would be reversed if it -- if he found that that indicated an actual agreement of the parties to class arbitration."
2012.12-135,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,482.993,486.011,You're -- you're saying that this is off the wall.
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,491.915,506.674,"--Well, not to be pejorative, but I would say this: In the vernacular of Stolt-Nielsen, this language, quote, “ leaves no room ” for a conclusion that the parties agree to arbitrate on the facts--"
2012.12-135,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,506.674,526.636,"So you're saying -- you're saying that the -- that the deference which we give to arbitrator's statement of fact, like the deference we give to a lower court's adjudication of fact, has a limit, that at some point, the distortion of fact becomes an issue, a question of law rather than fact, right?"
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,526.636,527.504,--Yes.
2012.12-135,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,529.838,536.008,Do you have other examples from other -- other review that we've given to arbitrators' factual decisions?
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,536.008,537.277,Well--
2012.12-135,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.277,554.821,"I mean, I -- I don't want to adopt a special rule for -- for class actions, but if -- if you're telling me this is just a general principle, that at some point if it's too much off the wall, it becomes an error of law and -- and we can reverse it."
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,557.607,565.177,"--Well, let me -- let me -- let me refer you to Stolt-Nielsen first, and then to a hypothetical example that my brother gives."
2012.12-135,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,565.177,565.76,"No, I want a case."
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,566.343,566.81,Okay.
2012.12-135,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,568.726,570.595,--But that is a class action case.
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,573.397,574.73,"--Oh, you mean a non-class action case."
2012.12-135,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,574.73,592.34,"--I want a case where we have, or where Federal courts have with our approval, disregarded a -- a factual finding by an arbitrator because the factual finding was too much off the wall; that there was simply not enough basis to support it."
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,592.34,597.243,"Justice Scalia, I can't -- I'm sort of trying to scroll through all your arbitration decisions."
2012.12-135,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,684.431,690.335,"Yes, but it's not exactly -- this is not the only clause that provides for arbitration."
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,721.77,728.358,The fact -- the fact that the arbitration clause -- the sentence has two clauses.
2012.12-135,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,797.021,812.464,"Mr. Waxman, can I just ask you what you think the standard is under 10(a)(4), because my understanding of the standard was that a court had to find that an arbitrator was exceeding his powers, was acting outside the scope of his authority--"
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,812.464,812.864,Yes.
2012.12-135,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,812.864,825.438,"--And that we have said quite a number of times that the fact that the arbitrator committed an error and even a serious error is not enough, that he had to be doing something that was simply outside the scope of his authority."
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,836.062,844.382,"I agree with that as a proposition of what review is under 10(a)(4), that is whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority."
2012.12-135,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,874.151,885.543,"And you don't disagree, do you, that this arbitrator -- if you read his opinion, you might think it's terribly wrong, but that what he's doing is trying to construe a contract."
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,885.543,891.03,"I think that -- I mean, trying I think is not a defense."
2012.12-135,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,892.482,903.337,"Yes, but he is going -- but he's looking at the words, that he's trying to figure out what the parties agreed on when there's no explicit statement about what the parties agreed on."
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,903.337,903.503,--Right.
2012.12-135,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,960.19,968.261,So now you're saying that he exceeded his authority because he didn't apply a kind of clear statement presumption.
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,998.363,1000.682,--Justice Kagan--
2012.12-135,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1000.682,1001.667,Am I wrong?
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1001.667,1006.703,--We are not -- you didn't say the words “ clear statement ”.
2012.12-135,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1064.107,1065.807,It was a combination of the two provisions.
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1106.234,1123.78,"--Arbitration clauses that say in one form of words or another that you may not bring any dispute to court, you must bring all disputes to arbitration, is -- is utterly commonplace."
2012.12-135,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1146.228,1150.763,"Was this -- was this a -- well, was this an experienced arbitrator?"
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1150.763,1154.649,"--I -- so far as the record shows, yes."
2012.12-135,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1312.969,1330.248,"That comes under our basic thing -- as I read this, the difference was between this and Stolt-Nielsen, you have two parties here and they both say, arbitrator, you decide whether or not this language, that says nothing about it, did encompass class or not."
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1368.973,1371.242,--So the arbitrator -- so a couple of responses.
2012.12-135,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1435.434,1440.386,"Out of curiosity, Mr. Waxman, in a case like this, how is the arbitrator paid?"
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1443.271,1446.64,"I am not sure, Justice Alito, if the record shows."
2012.12-135,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1477.594,1487.2,"Mr. Waxman, how wrong does an arbitrator's decision have to be to become an issue of law?"
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1508.38,1510.648,"Yes, I do, but--"
2012.12-135,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1510.648,1511.265,All right.
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1520.171,1531.146,--If you -- so if you -- an arbitrator exceeds his powers if it -- if he decides to arbitrate a subject matter that the parties have not agreed to arbitrate.
2012.12-135,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1583.196,1589.684,"Well, of course, this was -- this was an adhesion contract, so there's no -- it was drafted by Oxford."
2012.12-135,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1635.063,1645.919,"Justice Ginsburg, neither the arbitrator nor any of the courts below made any finding about whether this is a contract of adhesion or whether this is a so-called negative value case."
2012.12-135,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1671.636,1672.236,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,1675.688,1681.777,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1728.925,1737.412,"That's -- that's all he has to do is saying, you know, I'm -- I'm interpreting the contract, and whatever he says is okay then, right?"
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,1737.412,1738.281,Justice--
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1738.281,1764.246,"I mean, we -- we were concerned in Stolt-Nielsen about a -- a -- a company betting the company, right, on -- on class action whenever -- whenever it agrees to arbitration, because class arbitration, you know, will bankrupt the company and without an appeal to the court or, you know, not -- not -- not much of an appeal anyway."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,1793.515,1803.889,"--Justice Scalia, Stolt-Nielsen taught us that the language of the contract or any other evidence has to demonstrate the -- that the parties agreed to class arbitration."
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1810.543,1827.921,"And you think that standard -- all that standard means is that the arbitrator has to say is, I am interpreting the contract, even though what he says is flatly, visibly, unquestionably contrary to what the contract says, and the court has to accept that, so long as he says, I'm interpreting the contract."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,1827.921,1833.325,--This Court's jurisprudence for almost 2 centuries has held just exactly that.
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1833.325,1834.358,Just exactly that?
2012.12-135,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1834.358,1835.444,"Well, I don't think so."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,1860.643,1863.112,"Well, there -- well, there is a basis."
2012.12-135,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1871.45,1872.85,"That's a different thing, that's a different thing."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,1898.968,1906.791,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I don't think manifest disregard -- certainly, manifest disregard is not a standard by which this matter has come up before the Court."
2012.12-135,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1920.698,1921.3,All right.
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,1938.845,1950.45,"No, Justice Breyer, because here both sides, not only in 2003, but in 2010 after Stolt-Nielsen, came to the arbitrator and said, we want you to decide it."
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1975.868,1977.303,What supports his decision?
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,1989.11,1991.493,"Justice Scalia, they did agree."
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2021.832,2022.682,I don't understand.
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2027.284,2031.937,--Oxford made that distinction in 2002.
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.949,2050.882,The top of page 6?
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2050.882,2052.151,"--The top of page 6, Your Honor."
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.151,2056.22,Yes.
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2056.22,2059.005,Plaintiff quoted the contract here as saying
2012.12-135,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2084.589,2103.617,"I think that's inconsistent with the law that's developed -- actually in fairness to the arbitrator, after he'd made his initial decision, which is that if you have something that just says disputes and doesn't address the issue of class arbitration at all, that you can't have class arbitration."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2103.617,2117.643,"The arbitrator, however, Mr. Chief Justice, cannot be faulted or his award vacated based upon changes or arguments that were never made at the time."
2012.12-135,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2134.472,2135.588,"Could you get back -- I'm sorry, go ahead."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2135.588,2136.155,--I'm sorry.
2012.12-135,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2160.12,2160.589,Can I--
2012.12-135,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2160.589,2177.415,"Getting back to Justice Breyer's question, I thought his -- First Options is fairly strong authority for him, because there you have a situation with the arbitrator determining that a particular entity or individual is bound by the agreement."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2197.495,2205.684,"Here, Mr. Chief Justice, the arbitrator did exactly what the parties had asked him to do, though."
2012.12-135,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2231.686,2232.519,--Can I see--
2012.12-135,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2232.519,2244.143,I thought that Oxford conceded that it did not preserve any question of entitlement to de novo review.
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2244.143,2246.261,That is correct.
2012.12-135,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2276.714,2280.999,"--Counsel -- counsel, you seem -- I don't know."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2361.284,2366.105,"Answering that -- answering that hypothetical, assuming that was--"
2012.12-135,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2366.105,2367.138,Was it a hypothetical?
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2368.105,2372.342,"--Well, if there was a manifest disregard--"
2012.12-135,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2372.342,2373.592,"No, I want to say why there wasn't."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2375.561,2379.33,"--Well, the arbitrator did not manifestly disregard."
2012.12-135,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2384.317,2392.59,"Look, I'm going to say something and you are going to say, that's right, that's just what I wanted, and that won't do me any good if you don't think of it."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2449.192,2454.913,"Well, I don't believe that is -- Justice Breyer, I don't believe that is a manifest disregard."
2012.12-135,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2454.913,2456.782,So -- obviously you don't.
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2459.365,2474.494,"And the reason being is that the arbitrator based his determination on the standards or the materials that were put forth before him, the agreement and the evidence, and he made a decision."
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2474.494,2475.877,But that's not enough.
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2499.109,2499.809,Yes.
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2499.809,2501.227,"Now, why is this plausible?"
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2501.227,2506.763,"Well, with all due respect, Justice Scalia, I don't think plausibility comes into play."
2012.12-135,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2506.763,2508.465,Use whatever word you want.
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2533.948,2534.398,What's a magic 8-ball?
2012.12-135,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2536.132,2545.821,"--A magic 8-ball is you have -- that's a little thing, it's the -- it's a non-sportsman's equivalent of throwing darts."
2012.12-135,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2550.475,2557.461,"Why don't you, Mr. Katz, why don't you concentrate on what the arbitrator himself said."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2564.049,2575.655,"Justice Ginsburg, what the arbitrator had found was that the “ no civil action ” part of the clause was -- was coextensive."
2012.12-135,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2591.8,2594.235,Can I ask you a question on something a little bit different?
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2604.774,2615.832,"--Well, this specific agreement was Dr. Sutter and Oxford, but there are 20,000 physicians who had signed the same agreement."
2012.12-135,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2615.832,2616.465,All right.
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2626.071,2627.304,Correct.
2012.12-135,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2627.304,2646.067,"And if we assume -- if I ask you to assume for the sake of argument that this agreement does not constitute an agreement to engage in class arbitration, where did the arbitrator get the authority to make that holding with respect to all of these absent class members?"
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2646.067,2648.184,"Well, the arbitrate--"
2012.12-135,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2648.184,2659.208,"If they didn't agree to class arbitration, how can they -- and they didn't agree to have the arbitrator decide whether the agreement calls for -- for class arbitration."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2664.029,2673.802,"--Well, the arbitrator made the decision based on the language and the evidence presented before him and finding that it authorized class arbitration."
2012.12-135,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2678.187,2686.042,"Is the -- is the contract authorized it as for Dr. Sutter, all of the others are similarly situated, they got the same contracts?"
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2686.042,2687.109,They all -- they all had the--
2012.12-135,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2687.109,2691.096,So either the contract means what the arbitrator said it meant or it doesn't.
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2694.381,2696.167,--That -- that is correct.
2012.12-135,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2698.967,2700.467,Wait a minute.
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2706.954,2708.323,"--Well, the--"
2012.12-135,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2708.323,2718.095,You're saying he can do it with respect to Oxford because Oxford agreed to have the arbitrator decide whether this calls for class arbitration.
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2725.617,2732.188,"--Well, Justice Alito, this -- this is no different than in any other contract interpretation issue."
2012.12-135,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2740.96,2743.579,But the difference is in First Options.
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2763.54,2784.823,"But Stolt-Nielsen, which the arbitrator faithfully reviewed, analyzed, and followed, makes clear that you can have class arbitration as long as the arbitrator determines that the contracting parties to that agreement establish that class arbitration is available."
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2784.823,2787.023,Did these other people agree to this arbitrator?
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2801.249,2805.486,"Well, for one thing, Justice Scalia, that's exactly what Oxford wanted."
2012.12-135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2809.771,2811.39,Could they -- could they opt out?
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2811.39,2814.358,"Well, ultimately, they could -- they could opt out when it was certified."
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2817.46,2820.496,How can they opt out if they've agreed to class arbitration?
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2820.496,2828.083,"Well, they can opt out of the class and pursue, if they wanted to at that point, an individual arbitration if that's what they chose to do."
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2828.083,2829.268,Are you sure?
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2832.97,2840.208,"Well, they -- they proceeded -- they agreed for the matter to proceed as a class proceeding."
2012.12-135,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2841.16,2844.694,"And those -- and there are rules that governed that, right?"
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2844.694,2846.646,"--That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.12-135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2851.031,2862.673,"But -- but how could -- how could they opt out if the arbitrator said -- says, as Justice Scalia and Justice Alito are suggesting, we have -- I have jurisdiction to decide this case."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2865.875,2875.731,"Justice Kennedy, the determination that this matter could proceed as a class arbitration was only the first issue that was decided."
2012.12-135,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2881.468,2885.938,"Well, presumably they could opt out, but did they agree to be bound by this unless they opted out?"
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2890.925,2895.894,"--But everyone, Justice Alito, everyone signs the same agreement."
2012.12-135,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2899.864,2906.435,"No, but I think you're -- you're not -- you're not accepting my assumption that this is an incorrect interpretation of the contract."
2012.12-135,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2944.393,2949.762,You would never have class action arbitration if that were so.
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2949.762,2952.647,--If -- if it was--
2012.12-135,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2952.647,2963.355,"It would be impossible, because you could never get in advance -- they find out that by getting notice and then they decide whether they want to stay with it or opt out."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,2963.355,2971.46,"--Well, in any class arbitration, the arbitrator is not going to decide the same questions as to the 20,000 of the same agreements."
2012.12-135,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3003.432,3006.567,"And this may not -- I'm not sure it's relevant, but it -- it might be."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,3013.587,3015.256,This has been going on 11 years.
2012.12-135,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3017.623,3034.535,"It's not -- it's not a facetious question, because I think one of the concerns about class arbitration is that it -- it eliminates the supposed benefits of arbitration, because you can't have sort of quick and rough and ready determinations when it's going to bind 20,000 people."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,3034.535,3051.662,"--Well, class arbitration is, as in many arbitrations in this day and age, involves complex issues, that sometimes you have major corporations doing battle over -- over major agreements that they know at the time involved big ticket items."
2012.12-135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3051.662,3060.185,"Well, let me ask -- ask you this question, because I think it's consistent to the answer you're giving to the Chief Justice, a little bit different, though."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,3115.772,3123.526,"Justice Kennedy, that should not bear on the decision here, because this matter comes up under 10(a)(4)."
2012.12-135,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3136.518,3139.22,How long -- can we straighten out this 11 years?
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,3144.172,3159.718,"--Well, the matter wasn't in the New Jersey courts for that long, but various points in time, because the AAA rules allow for a -- a filing of a Federal suit to vacate, Oxford, on multiple occasions--"
2012.12-135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3159.718,3164.17,But -- but tell me why -- why is that a factor or not a factor in -- in our decision?
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,3166.388,3171.073,"--Partiality is not a factor, Justice Kennedy--"
2012.12-135,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3171.073,3171.573,"Well, but surely--"
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,3171.573,3172.073,--in this decision.
2012.12-135,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3172.073,3172.823,--I'm sorry.
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,3173.656,3184.881,"In this decision, because partiality or what could potentially be perceived as a subjective intent, so the arbitrator does not play under 10(A)(4)."
2012.12-135,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3184.881,3192.169,"But under -- under -- that provision, the partiality provision, is addressed to favoring one party as opposed to another party."
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,3216.952,3237.848,"Well, arbitrators -- I would submit that an arbitrator who was doing something that was -- that was documented or perceived to be crazy -- and pardon my vernacular -- or just way out of line, then I'd submit that arbitrator is not going to be hired again."
2012.12-135,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3237.848,3242.085,How many -- how -- what is the history of class actions and arbitrations?
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,3249.256,3250.123,That's correct.
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3255.977,3257.012,How many have there been?
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,3259.029,3260.381,"Well, I don't know--"
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3260.381,3261.247,Do you have any idea?
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,3261.247,3269.57,"--Well -- I don't think there has been thousands, but there -- I know there have certainly been a number so far that the American Arbitration Association has set forth rules--"
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3269.57,3270.703,I'm sure there's been a number.
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,3271.688,3273.688,--I -- I don't -- I don't know the number.
2012.12-135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3273.688,3275.24,It could be less than 100?
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,3275.24,3277.592,"I wouldn't know that, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-135,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3361.662,3362.948,I'm sorry to just interrupt.
2012.12-135,1,22630,eric_d_katz,,3369.852,3375.922,"But here, both sides, Mr. Chief Justice, expressly asked the arbitrator."

2012.12-135,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3535.874,3537.242,What is your significant point?
2012.12-135,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3540.861,3545.848,"I can't go back 200 years, but let's just go to 1960 in terms of the standard."
