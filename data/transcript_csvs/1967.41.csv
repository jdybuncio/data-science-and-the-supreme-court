1967.41,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.272,"Number 41, Sam Umans, petitioner, versus United States."
1967.41,0,21891,edward_brodsky,,9.543,11.679,If the Court please.
1967.41,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,266.287,273.844,"Well you don’t -- you may be right, but there’s no case holding that is there?"
1967.41,0,21891,edward_brodsky,,273.844,274.891,"No, not at all."
1967.41,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,276.761,279.975,"But I thought, alright just at the analytical level."
1967.41,0,21891,edward_brodsky,,279.975,280.872,Yes.
1967.41,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,280.872,290.709,That the cases have held that that is a matter entirely for the grand jury as to on what bases they’re going to bring in on that.
1967.41,0,21891,edward_brodsky,,290.709,294.032,I think the Costello case in this Court certainly says that.
1967.41,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,295.824,303.055,But there are some decisions by various Courts of Appeals that would sustain what you have just said.
1967.41,0,21891,edward_brodsky,,303.055,304.25,"Before Costello, Your Honor?"
1967.41,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,304.25,305.019,Before Costello.
1967.41,0,21891,edward_brodsky,,305.019,309.688,There’s no decision after Costello which would sustain what I said.
1967.41,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,406.607,415.597,"But some of these people, whose affidavits were rather summarized to the grand jury testified here at trial, did they not?"
1967.41,0,21891,edward_brodsky,,415.597,416.34,All of them did Your Honor.
1967.41,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,416.34,417.158,All of them?
1967.41,0,21891,edward_brodsky,,417.158,417.46,Yes sir.
1967.41,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,417.46,420.304,"And you did obtain their affidavits, did you not?"
1967.41,0,21891,edward_brodsky,,420.304,434.47,"We obtained portions of their affidavits and the Solicitor General says and I have no reason to dispute it that the affidavits which they gave us at trial are the very same affidavits which were summarized before the grand jury, yes Your Honor."
1967.41,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,434.47,447.488,So that in that sense and to that extent you could obtain something that is substitute for the testimony of these persons before the grand jury.
1967.41,0,21891,edward_brodsky,,447.488,448.22,We did indeed.
1967.41,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,473.954,480.9,Was there any reason to think that these affidavits were not prepared specifically for the grand jury?
1967.41,0,21891,edward_brodsky,,480.9,482.643,I have no evidence one way or the other on that.
1967.41,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,482.643,494.656,So it is possible that the affidavits might not have existed if these persons have testified personally before the grand jury?
1967.41,0,21891,edward_brodsky,,494.656,497.74,I doubt that for this reason.
1967.41,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,640.1,648.807,Do you have any knowledge Mr. Brodsky whether this is a policy of the Department of Justice or is this something developed by the United States attorneys in their respect --
1967.41,0,21891,edward_brodsky,,648.807,650.85,I have no knowledge on that one way or another Your Honor.
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1711.293,1714.156,May it please the Court.
1967.41,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2003.031,2005.766,MWhat is the practice in this respect?
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2015.822,2022.402,"No Your Honor, as far as I know the practice varies with the individual U.S. attorney."
1967.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2064.616,2068.592,I’m sorry Mr. Glazer; did I understand you to say that it’s the Justice Department?
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2068.592,2069.186,"No, no."
1967.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2069.186,2069.389,No.
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2069.389,2070.994,It’s not the Justice Department.
1967.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2070.994,2072.15,This with any Justice Department --
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2072.15,2075.177,"No, as far as I know there’s no Justice Department policy."
1967.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2103.828,2118.389,"I appreciate the record wouldn’t show anything about this but how often was, before this case, was the practice followed which was followed in this case, do you know that? Is that a common place thing or --"
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2118.389,2139.425,"From the U.S. attorney’s letter of the Second Circuit, I would assume that it was common for -- to put on an agent and not offer firsthand information in cases which originated through the investigation agencies."
1967.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2153.036,2155.815,"But in any event, this is the southern district we’re talking about?"
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2155.815,2158.427,"Right, this is the southern district and this case arises out of the southern district."
1967.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2158.427,2162.487,"And the southern district is now following the admonition of the Court of Appeals, is that it?"
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2162.487,2166.146,"Right, the southern district is following the admonition of the Court of Appeals."
1967.41,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2166.146,2178.12,"Is this confined -- is it confined to tax cases? This practice, was it confined to tax cases?"
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2178.12,2178.327,This --
1967.41,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2178.327,2182.438,"Practice of using affidavits where it existed, do you know?"
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2182.438,2184.752,I don’t think it’s confined with tax cases.
1967.41,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2196.615,2210.764,"Well I understand that, but what I’d like to know is whether there are other districts too where non-tax cases this practice -- is this the right --"
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2210.764,2212.527,I would assume that in other districts --
1967.41,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2212.527,2213.637,-- shortcut.
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2213.637,2226.163,"I would assume that in other districts there are cases where U.S. attorneys use the agent, the agent instead of using firsthand witnesses."
1967.41,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2226.163,2227.785,I say non-tax case.
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2227.785,2230.697,And I would assume that it also has occurred in non-tax cases.
1967.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2232.37,2244.875,"May I ask this, I take it the Department of Justice could, I imagine, administratively establish a policy which would be binding on all U.S. attorneys I suspect, couldn’t it?"
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2244.875,2245.729,Yes it could it.
1967.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2245.729,2249.207,Any indication that it has any idea doing this?
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2249.207,2251.304,"I have no idea, no."
1967.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2299.385,2307.802,Well may I suggest I should think a more practical way would be for the Department of Justice to announce a policy in this regard and bind the U.S. attorneys too.
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2307.802,2311.826,I think that also be a solution to the problem.
1967.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2312.386,2316.489,Do you think that he could do that if the law provides otherwise?
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2316.489,2320.887,Well we certainly couldn’t bind the grand jury.
1967.41,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.029,2418.964,"But you’re never really sure, are you?"
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2418.964,2421.089,"No, because they sometimes change their mind."
1967.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2452.228,2462.034,"I ask you the question again, because I thought you answered rather quickly, the problem that I hadn’t talked about until the question was answered. So this is that."
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2485.424,2486.267,No I didn’t --
1967.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2486.267,2496.557,"Or the Department of Justice, the attorney general and the executive office could change that rule by telling his prosecuting officers not to use it?"
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2496.557,2506.391,"No, I don’t suggest that we were tried -- the Department of Justice would try to stop the grand jury from hearing hearsay evidence."
1967.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2517.082,2520.051,Or might be -- suppose the criticism was wrong?
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2520.051,2520.232,Well --
1967.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2520.232,2522.698,Suppose the law is the other way?
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2522.698,2525.176,Well I think the law is --
1967.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2525.176,2535.822,You only mean that they would have to bound to the will of judges of the Court of Appeals and violate the law.
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2535.822,2536.179,Yes.
1967.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2575.57,2587.761,"Well did they make that suggestion on the basis even though the law provided otherwise, they were going to say it, admonish the judges in that Circuit to take evidence is not being missed there under the law?"
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2587.761,2588.708,Well --
1967.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2588.708,2595.638,Where does that right come from to make that suggestion?
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2595.638,2597.64,Though I think the --
1967.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2597.64,2600.272,I’m not talking about interpretative law --
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2600.272,2621.892,"I think the right may -- I think the suggestion may have come from a case, an earlier case which they had where there was a dispute between, in the Court of Appeals as to whether there had been a witness -- an agent who testified they had deceived the grand jury."
1967.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2668.649,2679.033,I was just asking the question because I hadn’t -- the thought hadn’t occurred to me that anybody would think of this judge to have that power.
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2679.033,2683.068,Let me get to the second issue in this case.
1967.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3009.865,3024.577,"Mr. Glazer, were any of the papers turned over to the defense, affidavits or other statements of the witnesses in which they identified receipts of money from other than this petitioner?"
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3024.577,3025.609,"Yes, yes that’s right."
1967.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3025.609,3034.636,"In other words, there were some documents in which omissions of the petitioner’s name as one who paid the money appears, is that right?"
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3034.636,3038.588,"Right, in addition to the grand jury testimony --"
1967.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3038.588,3039.548,I mean at the trial?
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3039.548,3040.508,"At the – no, at the trial."
1967.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3043.413,3045.789,But you agree or do you –
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3045.789,3046.74,"Oh, sure we agree that --"
1967.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3046.74,3048.826,-- that a document in which a name was omitted that there is --
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3048.826,3082.948,"Yes, that’s right and that’s what the court, as I pointed out in the portion of the transcript it’s in page 162 and 163 of the original transcript, it isn’t printed, the court did when he noticed that one of these documents did name either accountants, he did turn over that type of material, and also that there are two other affidavits which name other accountants, don’t name petitioner one as Exhibit 107 involving the witness Ellington, the other one is 128 (a) involving --"
1967.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3082.948,3091.651,Does the record show any cross-examination of those witnesses based on the omission of petitioners then?
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3091.651,3098.912,"Well, for some reason the witness Ellington was not cross-examined except with his grand jury testimony just for two pages."
1967.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3102.237,3106.2,Including the omission of petitioner’s name from his prior --
1967.41,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3106.2,3108.695,Well he had that material.
1967.41,2,21891,edward_brodsky,,3864.243,3865.506,Nothing further Your Honor.
1967.41,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3865.506,3867.987,Very well.
