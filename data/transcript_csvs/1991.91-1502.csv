1991.91-1502,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.429,"We'll hear argument this morning in No. 91-1502, Barbara Franklin, Secretary of Commerce v. Massachusetts."
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,11.6,14.431,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-1502,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,67.576,69.066,"Mr. Roberts, may I interrupt you at this point."
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,89.059,94.633,--The instructions say you must list your permanent home or actual home at time of enlistment.
1991.91-1502,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,94.633,104.719,So that the suggestion that somebody could simply list a State whose tax laws he found attractive is not true?
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,104.719,105.751,That is not true.
1991.91-1502,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,199.903,220.997,"Mr. Roberts, as I understand the respondents in their briefs, they also make a claim that the Constitution itself is violated, and I suppose that would have to be resolved apart from any APA claim."
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,220.997,228.321,"We believe, Your Honor, that the constitutional claims are also barred by the commitment of this matter to the Secretary's discretion."
1991.91-1502,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,251.656,262.325,"Well, what does the Constitution mean in requiring an enumeration and in referring to the whole number of persons?"
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,265.467,271.631,"Well, assuming there is review, an enumeration is exactly what took place in this case."
1991.91-1502,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,423.702,439.951,"Well, what if the Secretary were to do some wholly arbitrary act like counting people who live in Massachusetts as part of the population of the State of Washington?"
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,439.951,448.769,"I think in any case in which the argument is that judicial review is precluded, you can come up with hypotheticals that seem to call for corrective action."
1991.91-1502,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,448.769,449.348,Yes--
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,449.348,454.69,But that is not enough to establish that the exception to review doesn't apply or otherwise it would never apply.
1991.91-1502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,503.764,513.471,"--But under your theory of the case, it is not necessary to do so, but what do you think the agency action would be here?"
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,513.471,516.222,"Well, I am not sure."
1991.91-1502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,535.063,538.415,"And in your view, is the President authorized to correct that?"
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,538.415,542.779,--Absolutely; he has the obligation to take care that the law be faithfully executed.
1991.91-1502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,556.468,562.082,So then I guess the next possibility is the President's transmittal of the data to Congress as the agency act?
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,562.082,571.398,"Yes, except that the President is not an agency subject to suit under the APA, and I don't understand Massachusetts to challenge that submission here."
1991.91-1502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,610.384,623.41,"Mr. Roberts, I know the President is not covered by the Administrative Procedure Act, but do you really think that that means that there is no review whatever of Presidential actions?"
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,630.717,631.398,"Well, he--"
1991.91-1502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,631.398,636.821,"I agree, he is not reviewable under the APA, but might he not be reviewable in some other fashion?"
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,636.821,651.811,"--Theoretically, in a purely ministerial task, by mandamus, but this is not a purely ministerial task, and there is no suggestion that there is any other basis for suit here, other than the APA."
1991.91-1502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,666.611,678.679,"When the APA refers to agency action, don't you think it means action binding upon private individuals somehow?"
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,693.058,701.572,"Not in the sense, for example, as the Court discussed in the Luhan case, it does have to have an effect."
1991.91-1502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,721.916,728.882,I am a little puzzled by it; how far can the President depart from what the Secretary's report would show?
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,738.225,753.937,"--The law directs him to apply, of course, a particular mathematical formula to the population figures he receives, but I don't think there is a limit on his exercise of authority to direct the Secretary of Commerce to conduct the census in a particular manner."
1991.91-1502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,767.227,776.721,"But would he have to remand it in effect to the Secretary or could he say, well, I have had somebody over at the FBI making some checks for me and they tell me there are really more people in Massachusetts, so I am going to give them extra seats."
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,776.721,782.864,I think under the law he is supposed to base his calculation on the figures submitted by the Secretary.
1991.91-1502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,782.864,783.686,"But what if he didn't, what if he did what I said?"
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,783.686,788.668,"Well, again, the manner of review is established in the statute."
1991.91-1502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,812.926,816.378,"If by law the President's action were final, would that be reviewable?"
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,816.378,821.47,"--No, it would not because he is not an agency subject to review under the APA."
1991.91-1502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,821.47,829.998,"But the President can't seize the steel mills or withhold tapes either, but his actions are subject to review in those instances."
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,829.998,833.268,"But not pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, pursuant to another--"
1991.91-1502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,833.268,836.02,"Well, but your position, he is not subject to review at all."
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,836.02,843.687,"--I think that is right, because the statutory scheme which indicates his statement is to go before Congress--"
1991.91-1502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,843.687,848.87,But my hypothetical was that his action was conclusive.
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,848.87,867.631,"--It is conclusive unless reviewed by Congress, and my submission is that by providing for a special mechanism for congressional review, and the historical fact that that is how Congress has reviewed it, indicates an intent to preclude review of that interim step in the transmission process."
1991.91-1502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,898.912,907.156,Before you get... just one more thing about this series from the census to the President to the Congress.
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,915.742,918.744,"--No, the requirement is for them to pass a new law."
1991.91-1502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,918.744,921.286,"Both houses, plus the concurrence of the President?"
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,921.286,921.866,Right.
1991.91-1502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.27,926.521,Right.
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,926.521,941.111,"However, they have specifically provided in the census and in the Apportionment Act for a mechanism, and it is a historical mechanism, for this to lie in Congress and to be addressed xx a particular period so that they can take action."
1991.91-1502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,941.111,948.774,"But no single house of Congress can just look at this stuff from the President and say this is junk, and we are not going to proceed on this basis."
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,948.774,953.067,"No, it has to be, as the statute says, a subsequent statute that has to be enacted."
1991.91-1502,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1116.423,1155.909,"Mr. Roberts, is your argument undercut by the colloquy that Massachusetts sets out on pages 12 and 13 of its brief, which as I read it indicates that counsel for the Government, counsel for your side are saying that the only so-called justification to remove the decision to count based on home of record from the realm of the arbitrary and capricious is the mere fact that Mr. Mossbacher had made a commitment to Congress to count them."
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1170.93,1173.091,I don't think that undercuts our position.
1991.91-1502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1425.236,1425.995,You have a lot of time.
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1450.972,1456.596,"No, you can file a suit for habeas corpus against the prison warden."
1991.91-1502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1456.596,1457.788,Against the prison warden.
1991.91-1502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1461.849,1466.083,"Would be reviewable to the extent it is the warden's action, yes."
1991.91-1502,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1500.263,1502.965,"Very well, Mr. Roberts."
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1505.128,1510.972,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-1502,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1580.055,1593.155,"Well, do you think the word actual in the Constitution changes the meaning of enumeration and gives that noun a meaning it wouldn't otherwise have if the word actual weren't in front of it?"
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1593.155,1595.777,"We believe so, Your Honor."
1991.91-1502,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1611.648,1646.742,"Well, but if you take the language leading up to it in Article 1, section 2, and it talks about representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union according to the respective numbers which shall be determined... determined at... and this is the actual enumeration... it seems to me you can use the word... read the word actual as simply indicating when it actually comes to enumerating rather than modifying the word enumeration the way you say it."
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1646.742,1663.31,"--I believe, Your Honor, that was required, that there be an enumeration within 3 years and then each term of 10 years afterwards, and that it would be an actual enumeration seems to have been understood by the contemporaneous interpretation of the framers, who in fact mandated that there be a head count, and dis--"
1991.91-1502,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1663.31,1665.722,How did they mandate that there be a head count?
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1665.722,1678.261,"--Through the first Census Act of 1790 passed by the First Congress in March 1990, which was implemented by a head count, actual census-taking of the entire population."
1991.91-1502,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1678.261,1684.475,And you say because that was the First Congress they probably reflected what the Constitution intended.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1684.475,1688.877,"We believe so, Your Honor, and we note that that was continued decade after decade."
1991.91-1502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1698.053,1700.316,In what respect is this not a head count?
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1703.947,1710.422,"Well, we believe, Your Honor, that it is an estimate as to where people are residing, which is the point of an apportionment census."
1991.91-1502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1710.422,1717.017,--It's where they said... they said they resided on the basis of the last information we had.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1717.017,1723.692,"Your Honor, we believe that the requirement of a decennial census requires an update every 10 years."
1991.91-1502,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1764.648,1772.602,"Well, on that theory, then, I cannot be counted as a resident of New Hampshire if they happen to take the census during the term of this Court."
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1772.602,1775.964,"--Well, Your Honor, from the first days... in fact--"
1991.91-1502,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1775.964,1777.504,Do you take it that far?
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1781.508,1781.778,"--No, Your Honor."
1991.91-1502,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1781.778,1782.019,--Okay.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1784.76,1793.566,"Someone should be counted at their usual place of abode, was what the First Congress said, and if they are temporarily absent they should be counted at the place they usually reside."
1991.91-1502,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1821.946,1827.897,"Well, what exactly was it... what is the actual language used by the First Congress on which you're relying?"
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1827.897,1832.902,"Your Honor, I believe that is set forth in the joint appendix."
1991.91-1502,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1835.664,1842.507,Is that the grey... the grey volume.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1842.507,1847.252,"No, Your Honor, in the joint appendix--"
1991.91-1502,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1847.252,1847.632,The brown volume.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1847.632,1848.922,--I believe there is a direct quotation.
1991.91-1502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.404,1901.406,"Yes, but that all depends upon what you mean by occasionally absent."
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1901.726,1902.798,"That is true, Your Honor."
1991.91-1502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1902.798,1912.555,"If occasionally absent includes absence of years, then most of the time means most of the time when he's not absent, and that could mean many years ago, couldn't it?"
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1912.555,1914.065,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-1502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.952,1948.548,Why is their overseas post their dwelling any more than the Spanish Ambassador's residence was his dwelling?
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1950.139,1951.37,"First, Your Honor--"
1991.91-1502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1951.37,1954.222,"They're assigned there, just as the Spanish Ambassador is assigned there."
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1959.956,1963.837,"--First, Your Honor, because that is where they are living and sleeping most of the time."
1991.91-1502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.788,1986.663,"Oh, so all we have to do is call U.S. bases abroad... we can deem them to be territory of the United States and you'll be happy."
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,1986.663,1990.394,"No, Your Honor, because I believe that would violate the guiding principle of usual residence."
1991.91-1502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1990.394,1990.915,"Well, I mean that's a fiction."
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2006.686,2017.081,"Well, Your Honor, I would suggest that the Court has said, for example, in the Universal Camera case that it may rely on the findings of the district court, and the district court in this case may find--"
1991.91-1502,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2017.081,2021.895,"Yes, but you have constantly talked about stipulations."
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2029.04,2041.259,"--Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice, the reason that I referred to it is because it is the facts which the Justice Department and the Massachusetts Attorney General agreed would provide a record for the Court to make a decision, and so we have relied on them."
1991.91-1502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.094,2055.007,May I ask you one other question about the 1790 act?
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2061.101,2062.873,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-1502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2062.873,2066.755,Are you saying that language applies even though he doesn't usually reside in the United States?
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2066.755,2075.92,"Your Honor, I would suggest that if someone is absent on a journey, as I am in Washington today, and if it were the census date today... my usual residence is in Massachusetts--"
1991.91-1502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2075.92,2076.411,Right.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2076.411,2080.994,"--But if I am living abroad, I've rented out my home or sold my home and I have--"
1991.91-1502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2080.994,2085.717,"I understand your argument, but I just don't think it is supported by the language, usually resides in the United States."
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2085.717,2093.411,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that this was designed for people who are occasionally absent on a journey and that is the way it has been interpreted for 200 years."
1991.91-1502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2260.543,2263.164,"Excuse me, and you say that's not constitutional?"
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2264.937,2267.628,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-1502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2267.628,2268.858,--Because I've never lived there.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2296.025,2297.587,"I understand, Your Honor."
1991.91-1502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2381.1,2385.424,Are you saying that the three... what I would call three alternatives.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2387.024,2394.01,"--Well, they are three alternatives, Your Honor, but they miss one very important alternative, which is not to use file data at all."
1991.91-1502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2394.01,2401.603,So the duty under the seat belt case is not to consider an alternative but to consider all alternatives.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2401.603,2417.896,"Or at least all the important alternatives, and the obvious other alternative was returning to the historic practice, which was, as I say, to count them as Americans... in fact, apportion them the same way as the domestic military, where they were living on the date of the census and not where they had lived years or decades before."
1991.91-1502,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2473.432,2484.347,"Mr. Golann, how about any number of other entities such as counties or school districts which may depend on census data for Federal funding?"
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2488.201,2496.196,"--Mr. Chief Justice, we would emphasize that this case involves only the constitutional apportionment census."
1991.91-1502,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2520.442,2531.719,"Can we reasonably differentiate, though, the kind of census you're talking about from the other kinds of census that these other groups justifiably rely on?"
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2531.719,2540.245,"--I believe so, Your Honor, and the reason is that the Apportionment Act, which contains the three standards I've articulated, only applies to the apportionment census."
1991.91-1502,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2547.129,2553.995,You're saying that nothing but the apportionment of the House of Representatives depends on the Apportionment Act census?
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2553.995,2556.346,"That, and votes in the Electoral College, Your Honor."
1991.91-1502,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2559.577,2566.192,"It's not used, then, for any other purposes, for allocating any sort of funds at all?"
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2566.192,2569.184,--The Secretary might have discretion if he wishes to use it.
1991.91-1502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2608.052,2609.092,May I ask one other question?
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2620.069,2624.802,It is conceivable that there might be some sort of earthquake in the census.
1991.91-1502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2637.398,2638.56,Why do you say that?
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2649.126,2652.559,"--The universe might be, I would suggest, perhaps five or six or half-dozen."
1991.91-1502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2665.148,2666.33,"Well, they had two formulas that would have worked."
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2666.33,2674.885,"Well, I don't believe either one had ever been used, and that illustrates the problems when you are very far away from qualifying for the last seat."
1991.91-1502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2683.072,2698.283,"Mr. Golann, suppose I disagree with you that somebody residing abroad can't be counted so long as he intends to return to the United States and intends to return to a particular place."
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2730.133,2732.024,"Your Honor, I would have two concerns."
1991.91-1502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2752.218,2755.728,"Well, it's... you mean there are no estimates made in the census at all?"
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2764.534,2770.829,"They do, Your Honor, and they ask very specific questions, and they check the forms against each other, as you will find in the official forms."
1991.91-1502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2784.109,2786.449,How long does the process take?
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2786.449,2791.022,--I believe it occurs over a few days in April of 1990.
1991.91-1502,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2853.733,2868.923,"Mr. Golann, would Massachusetts count for purposes of allowing them to vote military personnel with a home of record in Massachusetts?"
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2868.923,2873.545,"The standards, Your Honor... they might or might not."
1991.91-1502,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2892.159,2900.584,"But also, I suppose, true that some people with a home of record in Massachusetts would be allowed to vote there--"
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2900.584,2901.546,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-1502,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2901.546,2906.537,--Even though Massachusetts is here saying you can't count them for apportionment purposes.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2906.537,2910.02,"That, Your Honor, was decided by this Court in Carrington v. Rash."
1991.91-1502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2988.51,2995.967,"Well, it would be rare that military people have that kind of staleness."
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,2995.967,2999.211,Your Honor--
1991.91-1502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2999.211,3001.663,Military people ordinarily don't stay overseas forever.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3001.663,3006.285,"--No, Your Honor, but they move around, and in this voluntary Army--"
1991.91-1502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3006.285,3013.799,"Well, you think a very high percentage of military people stay out of the United States for 15 years?"
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3013.799,3017.111,"--No, but they move from one--"
1991.91-1502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3017.111,3017.691,All right.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3025.879,3029.85,"--Your Honor, I don't know, and I'd have to refer to personal experience, which I don't wish to."
1991.91-1502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3029.85,3034.873,"Well, when they come back they're going to be counted where they live."
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3034.873,3035.594,That's right.
1991.91-1502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.145,3044.33,"They won't be any longer any problem about them, but when they're overseas for 4 years, what's wrong with the home of record?"
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3044.33,3046.23,--The problem with home of record is--
1991.91-1502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3046.23,3047.943,"Certainly it won't be staleness, will it?"
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3047.943,3051.446,"--Well, Your Honor, the record--"
1991.91-1502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3051.446,3052.595,"Well, will it, or not?"
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3052.595,3053.797,"--Yes, it will, Your Honor."
1991.91-1502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3053.797,3055.517,"What, 4 years stale, is that it?"
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3055.517,3059.79,"No, because it's a record... it's not where they lived just before they left the United States."
1991.91-1502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3059.79,3061.08,"Well, that isn't staleness."
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3063.022,3066.964,"Your Honor, I believe--"
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3066.964,3068.546,That's just plain inaccuracy.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3068.546,3086.387,"--It is where they lived when they first entered the military, and if they entered the military 10 or 15 years before, it's where they lived 10 or 15 years before, not the last place they lived in the United States before going overseas, not the place they're going to go back to, and when they return, Your Honor, again the--"
1991.91-1502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3086.387,3097.684,"You think a military person who enters and has a home of record, and he might have established a domicile while he's in the service in some other State--"
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3097.684,3099.534,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-1502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3099.534,3105.999,--And he would still be counted if he went overseas as being in the State of his home of record.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3105.999,3118.088,"Indeed, he would have to be, because he could not change the home of record until he broke military service, left the military for at least one day and then after being out of the military, if he reenlisted he could name again, but otherwise not."
1991.91-1502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3118.088,3125.724,So he might have been counted a couple of times in some other State while he was in the military in this country.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3125.724,3128.747,If he were in this--
1991.91-1502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3128.747,3129.485,He might have been counted in a couple of--
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3129.485,3130.005,--No.
1991.91-1502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3130.005,3132.277,--States other than his home of record.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3132.277,3135.499,"Your Honor, if he were in the domestic military--"
1991.91-1502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3135.499,3135.75,Yes.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3135.75,3136.341,--That's correct.
1991.91-1502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3198.611,3206.105,What if I think they should have been counted where they intended to reside when they came back to the United States?
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3207.877,3211.508,He should not have used home of record data.
1991.91-1502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3211.508,3212.299,I know that.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3212.299,3212.89,He should have enumerated--
1991.91-1502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3212.89,3213.841,I know you believe that.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3215.541,3220.684,"--He should have conducted an actual enumeration and asked the question Your Honor posed, where do you plan to live when you come back?"
1991.91-1502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3220.684,3222.566,What if there was no time to do that?
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3222.566,3229.6,"If there is no time now, in that case they should not be counted... or not apportioned back to States at all."
1991.91-1502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3229.6,3230.121,At all.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3231.803,3240.589,"That is preferable because the decennial census is a snapshot, and a snapshot of the population on April 1990, and that didn't happen."
1991.91-1502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3240.589,3249.833,Why is that snapshot closer to... in focus than the snapshot of using stale data but at least some data?
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3249.833,3257.089,Because for one thing it involves the problem... and this was the reason for some other variations from usual residence of double counting.
1991.91-1502,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3285.068,3293.764,So that no data except that gathered on essentially an account made every 10 years will ever suffice on your theory.
1991.91-1502,1,20921,dwight_golann,,3293.764,3295.594,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-1502,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3298.526,3301.808,"Thank you, Mr. Golann."
1991.91-1502,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3304.67,3309.632,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-1502,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3414.653,3423.299,"Mr. Roberts, do you think we have to vote this method of enumeration up or down to decide this case?"
1991.91-1502,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3423.299,3424.667,--Absolutely not.
1991.91-1502,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3431.912,3433.074,What if we don't agree with that?
1991.91-1502,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3447.985,3453.786,"Well, if you agree, if that is your view, you should still reverse because this matter was not remanded to the Secretary."
1991.91-1502,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3453.786,3454.157,"Yes, all right."
1991.91-1502,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3462.484,3463.623,Correct.
1991.91-1502,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3463.623,3475.611,"--And it should have been remanded, but we could remand without deciding whether this home of record approach is correct."
1991.91-1502,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3475.611,3482.737,"You could remand to the Secretary, yes, of course, but that is not what the district court did, and if you disagree with us--"
1991.91-1502,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3482.737,3483.996,I understand that.
1991.91-1502,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3490.141,3493.984,"--Yes, we wouldn't consider that a resounding victory."
1991.91-1502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3544.147,3548.267,--I think Mr. Golann is saying inaccuracy in not counting is okay.
1991.91-1502,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3564.59,3568.243,I would say in every instance of the census.
1991.91-1502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3572.126,3573.316,"Well, that's fine, but those are noses you haven't counted."
1991.91-1502,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3574.227,3580.97,"When we give you the census form and it says list the people in your house, I mean, just as on the answered home of record, maybe people lie."
1991.91-1502,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3614.933,3624.2,"The one thing about the home of record, some of that data is more than 10 years old, and how do you respond to the requirement of a census every 10 years, his argument there?"
1991.91-1502,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3624.2,3627.465,The home of record data is current data.
1991.91-1502,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3640.952,3642.154,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
