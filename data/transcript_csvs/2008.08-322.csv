2008.08-322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.322,"We will hear argument this morning in Case 08-322, Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District v. Holder."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,9.074,22.878,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: After more than 20 years of steadfast compliance with the Voting Rights Act, Northwest Austin MUD Number One is entitled to be free from the intrusive burdens of preclearance."
2008.08-322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,45.695,53.724,"It may be (.) it may be a political subdivision under those decisions, but it's certainly not a political subdivision under the statutory definition."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,53.724,57.019,"--Well, we disagree with that, Your Honor."
2008.08-322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,69.872,72.231,Bailout wasn't involved in those cases.
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,99.406,106.609,"--Justice Ginsburg, the term ""governmental unit"" doesn't actually appear in the provision that authorizes bailout."
2008.08-322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,136.892,143.969,"Yes, but the (.) but the statute does use the term ""governmental unit"" to encompass districts."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,151.013,157.697,"Again, I disagree with Your Honor that (.) that the term ""governmental unit"" appears in the provision that defines criteria."
2008.08-322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,157.697,165.414,"It appears in the statute twice, suggesting that Congress had in mind three categories."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,165.414,180.126,"Again, the statute that defines who's eligible to bailout says a State, a political subdivision that has been separately designated for coverage under 4(b), and a political subdivision that has not been separately designated for coverage."
2008.08-322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,232.212,253.598,"Well, to the extent we have some latitude in construing the Act, certainly it would be a relevant factor if we concluded that it's just unworkable or impractical to have an uncovered jurisdiction within a county which is a covered jurisdiction."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,265.81,275.196,"Well, certainly we believe that the purposes of the Act suggest that we should be considered a political subdivision eligible to bail out."
2008.08-322,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,328.987,337.796,"And how do you account for the fact that if your district were located in a separately covered political subdivision, you clearly could not bail out."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,337.796,353.885,"--Well, I (.) I (.) again, the Court doesn't need to reach that question yet, but I'm not sure that the answer is that we clearly couldn't if we were a separately designated or (.) excuse me (.) if we were in a separately designated county that says (.) that's it's not in a covered State, right?"
2008.08-322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,389.058,398.523,There is (.) the district court had some assistance from the legislative development of this latest extension.
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,410.518,415.295,"--I don't know that there was a specific legislative proposal, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.08-322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,420.776,423.416,And what was the reason that it was resisted?
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,423.416,427.042,--I don't know that the record actually shows that it was resisted.
2008.08-322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,492.532,501.589,The Department of Justice has (.) does it (.) does it not have a regulation that contradicts your reading?
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,508.757,521.942,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but unlike the Attorney General's regulations that relate to preclearance, bailout is not something that the Attorney General actually has any specific say in."
2008.08-322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,544.398,559.829,"If we find that you're not covered by the bailout provision, that only the county is, do you really then have standing to proceed to question the workability of the bailout procedures?"
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,566.611,575.747,"--Well, with respect to our constitutionality issue, Justice Kennedy, one thing nobody is contesting here is that we are not subject to preclearance."
2008.08-322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,592.301,594.145,"Well, has preclearance been denied to you?"
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,594.145,596.582,"Well, we didn't seek a preclearance--"
2008.08-322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,596.582,597.268,Exactly.
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,607.033,613.089,"--Well, there is certainly a possibility we may seek to preclear things in the future, but this is primarily--"
2008.08-322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,613.089,614.544,Then isn't (.) isn't that the time for litigating?
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,614.544,616.342,"--No, Justice Souter."
2008.08-322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,623.57,627.755,"But it's not affecting anything you're doing on a day-to-day basis, as I understand it."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,649.311,652.233,"--I agree with (.) I disagree with that as well, Justice Souter."
2008.08-322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,665.382,674.128,"What was the last time the district applied for preclearance, the last year?"
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,674.128,684.373,"The contract in 2004 by which we asked the county to actually perform the elections itself, that was precleared, Your Honor."
2008.08-322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,684.373,687.762,And so 2004 is the last year.
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,693.747,694.371,That's correct.
2008.08-322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,695.011,702.962,But you're subject to preclearance and you cannot make changes without going to the Attorney General and asking for his permission.
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,702.962,703.648,--That's correct.
2008.08-322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,703.648,712.474,"Is it any different from, from a (.) a Federal law prohibiting certain speech?"
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,721.656,722.982,"No, Justice Scalia."
2008.08-322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,722.982,738.838,"But the suit (.) correct me if I'm wrong, and I may be wrong on this, but I thought this suit eventuated from the fact that you had been denied bailout and that your entire case was brought on the refusal of bailout."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,751.067,753.457,"I do think you're wrong about that, Justice Souter."
2008.08-322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,759.329,759.672,Right.
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,759.672,765.795,--and this lawsuit seeks the bailout and the declaratory judgment that if we cannot bail out--
2008.08-322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,765.795,767.811,You separately asked for declaratory judgment?
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,767.811,768.357,--Yes.
2008.08-322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,771.668,790.659,"You don't challenge (.) if you have bailout, say we accept your reading of the statute, you are not contesting the constitutionality of the act if it matched your obligation to preclear with the right to bail out."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,790.659,792.815,"--Well, that's not exactly right either, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.08-322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,806.682,821.068,But I (.) I thought I just heard you say even if you got the bailout the extension for another 25 years would still be unconstitutional.
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,834.5,835.186,No.
2008.08-322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,850.353,852.618,"Well Mr. Coleman, this is important to me."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,860.273,862.067,"I do acknowledge that, Justice Souter."
2008.08-322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,862.067,867.113,"Well, presumably you wouldn't have standing to raise it because you wouldn't be subject to the preclearance requirement."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,867.113,867.534,Right.
2008.08-322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,898.601,901.756,"Mr. Coleman, may I just raise a basic point here."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,995.106,1005.322,"--Our answer, Your Honor, is (.) is a very clear one and that is there is a difference between a nondiscrimination statute and a noncircumvention statute."
2008.08-322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1030.077,1049.321,"Well, the evidence that I've been getting into is a pretty good indication (.) I would have thought Congress thought so and I would have thought so too (.) that there is something to be concerned about on the issue of circumvention; that in fact the attitudes have not so radically changed as to render circumvention irrelevant."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1049.321,1053.38,"--I honestly disagree with you, Justice Souter, on that."
2008.08-322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1054.834,1067.86,"But there was (.) but there was (.) Congress fastened on that issue and it referred to second generation discrimination, which is a frequent pattern with discrimination."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1096.037,1139.937,"--Justice Ginsburg, the Court in Katzenbach recognized that Congress had been trying for several years to try to fix this problem and it walked through, as this Court has walked through innumerable times, that section 5 is simply not about nondiscrimination, but it was about the unremitting and ingenious defiance of statutes in a way that made ordinary enforcement mechanisms, including litigation, simply ineffective, that no matter what the courts did, in the South the enforcement mechanisms were unable to allow minority individuals to register and get out and vote, that no matter what happened (.) preclearance put a stop to that."
2008.08-322,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1144.126,1145.701,"No, I'll ask you that question because I'd like to hear your answer to that."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1145.701,1157.383,"--Notwithstanding that record, it is not the kind of record (.) Congress put together what it believed was a discrimination record, but not a circumvention record."
2008.08-322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1170.334,1188.014,But if you take the multiple devices (.) take the one as simple as moving the election day so that it will coincide with the (.) with the holiday of a predominantly minority college.
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1204.271,1205.663,"Two points on that, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.08-322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1222.03,1231.853,"Perhaps they (.) perhaps they wouldn't if the only tool in the arsenal were section 2, if everything had to be a Federal lawsuit."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1231.853,1234.509,"--And that gets at the heart of one of our arguments, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.08-322,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1234.93,1236.431,"Can I ask you this question for a second, please?"
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1324.349,1328.752,"--Well, I'm obviously not going to have time to respond to all of that, Justice Breyer."
2008.08-322,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1328.752,1329.408,Whatever you want.
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1329.408,1339.871,"But, for instance, with respect to the first point that you raised, which is voter registration and turnout issues, those numbers don't tell the whole story."
2008.08-322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1416.169,1425.399,"Well, Justice Breyer (.) Justice Breyer did refer you to some other more current statistics, submissions, Title V suits, and so forth."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1442.735,1443.25,--That's--
2008.08-322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1443.25,1455.667,"And that (.) that's part of the showing, it seems to me, that the Congress has to make, that these States that are now covered and that were covered are markedly different from the noncovered jurisdictions."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1460.962,1464.476,--The only comparative data that existed was of two kinds.
2008.08-322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1528.076,1530.7,What kind of coverage formula would be adequate?
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1542.149,1557.642,"Well, just to give one example (.) and I'm not (.) not recommending this (.) but if, for instance, the same coverage formula had been applied to the 2000 and 2004 elections, equalizing for citizen voting age population, the only covered State would have been Hawaii."
2008.08-322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1569.091,1582.287,"There was (.) and maybe the government will refer to it (.) I thought, quite a bit of evidence comparing covered and noncovered in this record."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1582.287,1583.836,"I wouldn't say quite a bit, Your Honor."
2008.08-322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1588.27,1593.83,"Well, you said all that there was was a number of section 2 suits, but I think there was quite a bit more than that."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1593.83,1595.249,I (.) I actually dispute that.
2008.08-322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1626.126,1633.281,In your (.) in your answer you said if they used the 2004 the only State would be Hawaii.
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1654.101,1663.284,It needed to make an evaluation of where there is an actual risk of backsliding and where there is actual evidence of circumvention.
2008.08-322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1665.113,1667.986,"What about the evidence that Justice Breyer summarized, that I alluded to?"
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1682.4,1683.106,--That evidence--
2008.08-322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1683.106,1683.87,It has never stopped.
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1683.87,1699.378,"--That evidence justifies strict enforcement of nondiscrimination statutes, but it does not justify a presumption that State and local officials in these areas are so racist that they cannot be relied on to pass and enforce fair voting laws."
2008.08-322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1699.378,1706.783,They couldn't (.) they couldn't be relied upon apparently in the some 200 cases in which the voting change was withdrawn after DOJ objection.
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1706.783,1713.498,"Again, this (.) this information that goes out over 30 years and across thousands upon thousands of jurisdictions--"
2008.08-322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1713.498,1714.434,This wasn't information over 30 years.
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1722.135,1724.51,--From (.) from 1982 forward.
2008.08-322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1724.51,1725.025,"Yes, that's correct."
2008.08-322,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1725.025,1728.149,So you have 25 years across thousands of jurisdictions.
2008.08-322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1739.597,1740.736,"Thank you, Mr. Coleman."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1750.407,1767.523,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: And let me begin where Mr. Coleman left off, because I don't think that his argument adequately grapples either with this Court's consistent upholding of the provision at issue 4 times over 4 decades or with Congress's action in 2006."
2008.08-322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1801.729,1811.598,"Counsel, the (.) the (.) our (.) our decision in City of Boerne said that action under section 5 has to be congruent and proportional to what it's trying to remedy."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1826.217,1828.467,"I (.) I disagree with that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.08-322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1849.365,1852.474,"Well, that's like the old (.) you know, it's the elephant whistle."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1867.684,1869.529,"Well, let me suggest another example."
2008.08-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1904.39,1906.106,"No, the parallel (.) the parallel isn't there."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1922.43,1923.351,--Absolutely.
2008.08-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1940.032,1940.921,A long time ago.
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1948.093,1953.446,Quite a bit of evidence about the ineffectiveness of section 2 as a remedy.
2008.08-322,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1980.342,1985.684,"Well, if section 2 is ineffective, then why didn't Congress extend section 5 to the entire country?"
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2000.334,2001.239,--I don't believe so.
2008.08-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2010.332,2011.69,"Not comparative, however."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2015.094,2018.889,"--Well, I disagree with that for several reasons."
2008.08-322,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2039.255,2040.772,"Well, it's 18 percent."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2062.84,2077.946,"Well, again, I think that what Congress found is that the rate in Texas coupled with its historical amount of discrimination together justified (.) justified the reauthorization of section 5."
2008.08-322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2077.946,2081.035,"Well, let me focus on that historical aspect."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2094.905,2106.51,"Again, I think what this Court has (.) has answered that question in Katzenbach by saying it may be the case that there are other jurisdictions discriminate more, Congress can deal with the problem one step at a time."
2008.08-322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2116.742,2123.816,"Well, so your answer is that Congress can impose this disparate treatment forever because of the history in the south?"
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2123.816,2125.177,--Absolutely not.
2008.08-322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2125.177,2128.079,When can they (.) when can they (.) when do they have to stop?
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2128.079,2134.201,"Well, Congress here said 25 years was (.) 25 years was the appropriate reauthorization period."
2008.08-322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2134.201,2137.122,"Well, they said five years originally and then another 20 years."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2141.981,2149.401,"Well, again, if Congress can't make the findings, then I think this Court would be well within its powers to (.) to strike it down."
2008.08-322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2164.129,2168.594,"Well, is the burden that the Act puts on the State irrelevant consideration?"
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2168.594,2169.705,It certainly is.
2008.08-322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2170.282,2178.058,"How many people in the Department of Justice (.) what's the Department of Justice budget for preclearance processes each year, do you know?"
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2178.058,2179.529,--I don't know what the budget is.
2008.08-322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2183.276,2184.01,Thirty attorneys.
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2194.225,2196.944,"--Again, I don't quarrel with that, but Congress certainly--"
2008.08-322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2196.944,2199.334,But you think that is (.) that is relevant?
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2199.334,2202.048,--I (.) I certainly think the burden on the States is relevant.
2008.08-322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2210.109,2221.791,But yet (.) yet the Congress has made a finding that the sovereignty of Georgia is less than the sovereign dignity of Ohio.
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2238.208,2240.08,I wouldn't put it at all in those terms.
2008.08-322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2256.042,2256.466,"Well, then my point stands."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2280.424,2281.11,But (.) but--
2008.08-322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2281.11,2288.781,"This is (.) this is a great disparity in treatment, and the government of the United States is saying that our States must be treated differently."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2292.56,2298.963,"--Justice Kennedy, their burden is the same as it has always been in South Carolina versus Katzenbach and City of Rome."
2008.08-322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2315.738,2323.639,"No one (.) no one questions the validity, the urgency, the essentiality of the Voting Rights Act."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2331.371,2333.824,And Congress did show precisely that.
2008.08-322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2351.551,2362.746,"Well, why didn't Congress then extend the Act to Massachusetts, whereas your brother told us the disparity between Hispanic and non-Hispanic voting is far greater than jurisdictions that are covered?"
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2362.746,2369.731,"--Because that (.) because, again, that is only one aspect of the overall problem, the amount of registration rates or something like that."
2008.08-322,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2399.015,2401.734,Wouldn't you agree that there is some oddities in this coverage formula?
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2407.778,2414.774,"There (.) there (.) there are certainly some oddities, as there always have been, from Katzenbach and from City of Rome."
2008.08-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2424.457,2426.878,"--Oh, let's talk about the bailout provision."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2429.706,2430.642,--That's correct.
2008.08-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2430.642,2431.862,How many years is that?
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2443.197,2446.247,"There (.) there have been 18 under the new provision, which is--"
2008.08-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2446.247,2449.62,You bring this before us as a justification for the legislation.
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2449.62,2450.306,--I am saying--
2008.08-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2450.306,2452.042,It's obviously quite impracticable--
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2452.042,2452.557,--Again--
2008.08-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2452.557,2454.023,--for anybody to bail out.
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2454.023,2459.302,"--Justice Scalia, that precise argument was made to Congress in 2006 and it was rejected."
2008.08-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2459.817,2462.566,"The question is whether it's right, not whether Congress rejected it."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2463.222,2476.499,"--And I think it's not right because what the testimony found was that States are able to bail out, but they don't, and this goes back to my point to Justice Kennedy, because today States are finding that preclearance actually serves their interests; it increases--"
2008.08-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2476.499,2478.78,"It fends off Section 2 suits, I assume."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2501.176,2503.095,"--Well, I don't think that's a quite fair characterization."
2008.08-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2516.589,2517.354,"Well, they get elected under this system."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2519.042,2520.337,--Excuse me?
2008.08-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.337,2526.601,"I say, everybody who voted for this (.) this system was elected under this system."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2529.412,2536.1,"Well, I think that we shouldn't (.) this Court should be loathe to second-guess the motivations of Congress under--"
2008.08-322,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2536.1,2564.476,"We have (.) we have before us the representations of the county in which the district is located, and of several of the covered jurisdictions, that they don't seek bailout because they think that the benefits, many of which have nothing to do with districting, outweigh whatever burden preclearance puts on them."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2593.855,2608.631,"--That's precisely right, Justice Ginsburg, and what the covered jurisdictions also say is something about how this (.) the test before this Court shouldn't be the narrowest time slice of today, but rather the test should be to think about historically what has happened."
2008.08-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2608.631,2613.754,We are not insisting that they (.) the other side is not insisting that they be kicked out.
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2621.608,2622.001,But--
2008.08-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.001,2634.323,"If you want to make this a voluntary system that's something entirely different, but the question is assuming a State or (.) or a covered jurisdiction does not want to be in, do you have the right to coerce them to be in?"
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2635.088,2635.462,"--Yes, and--"
2008.08-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2635.462,2636.511,"If they want to stay in, that's fine."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2636.511,2648.147,--And this Court has recognized and the brief of the covered jurisdictions recognizes the fact that it's a separate sovereign requiring in this provides an additional deterrent element and increases the integrity of the elections.
2008.08-322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2660.17,2672.914,"Well, the overall historical record, Katzenbach said there had been unremitting and ingenious defiance, and that was certainly true as of the time of the Voting Rights Act."
2008.08-322,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2698.951,2700.324,--That is correct.
2008.08-322,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2750.162,2752.647,Could I ask you this question about (.) about bailout?
2008.08-322,2,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2784.758,2791.615,"Again, this Court has repeatedly said that this Congress, of the United States, can legislate on the State-by-State level."
2008.08-322,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2811.167,2819.82,"If it's the case that there is no discrimination going on, no evasion going on in this little utility district, is there any good reason why they shouldn't be able to bail out?"
2008.08-322,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2819.82,2833.971,"Yes, absolutely, because that's what City of Rome argued in 1980, and what this Court said in rejecting precisely that argument over Justice Powell's dissent, was that it's not that discrimination can't be to be at the individual unit-by-unit level."
2008.08-322,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2837.735,2838.596,That was 1980?
2008.08-322,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2838.596,2839.594,That's correct.
2008.08-322,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2839.594,2840.14,Why--
2008.08-322,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2840.14,2844.858,"The bailout provision was adopted in 1982, 27 years ago."
2008.08-322,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2852.214,2854.65,First of all there was a bailout provision at issue in 1980.
2008.08-322,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2861.524,2862.741,Less than one a year?
2008.08-322,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2862.741,2873.344,"--that (.) no, what they contemplated was to make it easier for political divisions to bail out, and what Congress (.) what Congress anticipated, certainly more than one a year, that didn't materialize."
2008.08-322,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2884.528,2893.649,"Counsel, I thought (.) I thought our opinion in City of Boerne said that the problem that Section 5 legislation addresses has to be widespread and persisting."
2008.08-322,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2900.535,2901.132,I do.
2008.08-322,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2906.33,2911.828,"In covered States as opposed to noncovered States, if I can add that to the Chief Justice's question, please."
2008.08-322,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2911.828,2918.528,--I do agree that they went State by State and showed (.) showed tremendous amounts of discrimination in those places.
2008.08-322,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2933.79,2935.771,Just one thing on bailout.
2008.08-322,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2974.914,2981.021,"Justice Kennedy, the only evidence in the record is that the bailout provision works nothing like the way that it might be hypothesized."
2008.08-322,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3007.572,3008.586,"What I understand it, is this incorrect?"
2008.08-322,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3036.355,3046.603,"--For the way the statute works, they have to go to the 107 subunits, which is absolutely feasible because they are under contract with all 107 subunits to administer their elections."
2008.08-322,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3050.646,3056.27,"Travis County is not the superior of many of those subunits, as it is not of this district here."
2008.08-322,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3060.205,3062.158,"--Again, I think that's a distinction without a difference."
2008.08-322,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3073.981,3076.231,--And the number is 18 now?
2008.08-322,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3076.231,3077.603,The number is 18.
2008.08-322,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3077.603,3079.557,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3093.413,3103.704,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our long experience demonstrates that racial discrimination in voting has been persistent and adaptive."
2008.08-322,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3149.718,3151.449,I think that's absolutely right.
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3169.565,3182.516,"--As (.) as the Court said in Katzenbach when it first was presented with this question of the coverage formula, Congress is permitted to use so much of its power as is necessary to target the problem as it finds it."
2008.08-322,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3198.399,3204.24,So is it your (.) is it your position that today southerners are more likely to discriminate than northerners?
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3204.24,3208.615,"I wouldn't frame it in that way, Justice (.) Chief Justice Roberts."
2008.08-322,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3229.075,3230.51,So your answer is yes?
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3230.51,3240.727,--I think that it's fair to say that the pattern has been more repetitious violations in the covered jurisdictions and (.) and more one off discrimination in other places.
2008.08-322,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3280.335,3290.906,So (.) but I guess that point depends upon the assumption that shortening the time period for early voting is discriminatory as opposed to good policy.
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3290.906,3307.166,"I think in the context of that circumstance, Justice (.) Chief Justice Roberts, the issue was that you had a long-standing incumbent and that the early voting (.) the timing of the early voting period was such that it was going to conflict with a (.) a holiday of (.) of a--"
2008.08-322,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3307.166,3310.321,So that was largely to protect the incumbent.
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3310.321,3318.055,"--To protect the incumbent, but to disadvantage the community that was prepared to exercise its voice, as this Court found in the LULAC opinion."
2008.08-322,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3318.757,3319.303,"Well, incumbent--"
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3319.303,3320.382,--the incumbent was not the candidate of choice.
2008.08-322,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3320.382,3324.364,--Incumbent protection takes place in the North as well as the South.
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3324.364,3334.67,"By all means, but the (.) but the incumbent protection in this instance was designed to cut off the minority community, the Latino voters who had been disadvantaged by virtue of that plan."
2008.08-322,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3337.014,3341.327,"Mr. Adegbile, what was (.) I read it in the briefs, and I forget what it was."
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3349.024,3354.133,"It was (.) it was 33 to 390, I believe."
2008.08-322,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3354.133,3355.774,--33 to 390.
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3387.617,3388.338,Well--
2008.08-322,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3388.338,3389.29,Twenty-five years from now?
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3391.318,3395.304,"--Justice Scalia, I think some members of Congress did of course vote against the Act."
2008.08-322,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3395.304,3398.458,Thirty-three members of the House and nobody in the Senate.
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3398.458,3401.035,"Thirty-three members of the House, indeed."
2008.08-322,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3439.505,3449.843,"But the question is, do you agree that this is unlike access to buildings by people who are in wheelchairs?"
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3473.864,3477.487,--Congress had a more specific reason as I understand the record.
2008.08-322,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3567.772,3597.303,"So what is the reason in your opinion if you had to summarize it in ray sentence or two, you would say that the reason that Congress didn't go into other States and decide which ones to add to this or go into these States district by district and decide which ones to subtract from this, the reason that Congress didn't modify voting rights statute but simply renewed it?"
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3597.303,3604.708,Is that it wanted to stay the course of ridding the covered jurisdictions from discrimination.
2008.08-322,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3620.969,3636.539,Would you say from your experience and I'm sure you're very knowledgeable about this that there is no great are discrimination in voting in Virginia than in North Carolina or in Tennessee or in Arkansas or in Ohio?
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3636.539,3652.969,"--I can't precisely quantify the quantum of discrimination in each of those stays but I think that Congress' judgment was there had been a demonstrated pattern of discrimination in the covered jurisdictions, covering formula had--"
2008.08-322,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3652.969,3656.626,Wasn't Virginia the first State in the Union to elect a black governor.
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3656.626,3658.919,"--Yes, indeed it was."
2008.08-322,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3658.919,3664.356,And it has a black chief justice of the supreme court currently.
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3664.356,3666.497,"Yes, Justice Scalia, I take the point."
2008.08-322,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3709.885,3741.574,"Well, the brief filed by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the first 15 pages I think makes a good demonstration of discrete discriminatory acts; and the brief filed by Nathaniel, Professor Percelly, makes an important point about crossovers in different (.) my concern is it's just not clear to me that Congress addressed this for the rest of the country."
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3743.48,3754.492,I think the close (.) the best evidence of the comparison question to which you're returning is the section 2 cases that were examined in a report that was submitted to Congress.
2008.08-322,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3805.611,3811.921,"Well, the cases you're talking about include both intentional and impact cases."
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3843.908,3846.049,I think there are two responses.
2008.08-322,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3897.557,3898.244,Thank you.
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3905.742,3908.035,"Approximately 10 months, Justice Breyer."
2008.08-322,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3908.035,3918.315,And how long would it have taken Congress in your opinion to have compiled the record to figure out what's happening in this respect in every State or in these States district by district?
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3918.315,3925.014,"I think that I can't put a precise time on it, but it would have been certainly a couple more years."
2008.08-322,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3937.149,3952.595,"So your position is that it makes no difference if discrimination in the noncovered jurisdiction is more widespread and more persistent; it doesn't matter, because Congress can focus solely on the jurisdictions that have been covered since 1965?"
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3952.595,3955.001,I make a slightly different point.
2008.08-322,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3982.488,3991.251,So I guess your answer is that they can address the covered jurisdictions that have been covered since 1965 without looking at all to the rest of the country?
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3991.251,4000.781,"I think that if things were flipped and discrimination was much worse outside, that would reflect on the reasonableness of Congress' judgment."
2008.08-322,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4004.389,4005.512,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-322,4,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,4005.512,4006.327,Thank you.
2008.08-322,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4006.327,4011.789,"Mr. Coleman, have you 5 minutes."
2008.08-322,5,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4011.789,4024.989,"But, as Justice Alito pointed out, Congress didn't know, because it didn't ask, whether discrimination is worse in Tennessee or Arkansas than in Virginia and other States."
2008.08-322,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4048.839,4050.745,You should have a chance to answer the same question.
2008.08-322,5,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4054.29,4055.866,"--Oh, I strongly disagree with that."
2008.08-322,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4075.671,4080.374,"Well, they now have 25 years to look at, or 24 years, to look at the rest of the country."
2008.08-322,5,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4083.263,4084.683,"No, nobody is doing that."
2008.08-322,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4096.428,4103.74,"Well, this Court said (.) it was not 1982, it was two thousand something."
2008.08-322,5,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4109.518,4122.497,"Congress' justification simply does (.) I think as we've heard from counsel, in light of our mobile society and the fact that people don't live in the same place people lived 40 years ago."
2008.08-322,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4123.729,4125.745,Let me ask this question just as sort of background.
2008.08-322,5,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4134.647,4140.391,--Well the only standards that exist are whether they use a test or devise in the 1960s.
2008.08-322,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4140.391,4140.676,Correct.
2008.08-322,5,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4147.501,4150.546,I don't think we've challenged the action that took place--
2008.08-322,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4150.546,4156.34,"Well, you have a history that some States are covered and some are not because of certain requirements that the statute imposed."
2008.08-322,5,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4163.148,4165.851,"--No, Justice Stevens, we do challenge that."
2008.08-322,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4166.303,4170.101,Then why is it relevant there are a lot of States out there that are not covered?
2008.08-322,5,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4170.101,4192.263,"--Because this Court's discussions of these issues in Morris and in Garrett and even in Hibbs indicate that it does matter what the evidence shows with respect to a coverage determination, and Congress' decision to not update it, which we believe was for political reasons, simply bears no resemblance to reality."
2008.08-322,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4197.011,4203.836,Are you arguing the statute is unconstitutional because Congress failed to extend it to other (.) other parts of the country?
2008.08-322,5,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4203.836,4204.99,"--No, I don't think that's our argument."
2008.08-322,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4257.002,4266.498,The district will (.) the district will never be involved in racial bloc voting for districting purposes because it doesn't (.) it's boundaries don't change.
2008.08-322,5,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4266.498,4268.639,"--That's true, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.08-322,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4300.345,4315.214,"Why wouldn't one construing the Act as it was passed in 2006, say, well, Congress obviously had in mind that this would be enforced consistent with this Court's decision in Shaw, this Court's decision in Miller?"
2008.08-322,5,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4315.214,4325.817,--We believe that the interpretation of the Act or (.) excuse me (.) the passage of the amendments in 2006 go far beyond what preclearance was in 1965.
2008.08-322,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4343.403,4344.433,"Thank you, counsel."
