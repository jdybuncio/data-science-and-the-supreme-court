1971.70-96,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.096,"First in No. 96, Picard against Connor."
1971.70-96,0,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,15.723,20.437,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-96,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,73.765,76.934,Is that the only issue in the case?
1971.70-96,0,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,76.934,99.21,"That to me is the overriding issue, the Commonwealth takes the position that in addition to the Equal Protection argument, there is also an exhaustion argument, and there is also a question of whether or not a purely state procedural Statute should be the subject matter of the review by way of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus."
1971.70-96,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,259.19,261.023,Where are you reading from?
1971.70-96,0,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,261.023,265.657,"From the Commonwealth’s brief Mr. Justice Brennan, page 3."
1971.70-96,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,265.657,268.871,--what I meant by that was is that a Statute or—
1971.70-96,0,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,268.871,272.258,"Yes, General Laws Chapter 277, Section 19."
1971.70-96,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,272.258,297.062,"Since I interrupted you, may I ask that the Court of Appeals by law, turned this on cases of -- I gather here, Supreme Judicial Court that indictments are amendable only with respect to matters of form and as to matters of substance as to minor details or other sense of formalities, is that the law?"
1971.70-96,0,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,297.062,298.635,"Yes it is, if Your Honor please."
1971.70-96,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,298.635,306.465,And does this thing turn on whether this amendment was an amendment in minor detail or in the sense of formality?
1971.70-96,0,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,306.465,313.234,"Well, we would suggest that this case does not necessarily turn on that issue in view of this particular statute."
1971.70-96,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,321.086,330.212,"In other words, your position is that whatever maybe, by statute, indictments are also amendable in the particular that we have involved."
1971.70-96,0,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,330.212,333.682,"Right, in the fictitious name situation or an erroneous name situation."
1971.70-96,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,333.682,336.76,Does the appellant present the issue whether that statute is Constitutional?
1971.70-96,0,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,336.76,343.206,"Yes, it does."
1971.70-96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,343.206,352.788,"And the Court in the holding, in reversing the conviction not relied entirely, as I read the opinion, on the Equal Protection clause."
1971.70-96,0,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,352.788,353.109,Yes.
1971.70-96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,353.526,354.777,Not on Due Process?
1971.70-96,0,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,354.777,354.965,No.
1971.70-96,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,403.852,409.239,"Now, where did Tauro say this?"
1971.70-96,0,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,409.239,410.977,"On the docket entry, if Your Honor please."
1971.70-96,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,410.977,411.487,Docket entry?
1971.70-96,0,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,411.487,412.888,"Mr. Chief Justice, yes."
1971.70-96,1,33180,james_j_twohig,,1814.514,1820.422,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1971.70-96,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1949.565,1956.811,"But,there are a lot of people who commit criminal act whose identity is not known for quite some time?"
1971.70-96,1,33180,james_j_twohig,,1956.811,1970.253,"Not even any name, Your Honor, I will agree to that, but in those cases, the statute provides that there shall be a practicable description before indictment."
1971.70-96,2,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,3517.731,3520.974,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1971.70-96,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3628.5,3630.321,"Thank you Mr. Irwin, thank you Mr. Twohig."
