1977.76-1471,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,50.065,"We will hear arguments next in Federal Communications Commission, 1471 and the related and consolidated cases."
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,62.104,67.808,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1471,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,397.696,428.699,"Mr. Griswold, suppose a television station had broadcast which were clearly, for the purposes of my question, clearly an after task, the hurdles of the obscenity decisions of this Court, that is we would not sustain a criminal conviction for what they had shown on the television, would that be a ground considered denial renewal of the license of the end of the three year validity?"
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,428.699,437.423,That would certainly be a ground to be taken into account along with all the other factors in determining whether the license should be renewed.
1977.76-1471,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,437.423,442.696,"Well, how would you square that with the, I am sure you have a distinction between what (Voice Overlap)"
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,442.696,452.552,"Because we are not dealing here with something which says, this is merely a ground to be taken into account with all the other factors."
1977.76-1471,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,469.018,490.056,Let me change my hypothetical then the only adverse evidence against the broadcaster is found in the series of broadcast of the kind I included in my original hypothetical question and the Commission said any licensee which resists in that kind of broadcasting will not be renewed.
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,490.206,504.687,"Well, that would be precise of this case, that would be announcing a rule that indicates of cross-ownership, there cannot be a renewal and that I suggest is contrary to a constitutional provision."
1977.76-1471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,504.687,524.438,"Say one newspaper in a two-newspaper town was to merge with the other and let us suppose that the existing status that allows that in some circumstances had not been passed, that is does antitrust laws, do they valuably apply?"
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,524.438,540.102,"The antitrust laws is clearly applied to newspapers and to television and then in any event where there is a violation of the antitrust laws as there was in the Lorain Journal case, which came from this Court, the Department of Justice can proceed under the --"
1977.76-1471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,540.102,555.054,"Well, one newspaper says along, the only reason I cannot acquire the other newspapers because I am a newspaper, some other company could acquire it?"
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,555.054,558.678,It would not be as the Lorain Journal Case shows.
1977.76-1471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,565.111,566.324,In the news business?
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,566.324,567.965,-- in the news business.
1977.76-1471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,569.51,577.609,"And the government is entitled to insist that there be dispersion in the publishing business, is that it?"
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,577.609,588.107,"Mr. Justice, it is a different, it seems to me between the antitrust laws and the influence or weight to be given to anticompetitive effect."
1977.76-1471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,588.107,594.742,"Well I know, but anticompetitive does not conceal the fact that we are talking about competition in the news business?"
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,594.742,609.885,And I am perfectly willing to concede that the anticompetitive effect can be taken into account along with all other factors in determining whether a license should be granted or should be renewed.
1977.76-1471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,609.885,621.612,The government under the antitrust laws could validly prevent there being only one paper in the town where there have been two before?
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,621.612,623.626,I am not sure of that Mr. Justice.
1977.76-1471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,623.626,634.126,"Well, I suppose that otherwise -- based on antitrust considerations, you will conclude that antitrust laws would be violated, if these --"
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,634.126,635.849,"No, I do not Mr. Justice."
1977.76-1471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,639.222,639.597,I understand.
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,639.597,644.521,And I know nothing to indicate that that violates the antitrust law.
1977.76-1471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,644.521,656.053,"I just posed to you though the situation where under ordinary antitrust principles, merger between two papers would violate the antitrust laws and under commonly understood antitrust principles."
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,662.485,664.094,Yes Mr. Justice.
1977.76-1471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,672.468,678.356,"I know, but then in that case the government is saying there must be two newspaper voices in the city --"
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,678.356,690.169,And applying the same law to newspapers that applies to every other kind of business in the country whereas this rule applies only to newspapers and applies a rule which is much more stringent.
1977.76-1471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,690.169,701.849,"You would not say then that the antitrust laws could validly prevent all of the press, all of the newspapers and all of the televisions stations in the city merging?"
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,701.849,705.954,"Well, I assume that that would violate antitrust law."
1977.76-1471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,705.954,709.19,Even though you have televisions stations as well as newspapers?
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,709.19,713.072,I thought you said all the newspapers and all the televisions merging.
1977.76-1471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,713.072,714.311,I did.
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,714.311,724.813,"Well, that under many circumstances would violate the antitrust laws and I am not contending that newspapers are not subject to the antitrust laws."
1977.76-1471,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,733.985,737.947,"Mr. Griswold, let me asked the other side of the same coin."
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,742.461,745.179,"No, Mr. Justice, I do not, not great many."
1977.76-1471,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,745.179,750.528,"Not a great many and hence we do deal with a product of scarcity, even on the newspapers side?"
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,750.528,752.787,Even on the newspapers side.
1977.76-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,800.282,808.611,Would you think that Commission saw its source of authority to require diversity in the First Amendment?
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,808.611,821.663,"I am not sure that the Commission did it only there, the Court of Appeals certainly did. The Court of Appeals said that a presumption was compel in order to carry out First Amendment values."
1977.76-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,821.663,824.037,Is that about the same thing in Buckley against Valeo?
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,824.037,825.228,Yes.
1977.76-1471,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,825.228,827.306,Is that not the same thing in Democratic National Committee?
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,827.306,829.357,In the Democratic National Committee case.
1977.76-1471,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,829.357,830.022,Same court?
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,830.022,847.896,"There is nothing in the amendment about diversity, just freedom and there is a further paradox. The regulations here were intended to affect more than broadcast media and they can have no effect on diversity and broadcasting."
1977.76-1471,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,857.632,861.131,"Well, has diversity not been a factor in the decisions of the Commission for three years?"
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,861.131,871.539,"Yes Mr. Chief Justice and I am quite clear that diversity can continue to be a factor, but not the controlling factor."
1977.76-1471,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,881.122,888.625,"When you have a half a dozen considerations, how do you really determine which is the one that both counters back?"
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,888.625,898.895,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice the closest analogy I have been able to think of, I suppose based on my past experience is the problem with the Buckley case."
1977.76-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1096.366,1103.715,How much of a weight can we attribute to what the 1952 Congress thought as to what the 1934 Congress amended?
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1103.715,1107.381,I would suggest Mr. Justice that that is not what we are dealing with here.
1977.76-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1438.042,1443.041,"Counsel, if we are talking about rules, why is there need to be any reference to a record?"
1977.76-1471,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1447.232,1450.087,That certainly is a nice question.
1977.76-1471,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1598.908,1600.631,Mr. Armstrong.
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1600.631,1604.247,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1675.127,1676.643,How often as it?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1676.643,1685.608,"Or even --well, I think Mr. Justice White that it is authorized by this Public Interest Standard and the Communications Act."
1977.76-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1685.608,1686.128,Which is one?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1689.881,1702.068,It is the standard that among under considerations that the Commission can take into account in allocating spectrum resources is a policy of diversity and that is one component of the public interest.
1977.76-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1702.068,1704.68,Based on Congress’ authority over interstate commerce?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1704.68,1705.837,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1977.76-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1705.837,1706.622,Not the First Amendment?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1706.622,1709.532,"Yes sir and not the First Amendment, I understand your question."
1977.76-1471,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1843.297,1856.363,"How much weight could the Commission give if an applicant had only four television stations, but their market area came in to play?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1856.363,1866.184,"Well, I think, I believe I understand Mr. Chief Justice that your question is suppose the Commission was to change the present rule which says there is a limit of five VHF stations to try to change it to four."
1977.76-1471,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1871.919,1880.137,"What I had in mind was four stations in New York City, Newark, Trenton and Philadelphia or something like that?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1880.137,1890.111,"I think the closer the location, the easier a job the Commission would have in convincing a court that its public interest judgment was rational."
1977.76-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.348,1939.344,"The case is not over if we agree with you on that, is it?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1939.344,1944.635,"No sir, I am saying that we have to still defend our grandfather rule with that."
1977.76-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1944.635,1946.137,"Well no, I mean --"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1946.137,1947.622,Oh! The statutory authority point?
1977.76-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1947.622,1955.813,"We cannot agree with you, you cannot win this case without our deciding the constitutional issue, can we?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1955.813,1958.757,"Well, I would say --"
1977.76-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1958.757,1964.169,Your position maybe a very rational application in public interest standard and it is still barred by the First Amendment?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1964.169,1969.801,"Well, we read Mr. Justice White the NBC case to give us --"
1977.76-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1969.801,1971.339,You are going to argue the constitution as it is?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1971.339,1971.808,Yes sir.
1977.76-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1971.808,1972.154,All right.
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1972.409,2017.938,"But if we are acting within our statutory authority and in a moment, I would like to discuss being visible to reference to the 52 legislation, but if it is within our general rule making authority under the 34 Act and if the public interest judgment is rationally explained and if that leads us to a decision to deny an applicant license, it is our position that that applicant has not had his First Amendment rights violated anymore than the applicant for the eighth AM radio station would not have his constitution rights violated, if in applying that rule that was upheld in Storer we turned his application down."
1977.76-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.025,2031.452,"You mean, we can just cite that case as the authority for the constitutional question presented here?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2031.452,2045.28,"We read that case as saying that in applying the public interest standard if the Commission rationally concludes that an applicant is not going to receive a license, that the applicant cannot complaint because of the fact that as a result not getting a license his First --"
1977.76-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2045.28,2046.817,"So your answer is yes, that is it?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2046.817,2052.121,"Yes sir, where relying on NBC for that point as dispositive."
1977.76-1471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2054.282,2064.342,"(Voice Overlap)arguments, at least part of it was different and that is that this imposes an administrative inhibition on the newspapers, is it not?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2064.342,2065.617,Mr. Justice Stewart we view this --
1977.76-1471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2065.617,2073.134,"However which, first of all the Commission does not have statutory jurisdiction and secondly it introduces a new First Amendment argument?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2073.134,2079.402,We do not ground this case in any way upon any assertive statutory jurisdiction over newspapers.
1977.76-1471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2079.402,2081.853,But that is an impact of the what the Commission did?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2081.853,2112.675,"The ultimate bottom line in the case as we see it is whether those spectrum resources have to be given to an applicant and we would say that this Court in the dictum in the 1959 case and the Court of Appeals in the McClatchy and Clarksburg Cases has recognized that a newspaper, the status of an applicant as the owner of the newspaper is relevant for the Commission to consider in deciding whether to give that applicant a broadcast station."
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2172.069,2175.098,But you did say a lot of newspapers?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2175.098,2175.9,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2175.9,2190.742,"I mean for example, the owner can own General Motors, a line of steamship line, Amtrak, four bars and grills, Chase National Bank, that is okay?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2190.742,2191.663,Mr. Justice Marshall.
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2191.663,2193.643,"But newspaper, no."
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2193.643,2197.604,"Excuse me sir, you are quite correct in your statement of what happens."
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2219.282,2221.135,How long do you on the --
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2221.135,2229.4,"There is no question about that, that by its very nature, the policy is going to hurt a newspaper applicant’s chances more than it will hurt the owner of the Amtrak's chances if he wants to go a license."
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2229.4,2235.47,"But then it is just not neutral at all, but you are not neutral, are you?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2235.47,2248.731,"I think that the policy of, if it could be characterized is that, it nevertheless is not a ground for striking down what we done because the diversity policy would seem to me by the intend of your question would fall and that has been recognized."
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2248.731,2252.256,I still do not see where you get the jurisdiction over the newspaper owner?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2252.256,2254.119,We do not have jurisdiction of the newspaper at all.
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2265.254,2269.498,"But I mean, do they do have to set out all these other things?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2269.498,2270.31,Excuse me sir?
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2270.31,2274.888,"The proposed owner, does he have to set out everything else he owns?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2274.888,2283.425,"I do not want to get drawn into a detailed discussion of the Commission’s ownership purporting requirements, but I think we do require -."
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2297.106,2300.485,"Well, this is aimed at newspaper?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2300.485,2301.109,"No sir, it is."
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2301.109,2302.203,"I do not care, you get the right one."
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2302.203,2306.479,"Well, the actual wording of this regulation, yes sir, it is, on its face it is."
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2306.479,2313.343,And does that not violate the specific provision of that Committee report?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2313.343,2314.965,That was the point I was coming to.
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2314.965,2315.641,Oh! Good.
1977.76-1471,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2315.641,2327.489,"Now, before you get to that, we have said, I think on the number of occasions here and other courts have said it that the First Amendment does not confine to newspapers or publishers, it belongs to everyone."
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2351.256,2357.611,"As I understand it, you are saying that would, in that case does newspaper ownership would actually work in his favor?"
1977.76-1471,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2357.611,2358.95,Because it shows their experience?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2358.95,2359.322,Yes sir.
1977.76-1471,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2369.526,2375.237,"There is only one newspaper, the newspaper that had no others stations and no other --?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2375.237,2386.911,Under those circumstances it is quite conceivable that the weight in favor of the experience factor that you mentioned would outweigh whatever the merit the applicant would suffer under the diversity criteria.
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2603.433,2612.531,"Well, what happens if a newspaper in Baltimore wants to buy a radio, television stations in Washington?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2612.531,2622.005,It would depend on the contour of the radio station in Washington whether or not it would place a certain contour over the city of Baltimore.
1977.76-1471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2641.936,2642.524,Involves a --
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2642.524,2647.794,That is why I did not pick Richmond.[Laughter]
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2647.794,2655.374,You picked the case that would require some detailed application of the standards of the rule and I would not know right off hand how it might come out.
1977.76-1471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2655.374,2657.636,It has to do with the City Signal or something?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2657.636,2658.749,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1977.76-1471,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2737.988,2745.225,"Mr. Armstrong, how many of the members of the class that are preserved by the grandfather clause with that definition?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2745.225,2773.088,"Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, every member of that class, it can be said of that member that its record has been before the Commission at every three years at renewal time has been passed upon by the Commission and has been found to be in the public interest and the Commission characterized, generally speaking, the record of the class as a group as meritorious and --"
1977.76-1471,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2773.088,2782.093,"And your argument is not that it includes some specially well qualified stations, but then everyone in the class has proven his entitlement to a continued license."
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2782.093,2784.598,"Well, it is true."
1977.76-1471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2784.598,2787.348,"That is true about every licensee in this country, is it not?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2787.348,2787.6,"Yes, sir."
1977.76-1471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2787.6,2791.825,"With one or two exceptions, every licensee has had his license three years or more."
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2791.825,2797.229,"Yes, sir and in the case of these, though it has been passed upon by the Commission at three year intervals and it is found they had been serving public interest --"
1977.76-1471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2797.229,2800.619,And it is true about every licensee in the country with one or two notable exceptions?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2800.619,2806.695,"Well, I think in the case of these licensees, generally speaking Mr. Justice Stewart, they have been in there longer."
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2847.534,2854.662,Was diversity involved in each one of these renewals?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2854.662,2856.373,I am not sure.
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2856.373,2866.498,"I think we have, most of us have familiarity with renewals and applications and sometimes you know renewals are almost perfunctory?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2866.498,2867.116,I am not sure.
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2867.116,2868.114,Are they not?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2868.114,2869.225,"Well, Mr. Marshall --"
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2869.225,2872.623,I am not speaking about FCC but in others did it not --
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2872.623,2874.191,That may be true in other agencies.
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2874.191,2875.261,But it could not be in the --
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2875.261,2876.82,The Commission is obligated by [Laughter].
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2876.82,2878.248,And include the diversities?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2878.248,2884.058,"Well, I would not want to concede that we have not followed their statutory mandate to make a public interest finding."
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2884.058,2905.879,"I mean, I have difficulty with -- suppose it happens that in this town there is one radio station, one television station, and one newspaper and the town decides why should it not and this has been renewed for the last ten times."
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2908.368,2915.093,"It means that if will not -- well, there are certain small market cases which Washington would not include."
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2931.075,2934.318,That is with or without this rule?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2934.318,2935.104,"Yes, sir."
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2935.613,2938.259,"The rule does tend to later though, does it not?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2938.259,2954.248,"All that this rule does is tend to give the applicant a chance to have his future fate as a broadcaster if he wants to continue, determined on the basis of his record of performance and not on the basis of the fact that he is a cross-owner, that is all it does."
1977.76-1471,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2994.194,3011.285,"Is it inconceivable that after five years experience or any number of years you want to pick, the Commission might come to substantially the same conclusion that the Court of Appeals came to now in a rule making proceeding?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,3011.285,3014.458,It is conceivable Mr. Chief Justice.
1977.76-1471,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3014.458,3015.541,On basis of experience?
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,3015.541,3036.209,"The Commission on the basis of experience, five years from now might reach a judgment that it should order more extensive divestiture and give more weight to diversity than it felt it was able to do on the basis of the record in this proceeding because this record did not establish a strong showing and Commission relied on that heavily and clearly intervening experience might change the nature of the record."
1977.76-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3040.252,3062.037,"Mr. Armstrong, could I ask you what is your view of the relative position, of the relative function of the Department of Justice and the bureaucracies in this case that you think your relative position is governed by Section 2348 of the Title XXVIII?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,3062.037,3067.409,"Yes Sir, I believe that is the position we are relying upon in order for our authority to file --"
1977.76-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3067.409,3072.366,"I know, I am sure that it looks like you certainly have the authority, what about the Department of Justice?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,3072.366,3085.706,"Well, it is our view that like the National Citizens Community for Broadcasting, they were a party with a very strong policy preference as to how the Commission should have weighed the competing considerations which were before in the case --"
1977.76-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3085.706,3098.523,"So you would say that under 2348, the Attorney General for example, could have instituted the entire review proceeding before the Court of Appeals just disagreeing with it?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,3098.523,3106.432,"Initially, I might say in this case that the Department of Justice did file United States versus FCC, they later withdrew it."
1977.76-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3111.819,3122.0,"So, they do not question at all of the authority of the -- I am sure you disagree with them on the result, but you do not question at all their authority to take the position contrary with respect to divestiture?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,3122.0,3129.865,We do not question their authority to tell us that they wish to be given more weight to the given presumed gained (Voice Overlap)
1977.76-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3129.865,3130.955,Or to appear in this Court --
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,3130.955,3132.375,Or to appear in this Court.
1977.76-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3132.375,3150.157,"What if the Federal Communications Commission had turned down the United States' motion to intervene, do you think they would still have any standing to challenge anything in the Court of Appeals other than the Commission’s denial of motion to intervene?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,3150.157,3154.992,Your Honor's question is a good question and I must say that have not focus on that question.
1977.76-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3171.613,3180.825,"In your position I take in response to Mr. Justice White is that, since the Commission allowed them to intervene just like they allowed a number of private groups to intervene, they have at least the standing --"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,3180.825,3191.276,"Yes sir, at least we will go for as far to say under the circumstances where they were a party with the strong policy pitch before the Commission, either a statutory respondent or as a petitioner, they probably should be allowed to make that argument."
1977.76-1471,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3191.276,3198.098,"Mr. Armstrong, but regardless of all that we recognize their right to intervene in this Court at anytime, do you not?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,3198.098,3200.489,"I would guess sir, yes sir."
1977.76-1471,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3200.489,3206.498,"You do more than recognize that you insist on it do you not, Mr. Armstrong, you would assert it affirmatively?"
1977.76-1471,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,3206.498,3209.194,Certainly and many instances we would have to rely upon --
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3363.268,3367.026,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1471,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3392.016,3400.366,"Well, Mr. Wallace, are you not ordinarily expected to uphold the Act of Congress that is challenged under that Section?"
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3400.366,3407.542,We are not attacking the Constitutionality of any Act of Congress in our submission to this Court.
1977.76-1471,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3407.542,3410.765,But I thought you said that that is one of the authorities by which you were here?
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3410.765,3411.906,We could.
1977.76-1471,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3414.691,3416.822,And therefore we do not (Voice Overlap)
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3416.822,3418.554,That is correct.
1977.76-1471,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4081.307,4083.472,"Mr. Wallace, may I interrupt you for a moment."
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4089.027,4089.373,Yes.
1977.76-1471,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4089.373,4094.41,And you are saying that there were examples before to which it was entitled to give weight?
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4094.41,4094.504,That is correct.
1977.76-1471,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4094.504,4095.987,And that does not make sense to me.
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4098.212,4109.336,"Well, I am about to, but I am using this introduction to the deficiencies because I think it is important to recognize what was at stake before the Commission."
1977.76-1471,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4109.336,4112.609,But if it was entitled to give weight then it is not entitled to give weight.
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4112.609,4119.951,It obviously some weight to these or it would not have adopted the prospective rule in order the divestitures that it did.
1977.76-1471,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4134.822,4141.812,"The consistency concept does not prevent a regulatory agency from having a change of mind or heart over a period of time, does it?"
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4141.812,4165.654,"Not at all, but it does have to base the way it applies that change on rational grounds that do not treat individuals arbitrarily based on factors that are unrelated rationally to the basis at which the agency has changed its position."
1977.76-1471,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4373.108,4386.141,"That disparity would be wholly correctable within a maximum of three years if the Commission thought that, that disparity was a controlling reason for not granting the renewal of the application?"
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4386.141,4397.185,"It could be, but the Commission is under considerable inhibition at renewal time to engage in what it considers to be a forfeiture of the applicant’s license when the applicant is providing great service."
1977.76-1471,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4397.185,4405.949,"Yes I know, but you are arguing now that the Commission was compelled not to have a Grandfather Clause?"
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4405.949,4421.836,"Well, I am arguing that the Commission, there are particularly strong reasons to see whether the Commission’s Grandfather Clause was rationally based, whether the grounds that it gave for adopting the Grandfather Clause stand up, on the Commission's own premises."
1977.76-1471,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4426.129,4431.12,"If it had this perspective rule it was compelled to have a Grandfather Clause, that was I thought what your argument was?"
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4431.12,4433.123,Well we have said that --
1977.76-1471,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4433.123,4434.676,Am I mistaken?
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4434.676,4436.156,I believe you are Mr. Justice.
1977.76-1471,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4439.806,4441.101,Oh in requiring a rule.
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4441.101,4452.067,"In requiring a rule and that the Commission if it can rationally justify a grandfathering, it is entitled to adopt a Grandfathering Provision."
1977.76-1471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4465.92,4471.055,"Mr. Wallace, what about the local ownership point which is the first one they make?"
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4482.948,4487.438,"Well, we are arguing several points in response to that."
1977.76-1471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4495.668,4498.821,Because it never said that it was totally zero factor?
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4498.821,4500.54,It has never said that it was totally zero.
1977.76-1471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4515.107,4518.202,It was considered rational as to the three quarters?
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4518.202,4527.604,A third point is that there was nothing before the Commission to -- it just shows that they were not really relying on that.
1977.76-1471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4529.025,4531.37,Listen and please answer my question if you would.
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4542.706,4549.565,"Yes, because there was nothing before the Commission to show that local ownership would be diminished."
1977.76-1471,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4549.565,4560.672,But was it irrational consideration that concluded that it might be and that is all I held and you gave an example earlier in your argument of the Washington-Detroit swap where it took place.
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4564.015,4603.169,"The Commission has approved many transfers over the years which resulted in diminution of local ownership as I expect they will approve the Washington-Detroit transfer and there was no evidence before the Commission that local ownership that they were not eligible local owners to come forward to be transferees of these licenses if the Commission were to require that they be transferred to locally owned interest, if the Commission wanted to give particular weight to that factor."
1977.76-1471,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4614.918,4620.257,"You do not need any sort of evidence in a rule making procedure, do you?"
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4620.257,4631.82,"No, but you need a rational ground for belief that, what you are worried about will be diminished by the particular course of action."
1977.76-1471,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4631.82,4641.767,But is not the Commission presume to have some confidence and expertise which can supply that rational ground just patently fallacious?
1977.76-1471,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4641.767,4670.719,"It does have some expertise in this area, but there is nothing on the face of either Commission practice, what the Commission purported to rely on or what was before it to indicate that local ownership would be preserved by the Grandfathering or was of sufficient concern that the Commission that they were taking any step to assure transfers to local owners where they were requiring divestiture."
1977.76-1471,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4714.116,4746.594,"Mr. Firestone somewhere in the course of your discussion, if you find it convenient and if you think it is relevant, would you relate what the Commission has done here to its situation that has been mentioned requiring a divestiture by the star of its broadcast relations and permitting even though it is true that any other licensee is up for renewal, but one was mandatory and one is a still open?"
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4746.594,4749.79,Yes Mr. Chief Justice.
1977.76-1471,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4798.227,4802.978,"That is quite different than saying it is not supported by substantial record concerns, substantial evidence."
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4815.199,4826.523,"Well, we believe that if there is absolutely no record support and no basis for coming to suppositions that it could rise to the level of arbitrary."
1977.76-1471,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4826.523,4832.359,Is it not difficult to find arbitrary and capricious over five year period of time?
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4832.359,4841.304,"Your Honor, the place where it was arbitrary and capricious was the Commission’s failure to order divestiture and the failure to apply its prospective rule."
1977.76-1471,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4843.405,4845.744,"And that was five years, they worked on?"
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4845.744,4847.91,There were the five-year standard.
1977.76-1471,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4847.91,4849.884,Should I going to say that it is arbitrary and capricious?
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4849.884,4850.819,That the five-year standard --
1977.76-1471,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4850.819,4855.514,"That would be arbitrary, but it shows, it is hard to see it is capricious.[Laughter]"
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4855.514,4858.181,The five-year standard is now what we say is arbitrary and capricious.
1977.76-1471,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4907.191,4913.995,The court did seem at least in its words to require that the Commission issued a rule in this area?
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4913.995,4921.889,"Well, to the extent of that orders of rule, I think we would concede that the Commission does have authority."
1977.76-1471,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4921.889,4923.317,To have no rule at all?
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4923.317,4926.401,To have no rule at all.
1977.76-1471,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4926.401,4930.656,But is there a difference when they go part way down the road and not all the way?
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4930.656,4931.936,"Yes you Honor, there is a difference there."
1977.76-1471,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4931.936,4934.14,That the Court of the Appeals was pointing to?
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,4934.14,4945.233,"They pointed it to it, but I suppose that if the Commission acted rationally and the Court of Appeals pointed out many areas, this decision was riddled over there at the agency level."
1977.76-1471,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5095.514,5097.824,I did not bar local ownership.
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,5099.976,5116.856,"Right, but certainly here, what it showed is that they preferred the criterion of the diversity over local ownership for the perspective rule, but turned it around and used this criterion to override diversity for existing licensees when 25% of them were not even local owners."
1977.76-1471,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5140.716,5146.215,But does not the Commission's reliance here supersedes whatever they said in 1965?
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,5146.215,5149.561,Except that they have not -- they have not rushed.
1977.76-1471,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5154.328,5165.075,"Well, if every agency when it changes it might have to get out all of its other inconsistent statements that were made over last 40 years, we would never adjourn for the summer?[Laughter]"
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,5165.075,5171.206,"That is true, but there are internal inconsistencies here, and also they did not really treat this issue of integration."
1977.76-1471,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5185.975,5193.375,"Mr. Firestone, I know the newspapers argued that they were not involved in the management of the station as much, did the Commission so find?"
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,5193.375,5200.519,"The Commission stated that where it is not that case, where they are not separate ownership, they would require far many more divestitures."
1977.76-1471,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5207.426,5217.419,"Are you saying that it would be irrational to attach any weight at all with the acquirement of local ownership, unless the local owner was actively involved in management?"
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,5217.419,5221.135,"Under existing Commission Law, unless the Commission changes it."
1977.76-1471,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5221.135,5223.115,Let us follow Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s suggestion.
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,5241.88,5245.344,"I do not think it is the question, but if it were --"
1977.76-1471,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5245.344,5250.888,"Well, we must mean different things by irrationality, that is there are different kinds of irrationality?"
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,5250.888,5256.099,"No, I think that the question here is, has the Commission been internally inconsistent?"
1977.76-1471,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5260.359,5267.299,"In other words, whenever you find inconsistency, do you necessarily find irrationality, is that your view?"
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,5267.299,5272.815,I think that it raises the question of irrationality.[Laughter]
1977.76-1471,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5306.863,5309.133,"I just ask one other question, Mr. Firestone."
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,5334.824,5343.799,"Under the Court of the Appeals mandate, the quick answer to your questions is, I do think the Commission could rewrite the opinion."
1977.76-1471,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5343.799,5345.113,And reach the same result?
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,5345.113,5348.012,And reach the same result.
1977.76-1471,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5351.393,5358.439,"So, if you assume they could have written a better opinion and reached the same result you must be assuming that it was not totally irrational?"
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,5358.439,5365.069,"Right, but well, I think generally --"
1977.76-1471,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5365.069,5371.914,"Is it the remand, is not generally the remand, it is not the remand to say go ahead and restate your reasons, your reasons do not adequately support the conclusion."
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,5377.581,5379.171,"Well, we do not read that decision."
1977.76-1471,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5573.165,5579.111,"But if basic principle is true, why does it not apply to the existing situation and many others?"
1977.76-1471,3,18926,charles_m_firestone,,5579.111,5591.597,"That is exactly our contention that it should and in fact, what they have done is apply the public interest standard to transfers which they refuse to apply to renewals, and yet it is the same a public interest standard."
1977.76-1471,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5737.523,5754.879,"Mr. Griswold, you had some observations right down, so that your argument about the unconstitutionality of saying a newspaper cannot have the same rights as anyone else, how would you apply that preposition to what I have just been discussing with Mr. Firestone on the Star?"
1977.76-1471,4,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,5771.783,5781.166,"If done by a blanket rule which prevents the consideration of all of the facts circumstances, with respect to that particular case."
1977.76-1471,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5781.166,5782.719,It was a blanket rules?
1977.76-1471,4,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,5782.719,5784.499,In this case it is a blanket rule.
1977.76-1471,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5784.499,5786.397,In the Star Case?
1977.76-1471,4,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,5786.397,5789.341,"I am sorry, I am afraid I do not understand the case."
1977.76-1471,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5789.341,5795.795,"Well, when the Star, when a new owner bought the Star, he had the diversity of television license element there?"
1977.76-1471,4,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,5795.795,5797.035,"When, when I am sorry (Voice Overlap)"
1977.76-1471,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5797.035,5798.811,When the new owner bought the Star --
1977.76-1471,4,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,5798.811,5800.532,Oh! The Washington Star?
1977.76-1471,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5800.532,5802.215,"WMAL, to get --"
1977.76-1471,4,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,5802.215,5820.604,"I think that of course, as far as I know is the only case, or at least the only prominent case which actually exists under this rule and I think it shows among the other things that this rule does not promote diversity."
1977.76-1471,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5872.808,5879.678,"Are you suggesting that, constitutionally, the prospective rule might survive, but the divestiture rule might not?"
1977.76-1471,4,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,5879.678,5884.497,"No, Mr. Justice, I think that constitutionally the prospective rule should not --"
1977.76-1471,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5884.497,5890.097,"Oh I understand, I understand but you concede that the one surviving and not the other?"
1977.76-1471,4,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,5890.097,5899.995,"Oh! I can concede it, yes but my position is, that the prospective rule is not constitutional."
1977.76-1471,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5928.329,5937.093,"Well, why should the owner of broadcast station be forbidden from acquiring another just because he is a broadcaster?"
1977.76-1471,4,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,5937.093,5945.872,"Mr. Justice, I think that was probably settled as long ago as the Federal Radio Commission Case in 1930."
1977.76-1471,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5945.872,5946.416,Maybe?[Laughter]
1977.76-1471,4,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,5948.716,5952.158,"The Pottsville Case is 1940, yes, I think so."
1977.76-1471,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5952.158,5953.355,"And why, can I ask you why?"
1977.76-1471,4,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,5953.355,5978.438,"And the Red Lion Case in which I appeared seven or eight years ago, for better or for worse, the Court has taken the role, I am inclined to think for the better though it is an awful course question, but there is something about broadcasting involving the limitation of the spectrum, which makes it appropriate for the Government to introduce a regulation."
