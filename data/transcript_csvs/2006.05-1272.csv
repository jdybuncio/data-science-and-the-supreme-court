2006.05-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.747,"We will hear argument next in 05-1272, Rockwell International Corporation versus United States."
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,9.887,11.684,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,36.142,37.829,"Ms. Mahoney, let me ask you a question."
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,49.356,52.511,"Your Honor, that is one possible interpretation of the statute."
2006.05-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,52.511,54.885,How is there any other possible one?
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,57.165,69.284,I think the way that the courts have handled it below is that it says that there's no jurisdiction unless it is a claim brought by a relator who is an original source or if it's brought by the United States.
2006.05-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,82.874,85.825,It's not brought by the United States as long as he's still there.
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,85.825,86.731,That's correct.
2006.05-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,86.731,87.012,That's your argument.
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,87.012,98.367,"Well, it can't be, Your Honor, because under the statutory terms, under section 3720(a) the Attorney General has the authority to bring a claim on behalf of the United States."
2006.05-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,138.257,141.554,I guess it really depends on whether you think the language
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,147.69,161.576,"Well, I don't think it can be, Your Honor, because if you look at the language throughout these sections, it differentiates between two kinds of actions, actions brought by the United States or the Attorney General and actions brought by the relator."
2006.05-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,174.056,174.679,"Well, wait."
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,194.547,195.249,--That's correct.
2006.05-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,195.249,198.357,But you say that's different from the Government bringing the action.
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,198.357,198.544,Absolutely.
2006.05-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,278.826,301.567,"You're being very picky-picky with this text, considering that you're willing to swallow whole the notion that so long as the... so long as the original party, so long as the non-government plaintiff drops out, all of a sudden it become as action brought by the United States."
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,335.272,339.521,"Your Honor, of course that would be great for Rockwell, and so--"
2006.05-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,339.521,342.363,"I know, but it would be so extreme that we're not likely to buy it."
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,342.363,362.792,"--Well, we don't argue for that because I think that the Court has said that the Government's intervention does not cure defects with respect to the relator, and therefore, if the relator didn't have... that... doesn't have standing... you know, part of this goes to the issue of the Stevens assignment."
2006.05-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,395.935,403.808,"Otherwise, the Attorney General could just bring it all over again, a fresh complaint, and that would be wasted motion?"
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,403.808,404.322,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,442.806,444.338,"They don't have to give them any money, though."
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,446.868,450.538,"Your Honor, I think that you could say that they don't have to give them money."
2006.05-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,450.538,452.084,But you'd then have to pay his attorneys' fees.
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,453.85,469.233,"Well, it is about that, but we don't have to pay his attorneys' fees, Your Honor, if he doesn't get a share, because the way that section (d) is written is it says that a relator who is paid a share of the proceeds shall also be entitled to attorneys' fees."
2006.05-1272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,629.434,640.57,"Well, suppose a company has a plan to defraud the Government and it use a certain chemical mix to save money and that's what the real fraud is."
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,680.851,684.677,"Perhaps, Your Honor, in certain circumstances."
2006.05-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,793.665,795.976,It wouldn't have to have anything to do with pondcrete at all.
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,803.66,812.532,"Your Honor, every court that has considered that question has said that it has to be analyzed on what they call a claim by claim basis."
2006.05-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,824.278,829.245,"Factual theory of falsity, that doesn't mean anything to me."
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,829.245,830.385,--A theory of falsity.
2006.05-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,897.14,899.138,That's one way to look at it.
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,918.6,920.974,"--But, Your Honor, it doesn't have to be determined after the case is over."
2006.05-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,937.795,941.215,"If you only show that it's wrong at the end, you still say that they should be thrown out."
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,941.215,946.791,"--Yes, we do, Your Honor but it is not by any means necessary to the outcome in this case."
2006.05-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1053.31,1056.152,"Well, his allegation was that this, the design is not going to work."
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1056.152,1057.652,But Your Honor--
2006.05-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1057.652,1061.181,"That's not an allegation that's... I mean, it is either true or it's not true."
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1071.865,1075.333,"--Because, Your Honor, this, this is a statute about fraud."
2006.05-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1094.152,1096.839,They were certifying their compliance with the applicable laws--
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1096.839,1097.667,"At that, at the time--"
2006.05-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1097.667,1099.901,--based upon their pondcrete design.
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1099.901,1109.194,--At the time that he was there that was not actually... he didn't even allege that he knew they were doing that with respect to pondcrete.
2006.05-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1173.745,1188.052,"Am, am I correct that they were, in fact, using that same pipe or that same pipe system during a period when perfectly fine cement blocks were being produced?"
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1188.052,1189.912,"We think that's correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1189.912,1191.613,"Is that true, is that conceded?"
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1191.613,1209.404,"Well, I think that it's conceded that... well, their own counsels told the jury that they were making it wrong, they weren't adding enough cement, that that was the reason that it was failing; and the Government told the jury that they were making it fine until they reduced the ratio of cement."
2006.05-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1221.398,1226.412,"The whole purpose, the whole purpose of this legislation is to ferret out fraud on the Government."
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1244.968,1247.31,"--Well, Your Honor, the statute isn't written in that way."
2006.05-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1253.807,1255.62,"Well, what about the hypothetical?"
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1267.49,1274.736,"--If... the mere fact that he is a trigger for the Government discovery of a different problem, no, that is not a basis for recovery."
2006.05-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1305.365,1313.455,"You would, you would change that to say direct knowledge of the information not on which the allegations are based, but on which recovery is eventually... eventually ordered?"
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1313.455,1319.188,--On which the allegations of the claim is based.
2006.05-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1366.872,1367.637,Identified them all?
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1367.637,1368.87,--on a global basis.
2006.05-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1369.323,1370.932,They've identified them all already?
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1371.338,1372.9,"No, I don't think they have identified them all."
2006.05-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.213,1374.291,You may find another one.
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1374.291,1392.704,"--I, I would also... again, it would allow the relator to get, you know, a share of, when the Government doesn't intervene, a minimum of 25 percent of a billion dollar recovery after a public disclosure that he knew nothing about, if he just knew one little piece after separate theory of fraud."
2006.05-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1392.704,1397.39,But the theory is not necessarily bad.
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1443.325,1454.774,"Well it there, if there's a minor variation, you know, something like that, I certainly don't think that disqualifies the relator from, from being an original source."
2006.05-1272,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1525.432,1526.807,May I ask just one quick question?
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1526.807,1527.68,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1272,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1527.68,1531.679,What was the public disclosure of the claim that ultimately prevailed?
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1531.679,1539.082,The public... there... the public disclosure was in 19... it can be from several pieces.
2006.05-1272,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1562.37,1566.462,And the public disclosure was made in the newspapers rather than in an official Government proceeding?
2006.05-1272,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1566.462,1567.087,--That's correct.
2006.05-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1584.08,1585.703,"Thank you, Ms. Mahoney."
2006.05-1272,1,36827,maria_t_vullo,,1588.984,1592.404,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.05-1272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1645.491,1655.8,"Unfortunately, it was not the criminal conduct that was ultimately... it was not the manner of criminal conduct that was ultimately the basis on which the Government proceeded?"
2006.05-1272,1,36827,maria_t_vullo,,1667.437,1670.763,"Justice Scalia, I would beg to differ on that."
2006.05-1272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1751.185,1751.591,Yeah.
2006.05-1272,1,36827,maria_t_vullo,,1802.758,1804.664,That's--
2006.05-1272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.664,1812.129,During a certain period after this it was creating perfectly good blocks by adding more cement.
2006.05-1272,1,36827,maria_t_vullo,,1822.78,1824.936,"--Justice Scalia, two important points."
2006.05-1272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1844.147,1846.225,And why did the government claim it was insolid?
2006.05-1272,1,36827,maria_t_vullo,,1852.83,1863.42,"Your Honor, one of the pieces of evidence... and I would... out of 55 witnesses and 500 documents, was that there were certain people who were using too little cement."
2006.05-1272,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1865.045,1893.455,"No, but was the reason they were using too little cement, the reason that there was a variation in the amount of liquid being taken out with the sludge as you've described to us that he had claimed, or was the reason simply that there was a kind of standard ratio of cement to sludge and that standard ratio was not followed in the later cases?"
2006.05-1272,1,36827,maria_t_vullo,,1919.789,1921.992,"--That's not correct, Justice Souter."
2006.05-1272,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1947.449,1963.834,"But if they had followed the formula that they followed at the beginning, isn't it true that there's no evidence that even these variations in the liquid in the sludge would have resulted in instable or insolid pondcrete?"
2006.05-1272,1,36827,maria_t_vullo,,1963.834,1964.348,No.
2006.05-1272,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1979.0,1985.842,"This was truly even before the troubles started, even before the insolid pondcrete?"
2006.05-1272,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1985.842,1986.358,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2001.757,2003.349,Was... here's an easy question.
2006.05-1272,3,36827,maria_t_vullo,,2012.237,2015.173,--Mr. Stone did not testify at trial.
2006.05-1272,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.173,2017.485,Was this evidence introduced from some other source?
2006.05-1272,3,36827,maria_t_vullo,,2024.154,2027.731,The jury... Mr. Freibach described the process.
2006.05-1272,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2031.417,2036.103,So his central allegation was not even placed before the jury?
2006.05-1272,3,36827,maria_t_vullo,,2036.103,2039.868,"Your Honor, I would submit to you, Justice Scalia, that that wasn't required."
2006.05-1272,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2041.318,2042.959,"But it is worse than that, though."
2006.05-1272,3,36827,maria_t_vullo,,2077.243,2086.628,"--Mr. Chief Justice, the voluntarily provides prong requires the relator to be honest and truthful and submit all the information he has."
2006.05-1272,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2092.297,2103.231,"But he has to... if the information that he provides isn't direct and independent information of the allegations, it would seem that the statute is not satisfied."
2006.05-1272,3,36827,maria_t_vullo,,2103.231,2110.135,"--That is correct, Your Honor, but Mr. Stone did have direct and independent knowledge of his allegations."
2006.05-1272,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2117.741,2126.706,I don't want to get off my question here but did you... do you agree that this page JA 605 was the only information that he provided to the government?
2006.05-1272,3,36827,maria_t_vullo,,2126.706,2128.471,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.05-1272,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2128.471,2130.907,"Well, maybe I'd better phrase it differently."
2006.05-1272,3,36827,maria_t_vullo,,2133.828,2143.997,"That, the Tenth Circuit did rely on that document and did not consider any other information as a result of its ruling with respect to that document."
2006.05-1272,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2164.472,2169.377,"Well, but this... he has to provide this information before filing an action."
2006.05-1272,3,36827,maria_t_vullo,,2169.377,2170.627,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-1272,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2180.544,2181.513,I have a question.
2006.05-1272,3,36827,maria_t_vullo,,2181.513,2182.809,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-1272,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2182.809,2186.213,"As I understand the statute, you his the first prong."
2006.05-1272,3,36827,maria_t_vullo,,2192.617,2200.723,"Justice Stevens, we in the courts below agreed for purposes of the original source provision that there was a public disclosure."
2006.05-1272,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2203.114,2211.75,"You agree that it's within 4(a), that it was an action based on a public disclosure of information disclosed in newspapers; is that right?"
2006.05-1272,3,36827,maria_t_vullo,,2211.75,2226.76,"--In newspapers and also the criminal investigation, but I think what's important is that the standard that Rockwell seeks to have this Court adopt would actually require such a great level of specificity that is not in the public disclosure at all."
2006.05-1272,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2233.695,2239.192,"I am asking you, really what I'm seeking to find out is what is the scope of the public disclosure that everyone agrees was made?"
2006.05-1272,3,36827,maria_t_vullo,,2241.425,2252.406,"--It was newspapers, and the FBI agents' search warrant affidavit was also publicly disclosed prior to Mr. Stone's filing of the action."
2006.05-1272,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2252.406,2260.294,"If it was publicly disclosed in the newspapers, does that fit into one of the categories of public disclosure mentioned in 4(a)?"
2006.05-1272,3,36827,maria_t_vullo,,2260.294,2260.778,Yes.
2006.05-1272,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2263.652,2267.26,And everybody agrees on what those news reports contained?
2006.05-1272,3,36827,maria_t_vullo,,2267.26,2275.818,"Well, I'm not sure what Rockwell agrees, but I could tell Your Honor what I believe those news reports said, and they said that there were environmental violations."
2006.05-1272,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2291.655,2295.123,So you're saying that the original source of the information was published?
2006.05-1272,3,36827,maria_t_vullo,,2295.123,2298.497,I don't believe that that's the appropriate test.
2006.05-1272,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2316.366,2318.927,I would have thought the allegations referred to the public disclosure.
2006.05-1272,3,36827,maria_t_vullo,,2327.939,2331.858,"Mr. Chief Justice, there is a split in the circuits on that issue."
2006.05-1272,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2439.831,2444.017,We've also said that jurisdiction must be maintained throughout the case.
2006.05-1272,3,36827,maria_t_vullo,,2468.835,2472.787,"Justice Scalia, I think this is a jurisdictional provision that Congress created."
2006.05-1272,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2503.961,2505.399,"Thank you, Ms. Vullo."
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2507.803,2521.376,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1272,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2574.01,2580.586,"Well, that's all very nice, but Congress didn't leave it up to you to decide who ought to get rewarded or not."
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2591.708,2592.144,We agree.
2006.05-1272,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2635.518,2640.188,What if the defect that he identified turns out to be entirely different?
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2647.684,2656.353,"--I mean, there certainly could be a situation in which the government intervenes in a suit but files what can be regarded as a substantially different claim."
2006.05-1272,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2671.689,2672.173,Let's take this case.
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2684.092,2685.607,--It didn't introduce the engineering report.
2006.05-1272,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2687.184,2690.292,"Well, what else had he provided beyond... did you use anything that came from him?"
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2690.292,2697.29,--He had provided substantial information about a pattern of concealment of environmental violations generally.
2006.05-1272,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2701.834,2704.519,But did you use at trial anything that he provided you?
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2704.519,2708.112,--We proved essentially the state of affairs that he predicted would occur.
2006.05-1272,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2708.112,2711.862,Did you use anything he provided you in order to prove it?
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2711.862,2713.344,I'm not aware of anything that--
2006.05-1272,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2713.344,2714.563,"No, neither am I."
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2714.563,2721.139,"--But nevertheless, the relator had direct and independent knowledge of the information on which his allegations were based."
2006.05-1272,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2813.696,2823.396,How is it possible to say that he had direct knowledge of events that occurred after he had left Rockwell?
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2827.549,2828.221,But again--
2006.05-1272,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2828.221,2834.765,"Not only not because of this pipe thing that he predicted would cause a failure, not only it was not because of that."
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2835.812,2839.794,"--Again, the statute doesn't require direct and independent knowledge of the fraud."
2006.05-1272,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2844.854,2845.651,That's right.
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2849.338,2855.602,His basis for making that prediction was that he believed that the process would malfunction.
2006.05-1272,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2856.508,2858.741,But prediction is not knowledge.
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2861.271,2882.059,"--I think independent of whether there had every been a public disclosure, it would have been open to Rockwell to argue in response to the original complaint that Stone couldn't consistent with Rule 11 make allegations as to what had happened at the plant after he left because he no longer had an evidentiary basis for doing so."
2006.05-1272,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2924.214,2935.819,And his sufficient information you assert is his prediction that these blocks would fail for a reason that turned out not to be the reason for their failure.
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2939.146,2944.503,"That knowledge, but I think it's also important to recognize that the original complaint was not focused on pondcrete specifically."
2006.05-1272,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2961.652,2976.755,So you think relators can get part of the Government's recovery even where their initial allegations before the Government intervenes have nothing whatever to do with the reason the Government is ultimately giving money?
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2979.287,2985.707,I guess I would... I would disagree with the premise that his reasons had nothing whatever to do with why the Government is getting money.
2006.05-1272,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2990.659,2992.189,"So you don't believe that, then."
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3002.981,3004.277,--It has to be connected with his allegations.
2006.05-1272,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3026.861,3028.158,What do you mean by connected?
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3053.397,3061.973,"--No, and I think I would put that with the hypothetical that I offered about the Government adding a claim that Rockwell had misrepresented its compliance with the antidiscrimination laws."
2006.05-1272,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3068.798,3071.829,"And it doesn't matter to you if he just, if he's completely wrong?"
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3089.337,3097.522,"I think we would... I think there could still be a sufficient connection even if his reason for thinking the pondcrete failed, they all turned out to be correct."
2006.05-1272,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3142.613,3143.676,Try this hypothetical.
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3186.267,3186.814,"Well, I think--"
2006.05-1272,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3186.814,3192.594,Does he get money just because he came out with the same charge that the Government ultimately proves?
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3199.154,3208.493,"--I mean, I need to know more about the hypothetical, but my initial reaction is that that's a complaint that's easily dismissed based on Rule 11, leaving aside the question of any public disclosure."
2006.05-1272,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3211.008,3212.834,"Well, assume one that just gets over the line."
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3212.834,3226.862,"--I think if the complaint just gets over the line, that is if the evidence in the relator's possession is just barely good enough to sustain the allegation of fraud or at least to allow the suit to go forward, there's no reason to read the public disclosure--"
2006.05-1272,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3226.862,3227.86,It turns out to be entirely wrong.
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3235.404,3241.856,--I think we would still want to compare the nature of the fraud that the Government alleged with the nature of the fraud that the relator alleged.
2006.05-1272,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3342.86,3370.334,Explain why it would be a minor variation if what he has identified as a defect in the pipe system and what turns out to be the situation that was covered up is the inadequate cement that caused the loss?
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3370.334,3375.269,--It's a minor variation in the sense that it's not relevant to the defendant's ultimate liability.
2006.05-1272,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3413.675,3434.667,"May I ask this question: Supposing he is the only source of the information that's publicly disclosed on which precipitated the filing of the complaint, and after the complaint is filed discovery reveals other violations of law on which the Government prevails, but they do not prevail on the theory of the original complaint."
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3443.476,3448.506,"I mean, my instinct would be that probably he could still recover."
2006.05-1272,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3457.236,3461.234,Assuming we only look at the public information at the time the complaint is filed.
2006.05-1272,4,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3461.234,3481.523,"I mean, probably that question would raise no public disclosure issue to begin with, because if there had been no... at least if there had been no public disclosure of the fraudulent conduct that was revealed through discovery, there would be no need for him to satisfy the original source test with respect to those new allegations."
2006.05-1272,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3481.523,3483.289,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2006.05-1272,5,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3486.099,3500.266,"I would like to first just address, the Government's suggested that he could be an original source because he had knowledge of false representations and concealments derived throughout his employment."
2006.05-1272,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3533.189,3544.763,"What is your response to the Government's assertion, which seems to me quite true, that in order to... in order to prevail it did not have to show why these blocks were not solidified?"
2006.05-1272,5,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3544.763,3545.685,I think what--
2006.05-1272,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3545.685,3547.871,It just had to show that they weren't.
2006.05-1272,5,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3552.869,3561.162,"--Your Honor, the point is that Mr. Stone wasn't there when the manufacturing problems occurred, so he didn't actually have direct knowledge that pondcrete was leaking."
2006.05-1272,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3691.281,3693.39,There were other documents.
2006.05-1272,5,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3701.528,3704.855,"Your Honor, what they're referring to is the affidavit, I think."
2006.05-1272,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3717.037,3718.224,Thank you Ms. Mahoney.
