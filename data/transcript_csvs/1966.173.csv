1966.173,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,23.402,Commissioner of Internal Revenue versus Howe A. Stidger et ux.
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,29.859,34.422,"Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices."
1966.173,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,178.981,184.304,"This -- he was -- he wasn't assigned to a ship when he was overseas, was he?"
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,184.304,185.716,No sir.
1966.173,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,185.857,186.768,He's not on a carrier.
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,190.146,190.498,A land base.
1966.173,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,190.498,193.568,"-- naval base, naval aviation land base or what?"
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,193.568,194.848,"Yes sir, a marine air base."
1966.173,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,194.848,195.8,Marine air station?
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,195.8,196.775,Yes sir.
1966.173,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,196.775,209.55,"Mr. Rogovin, in your statement, you said he was permanently assigned to -- or something to that effect, assigned in a permanent station in the Pacific."
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,212.229,214.089,This is a word of art --
1966.173,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,214.089,214.462,Is it in the record?
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,214.462,215.742,-- Justice Fortas.
1966.173,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,225.256,232.931,And this was officially designated as a permanent duty station?
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,232.931,240.429,The actual orders are not part of the record.
1966.173,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,256.122,263.958,And this may -- it seems to me that it may have some significance with respect to the outcome of this case.
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,268.406,268.488,Yes sir.
1966.173,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,268.488,279.621,"-- but perhaps at some point, you can tell me whether there is anything in this record that characterizes that duty station as permanent."
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,279.621,283.907,Yes sir.
1966.173,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,354.676,359.847,"Now, if he had not been overseas, would he have had this subsistence allowance?"
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,359.847,368.973,"Yes sir, both allowances were obtainable under any circumstance of service, whether it be in the United States or the (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.173,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,368.973,371.122,"For any married officer, is that it?"
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,371.122,376.918,The dependent -- the quarters allowance depends on your marital status and your rank.
1966.173,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,377.364,379.243,"Right, but you get a quarters allowance --"
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,379.243,379.268,Yes sir.
1966.173,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,379.268,380.123,-- if you're married?
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,380.123,380.603,That's -- yes sir.
1966.173,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,380.603,383.597,The amount of it depends upon your rank and your -- and what?
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,385.47,387.636,I believe it's just whether they are married or --
1966.173,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,387.636,388.259,Or not?
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,388.259,388.936,Yes sir.
1966.173,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,388.936,392.589,"An unmarried officer doesn't get a quarters allowance, does he generally?"
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,392.589,394.762,"Generally, he does not but he can under certain circumstances --"
1966.173,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,394.762,395.605,Yes.
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,395.605,397.133,-- as I understand it.
1966.173,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,397.133,399.128,But area officer gets the subsistence allowance?
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,399.128,399.557,Yes sir.
1966.173,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,400.236,401.476,Wherever he is?
1966.173,0,38508,rogovin,,401.476,406.62,Yes sir.
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,2206.997,2209.099,May it please the Court.
1966.173,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2309.336,2311.366,That's in 37 United States Code Mr. Reed (Inaudible).
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,2311.366,2312.881,"Yes sir, that's --"
1966.173,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2319.657,2320.493,Thank you.
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,2320.493,2334.836,And so the -- when the -- this Revenue Ruling about permanent duty stations which was first promulgated in 1955 and I think had no counterpart in any earlier ruling.
1966.173,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2493.11,2497.032,He's gone 10 months altogether?
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,2497.032,2501.753,He was out of United States a little over 11 months.
1966.173,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2565.798,2570.676,"I understood there were -- as you say -- there was no issue as to that, as to the time he was away from Iwakuni as I --"
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,2570.676,2571.692,"I'm not sure, (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.173,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2571.692,2592.557,"As I read the end of the -- here at page 17, the petitioner himself says that the only issue before the Court, the only issue remaining is whether or not petitioners are entitled to a deduction for traveling expenses consisting of meals while at Iwakuni, Japan to the taxable year 1958."
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,2599.653,2608.473,"Well, the conclusion of the Government's brief is that the judgment below should be reversed for -- I don't know what their -- had -- what the Government's position is on these two months, Mr. Justice."
1966.173,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2609.97,2612.457,Yes.
1966.173,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2612.457,2619.305,"And you claim Mr. Reed is that on this itinerary, this shows only eight months, actually at the --"
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,2619.305,2622.371,240 days at Iwakuni during the calendar year 58.
1966.173,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2622.371,2624.399,And the claim deduction was for --
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,2624.399,2624.409,10 months
1966.173,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2624.409,2628.17,"-- 10 months for $65, isn't that right?"
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,2633.363,2641.827,And Captain Stidger testified on that and -- before the Tax Court that he did moved around from point to point and that he got his meals wherever he could.
1966.173,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2648.593,2652.948,"But when he was away from, at Ikanuwi, whatever the name of the place is --"
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,2652.948,2653.837,Iwakuni.
1966.173,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2653.837,2657.345,"-- he got his expenses, was he not?"
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,2657.345,2666.262,"Well, he did for 49 days and for those 49 days for which he did get his per diem allowance, he is claiming no deduction."
1966.173,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2679.554,2680.722,Yes.
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,2680.722,2697.442,I think the other two weeks are the two weeks that he got back to California in mid-December.
1966.173,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3086.073,3090.418,"Mr. Reed, what do you do with Mr. Rogovin's illustration?"
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,3126.679,3126.7,I would not --
1966.173,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3126.7,3127.232,He says --
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,3127.232,3129.942,I would not permit Mr. Rogovin to deduct his lunch.
1966.173,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3143.643,3157.417,"Well yes, but in theory, that is to say if we are going to engage in (Inaudible) to getting to believe is the dubious exercise of logic as applied to this problem."
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,3186.592,3204.625,"I don't think so, perhaps this -- perhaps there's a logical, theoretical point there but I would think this Court in the footnote to its opinion in this case could make it clear that it wasn't covering that situation."
1966.173,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3218.077,3221.482,"But suppose he lives out in the Morris Country, New Jersey Mr. Reed --"
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,3221.482,3221.732,Mr. Weisman (ph) --
1966.173,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3221.732,3226.129,-- and he commutes now or commutes to New York City everyday?
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,3226.129,3226.696,I have --
1966.173,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3226.696,3228.014,Is that all part of the home area?
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,3228.014,3229.469,"I think so, I think so."
1966.173,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3229.469,3234.389,I guess it's going to get bigger when people commute by plane.
1966.173,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3234.389,3238.301,"Well, there are good many people now who live in Washington and work in New York and the reverse."
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,3238.301,3239.095,Yes.
1966.173,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3239.095,3243.826,"And if they do it everyday -- commute everyday, what about that?"
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,3243.826,3251.122,"What you make out of that, I think a -- I think part of the work here can be done by the ordinary and necessary part of the statute."
1966.173,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3263.863,3265.994,What do you mean?
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,3265.994,3280.24,I really don't think that that should affect the result of this case.
1966.173,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3458.356,3481.735,"Mr. Reed, I noticed in the Government's brief a reference to the action taken by the Congress with respect to Congressmen that is to say that the writing for a specific sum, legislating a specific sum, which they may deduct for their expenses while in Washington."
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,3521.078,3532.064,"Well, I think that -- I think he -- I think in this -- he can deduct his expenses only if he's away from home."
1966.173,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3588.453,3588.468,Why?
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,3588.468,3591.436,"And therefore, he should only be allowed of his expenses back in the home district."
1966.173,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3591.436,3594.091,But then his family shouldn't be living here maybe --
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,3594.091,3594.155,Should not be.
1966.173,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3594.155,3595.371,-- for one reason or another.
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,3668.304,3672.278,"I don't think it's really relevant to this case, Mr. Justice."
1966.173,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3709.585,3734.209,"But ordinarily, he would -- by ordinary principles of construction, I suspect that you would take that as in effect the Congressional revalidation of the services interpretation at least in prior, because that would indicate very clearly that as you stated, Congress did know of the service's construction."
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,3755.511,3756.853,"Well, I agree Your Honor."
1966.173,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3797.033,3830.868,"Mr. Reed, what is your answer to the argument of the Government that the only case in point that's on this subject is in favor of the Government than it was in 1941 in the Fourth Circuit and Congress has had that information ever since that the Department has acted this way since 1941 at least and they say before that, and still no change has been made by the Congress."
1966.173,1,32586,john_a_reed,,3830.868,3831.632,Yes.
