2004.03-1116,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,6.258,We will now hear argument in Granholm against Heald and two related cases.
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,7.695,11.604,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,66.394,78.863,"Well, under your view, could the three-tier system, itself, be challenged by a New Jersey wholesaler wanting to sell in New York, or a New York wholesaler wanting to sell in New Jersey?"
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,78.863,80.129,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2004.03-1116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,80.129,83.658,"So, under your view, the whole three-tier system has to go down?"
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,83.658,84.881,"No, Justice Kennedy."
2004.03-1116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,93.253,94.59,"Well, under my hypothetical."
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,103.632,112.955,"--That is... or a challenge, as you ask the question, Justice Kennedy, could be mounted to that, under the same theory that we're advocating here."
2004.03-1116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,118.101,120.567,But so far as... the rationale is the same.
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,120.567,120.803,--The--
2004.03-1116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,120.803,129.032,"It seems to me that, under your rationale, that that in-state licensing system has to fall if there's a New Jersey wholesaler."
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,129.032,131.399,--It has to pass constitutional muster.
2004.03-1116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,131.399,155.365,"And when you say there is no precedent... I mean, I think a much more modest claim than you're making, the claim simply that a state cannot discriminate against out-of-state liquor... i.e., the physical liquid... which is really more modest and keeps the three-tier effect... now, your... that claim, that they couldn't do that, was really what was advanced in Young's Market."
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,176.903,180.92,"Your Honor, Young's Market... the result in Young's Market was correct--"
2004.03-1116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,180.92,185.528,"The result, I understand, you could put on the basis of there being no discrimination."
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,185.528,186.219,--Exactly.
2004.03-1116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,186.219,192.749,"Reading Justice Brandeis' opinion, I can't believe that that was the basis for his result."
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,192.749,202.382,The... the cases that followed Young's Market and purported to apply its reasoning took a very sweeping view of the Twenty-First Amendment.
2004.03-1116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,208.573,217.472,"But why wasn't that broad view appropriate, given the difference between the language of the Wilson Act, which has had the words"
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,247.127,254.286,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the... there was no need for the Webb-Kenyon Act to repeat the language of the Wilson Act."
2004.03-1116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,264.624,271.009,"Well, maybe that's the Act, but when they put it in the Constitution, why didn't they adopt the language,"
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,273.399,283.312,"--I think the reason for that is because it was so obvious that the state could not, prior to prohibition, discriminate."
2004.03-1116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,289.026,302.538,"But it was not obvious to the person who at least drafted the Webb-Kenyon in the first instance, because as I... as I understand it, there was an anti-discrimination provision, and that was then dropped."
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,305.465,308.605,It was dropped essentially because it was redundant.
2004.03-1116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,308.605,312.913,"Well, but is that a... is that on a legislative history record somewhere?"
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,313.55,318.003,"No, Justice Souter, that is not expressly on the record."
2004.03-1116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,431.181,434.782,"Well, it's not only temperance, but it's control over revenues."
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,440.037,441.275,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,441.275,442.627,And is it collected by the wholesaler?
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,442.627,443.302,"Yes, it is."
2004.03-1116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,443.302,444.23,All right.
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,447.427,450.078,It's... it turns out to--
2004.03-1116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,450.078,450.783,Is it on one--
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,450.783,451.644,"--a few cents a bottle, yes."
2004.03-1116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,451.644,452.133,--It is on one--
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,452.133,453.278,It's on... it's... and all alcohol.
2004.03-1116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,453.278,461.284,"--Under our cases, can the California winery be required to remit the tax to the New York State revenue authorities?"
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,461.284,462.781,"We believe so, Your Honor."
2004.03-1116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,462.781,464.22,Is that consistent with Quill?
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,464.22,466.151,It is consistent with Quill.
2004.03-1116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,495.294,495.816,What--
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,495.816,495.977,Under--
2004.03-1116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,495.977,503.426,"--what do you make of the argument that there's no practical way, except at great expense, to audit compliance if they're out of state?"
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,503.426,518.572,"--Justice Souter, this is one of the most regulated industries in America, of course, and the model legislation that has been adopted by a number of states includes record-keeping provisions, it requires that wineries--"
2004.03-1116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,518.572,528.967,"Well, I will grant that's required, but the argument, as I understand it, is, to find out whether they're doing what they are required to do, you've got to drop in unexpectedly and make an audit."
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,532.47,545.924,"--No, it's important to recognize, Justice Souter, that under the three-tier system, which is... which is where the states of New York and Michigan are saying that the other state wineries have to go... the three-tier system does not do that."
2004.03-1116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,552.075,552.517,So you're--
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,552.517,552.692,Should they--
2004.03-1116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,552.692,556.413,"--saying they are not dropping in to local wineries to do audits, in fact?"
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,556.413,558.539,"--They may, in some instances."
2004.03-1116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,562.358,563.874,What do we have in the record on that?
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,563.874,570.63,"There is not... there is not a great deal on the record, either way, on that, Your Honor."
2004.03-1116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,570.63,578.966,"I don't know what you mean by ""it's primarily a federal activity"", that the Federal Government polices compliance with the state tax laws?"
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,578.966,580.699,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-1116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,581.796,582.187,How does that occur?
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,582.187,597.023,"--under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, any violation of a state law is a federal offense and it is a violation... so basically, whether it's under-age access, whether it's taxation, whatever--"
2004.03-1116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,597.023,602.276,But does the federal authority make a routine audit to see that the state tax has been paid?
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,602.276,609.959,"--Basically, every single time that there is a transaction, it is recorded by the U.S. Trade and Tax Bureau."
2004.03-1116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,614.49,616.02,I have just one further question.
2004.03-1116,0,18376,clint_bolick,,624.834,627.762,"Justice Ginsburg, very important question."
2004.03-1116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,661.206,662.384,Thank you.
2004.03-1116,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,662.384,669.02,Ms. Sullivan?
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,669.02,671.364,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1116,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,679.524,683.418,"Well, it's very narrow, but the rationale is sweeping, and that's why I asked."
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,699.785,710.871,"All that we ask in this case, Justice Kennedy, is that you strike down Michigan and New York's decision to apply the three-tier system to everyone except their own in-state--"
2004.03-1116,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,710.871,711.57,"Well, I know, but what--"
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,711.57,711.836,--producers of wine--
2004.03-1116,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,711.836,714.957,--but you're... all you're asking is for a rationale that's sweeping.
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,714.957,734.609,"--Justice Kennedy, in our case, we want to suggest that it is... just as in Healy and Bacchus... that a law that discriminates in favor of in-state producers and against out-of-state producers loses its immunity afforded by the Twenty-First Amendment."
2004.03-1116,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,771.95,792.682,"Your answer to Justice Kennedy, I glean from what you said, that if New York took away the direct-sale privilege that in-state wineries get, then out-of-state wineries wouldn't be any better off, but they'd have nothing to complain about."
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,792.682,794.561,"--That's exactly correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-1116,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,817.107,817.73,But that's a decision for the state to make.
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,819.533,820.49,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-1116,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,820.49,822.334,--Not for this Court.
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,822.334,823.034,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,823.034,833.56,"You don't deny that a state... that Michigan could bar all out-of-state wine... not just... not just California, but they could bar all out-of-state wines?"
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,833.56,842.35,"That's correct, Justice Stevens, if it were in aid, and only if it were in aid, of the states... and necessary to serve the state's internal purposes."
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,842.35,844.8,"The only reason being given to give a monopoly to local producers, that's their--"
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,844.8,844.954,That's--
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,844.954,845.588,--whole purpose.
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,846.689,851.125,"--The state can have a monopoly if it's, itself, a market participant."
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.503,859.608,"No, I'm saying just to look at the... just limit to the market to... the only market participants would be Michigan wine--"
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,859.608,860.06,--Private--
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.06,860.545,--wineries.
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,860.545,865.831,"--Justice Stevens, a state may not discriminate against out-of-staters for the sole purpose of economic protectionism."
2004.03-1116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,865.831,868.487,"Well, I'm trying to think of what Brandeis could have been thinking."
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,868.487,869.67,In Young's Market.
2004.03-1116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,869.67,870.77,"Yes, that's right."
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,887.961,888.472,Correct.
2004.03-1116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,888.472,894.506,--which meant that the foreign liquor has to be treated better than domestic liquor.
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,929.175,929.941,But Justice--
2004.03-1116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,929.941,931.666,"Now, maybe... I think that's how he's reasoning."
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,931.666,932.103,--But--
2004.03-1116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,932.103,934.884,"And if he is, and even if he isn't, why isn't that right?"
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,934.884,949.398,"--Justice Breyer, the Young's Market language permitting state discrimination is, indeed, broad, but it's been superceded by 40 years of this Court's jurisprudence harmonizing the Twenty-First Amendment with the rest of the Constitution."
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.035,971.211,But Craig against Boren was--
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,971.211,971.509,--has been--
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.509,973.27,--had nothing to do with the Commerce Clause.
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,973.27,979.947,"--Correct, Your Honor, but if... if there were a law... the states are claiming that any law governing--"
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,979.947,980.833,"Nothing to do with importation, either."
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,980.833,989.623,--But the dormant Commerce Clause reflects a fundamental structural principle that is every bit as much a part of the Constitution as the Equal Protection Clause upheld in Craig v. Boren.
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1008.704,1009.239,Do you think Congress--
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1009.239,1009.6,--in Craig v. Boren--
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.6,1013.255,--could enact a statute authorizing the states to do just what they've done here?
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1013.255,1014.765,"--Absolutely, but it has not."
2004.03-1116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1143.239,1155.921,"Okay, we've got one difference from Bacchus, because the claim that's being made here, which I gather was not made, or made seriously, in Bacchus, is there really is a need for differential treatment for purposes of enforcement."
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1158.632,1159.74,Justice--
2004.03-1116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1159.74,1163.811,How are we supposed... what standard are we supposed to use to judge that argument?
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1166.187,1172.208,"--Justice Souter, we believe the standard should be strict scrutiny, though there must be a necessity to serve--"
2004.03-1116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1172.208,1173.149,Because--
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1173.149,1173.743,--a legitimate--
2004.03-1116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1173.743,1174.164,--it's facial discrimination.
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1174.164,1175.242,--Because it's facial discrimination.
2004.03-1116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1242.074,1243.725,But what about audits for revenue--
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1243.725,1257.079,"--On revenue, the nondiscriminatory means that's available to the state that Michigan and New York have not shown any reason to reject... 26 states have adopted some version of this... is to require an out-of-state winery to get a permit."
2004.03-1116,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1286.155,1286.484,Well--
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1286.484,1286.974,--level playing field--
2004.03-1116,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1286.974,1288.188,"--well, they do today, I'm sure, but--"
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1291.219,1294.237,"--But, Justice Souter, to... look at the experience--"
2004.03-1116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1294.237,1296.64,--They... you say they don't want to go to California to do an audit.
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1296.64,1304.578,"--They certainly don't, Justice Souter, but New Hampshire is a state that has actually... your own state is a state that has on its Web site a set of out-of-state wineries."

2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1317.37,1317.709,--in the field.
2004.03-1116,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1317.709,1319.944,--may I... may I... I just want to clarify one point.
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1333.214,1333.651,That's correct.
2004.03-1116,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1333.651,1334.257,--That is your--
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1334.257,1335.133,"That's correct, Justice Kennedy."
2004.03-1116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1369.114,1369.511,Could--
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1369.511,1370.372,--in Reno versus ACLU--
2004.03-1116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1370.372,1371.645,--could a state--
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1371.645,1372.877,--so it makes every interstate--
2004.03-1116,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1372.877,1385.053,"--could a state require an out-of-state winery to keep its books online, subject to a password, so that, with a password, they could go in and audit the books across the country, by wire?"
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1385.053,1394.899,"--Yes, Justice Souter, if it were part of a... an agreement to a permit that the... that the out-of-state winery is willing to make, then there's no extraterritorial regulation there, that would be just fine."
2004.03-1116,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1425.188,1440.121,"--Commerce Clause, in effect, protects consumers in states from entrenched business interests that want to have protectionism, and you're... you object to that and invoke the Commerce Clause to do it."
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1445.521,1449.732,"Justice Kennedy, reciprocity laws... yet... possibly."
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1506.543,1507.057,Let me just--
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1507.057,1507.394,--be necessary here.
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1507.394,1509.327,--be sure I heard your answer to Justice Kennedy correctly.
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1513.2,1528.117,"Not... they are subject to heightened scrutiny because they discriminate against out-of-staters in a way that you could not... for example, in New Energy, you said that you can't have a preference for... you can't have a discrimination in Ohio in reciprocity for Indiana."
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1532.839,1537.187,"And you contend that they do... the liquor reciprocity laws, all of them are unconstitutional."
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1537.187,1544.712,"Not... we contend that they would be subject to strict scrutiny, and they could be upheld if the state could show that they are closely tailored in a--"
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1544.712,1545.528,They can... that they can be--
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1545.528,1545.988,--way that these laws are not.
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1545.988,1548.73,--upheld by making a showing that you say is virtually impossible to make.
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1548.73,1552.575,"Your Honor, that's not before, and if there were other reasons--"
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1552.575,1553.142,"No, but I think it is--"
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1553.142,1553.329,--the state could--
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.757,1560.758,"--it is an interesting question as to whether that's a... that's a... you know, that's a necessary consequence of this decision, in your view."
2004.03-1116,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1560.758,1566.559,Nothing in this decision requires you to reach the question of whether there are other state defenses in other cases.
2004.03-1116,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1580.459,1580.91,"Thank you, Ms. Sullivan."
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1588.942,1592.357,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1116,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1637.574,1642.041,"Now the Bacchus case cuts against you, to some extent."
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1642.041,1648.956,--The Bacchus case was a very unique situation that we believe is not in any way controlling in the present case.
2004.03-1116,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1660.561,1675.79,"Well, but I think what's fairly implied in Justice O'Connor's question, you have to look at the language of Bacchus, and the language of Bacchus, in effect, restored the anti-discrimination component of the Commerce Clause to liquor control."
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1680.551,1682.424,I disagree that that is a necessary reading--
2004.03-1116,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1682.424,1682.819,--And I know it--
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1682.819,1683.113,--of the case.
2004.03-1116,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1683.113,1684.284,--involved pineapple wine and all that.
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1690.053,1694.573,"Correct, but you're... you have to understand that language in light of the actual context."
2004.03-1116,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1697.781,1702.005,"Well, then you have to understand Young in the light of its context, where there was no discrimination--"
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1702.005,1705.198,"There was discrimination in Young, Your Honor, and I'd like to get to that."
2004.03-1116,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1711.822,1715.949,"No, but the question was before the Court, because the dissent certainly raised the question."
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1715.949,1716.577,--Correct.
2004.03-1116,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1731.018,1732.579,"Well, why don't you focus on that?"
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1740.072,1740.354,--Well--
2004.03-1116,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1740.354,1744.91,So why don't you at least address how you would distinguish Bacchus?
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1749.345,1756.52,"--The only justification for the statute in Bacchus was what the Court characterized as ""mere protectionism""."
2004.03-1116,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.583,1775.439,"Well, no... I mean, that--"
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1775.439,1775.648,Do you--
2004.03-1116,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.648,1785.713,"--that rather lengthy statement you made earlier, that the Bacchus case didn't involve the importation of alcohol."
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1800.253,1801.588,--It was treating--
2004.03-1116,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1801.588,1802.619,--the case didn't involve it?
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1802.619,1813.861,"--it was treating two particular items of in-state production differently than all other in-state items and out-of-state items; but it was a taxation issue, not an importation issue."
2004.03-1116,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1831.494,1840.658,"Well, why don't we focus on the Court's rationale, which was stated very concisely by Justice White."
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1876.828,1879.897,--That was the first stage of the Court's analysis.
2004.03-1116,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1889.058,1894.949,"Well, your opponents have said that there isn't any clear countervailing interest here."
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1919.215,1919.377,--We--
2004.03-1116,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1919.377,1920.215,--the substantial interest?
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1920.215,1921.66,--we disagree wholeheartedly with that.
2004.03-1116,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1922.534,1922.915,"I know, but--"
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1922.915,1926.308,--the Michigan regulations do promote the state's interest in temperance.
2004.03-1116,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1929.11,1931.469,"--Well, you... I mean, you say that, but how?"
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1939.206,1946.897,"--But the key is, with an in-state licensee, the state has the ability to enforce against that licensee, to inspect, to punish the licensee--"
2004.03-1116,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1946.897,1947.32,Do we--
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1947.32,1948.016,--to hold them accountable.
2004.03-1116,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1948.016,1955.686,"--do we have a record of what the state is doing with respect to its in-state licensees, indicating what it could not do effectively to out-of-staters?"
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1956.816,1967.791,"The record in this case consisted of a small number of affidavits, answers to interrogatories, some surveys that were submitted as exhibits to motions for summary judgement."
2004.03-1116,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1978.664,1979.304,"Well, should--"
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1979.304,1979.902,--was not fully developed.
2004.03-1116,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1979.902,1999.02,"--should we send it back for... if we disagree with the rationale, should one or the other of these cases go back for evidence on what, in fact, the state is doing in relation to its in-state licensees and evidence that it could not effectively do the same with respect to out-of-staters?"
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1999.02,2000.709,"Yes, if--"
2004.03-1116,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2000.709,2002.228,And what would you show?
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2004.581,2020.959,--We would show that the Michigan requirement limiting sales and direct shipping to in-state licensees is required because the state only has effective enforcement authority over in-state licensees.
2004.03-1116,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2021.245,2022.078,"Well, but wait a minute."
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2040.396,2044.36,--Michigan does have a current license for out-state seller of wine.
2004.03-1116,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2045.674,2047.742,But could you not require submission to--
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2047.742,2048.475,--We--
2004.03-1116,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2048.475,2051.625,--Michigan's jurisdiction for all purposes of enforcement?
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2051.625,2053.862,"--Certainly, we could pass a law to that effect."
2004.03-1116,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2054.507,2076.737,"And if you... if you did that, could you require, as I suggested of Counsel on the other side, that you... that, as a condition of the licensing, that the business records of these companies be placed in some secure online fashion, that, with a password, you could get into and do an audit across the continent just as readily as you could do an audit next door?"
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2079.168,2083.822,--But there is no guarantee that such an audit would be just the same as an audit of an in-state--
2004.03-1116,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2083.822,2113.131,"--Well, let me ask, once we accept the proposition... I think this is the necessary reading of Bacchus... that the Commerce Clause applies to liquor and prevents discrimination, it seems to me it's just like any other commodity... food, milk, et cetera... and, in this case, you have a very substantial burden to show that this discriminatory treatment is justified... maybe strict scrutiny, maybe heightened scrutiny."
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2119.066,2135.921,"--Despite the lack of evidence in the record and the fact that District Court did not consider that evidence, the Sixth Circuit dismissed all of those claims of the state and remanded for entry of judgement on the Plaintiffs without giving us an opportunity to develop that record."
2004.03-1116,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2137.615,2138.742,"See, I don't... I don't understand."
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2142.377,2142.858,--There was--
2004.03-1116,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.858,2143.91,--a discriminatory matter.
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2158.317,2158.883,--There--
2004.03-1116,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.883,2159.895,You had your chance to show it.
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2159.895,2161.536,--there was evidence in the record.
2004.03-1116,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2166.2,2166.837,"All right, well--"
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2166.837,2167.178,--against Internet--
2004.03-1116,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.178,2174.74,"--tell us what those... what that material is, and if we find that material sustains your burden, that's fine, you win; and if it doesn't, you lose."
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2179.78,2185.901,"--Our key position is that before you get to that kind of evidentiary burden, the legal question--"
2004.03-1116,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2185.901,2187.33,That's what I'm interested in.
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2264.45,2267.943,--We disagree with that entire position.
2004.03-1116,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2268.739,2269.266,I know you do.
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2269.746,2274.996,--the text of the Twenty-First Amendment... the text of the Twenty-First Amendment gives states the right to control imports.
2004.03-1116,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2284.774,2287.463,Do you think--
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2287.463,2287.874,--the Commerce Clause.
2004.03-1116,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2287.874,2295.019,"--that Michigan can prohibit the importation of any wine, but still allow its own wine to be produced, sold, and consumed?"
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2295.019,2295.63,Yes.
2004.03-1116,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2298.158,2316.347,"I know you do, but the principle of Webb-Kenyon, which was enacted when the Wilson Act was already there... very clear... is to stop the original package doctrine, stop favoritism of the out-of-state liquor shipment, which meant, in a dry state, you had to sell less."
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2326.606,2328.302,"--The title of the Webb-Kenyon Act is,"
2004.03-1116,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2353.995,2363.071,"Well, then you are asking us, I guess, not only to reject Bacchus, but who was the first one that said that the Commerce Clause remains alive and well?"
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2366.661,2367.013,That may be.
2004.03-1116,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2370.281,2373.479,--In the context of alcoholic beverages.
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2373.479,2383.017,"--In the context of powers expressly conferred upon the states by the Twenty-First Amendment, that's an exception to the operation... the normal operation of the dormant Commerce Clause."
2004.03-1116,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2391.915,2400.496,"But that's a different argument than the one you made before, which seems to be saying the Twenty-First Amendment trumps, not that the two have to be harmonized."
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2400.496,2419.005,"When you read the two in light of each other, the purposes of each, it is clear that the purpose of the Twenty-First Amendment was to remove alcohol from interstate commerce as a constitutional matter, to prevent Congress from tampering with it in the future, to give the judgement to the states as to--"
2004.03-1116,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2419.005,2419.447,"Well, you--"
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2419.447,2419.87,--the necessity for--
2004.03-1116,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2419.87,2425.37,"--you say further than that; you say the purpose was to allow that the states discriminate in favor of home industry, if it chooses."
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2425.37,2427.418,"--That is one of the purposes, yes."
2004.03-1116,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2444.125,2447.392,But that gets us back to Bacchus and what to make of that.
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2447.392,2453.569,"I... as I indicated, I don't believe Bacchus overrules those cases; it didn't even cite most of those cases."
2004.03-1116,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2454.217,2456.334,"Well, the dissent seemed to think so--"
2004.03-1116,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2457.921,2460.295,--That's correct.

2004.03-1116,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2536.412,2547.86,"Do you... do you take the position that your colleague on your same side takes, that a state can permit only the sale, consumption, and... of its own wines, and bar all out-of-state wines?"
2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2547.86,2555.886,--The express terms of the Twenty-First Amendment would allow that if... particularly if it were necessary to advance the concerns of the Twenty-First Amendment.

2004.03-1116,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2556.956,2557.13,No--
2004.03-1116,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2557.13,2558.439,--don't put in the qualifications.
2004.03-1116,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2558.439,2558.867,--just for local protectionism.

2004.03-1116,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2561.407,2564.046,It's just for local protectionism.
2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2567.638,2573.668,"The terms of the amendment would allow that, but I don't think the Court needs to explore the outer parameters of the Twenty-First--"

2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2583.244,2586.638,"--It could be done, but that question really isn't presented here, because--"
2004.03-1116,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2586.638,2588.664,But could Congress pass a law forbidding it?

2004.03-1116,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2591.815,2592.062,Yeah.
2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2600.142,2603.685,"--Let me answer both of those questions, if I can, Your Honor."
2004.03-1116,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2637.541,2638.221,How can that be?
2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2648.026,2658.217,The legislative history makes clear that the Twenty-First Amendment was intended to eliminate the impediments posed by the dormant Commerce Clause and authorize states to regulate it.
2004.03-1116,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2658.217,2662.173,But you... you want us to read it by its terms.
2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2672.131,2674.51,By terms of our--
2004.03-1116,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2674.51,2675.746,So you don't want us to read it absolutely.
2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2675.746,2682.126,"--Your Honor, I don't think that... again, I don't think that you need to decide those questions in this case."
2004.03-1116,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2689.614,2691.82,But it also goes to the very core of the Commerce Clause.
2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2707.886,2710.6,"--North Dakota indicates otherwise, I believe, Your Honor."
2004.03-1116,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2732.233,2732.713,"Well, but that's fine."
2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2742.814,2744.418,--But there is good reason--
2004.03-1116,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2744.418,2751.486,"Now, if you're willing to... okay, if you're willing to acknowledge that, then we're halfway there and we're just arguing about whether there is good reason here or not."
2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2751.486,2753.414,"--There is good reason here, Your Honor."

2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2783.623,2785.009,"--It is wrong, Your Honor."
2004.03-1116,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2798.189,2799.262,What do they inspect them for?
2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2800.345,2808.163,"--Well, more than that, and this is why the physical presence is important and why the Internet hypothetical that Your Honor raised would not... would not satisfy the state's concerns."
2004.03-1116,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2819.476,2821.288,And is there a record that the state is doing that?

2004.03-1116,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2827.332,2829.361,"Well, isn't that the end of that issue, then?"
2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2831.729,2859.689,"--Your Honor, there is material in the McKeon affidavit, which is in the Joint Appendix... Mr. McKeon is the Chair of the state liquor authority... but it's also the case that to suggest that because there is some option out there... and there's no firm evidence that a less prescriptive rule would, in fact, satisfy the state's concerns in preventing diversion and tax evasion... but the possibility that's there's some rule out there, because other states have adopted more lax rules, is to treat alcohol like any other product."
2004.03-1116,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2865.469,2877.387,"Well, the Twenty-First Amendment at least recognizes that alcohol can be treated as unique, and the issue here is whether you're really doing that in a way that supports your claim of interest."
2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2877.387,2878.22,--Yes--
2004.03-1116,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2878.22,2890.58,"And, so far, the one specific thing I've heard from you is that state inspectors do go on winery premises, and they count bottles, and they see if they match what's on the written record."
2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2890.58,2892.89,--They also draw on the assistance of local law enforcement.
2004.03-1116,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2893.643,2894.288,But if that's--
2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2894.288,2894.616,--set forth--
2004.03-1116,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2894.616,2899.373,"--if that's really what New York's concern is, then why does New York say,"

2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2995.55,3006.315,"--It could be selling to minors, but it could also simply be sale out of an unlicensed premises, where you are selling outside the proper hours of sale, or sale outside of the three-tier system--"
2004.03-1116,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3006.315,3013.848,"Yeah, but if licensed premises don't serve a state interest, then you can't require a licensed premises, so that argument doesn't get too far."
2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3013.848,3022.449,"--But, Your Honor, the principle that having entities that sell liquor be licensed, is one that is at the heart, not just at the--"

2004.03-1116,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3091.746,3092.337,So the... we don't know yet.
2004.03-1116,3,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3092.337,3092.79,--We don't know.

2004.03-1116,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3389.102,3404.251,"And according to the District Court, in this very case, the State Attorney General conceded that New York's measure allowing direct sales by in-state wineries was designed to benefit local farmers."
