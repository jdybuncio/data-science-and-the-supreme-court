1988.87-1614,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-1614, Martin against Wilks and companion cases."
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,13.491,16.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1614,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,135.955,142.293,"Had... had the people who sought to intervene there, were they named in that action?"
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,142.293,143.476,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1988.87-1614,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,144.727,148.529,"The people who sought intervention, had they been named as defendants in the action?"
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,148.529,150.046,"--They had not, Your Honor."
1988.87-1614,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,150.046,152.881,Do you know why they weren't named?
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,152.881,173.378,"Certainly at the time the litigation was filed by the United States, the United States didn't name... they certainly did not have the view that they were necessary or indispensable parties for purposes of providing relief under Rule 19."
1988.87-1614,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,204.933,216.824,"Well, you know, some of our cases, like Justice Brandeis' opinion, I think, in Chase National Bank against the City of Norwalk, there isn't any duty to intervene in a case."
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,216.824,217.374,Well--
1988.87-1614,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.374,220.609,Are you trying... are you suggesting a special rule for this type of case?
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,223.828,229.481,--I'm suggesting that case was decided under the old rule and may not be fully applicable now.
1988.87-1614,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,230.25,233.285,"Well, what... what has changed that would make that case inapplicable?"
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,233.285,249.128,"--Well, it seems to me, Your Honor, that... that in the Penn-Central case, this Court with respect to the Burough of Moosic clearly determined that they had an obligation to intervene in the pending litigation in New York."
1988.87-1614,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,259.936,263.322,"Well, that was quite a different case from this, though."
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,263.322,266.506,"Well, Your Honor, I think they're perhaps closer than you may think."
1988.87-1614,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,307.083,312.052,"Well, is... is that a fact, could complete relief have been afforded without--"
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,312.052,312.635,"--Yes, sir."
1988.87-1614,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,332.116,339.12,"--Well, but it... it certainly was going to have an effect on their careers in city government, wasn't it?"
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,339.12,350.66,"Certainly to the extent that promotions in the city of Birmingham were no longer the exclusive preserve of whites, their interests were implicated."
1988.87-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,364.968,382.345,"It's more than just that promotions are no longer the exclusive preserve of whites, it's... it's that a certain number of blacks have to be favored under the consent decree, and that a white is not entitled to a promotion simply by reason of his color, under the consent decree."
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,392.57,403.343,"I think, Your Honor, if he elects to contest his interest, he has an avenue under Rule 24 to do so."
1988.87-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,420.004,421.404,"Well, that's fine, but you could have joined them."
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,435.38,452.292,"--Respectfully, Your Honor, if they are the beneficiaries of past discrimination, as I believe them fairly to be, I don't know of any of the cases of this Court that say they must be joined as a party in the action."
1988.87-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.292,457.862,"--That's how you would distinguish this from our other cases, that these people are beneficiaries of past discrimination?"
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,457.862,459.212,Certainly they are.
1988.87-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,461.814,465.583,That... that's been adjudicated... has that been adjudicated as to each of these individual--
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,465.583,468.118,"--Not as to each of these individuals, but Justice Scalia--"
1988.87-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.118,471.337,--But we're talking about individual rights that are being affected here.
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,471.337,478.259,"--We are, but we're talking about it in an incredibly unusual situation."
1988.87-1614,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,527.942,548.705,"So you answer Justice Scalia's question by saying, oh, they're beneficiaries of past discrimination, and thereby solve the problem by claiming that they are somehow the beneficiaries of a particular kind of benefit, but that seems to me precisely the kind of thing that ought to be tried."
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,558.128,562.43,"Justice Kennedy, they could have had their day in court."
1988.87-1614,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,569.103,578.808,"Do you say that because of their attorney, or were these... each of these persons represented by this attorney in 1974?"
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,578.808,580.391,"--No, Your Honor, I cannot say that."
1988.87-1614,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,595.67,598.705,Were most members of the fire department members of the union?
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,598.705,603.574,--Most white members of the fire department were members of the BFA.
1988.87-1614,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,603.574,604.942,In your--
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,604.942,605.476,The BFA--
1988.87-1614,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,605.476,611.93,"--In your view, was it appropriate for the trial court to deny the motion to intervene at the fairness hearing?"
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,611.93,618.749,"--Your Honor, that... the motion to intervene was made after the conclusion of the fairness hearing, in the first instance."
1988.87-1614,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,618.749,619.535,"Well, the day after?"
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,619.535,621.718,In the second instance--
1988.87-1614,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,621.718,622.737,Was it the day after?
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,622.737,623.953,--The day after.
1988.87-1614,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,632.509,635.045,And in your view that's a proper order?
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,635.045,637.83,"In my view, Your Honor, that is a proper order."
1988.87-1614,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,639.513,646.686,So that the duty to intervene arises at some time before the fairness hearing begins?
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,646.686,647.969,--Two responses.
1988.87-1614,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,675.103,687.346,"Well, I'm trying to fix the point at which a firefighter, say, who comes into the fire department, for six months or so, and hears about a lawsuit, suddenly has to go join it."
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,689.963,697.036,I think he must go as soon as he believes that his interest is implicated.
1988.87-1614,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,705.891,715.013,"Well, under your view, I, I suppose many of us would be... have our interests affected by lawsuits and we'd have to read the newspapers every day to see what lawsuits have been filed?"
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,715.013,758.026,"Certainly if your union, Your Honor, is following a case, actively working with one party, making a report to its membership, and if you're in Birmingham, Alabama, where many of our institutions have been restructured over the past 20 years, it is not a leap of faith to understand that when you are in a fire department with no black firemen, as was the case prior to 1968, that a federal court may well, whether by consent or by litigated judgment, impose goals to remedy the effects of past discrimination, as we believe was done properly here."
1988.87-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,758.026,783.907,"We're talking about a rule that has to apply to a lot of cases, however, and you're urging upon us, in the interest of judicial efficiency, that we have to get into, on a case by case basis, this, it seems to me, very difficult issue of whether a person has had sufficient notice that his or her rights are about to be affected, whereas the opposite rule, which has been our traditional rule, is quite simply, if you want to cut off somebody's rights, join them in the lawsuit."
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,797.401,799.853,"When you say these people, Your honor--"
1988.87-1614,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,799.853,803.638,The people that Justice Scalia just referred to.
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,803.638,804.688,--The--
1988.87-1614,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,804.688,807.34,Were any of the white firemen charged with violating the law?
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,807.34,807.957,"--No, sir."
1988.87-1614,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,807.957,809.875,Or was relief requested against them?
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,809.875,815.113,Relief has not been requested against the white firemen in any case.
1988.87-1614,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,815.113,815.513,I see.
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,815.513,834.757,"If I may respond, Justice Scalia, to your question or comment, it seems to me that the alternative of the rule we propose is simply a sanctioning of the sandbagging that occurred in this very case."
1988.87-1614,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,874.817,877.686,"Well, the city could have brought in these people."
1988.87-1614,0,28779,james_p_alexander,,877.686,880.638,"Yes, sir."
1988.87-1614,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,898.733,900.219,"Thank you, Mr. Alexander."
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,904.603,906.705,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1614,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,970.815,975.85,Do you have any statistics on how many employment actions were filed?
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,975.85,976.835,"I don't, Your Honor."
1988.87-1614,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,976.835,977.835,In that same period?
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,977.835,981.421,The 654 is the number that resulted in consent decrees.
1988.87-1614,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,982.538,987.657,Because merely because an action is filed doesn't mean that a consent decree is going to follow.
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,987.657,988.776,"--No, Your Honor."
1988.87-1614,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,990.026,995.763,"In fact, I would speculate... and it's sheer speculation... that it's probably a factor of something like 50 to one."
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,995.763,1014.225,"--Well, if the rule that Respondents urged was adopted in those other 49 cases for each of the one, massive numbers of whites would have to joined as parties, and all the problems of joinder, which I hope to get into, would be added to those other thousands and thousands of cases."
1988.87-1614,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1014.225,1024.615,"But isn't it a corollary to that that if your rule is adopted, interested employees would have to join each of the 49 suits on the grounds that they might lead to a consent decree?"
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1026.734,1031.353,I think the problems of intervention are far less than the problems of joinder.
1988.87-1614,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1033.138,1033.838,Excuse me.
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1046.529,1047.063,I think in most--
1988.87-1614,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1047.063,1052.95,"In all of the other cases, if there's not going to be any race conscious relief, there'd be no need of joinder."
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1052.95,1059.206,"--I think in most of those employment civil rights cases, there is race conscious relief, Your Honor."
1988.87-1614,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1139.741,1149.18,"But certainly notice... notice, in the sense of knowledge, has never been thought to be an adequate substitute for service, if you're trying to get jurisdiction over somebody."
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1149.18,1153.834,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, there may be three points to make in response to that."
1988.87-1614,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1160.238,1166.892,"But my point was that knowledge and notice have never been thought as a substitute for, for service."
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1166.892,1173.229,"--Well, knowledge... knowledge forms the prerequisite in estoppel cases, or waiver cases."
1988.87-1614,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1178.116,1191.273,"Well, can you cite some case from this Court which has applied the equitable doctrine of waiver to someone against whom relief was granted, it was not made a party to the action?"
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1191.273,1192.125,"Your Honor, the--"
1988.87-1614,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1192.125,1192.992,Can you?
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1192.992,1193.592,--I can't.
1988.87-1614,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1222.645,1228.215,"But this... the problem here, to my mind, is not due process but simply the rules."
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1237.821,1240.856,We're not urging that people must alert themselves.
1988.87-1614,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1249.712,1250.998,What is it that they were alerted to?
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1289.956,1302.264,"The Eleventh Circuit said, in the joint appendix at page 772 to 773, that the BFA knew of the litigation and its potential adverse effect from the time it was commenced in 1974."
1988.87-1614,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1302.264,1304.133,Potential adverse effect.
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1315.321,1320.325,"In 1977, Your Honor, in this... in that proceeding, the court entered race conscious relief."
1988.87-1614,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1405.664,1407.45,xxx parties at this time?
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1407.45,1415.27,"Yes, in this case, in this Title VII case which they brought, they were parties."
1988.87-1614,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1427.228,1434.517,"But did they get the normal sort of trial on that issue that you would if it hadn't, in the judge's view, been tried before?"
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1434.517,1436.383,The judge let them put in whatever they wanted.
1988.87-1614,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1440.337,1442.956,But what was the basis for the judge's decision in the case?
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1442.956,1444.756,--He had made several decisions.
1988.87-1614,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1504.178,1511.683,"Well, I thought the district court held that the Plaintiff's claims were impermissible collateral attacks--"
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1511.683,1512.467,"He did, Your Honor."
1988.87-1614,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1512.467,1512.867,--On the consent decrees.
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1515.55,1518.252,He... he issued several rulings.
1988.87-1614,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1520.371,1526.525,"Well, to the extent that he, the judge, determined they were impermissible attacks."
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1529.543,1533.012,"That's the issue in which the Court granted cert, but I would think, Your Honor, now that--"
1988.87-1614,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1533.012,1542.886,"Well, I mean, it's entirely possible, if not likely, that the Respondents would lose on the merits, if their claims were ever heard."
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1542.886,1543.219,--Your Honor--
1988.87-1614,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1543.219,1545.671,But I guess that's not our concern here.
1988.87-1614,1,39632,robert_d_joffe,,1545.671,1548.29,"--Your Honor, I believe they were heard on the merits."
1988.87-1614,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1576.023,1577.607,"Very well, Mr. Joffe."
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,1580.375,1583.713,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1742.998,1745.317,"Mr. Fitzpatrick, can I ask a kind of basic question here?"
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,1745.317,1746.069,"--Yes, Justice."
1988.87-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1746.069,1759.977,"Supposing instead of a settlement this case had been tried, and there were findings of fact of discrimination, and then the court made it clear that after appropriate hearings and plenty of time to study it, the court was going to enter a remedial decree that would affect whites as well as blacks."
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,1768.816,1793.114,"The question of whether or not there was a litigated decree or not, in my view, if non-parties had filed separate litigation subsequent to entry of that decree, after having been denied promotion, I would think the District Court might take into account the prior findings and... but still allow the Respondents to prove--"
1988.87-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1793.114,1793.633,"Well, that might go to whether he'd grant relief or not."
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,1804.072,1804.622,"--Excuse me, Justice."
1988.87-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1804.622,1816.916,"I'm just... I'm just... really I'm trying to get, with what I'm trying to think through is whether the fact that it's a consent decree has any bearing one way or another on your right to say, I want to attack that decree because I wasn't a party to it, and I'm not bound by it."
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,1816.916,1825.085,"In the view of the Eleventh Circuit, which I believe is the correct view, that would make no difference whether it was a litigated decree or not."
1988.87-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1831.056,1839.829,"So, really, the question isn't whether your clients are bound by the decree, the question is whether the decree is a defense to the litigation."
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,1839.829,1840.462,Yes--
1988.87-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1840.462,1840.881,And in that connection--
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,1840.881,1845.749,"--That is the defense which the Petitioners have... have alleged, and they believe it is a complete defense."
1988.87-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1845.749,1854.939,"--And of course, it may or may not be, but you at least, you have standing to say it's an invalid decree; it might have been entered fraudulently or all sorts of reasons."
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,1858.575,1871.716,"We want the opportunity to go to court and prove that under Title VII in the equal protection clause, the conduct of the city of Birmingham is outside the parameters of valid affirmative action as recognized by this Court in Johnson and Wygant."
1988.87-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1875.502,1882.774,"Well, you're not just asking for standing, you're asking us to rule on what the standards should be on deciding whether the decree is valid, is a defense of the litigation--"
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,1882.774,1888.928,"No, that is not an issue upon which certiorari was granted, although that was raised by the Petitioners."
1988.87-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1899.652,1899.969,--Right.
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,1902.854,1903.937,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1988.87-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1903.937,1904.304,Right.
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,1910.008,1912.627,When you say... you mean in our challenge--
1988.87-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1912.627,1913.243,Yes.
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,1913.243,1945.014,"--In our subsequent challenge, yes, we believe we should be able to attack the city's conduct, even though it's taken pursuant to a consent decree or, in the case of a litigated decree, if... if we have been denied promotions pursuant to a... to a court order, which is beyond the remedial authority of that court... and of course there are some differences between what is permissible in the realm of voluntary action and remedial action under 706(g)."
1988.87-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1955.989,1956.389,I understand.
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,1981.288,1989.543,"We believe... when the first of challenge promotions was made in this case, we sought preliminary relief."
1988.87-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2076.851,2094.647,"Surely for that purpose, to go back to Justice Stevens' line of questioning, there would be a difference between a consent decree and simply a court determination, because there the city wouldn't be the architect of its own violation, if it was... if it was simply hit with a judgment that required it to do certain things."
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2094.647,2097.515,"--Yes, I... I see your point there, Justice."
1988.87-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2100.384,2103.585,"Well, of course, you assume the party settling a case is an architect of the settlement."
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2105.768,2118.678,"--Well, the city, in the words of the mayor in his deposition, made the best business deal it had ever made when it settled this case for $265,000."
1988.87-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2118.678,2120.362,Are you claiming it was a collusive settlement?
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2120.362,2120.778,"No, sir."
1988.87-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2126.582,2131.236,"Well, there are a lot of people who have been eager to settle lawsuits once they get the evidence before the judge."
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2131.236,2131.636,"Yes, sir."
1988.87-1614,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2132.12,2136.39,"When they know... when they think they're going to lose, especially."
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2136.39,2138.09,"--Yes, we've all settled cases."
1988.87-1614,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2138.09,2146.594,"Mr. Fitzpatrick, this... this litigation involved promotion practices of the city, I take it."
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2147.279,2148.079,The original--
1988.87-1614,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2148.079,2149.479,"--Yes, the original action involved hiring."
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2149.479,2150.648,"--Let, let... yes."
1988.87-1614,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2150.648,2156.735,"Now, who has to be joined in your view in a hiring suit?"
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2156.735,2157.768,In a hiring case.
1988.87-1614,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2180.667,2184.802,"So who has to be joined, in your view, in a hiring action?"
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2184.802,2194.427,"--Who has to be joined... I would think it would be appropriate to join a defendant class of applicants, of current applicants perhaps, to the city."
1988.87-1614,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2208.234,2210.269,Just people on the eligibility list.
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2210.269,2224.279,"--I would think that they would be adequate representatives for the interests of those who might apply to the city of Birmingham, and therefore might be subject to the relief which--"
1988.87-1614,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2224.279,2226.196,In a class action?
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2226.196,2227.898,--Through a defendant class.
1988.87-1614,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2259.619,2270.241,"Well, during the period '74-'77, were there any employment suits brought against the city other than this one that involved this department?"
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2270.241,2300.094,"Not to my knowledge, Justice Kennedy, although... let me, if I may, I think it was within the parameter of Justice O'Connor's question, briefly state that the suits which were brought in '74 and '75 were very broad pattern and practice suits, not only against the city of Birmingham, but against the Jefferson County personnel board and some 20 or 25 other municipalities in the Jefferson County area."
1988.87-1614,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2329.113,2334.35,How many... how many of the Plaintiffs in this case were represented by counsel during those years?
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2334.35,2335.869,During the hearings?
1988.87-1614,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2338.635,2339.187,I Know.
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2341.237,2342.023,"No, sir."
1988.87-1614,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2351.629,2358.966,"Well, who was... it was said that some of the Respondents were consulting with the city people?"
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2358.966,2359.399,No.
1988.87-1614,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2372.875,2377.862,"Well, was there any evidence that any of these individuals, the Respondents, were aware?"
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2377.862,2378.262,"--No, sir."
1988.87-1614,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2381.098,2384.183,Were these Respondents members of that association?
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2384.183,2388.218,--The Respondents are all members of the association.
1988.87-1614,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2397.991,2402.728,"Well, did the association notify its members or anything, call their attention to this--"
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2402.728,2411.6,"--I don't believe that... that is not record evidence, but I don't believe the association went out and notified all its members that the litigation was pending and--"
1988.87-1614,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2411.6,2418.773,--Well I... I understood from your colleagues on the other side that these Respondents were aware of the litigation--
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2418.773,2419.189,"--No, sir."
1988.87-1614,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2469.706,2474.158,--When... when would it have become clear that the fire department was implicated in the suit?
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2474.158,2477.812,That fire department promotions were implicated in this suit?
1988.87-1614,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2477.812,2478.212,Yes.
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2478.212,2490.452,It only... the only... the first time that any fire department promotions were specifically mentioned was in the consent decree itself.
1988.87-1614,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2507.581,2510.031,Was any of this in the newspapers?
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2510.031,2514.151,--Apparently there were some newspaper stories about the filing of this litigation.
1988.87-1614,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2514.668,2517.77,"You mean this is apparent, you don't think so."
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2517.77,2523.441,"The... the Petitioners have cited newspaper articles in their brief, but--"
1988.87-1614,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2523.441,2528.494,"xxx involved the whole area all around Birmingham, right?"
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2528.494,2529.044,"--Yes, sir."
1988.87-1614,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2530.31,2531.529,And yet the newspapers didn't mention it?
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2531.529,2533.379,"No, I didn't say that, Justice Marshall."
1988.87-1614,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2533.379,2534.064,But that was my question.
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2534.064,2543.254,"It's my understanding that the Petitioners have cited newspaper articles in their briefs, and I will take their word for it that their briefs are accurate, although I have not gone back and read those old articles."
1988.87-1614,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2543.254,2544.704,And that your people can read.
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2544.704,2546.956,"Yes, my firefighters, I believe, can read."
1988.87-1614,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2546.956,2548.272,But they don't know anything about it?
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2548.272,2553.776,"Well, we do not believe that a story in the newspaper is an appropriate vehicle upon which to--"
1988.87-1614,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2553.776,2554.645,I didn't say that.
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2557.245,2566.702,--They said that they did not know about the particular fact that they were looking for promotional goals in the Birmingham fire and rescue service.
1988.87-1614,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2566.702,2573.356,"But they did know that there was a case pending, which affected the department they were working in."
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2573.356,2578.26,There was a case pending which challenged employment practices in the Jefferson County area.
1988.87-1614,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2578.26,2579.36,Where they work.
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2579.36,2580.777,Where they work.
1988.87-1614,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2658.062,2666.818,"Mr. Fitzpatrick, coming back to your earlier answer, that your clients did not know of the fact that promotions were at issue in this Litigation."
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2671.687,2675.222,--That... that is my personal assurance today.
1988.87-1614,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2679.926,2686.38,"But isn't it your legal position, Mr. Fitzpatrick, but even if they knew it wouldn't make any difference, because they didn't have any duty to act unless they were served with process?"
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2686.38,2687.399,--Correct.
1988.87-1614,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2725.572,2729.308,"Well, that's not all you insist upon, not just notice, not just notice that there's this lawsuit pending."
1988.87-1614,2,39253,raymond_p_fitzpatrick_jr,,2735.545,2736.595,"Absolutely, Justice."
1988.87-1614,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2763.68,2764.832,"--Thank you, Mr. Fitzpatrick."
1988.87-1614,3,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2776.889,2779.757,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1614,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2791.149,2795.017,"May I interrupt right out the outset, Mr. Merrill, because I'd be interested in your views."
1988.87-1614,3,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2804.373,2817.716,"Justice Stevens, I think that the way in which the issue should properly arise in the lawsuits that Respondents have filed would be framed in terms of the McDonnell Douglas and Burdine standard that this Court has laid out."
1988.87-1614,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2824.37,2824.953,Correct.
1988.87-1614,3,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2824.953,2833.726,"And at that point, the answer to that defense would be that the decree is either unlawful or else that the city is acting outside the terms of the decree and that the decree is no defense--"
1988.87-1614,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2833.726,2838.111,But that's quite a different issue than whether the outsiders are bound by the decree.
1988.87-1614,3,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2841.665,2847.402,"--No, they're not bound to do anything under the decree, but they are bound in a collateral... the Petitioners claim is that of collateral estoppel."
1988.87-1614,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2847.402,2853.972,"They're not bound, they're just... there's a defense to their lawsuit out there, which is in the fact that the city has relied on a decree."
1988.87-1614,3,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2864.078,2866.113,"I would agree with that, Justice Stevens."
1988.87-1614,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2866.113,2873.803,"So we're really not... and the question really isn't whether they're bound, the question is whether or not they can challenge the decree in order to anticipate, to defeat this defense."
1988.87-1614,3,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2873.803,2883.575,"It's an issue of res judicata or collateral estoppel, if you will, as to whether or not the validity of the decree is something as to which the Respondents are collaterally estopped from attacking."
1988.87-1614,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2898.584,2903.572,"Mr. Merrill, the federal government supported the entry of the consent decree in this case."
1988.87-1614,3,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2904.072,2904.605,That's correct.
1988.87-1614,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2909.976,2918.082,"So, indeed, it might constitute a valid defense if suit were permitted by the Respondents."
1988.87-1614,3,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2918.082,2919.965,I don't follow your question.
1988.87-1614,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2919.965,2923.117,"Well, it relates to what Justice Stevens was just asking."
1988.87-1614,3,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2937.809,2947.165,"The government is obligated by the terms of the decree to defend the decree... excuse me, defend the decree, and we would not take the position that the decree itself is invalid."
1988.87-1614,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2950.969,2956.171,Who do you think has to be named in a hiring suit?
1988.87-1614,3,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2956.171,2960.325,"Well, that raises an important point that I did want to address, Justice O'Connor."
1988.87-1614,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3056.202,3057.569,So what should the rule be?
1988.87-1614,3,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3061.106,3067.694,"Well, I think Rule 19 comes to bear by... comes into play by its terms."
1988.87-1614,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3158.437,3160.92,"Mr. Merrill, I thought we'd agreed these parties aren't bound."
1988.87-1614,3,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3165.258,3168.643,"--Well, I'm using that as a shorthand for whether or not collateral estoppel applies--"
1988.87-1614,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3168.643,3174.447,"But it's quite... it's quite a different... I mean, it's a shorthand, but you're mixing up two very fundamentally different concepts."
1988.87-1614,3,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3183.052,3184.921,"--Well, if the issue... technically you're right."
1988.87-1614,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3187.873,3190.723,"See, and that's part of the confusion with the court of appeals' opinion."
1988.87-1614,3,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3197.96,3203.031,--The issue is whether or not the decree is a defense as to which these Respondents have nothing to say in response.
1988.87-1614,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3203.031,3204.697,"Do you think it's that big a difference, Mr. Merrill?"
1988.87-1614,3,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3232.8,3236.835,"I think the issue here is collateral estoppel, and I think the issue is an important one, Justice Scalia."
1988.87-1614,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3354.879,3355.379,"Thank you, Mr. Merrill."
1988.87-1614,4,39632,robert_d_joffe,,3361.649,3369.672,The notion that this notice was inadequate comes pretty poorly from the mouth of the United States government which drafted the notice.
1988.87-1614,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3401.226,3402.043,"Yes, but let me ask you a question."
1988.87-1614,4,39632,robert_d_joffe,,3411.166,3411.749,--Absolutely.
1988.87-1614,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3419.272,3425.675,"So it really isn't a question of standing at all or a question of being bound, it's a question of whether it's a good defense, a particular decree."
1988.87-1614,4,39632,robert_d_joffe,,3425.675,3427.96,It's a... that is a question to the damage action.
1988.87-1614,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3454.595,3456.397,Maybe it's not just a matter of relitigation.

1988.87-1614,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3471.989,3478.476,"Well, maybe the fact that there was a hearing and notice is a defense to their claim rather than one that stops them at the threshold."
1988.87-1614,4,39632,robert_d_joffe,,3478.476,3484.13,--It's both a defense to their damage claim and it's a reason why they shouldn't be able to relitigate this issue.
1988.87-1614,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3562.978,3564.144,"Thank you, Mr. Joffe."
