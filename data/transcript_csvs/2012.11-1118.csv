2012.11-1118,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.404,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case Number 11-1118, Gunn v. Minton."
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,7.237,9.856,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1118,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,47.231,58.77,"The question is whether the experimental use, whether that was a viable theory."
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,63.99,67.775,"--Well, Your Honor, defining substantiality is a difficult point."
2012.11-1118,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,131.051,135.955,You mean substantial beyond the -- this particular case?
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,135.955,138.405,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1118,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,317.872,319.538,"Well, why isn't that significant?"
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,339.118,340.135,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,608.141,627.888,"Ms. Webre, is there any binding effect of a Federal determination here on State law, and is there any binding effect of any State determination here on Federal law?"
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,627.888,629.071,"No, Your Honor."
2012.11-1118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.071,647.968,"If it was left to the State, would what the States say about patent law be binding in any Federal cases, and, vice versa, if it went to the Federal jurisdiction, would anything that the Federal court says about -- about State tort law be binding on State courts?"
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,647.968,650.587,In neither direction would any decision be binding.
2012.11-1118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.03,686.324,"That -- that being so, your -- your last argument about the Federal government messing up -- you know, State tort law in an area that -- that is currently very much in the fore in the -- in the decisions of the Texas Supreme Court, that doesn't really carry a lot of weight, except in this single case."
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,691.895,700.834,"You are right that it will not substantially adversely impact Texas State law, but that's an illustration of a substantial State interest."
2012.11-1118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,740.059,741.594,--What about the Federal issue?
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,743.111,753.885,"There are no Federal issues that need resolving here, because it's solely a question of the application of these specific facts in this affidavit to the doctrine."
2012.11-1118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,759.372,770.43,"Let me ask this question: Suppose you have two cases, hypothetical, case A, case B, both involve the experimental use doctrine in Federal patent law."
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,783.405,788.975,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, because the question isn't the significance to the particular claim."
2012.11-1118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,792.011,800.782,"Well, if -- if you say -- since you're going to say it -- I mean, if it's a “ substantial ” Federal issue, then it's substantial in hypothetical B but not in hypothetical A?"
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,800.782,803.501,"--Well, it's perhaps more necessary."
2012.11-1118,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,829.636,844.026,So does that mean that if the claim in the malpractice action is that the PTO acted unconstitutionally -- assume that set of facts -- how does that change your analysis?
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,844.026,859.655,"That would be a more substantial Federal question than the one presented here, but I submit that it would not be sufficient to warrant “ arising under ” jurisdiction here, because it is -- it involves only a hypothetical actual set of patent rights."
2012.11-1118,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,894.578,905.45,"So go back to -- you were going through a list of questions, and I posited, let's assume that the malpractice claim does involve a constitutional question."
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,905.45,905.767,--Yes.
2012.11-1118,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,906.219,907.186,Then what other factors--
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,907.186,916.074,"--Well, the -- the -- in the continuum constitutional issues would be more substantial, statutory issues would be a little less substantial."
2012.11-1118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,976.58,990.123,Why -- why do all -- why do all of these issues cut in your favor in all cases involving malpractice?
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,1009.935,1010.718,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1010.718,1020.225,So the burden would be on you to show that every one of these factors in all of those cases is always going to cut in your favor.
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,1030.748,1040.306,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I urge that because I think that's the only appropriate application of the Grable test to legal malpractice cases."
2012.11-1118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1041.539,1043.258,"Well, I like -- I like bright-line rules."
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,1074.377,1075.243,--I think there are two reasons.
2012.11-1118,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1092.455,1096.558,--How about fraud on -- a claim of fraud on -- that the malpractice was fraud on the PTO?
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,1109.533,1110.966,"--No, Your Honor, it would not."
2012.11-1118,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1209.982,1213.101,I find that somewhat hard to follow.
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,1238.168,1240.418,--The PTO may not ignore it.
2012.11-1118,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1241.12,1245.989,"Or the district court does, if it gets to review that in a later action."
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,1245.989,1246.705,"--Well, but--"
2012.11-1118,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1246.705,1251.059,I'm only raising this question to address Justice Scalia's point.
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,1265.068,1267.687,"--No, Your Honor, you do not have to go to my absolute rule."
2012.11-1118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1285.982,1309.764,"I guess you might argue that even if it fails the Grable test in a couple of isolated cases, we should still adopt that rule, because the benefits of having a clear rule that doesn't have to be litigated in every -- every case outweigh the fact that one or two might -- might not come out that way if we applied Grable."
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,1309.764,1310.447,Well--
2012.11-1118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.447,1311.797,"Because we're making it up anyway, right?"
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,1311.797,1324.791,"--Well, Your Honor, I -- I would take it a step further than that, because I think that any actual impact of -- of what you're positing, Justice Sotomayor, is so ephemeral."
2012.11-1118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1361.964,1372.855,"Let -- let me ask you this: The Brighton Miller treatise is rather complimentary of Grable, and said it brought considerable certainty to the area."
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,1394.537,1398.072,"Well, it -- it does a couple of things."
2012.11-1118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1408.445,1412.499,--What I mean is the argument over “ arising under ” over jurisdiction.
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,1412.499,1430.876,"--There are, on this issue of the legal malpractice cases, in the wake of the Federal Circuit's opinions, the Air Measurement case and Immunocept case in 2007, scores and scores and scores of courts, State and Federal courts, have been grappling with this precise jurisdictional issue."
2012.11-1118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1469.818,1471.37,So my question was even broader.
2012.11-1118,0,33439,jane_webre,,1480.942,1484.678,--I think that is a -- that is a -- that's a substantial issue.
2012.11-1118,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1530.454,1531.854,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1543.145,1544.212,"It is, Your Honor."
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1581.987,1594.612,What about other areas of exclusive Federal jurisdiction where the claim if you are stating it initially would have to go into Federal court and not State court?
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1609.454,1611.439,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1611.439,1614.025,"Then what's the difference between, say, antitrust and patent?"
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1614.025,1615.727,"There are many differences, Your Honor."
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1625.166,1625.883,Then immigration law.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1625.883,1626.583,--Yes.
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1626.583,1628.285,Don't get in the weeds.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1629.451,1629.951,Yes.
2012.11-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.781,1649.631,Excuse me.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1669.195,1670.845,--That--
2012.11-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1670.845,1672.08,Is that the rule?
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1672.08,1673.53,--I believe in part.
2012.11-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.53,1690.208,"Any Federal statute that can be sued upon both in Federal courts and in State courts, but as to which Federal courts are the dispositive adjudicators, you say that that does not come within this “ arising under ” rule?"
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1690.208,1697.862,Does not come within this Court's doctrinal holdings in Grable and Empire because we have a Federal balancing and State balancing issue.
2012.11-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1701.083,1719.46,"You have a case for that, that says if a suit could be brought in State court even though it involves a dispositive Federal question as to which this Court would be the -- you know, the last interpreter, it cannot possibly come within “ arising under ” jurisdiction?"
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1720.294,1721.377,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2012.11-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1723.079,1748.028,"Do you have a case which says that when a Federal question is presented in a case over which Federal courts have jurisdiction but also State courts have jurisdiction, although, needless to say, the Federal courts would be dispositive on the issue, such a case cannot come within the “ arising under ” jurisdiction?"
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1748.028,1751.266,"No, I don't think anything that expressly."
2012.11-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1752.382,1755.401,I would find it extraordinary for that to be the rule.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1755.401,1757.336,"--Well, you can't isolate it."
2012.11-1118,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1762.204,1772.929,"But getting back, Justice Ginsburg simply made the point, I had thought, that you place a good deal of reliance on the fact that there is exclusive jurisdiction."
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1798.145,1812.47,"I think -- I think the factors that go into determining the -- one of the grounds that has been articulated by Grable and the balancing for Merrell Dow is the number of cases that would come into Federal court, and it is a doctrinal decision."
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1813.589,1818.374,So patent law cases of malpractice are smaller in number than copyright cases--
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1818.374,1820.66,Patent law cases--
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1820.66,1826.295,"Immigration and other exclusive jurisdictions, so that's okay to remove, but those others aren't?"
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1826.295,1827.064,Those--
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1827.064,1828.897,--Does that make a whole lot of sense?
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1828.897,1831.116,"--That is the articulation in Grable, Your Honor."
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1831.116,1848.993,"Well, how about a different one, the one that's being proposed by your adversary, which is define “ substantial ” as to how it affects Federal law, which I think was the bottom line -- or the development of Federal law, the bottom line of Grable."
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1878.211,1878.811,Sure.
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1889.102,1890.902,Why is -- who's going to follow it?
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1890.902,1893.054,--In many situations.
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1906.461,1911.632,Issue preclusion applies only to someone who was a party.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1911.632,1912.832,--Correct.
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1939.366,1940.432,But that certainly is not binding.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1953.609,1954.292,--It does.
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1954.292,1954.759,No.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,1954.759,1968.201,"Under this Court's decision Marrese v the Academy of Orthopedic Assertions -- Surgeons, a State court's decision is entitled to issue preclusion even in Federal forum."
2012.11-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1984.997,1992.151,"Is that -- my goodness, but you are going to have a purely hypothetical State decision here."
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2017.384,2018.701,Yes.
2012.11-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2019.868,2021.003,Do you have any cases like that?
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2027.407,2029.692,"--Well, it is a matter of issue preclusion."
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2087.128,2088.564,Besides the parties--
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2088.564,2089.114,--Yes.
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2089.114,2095.568,--how else does it affect the development of patent law?
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2095.568,2096.301,The--
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2096.301,2097.253,Who else is going to follow--
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2097.253,2097.903,--They're--
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2097.903,2100.205,--this malpractice determination?
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2100.205,2108.811,--It's going to have a really profound effect on patent law practitioners who are uniquely situated and work in parcel -- and interlocking with the Patent Office.
2012.11-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2118.084,2123.737,They knew -- they knew these were controverted issues.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2137.978,2141.532,The patent--
2012.11-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2141.532,2142.515,--the patent attorneys.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2143.449,2160.411,"--No, the Patent Office will have to take that as guidance, because their new taskmaster will not be following Federal patent law because in this case, the Court injected a brand-new requirement that was never held by a patent lawyer, that you had to have an expert witness testify to establish your experimental use testing exception."
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2178.538,2195.75,"What would happen -- what would happen if that came up in an ordinary litigation in Federal court, and the Federal circuit ultimately decided the question, the State court was entirely wrong about this; you don't need a witness."
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2207.657,2208.441,"--No, that's exactly the problem."
2012.11-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.263,2217.847,--Excuse me.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2229.055,2230.173,"--No, not contrary."
2012.11-1118,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2242.565,2266.93,"Are you saying, Mr. Michel, that what the State courts are going to do is to say that, notwithstanding that the Federal circuit has ruled on a matter, and notwithstanding that the lawyer has complied with the rule as articulated by the Federal circuit, that nonetheless, they will be held to have committed malpractice because they didn't comply with the State's rule?"
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2269.798,2275.952,"I think the State judges are going to try to possibly apply Federal circuit holdings, and in this case, they did not."
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2290.045,2298.484,"So what you're arguing, they're going to make a mistake, and because we might not accept certiorari, that's binding on everybody else--"
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2298.484,2299.601,--It's--
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2299.601,2300.251,--in the State--
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2300.251,2300.853,--No.
2012.11-1118,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2311.292,2319.398,"What if a lawyer says to the -- you know, I complied with all the Federal law -- all the rules in the Federal circuit, I complied with."
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2319.398,2319.648,--Yes.
2012.11-1118,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2319.648,2328.353,"You are suggesting that the State court is going to say, Too bad, you committed malpractice anyway because you didn't comply with our hypothetical law about patents."
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2328.353,2329.853,They did that in this case.
2012.11-1118,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2331.955,2335.84,I guess it's not their hypothetical law.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2345.465,2347.365,"--Correct, correct."
2012.11-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2352.519,2370.18,"Why is that worse than the fact that if it goes to Federal court, all of the lawyers in the State in all malpractice cases are going to be supposedly bound by the Federal court's holding as to State issues of malpractice?"
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2386.14,2387.009,--I think we disagree.
2012.11-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2405.087,2411.074,"--And you are trying the malpractice lawsuit, the State practice malpractice lawsuit, in Federal court."
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2411.074,2411.69,--Correct.
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2468.244,2478.95,"Anytime -- anytime we allow patent questions -- as you already pointed out, a lot of patent questions come up in State courts litigations, contract litigations."
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2491.24,2492.442,"--No, that is not our position."
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2492.442,2501.898,So what is the dividing line between patent questions that belong in State court and patent questions that belong only in Federal court?
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2501.898,2509.369,"For example, not every malpractice case -- it will be the “ case within the case ” doctrine in a patent case that will go to Federal court."
2012.11-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2528.033,2542.042,"So you are talking about a patent case that has a patent issue, whether it's a contract case, a tort case, a malpractice case -- if it has a patent issue, you think it has to go to Federal court."
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2542.042,2542.442,We do not.
2012.11-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2542.442,2549.779,"Well, then I repeat Justice Ginsburg's question, how do you decide which of those do and which of those don't?"
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2549.779,2551.648,I think this is a case in point.
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2561.854,2570.376,Why does it stay within the line -- you have said not every patent question that comes up in a State court.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2591.189,2614.238,"Well, the -- the distinction is, for example, in a licensing case, in a patent case, where you -- those cases are brought in Federal -- I mean -- I'm sorry -- brought in State court -- our -- our request here is following Grable, that what will go to Federal court are legal malpractice cases arising from substantial issues of Federal patent law that have that case within the case analysis."
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2633.333,2637.17,What was the substantial Federal matter in Grable?
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2637.17,2642.408,"The issue of the IRS, whether personal service had to be given under an IRS--"
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2642.408,2646.86,"That was in the control, the actions of the Federal agency, of IRS."
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2646.86,2647.676,--Correct.
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2647.676,2650.245,And you have no consequence for that here.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2650.245,2654.631,We do have rules that will govern the law on experimental use exception.
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2654.631,2655.248,You have--
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2655.248,2657.25,And that would govern the application in Federal court.
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2665.787,2675.378,"--But the Federal court -- you said before that whatever the Federal Circuit says, the State doesn't have to follow it the next time there's a case in State court."
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2681.715,2683.598,It does.
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2699.993,2700.36,--I'm sorry.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2701.779,2702.612,I'm sorry?
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2702.612,2703.945,The patent's invalid.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2709.916,2710.468,Correct.
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2710.468,2712.168,He's not going to get his patent back from this action.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2712.168,2712.535,That's correct.
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2712.535,2714.42,"He's going to get money for losing it, maybe."
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2714.42,2715.503,Correct.
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2715.503,2717.621,So how does it affect the patent?
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2717.621,2720.173,There is a pending continuation patent.
2012.11-1118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2720.173,2722.192,"We're back to that issue, okay."
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2722.192,2724.958,"Yes, but that is a collateral estoppel issue."
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2795.455,2805.56,And your -- your distinction between other areas of Federal jurisdiction where the Federal law controls and patent is what?
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2809.595,2810.214,Yes.
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2810.214,2811.014,--copyright law.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2816.634,2827.74,I think there are -- there are distinctions in the area of patent law versus any other area of the law mainly because as we get to the State -- this goes to the analysis of the State/Federal balance.
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2887.814,2893.618,So your case turns on the Federal Circuit having exclusive appellate jurisdiction?
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2893.618,2899.872,That is one of the most defining factors on the State/Federal balance of judicial responsibility.
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2918.817,2932.076,"But if there's a large Federal interest, I mean, that's a -- you're saying that there is in the Federal state balance -- the Federal balance, it's on the Federal side."
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2941.282,2946.169,"--No, I think the Federal government -- I can't -- I can't speculate to -- for that, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2960.763,2965.064,There's a difference between you and your colleague on what “ substantial ” means.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2965.064,2965.48,Yes.
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2965.48,2989.179,"And she says it doesn't just mean necessary, essential in this particular litigation, but as in the Grable case and the Kansas City Title & Trust has larger ramifications for many other cases, not just this case and whether there's going to be issue preclusion as to this particular inventor."
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,2993.731,2998.885,I think there are -- there are a number of issues of -- of greater importance than just this case.
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3018.865,3025.186,Whether they -- those questions will come to the Federal circuit and they'll decide it and then they'll be settled.
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,3025.186,3033.374,"Well, we would hope they would be settled, but then we're going to have this whole other body of law out there in State courts that aren't bound by the Federal court to answer those questions."
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3038.243,3046.349,"How likely is that in practice, that once the Federal circuit weighs in, that the State judges will go their own way?"
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,3046.349,3048.984,I think it's a very real possibility.
2012.11-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3049.501,3065.311,"My experience is that Federal judges, including this Federal judge, are not interested in -- in getting into the weeds of patent law, and if -- if they could rely on a decision of the Federal circuit, they would do that just as fast as they can."
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,3065.311,3068.464,--You -- you would -- you would think so.
2012.11-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3104.555,3107.173,"Would that be the same thing for antitrust, be the same for copyright?"
2012.11-1118,1,43050,thomas_m_michel,,3107.173,3109.958,--But the articulation isn't the same.
2012.11-1118,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3146.698,3148.015,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3150.316,3154.434,"Ms. Webre, can I ask you about the question presented?"
2012.11-1118,2,33439,jane_webre,,3181.518,3182.651,"I disagree, Your Honor."
2012.11-1118,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3261.984,3268.673,"Could you answer the one point your adversary raised that gives me pause, a lot of pause."
2012.11-1118,2,33439,jane_webre,,3300.626,3305.93,"Your Honor, I think that that is such a speculative road to go down."
2012.11-1118,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3309.232,3313.786,They are going to present an expert all of the time when they don't need to.
2012.11-1118,2,33439,jane_webre,,3313.786,3320.856,--They are going to do some extra work and make an extra belt along with the suspenders that they are required to do.
2012.11-1118,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3331.163,3346.523,"But you can think of an example where -- not perhaps on the facts of this case, but where a State court's ruling could in fact establish a code of behavior that's not just belts and suspenders, that's something else."
2012.11-1118,2,33439,jane_webre,,3346.523,3353.344,"--Your Honor, I think that -- that spinning out a hypothetical on that would be truly speculative."
2012.11-1118,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3368.253,3370.622,What about just the flip side of this case?
2012.11-1118,2,33439,jane_webre,,3384.132,3390.786,"--If an expert is required under Federal jurisprudence, then an expert is required in a real patent case."
2012.11-1118,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3409.43,3411.865,"Well, right, the requirements of the Federal law."
2012.11-1118,2,33439,jane_webre,,3417.019,3428.161,"--Well, Your Honor, if there is a conflict, then what you're supposed to follow is the jurisprudence of the courts who -- before whom you are practicing."
2012.11-1118,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3456.577,3458.111,"Thank you, counsel."
