1964.95,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,29.295,"Number 95 Victor Linkletter versus Victor G. Walker, Warden."
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,31.85,35.742,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1964.95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,244.627,249.404,"If there are some, there are some refinements on those two broad categories?"
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,249.404,251.863,"Yes sir, there are some refinements, yes sir."
1964.95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,257.151,270.956,"In other words some of the -- is question whether or not on direct appeal or on the collateral attack and whether or not the actual search occurred before or after Mapp, the trial so on, but there have been refinements drawn by some of the courts."
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,270.956,273.141,Yes sir.
1964.95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,284.449,286.11,Without any real discussion on it?
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,286.11,291.053,"Yes sir that's right, procuring the (Inaudible)."
1964.95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,361.603,368.444,"Excuse me, it has nothing to do with -- it has nothing to do with a fair trial as such, does it?"
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,368.444,368.973,I think.
1964.95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,368.973,390.703,"As contrasted to the rule of Gideon against Wainwright for instance because there is no question that this evidence is relevant material I believe had it been, had it been obtained properly would have been fairly admissible without violating his right to a fair trial in any way, isn't that correct?"
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,390.703,395.932,Justice I've would hate to – no sir I don't think so let me --
1964.95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,395.932,400.329,Then tell me why please?
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,400.329,415.029,The seizures and searches in the Mapp case and in the Linkletter case were items which were fully -- the seizures were plenary.
1964.95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,429.656,431.033,What was the evidence?
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,431.033,432.627,The evidence in--
1964.95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,432.627,433.98,That was introduced in this case.
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,433.98,434.153,Oh!
1964.95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,446.223,447.968,"Was it stolen property, was that it?"
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,447.968,448.811,Some was I think--
1964.95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,448.811,450.434,Because I don't have in it mind.
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,450.434,452.996,"It was contended to be stolen, the petitioner has never admitted it --"
1964.95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,452.996,460.353,"No I am not asking to admit anything, but that was -- the stuff that was admitted was allegedly stolen property?"
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,460.353,471.267,"Some of it was, some of it was his personal papers, some notes, key rings, shoes, (Inaudible) torch, various, various items."
1964.95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,523.736,527.647,Well of course this court doesn't sit here to determine guilt or innocence?
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,527.647,547.241,But the fact of guilt or innocence I think should not enter into the decision of retrospective versus prospective application.
1964.95,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,674.981,677.412,"In fact, mainly during the last [Inaudible]"
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,677.412,678.396,Sir.
1964.95,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,678.396,684.565,"In fact, when reading the last setup on footnote nine, [Inaudible]"
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,684.565,689.16,"Yes sir, in those cases, the same contention was urged and later proved unbounded."
1964.95,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,716.195,732.449,[Inaudible] as he has pointed out [Inaudible]
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,732.449,737.076,Yes sir.
1964.95,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,737.076,780.251,"Have you read another article, [Inaudible] retroactive, retrospective and prospective by saying [Inaudible]"
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,780.251,781.324,"Yes, and I think --"
1964.95,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,781.324,796.913,[Inaudible]
1964.95,0,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,796.913,798.437,I think it's a very sound approach.
1964.95,1,29010,justice_bernnan,,1004.143,1011.261,"If that was so, could he be retried, if you took that approach, could he be retried?"
1964.95,2,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1011.261,1013.02,If I am follow Your Honor --
1964.95,3,29010,justice_bernnan,,1013.02,1021.728,"I'm stating a Professor Meadow's notion that this is an unconstitutional detention after Mapp, and therefore, the Warden should let him go free."
1964.95,4,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1021.728,1021.92,If there is any way to get --
1964.95,5,29010,justice_bernnan,,1021.92,1032.266,"That was a constitutional detention initially, after Mapp it is now an unconstitutional detention and I am just asking you, could he be retried again?"
1964.95,6,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1032.266,1032.778,I may have to --
1964.95,7,29010,justice_bernnan,,1032.778,1039.423,"Suppose the state had all the evidence in the world, but he has been in there eight or nine years, statute of limitations have long since gone."
1964.95,8,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1042.157,1050.049,I have some doubt whether he could.
1964.95,9,29010,justice_bernnan,,1142.054,1156.682,"Yeah, but that argument I suppose under Wolf no absence of judicial integrity on part of the state courts relying on it, was there, in admitting the evidence?"
1964.95,10,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1167.073,1187.899,"Justice Brennan, as I recall this Court gave a warning several years after the Wolf decision in the Urban versus California that this decision was coming and then later in 1959, it gave another warning in Elkins case."
1964.95,11,29010,justice_bernnan,,1194.058,1195.828,"Well, no I'm just going to the argument."
1964.95,12,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1226.561,1227.354,The state --
1964.95,13,29010,justice_bernnan,,1227.354,1233.525,Where they in any way partners in any unconstitutional act in using that evidence actually?
1964.95,14,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1233.525,1237.477,That the use of evidence was with knowledge that it was unconstitutional and this removes some dignity in the state's position.
1964.95,15,29010,justice_bernnan,,1237.477,1249.324,"I know, but this Court had said in Wolf that was perfectly permissible and that conviction based upon the use of that evidence was not unconstitutional."
1964.95,16,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1249.324,1266.428,Well I submit that a fair reading of the Wolf and decisions following Wolf gave the states ample time to move and this was the red flag that was waved several times and Louisiana never moved.
1964.95,17,29010,justice_bernnan,,1266.428,1269.198,"What year what that about, 1950?"
1964.95,18,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1269.198,1269.947,1959.
1964.95,19,29010,justice_bernnan,,1269.947,1272.048,"1959, well what about in 1949?"
1964.95,20,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1272.048,1273.864,"No Irvine was in 1954, I'm sorry."
1964.95,21,29010,justice_bernnan,,1273.864,1277.963,"And what about between 1949 and 1954, that's five years?"
1964.95,22,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1281.264,1283.229,Right sir.
1964.95,22,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1283.229,1285.854,Because I just -- in Irvine I really can't understand.
1964.95,22,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1301.233,1301.908,Perhaps it is.
1964.95,22,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1301.908,1302.961,Yes it would.
1964.95,22,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1324.408,1327.035,Yes sir that observation has been made.
1964.95,23,29010,justice_bernnan,,1360.146,1362.969,"You mean, after the Mapp seizures, but before the Mapp decision?"
1964.95,24,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1362.969,1364.578,Yes sir.
1964.95,25,29010,justice_bernnan,,1364.578,1366.702,Intervening the Mapp seizure and the Mapp decision?
1964.95,26,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1366.702,1383.609,Yes sir and then in his case the accident time was the deciding factor and that he would be entitled to habeas corpus relief under a prospective holding since I think the prospective holding you like to cut off all relevant things.
1964.95,27,29010,justice_bernnan,,1383.609,1394.522,"I see, is this an argument that if in Mapp as we did, we held that Mapp's conviction had to be reversed by reason of a seizure which preceded this seizure."
1964.95,28,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1406.282,1414.117,Yes sir because and my client's interest depends upon the workload of the State Court to knock it.
1964.95,29,29010,justice_bernnan,,1414.117,1416.014,Your case might have been here first?
1964.95,30,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1416.014,1416.903,"Yes sir, no sir."
1964.95,31,29010,justice_bernnan,,1425.134,1427.16,[Inaudible]
1964.95,32,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1427.16,1429.077,Yes sir and decide it.
1964.95,32,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1429.077,1436.8,In that case the filed petition here -- the petition filed in the -- after the Louisiana direct --
1964.95,32,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1436.8,1440.144,"Yes sir immediately after the Mapp decision, no sir."
1964.95,32,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1440.144,1441.388,This is a [Inaudible]
1964.95,32,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1441.388,1442.302,"Yes sir, there was no --"
1964.95,32,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1442.302,1446.149,Not many petitions or certiorari filed in this case [Inaudible]
1964.95,32,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1446.149,1449.059,No sir.
1964.95,32,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1449.059,1455.507,Was there any objection made at the trial on the Fourth Amendment?
1964.95,32,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1455.507,1462.922,"Justice Clark, the Fifth Circuit opinion says that there was -- that there were objections made at that trial."
1964.95,32,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1477.794,1479.514,Was there any motion?
1964.95,32,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,1479.514,1480.018,No sir.
1964.95,32,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1480.018,1487.814,Right.
1964.95,32,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1487.814,1493.273,Mr. Airheart.
1964.95,33,42350,teddy_w_airhart_jr,,1493.273,1498.711,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.95,34,29010,justice_bernnan,,1816.453,1829.807,"Are these state rights, the Mapp search was May 23, 1957 and the illegal search in this case August 24, 1958, what a year-and-an-half later."
1964.95,35,42350,teddy_w_airhart_jr,,1833.316,1841.34,"Yes sir, those are correct."
1964.95,35,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2030.563,2037.198,"Very well, Mr. Airhart."
1964.95,36,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2039.18,2042.246,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1964.95,37,29010,justice_bernnan,,2056.373,2062.303,"I hope before you finish, I know from your brief what your position is."
1964.95,38,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2072.542,2080.193,The date of the map search seems to me Mr. Justice Brennan is perhaps the least significant date in the entire transaction.
1964.95,39,29010,justice_bernnan,,2102.059,2105.296,"And that was equally true in August 20, 19 --"
1964.95,40,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2105.296,2105.857,Precisely.
1964.95,41,29010,justice_bernnan,,2105.857,2107.66,"That's your argument, but don't take any more time."
1964.95,42,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2107.66,2109.284,Precisely.
1964.95,43,29010,justice_bernnan,,2407.403,2416.781,"Suppose the, suppose the search was of dimension of local, what would New York do with that?"
1964.95,44,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2416.781,2425.738,I assume that the Rowkin (ph) case stands for a good law in New York State Courts as well although I can't cite a case for that proposition.
1964.95,44,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2463.065,2465.704,"What do you with the Fifth, that's on the law?"
1964.95,44,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2465.704,2466.565,I beg your pardon sir?
1964.95,44,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2466.565,2472.136,What do you do with the Fifth Amendment self incrimination [Inaudible]
1964.95,44,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2472.136,2479.583,"I, yes, well, New York has in its own constitution the equivalent of the Fifth Amendment."
1964.95,44,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2513.77,2525.206,What I meant was my brother Black [Inaudible] placed reliance on Fifth?
1964.95,44,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2525.206,2539.639,"I can conceive under the Mapp case itself, Mr Justice Clark, I can easily conceive of many, many situations I think several of which have arisen already since Mapp in which there is an inter-relationship between the Fifth and the Fourth."
1964.95,45,29010,justice_bernnan,,2559.27,2570.001,Are you making this distinction now between so called evidence and so called contraband or are you making a further distinction between testimonial evidence and tangible?
1964.95,46,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2570.001,2575.836,I am making the distinction between testimonial evidence and tangible evidence Justice Brennan.
1964.95,47,29010,justice_bernnan,,2582.17,2582.347,Yeah.
1964.95,47,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2582.347,2590.956,"What about – but are calling it the difference between testimonial and tangible, how about letters?"
1964.95,48,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2590.956,2595.644,"To me a letter is a tangible object, Justice White I --"
1964.95,49,29010,justice_bernnan,,2595.644,2598.487,There is a void against you on that.
1964.95,50,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2601.386,2630.315,"I realize the difficulties to avoid Mr. Justice Brennan, but I think for these purposes and now we have to refer to the object of retroactivity, that's the limited question before us and it seems to me that in that context there might be very realistic distinction growing between those object which are obtained in a manner which might affect their reliability as a truth seeking piece of evidence relating to the question of guilt."
1964.95,50,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2691.252,2711.549,"You talk about the right of privacy so that's all the Fourth Amendment prohibit, that's in my judgment, a great mistake made in [Inaudible] to the Fourth Amendment right, not merely the right to privacy, the other thing decides the right to privacy that are violated on unreasonable search and seizure?"
1964.95,50,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2711.549,2719.508,Do you suggest Justice Black that one of those is the right to a fair trial?
1964.95,50,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2719.508,2740.306,"I was suggesting that when you just merely say invasion to right to privacy, that's the word that many judges have used and many commentators have used, that undoubtedly is one of the things prompted with passage of the Fourth Amendment and the adaptation of the rule in the old English cases, but that's not all the right to privacy."
1964.95,50,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2740.306,2743.458,"I used it only as a shorthand device, Justice Black."
1964.95,51,29010,justice_bernnan,,3661.437,3663.974,That's time served or sentence.
1964.95,52,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3663.974,3665.676,No that's sentence.
1964.95,52,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3682.594,3687.966,Mr. Screws.
1964.95,53,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,3687.966,3690.08,Just a few comments Your Honor.
1964.95,53,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3805.382,3806.014,Mr. Screws.
1964.95,53,48719,euel_a_screws_jr,,3816.443,3817.447,Yes.
1964.95,53,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3817.447,3827.986,Well I want to take this opportunity to thank you on behalf of this Court for bringing his case here and representing him as faithfully as you have.
