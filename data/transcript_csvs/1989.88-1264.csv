1989.88-1264,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.537,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88-1264, James Saffle versus Robin Leroy Parks."
1989.88-1264,0,40080,robert_a_nance,,11.988,15.321,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,92.692,103.571,"Mr. Nance, the case originated... the case that we're hearing... as a habeas review petition--"
1989.88-1264,0,40080,robert_a_nance,,103.571,104.021,It did--
1989.88-1264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,104.021,105.07,--collateral review?
1989.88-1264,0,40080,robert_a_nance,,105.07,105.961,"--I did, Your Honor."
1989.88-1264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,105.961,117.719,"Do you think, then, that we have to determine whether the rule sought would be applied retroactively, as suggested in Teague?"
1989.88-1264,0,40080,robert_a_nance,,117.719,123.894,"Your Honor, I've thought some about that, and, of course, we did not consider that in the court below."
1989.88-1264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,134.092,134.169,Yes.
1989.88-1264,0,40080,robert_a_nance,,147.149,162.65,"--Your Honor, if you feel that you need to look at it, I think Teague would compel the conclusion that the rule advanced by the court of appeals is a new rule because that rule was not dictated by precedent in force at the time Mr. Parks' conviction became final."
1989.88-1264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.65,163.642,And why do you say that?
1989.88-1264,0,40080,robert_a_nance,,167.996,186.629,"Your Honor, I'm unaware of any authority from this court that existed when his... Mr. Parks' conviction became final which would have prohibited, or which would have required, a sympathy plea that would have barred the state... put on the state essentially the duty of permitting a sympathy plea."
1989.88-1264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,186.629,202.159,"Well, I suppose the argument on the other side is that Locket and Eddings were already on the books and they require that you... that the jury be permitted to consider and give weight to evidence in mitigation."
1989.88-1264,0,40080,robert_a_nance,,206.773,213.258,I don't think the anti-sympathy instruction negates the consideration of mitigating evidence.
1989.88-1264,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,233.363,241.818,"California against Brown surely said that an instruction talking about mere sympathy was perfectly permissible, didn't it?"
1989.88-1264,0,40080,robert_a_nance,,241.818,259.92,"That's entirely correct, and if the Court were to reach a rule in this case that sympathy... a sympathy plea was required, as the court of appeals felt it was, I think that would be a new rule, because it wouldn't be dictated by any precedent that existed when Mr. Parks' conviction--"
1989.88-1264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,259.92,269.057,"Well, Mr. Nance, is it fair to say that the court of appeals said the sympathy instruction is required, or did they merely say that an anti-sympathy instruction is prohibited?"
1989.88-1264,0,40080,robert_a_nance,,269.057,273.781,"--I think the latter is the more precise formulation of what they said, Your Honor."
1989.88-1264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,273.781,286.831,"And if it was prohibited, the reason for prohibiting it is that they interpreted, whether rightly or wrongly, Locket as saying an instruction which interferes with the jury's consideration of all mitigating circumstances is invalid."
1989.88-1264,0,40080,robert_a_nance,,294.158,296.9,"Well, Mills more than Lockett."
1989.88-1264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,300.794,309.84,And it... Lockett invalidated an instruction which prohibited the consideration of all mitigating circumstances.
1989.88-1264,0,40080,robert_a_nance,,309.84,310.11,That's correct.
1989.88-1264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,310.11,318.137,"And that's what this court thought it was doing, was invalidating an instruction which interfered with the consideration of mitigating instruction."
1989.88-1264,0,40080,robert_a_nance,,325.162,328.023,If they're right--
1989.88-1264,1,43546,vivian_berger,,1179.353,1191.13,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1989.88-1264,2,40080,robert_a_nance,,2960.923,2965.728,"Your Honor, unless the Court has some further questions, I have no rebuttal."
1989.88-1264,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2965.728,2968.449,Thank you.
