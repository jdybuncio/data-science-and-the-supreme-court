2010.09-1454,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.372,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1454, Camreta v. Greene, and 09-1478, Alford v. Greene."
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,12.491,17.026,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,51.099,52.482,Not so fast.
2010.09-1454,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,54.801,58.67,"Of course, there are two issues here, and I hope we do get to the substance."
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,66.106,74.429,"--The record does not, Your Honor, because the mootness issue was raised relatively late in the proceedings, but I'm aware of what his current occupation is."
2010.09-1454,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,74.429,75.529,--Which is?
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,75.529,80.933,He is a child protective services worker with the Oregon Department of Human Services.
2010.09-1454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,80.933,109.185,"What I was about to ask is this: I can agree with you that -- that where there is a -- a determination on the merits, it should be reviewable, but could still disagree that it's reviewable where the requirements for Article III are not met; that is, where there is really no justiciable controversy between the parties."
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,118.058,126.112,"Your Honor, the interest of Mr. Camreta is the ongoing harm he has in his job."
2010.09-1454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,140.288,141.74,Why would he face liability?
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,181.882,187.852,"Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit opinion does apply to Mr. Camreta."
2010.09-1454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.949,207.532,But it takes--
2010.09-1454,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,207.532,207.966,General--
2010.09-1454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,207.966,217.538,"--It takes two to tango, and a case or controversy requires somebody on the other side who cares a fig about the outcome."
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,243.939,249.593,"Your Honor, I disagree that S.G. has no ongoing concrete stake in the outcome of this case."
2010.09-1454,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,277.778,288.818,"This is a Monell claim, and it's -- and the district court has held its ruling, I take it, in abeyance pending -- a ruling for reinstatement of that claim, pending our decision here?"
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,288.818,289.503,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,294.138,298.359,"Well, why isn't the answer, then, that that's the right case to take up?"
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,362.349,381.363,"Your Honor, the controversy remains the Fourth Amendment claim, which is the Respondent is seeking to pursue in the United States district court and that gives the Respondent here a direct financial stake in the viability of their Fourth Amendment argument, and--"
2010.09-1454,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,381.363,382.48,--I'm sorry.
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,442.234,454.644,"--Your Honor, in Arizonans v. Arizona, the Court recognized that the employee in that case had an interest in how she was able to conduct her job."
2010.09-1454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,472.789,474.122,She was the plaintiff.
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,480.609,481.545,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,481.545,500.09,"General Kroger, I don't think that the question here is really a standing question; it's really whether there is a controversy between this particular plaintiff and this particular defendant such that a judgment in this case would actually affect the legal relationship between the two, between the particular plaintiff and the particular defendant."
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,507.696,527.507,"Your Honor, the -- the -- Mr. Camreta remains a party below, and it's possible that the Court's rulings on the Fourth Amendment merits may impact the Fourteenth Amendment claims that are being made against Mr. Camreta that are alive and in controversy below."
2010.09-1454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.058,554.593,How does it affect the Fourteenth Amendment?
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,557.628,559.978,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.978,563.163,And what's the substance of that?
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,563.163,572.471,It is a claim of Mrs. Greene to interference with familial rights as a result of certain actions by Mr. Camreta and other defendants.
2010.09-1454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,572.471,578.792,But that didn't have to do with the school search -- the school seizure?
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,578.792,580.742,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,580.742,587.898,So -- and this case presents the question about was this unreasonable?
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,594.384,595.92,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,597.903,605.276,"Counsel, if we were to hold this case was moot, what would -- what do you think the appropriate disposition of the case would be?"
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,605.276,615.965,"--Your Honor, I believe if the Court determined that this case was moot, the -- the appropriate remedy would be pursuant to Munson where -- to vacate the Ninth Circuit decision."
2010.09-1454,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,615.965,621.536,"Well, you don't really want that, because the Ninth Circuit granted qualified immunity."
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,629.392,633.61,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,639.513,640.647,Vacate the opinion.
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,640.647,643.349,--vacate the opinion or decision on the Fourth Amendment claim.
2010.09-1454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,643.349,645.501,"That would make you happy, won't it?"
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,647.436,649.721,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,657.559,659.161,It doesn't just do that.
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,684.692,686.311,"You're correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,690.696,693.048,"There are different panels on the Ninth Circuit, aren't there?"
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,693.048,694.417,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,694.417,698.552,"And -- and they don't all hold the same thing, fortunately, do they?"
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,700.654,701.654,"They do they do not, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,701.654,704.873,"They're supposed to file circuit -- follow circuit precedent, aren't they?"
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,704.873,705.808,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,705.808,709.177,"But an opinion that is vacated is not circuit precedent, is it?"
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,709.177,710.26,"It is not, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,710.26,712.046,Mr. Camreta would be protected.
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,732.023,734.042,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,734.042,741.315,What happened in -- what -- what has Oregon done in response to this Ninth Circuit decision?
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,755.556,759.026,"Your Honor, that is not in the record, but I would happy -- be happy to respond."
2010.09-1454,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,789.962,790.762,On the merits--
2010.09-1454,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,790.762,791.798,Excuse me--
2010.09-1454,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,791.798,801.119,--do you think that the same approach you're following here would apply if the investigation focused on the student rather than a third party?
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,803.971,814.594,"Your Honor, I think in -- in those cases, because parental consent is a viable alternative where the allegation is a child is being abused by another child--"
2010.09-1454,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,814.594,815.946,"No, no, not another child."
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,825.302,839.11,"--Your Honor, I believe the -- the child abuse context is somewhat unique in that there are very few ways to investigate properly child abuse without speaking to the only witness that's typically available in the case, and that is the child."
2010.09-1454,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,839.11,843.863,So -- so you think it would be a different rule if we're talking about some other criminal activity?
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,854.987,864.693,"Your Honor, it would be the same reasonableness standard that would apply, but I think the courts might reach different conclusions about what would be reasonable in those circumstances."
2010.09-1454,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,864.693,866.712,"Well, on -- we're getting to the merits."
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,875.199,876.235,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,876.235,879.436,You agree that the child was -- was seized?
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,879.436,881.719,"Yes, Your Honor, we concede that the child was seized."
2010.09-1454,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,881.719,890.042,What -- what happens if the teacher tells -- the student is misbehaving on the playground: Go back in the classroom.
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,894.612,899.147,"No, Your Honor, I -- I disagree that that would be a seizure, because--"
2010.09-1454,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,899.147,900.932,What made this a seizure?
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,902.866,914.99,"--Your Honor, the reason we conceded the issue of seizure is we are here on -- on summary judgment, and we took the facts as alleged, which involved transporting the student inside the school."
2010.09-1454,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,914.99,924.029,"Well, but I'm -- I'm asking for your view of the proper category to apply in these cases, and if it is a seizure, then -- then it's just a question of reasonableness, and we'd look at all the circumstances."
2010.09-1454,0,31312,john_r_kroger,,924.029,925.047,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,928.083,928.999,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,945.378,947.678,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1454,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,975.497,977.747,What about -- did she -- did she -- let's go back one step.
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,988.071,991.09,"--Well, two responses, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1045.307,1046.759,"There was a dissent in that case, wasn't there?"
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1046.759,1048.143,--There was indeed a dissent in that case.
2010.09-1454,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1079.315,1092.055,"Ms. Kruger, how does this -- this situation, the qualified immunity situation, differ from a wide variety of other situations in which we might not be able to get to the underlying constitutional ruling?"
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1119.19,1151.327,"--The reason we think the qualified immunity situation is different, it presents a set of exceptional circumstances that weren't an exception to the usual prudential rule, is because the qualified immunity situation is one in which this Court has encouraged courts to undertake these kinds of constitutional rulings for the purpose of changing the legal landscape going forward, for the very purpose of establishing the law so that the -- that qualified immunity doesn't remain perpetually available to officials even though they are engaging in conduct--"
2010.09-1454,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1151.327,1152.41,"But, presumably, in every case--"
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1152.41,1152.977,--that has been found unconstitutional.
2010.09-1454,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1152.977,1153.893,--Excuse me.
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1168.367,1180.543,I think that in this situation what we have is not just a preview of how the court of appeals would decide the case subsequently in a case in which it was actually necessary to reach a certain judgment.
2010.09-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1214.598,1218.066,But that wouldn't be the case if the opinion were vacated--
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1218.066,1218.835,That's true.
2010.09-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1218.835,1220.335,--under Munsingwear?
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1220.335,1228.107,"That's true, Justice Scalia, and I think that if that's the disposition that this Court thinks is appropriate, we would be certainly be happier with that than a rule that says--"
2010.09-1454,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1228.107,1228.724,It would be--
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1228.724,1230.057,--an incorrect constitutional ruling.
2010.09-1454,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1230.057,1233.678,"--It would be a partial vacatur, right?"
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1238.38,1240.332,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-1454,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1285.628,1287.83,"Well, I'm not so sure he was correct."
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1311.861,1318.265,"I think that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think for that reason we would not object to that disposition in this case."
2010.09-1454,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1340.53,1347.518,It seems to me it would affect Camreta's behavior and that of other child protective officers.
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1366.765,1368.548,"I think that's absolutely right, Justice Kennedy."
2010.09-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1368.548,1369.065,Why?
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1372.336,1373.119,That's right.
2010.09-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.119,1378.322,Would this be clearly established law under any -- any conceivable interpretation of that?
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1378.322,1394.332,"I think it's -- it's true that if this Court were to vacate the Ninth Circuit's constitutional ruling, Mr. Camreta and others who are similarly situated wouldn't face the very significant concrete prospective effect of this decision, which is to strip them of qualified immunity in future cases."
2010.09-1454,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1399.485,1400.051,If we told them--
2010.09-1454,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1400.051,1401.118,You have very limited time.
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1406.739,1408.257,"--Certainly, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-1454,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1436.892,1441.094,"--Counsel, would -- I'm interrupting you only for a quick reason."
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1445.527,1447.161,"--That's correct, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-1454,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1447.963,1448.829,All right.
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1474.281,1482.701,"I think that the answer is that would go to the -- the question of the manner in which the -- the interview is conducted, as opposed to whether it's--"
2010.09-1454,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1482.701,1483.302,So how do we--
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1483.302,1484.52,--reasonable at its inception.
2010.09-1454,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1484.52,1502.848,"--How do we develop the law, or how do we help develop the law in this case if we answer your question but leave unanswered with no parameters, any idea -- because we have no set of facts; no one's going to review that question -- of what is reasonable in this context?"
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1502.848,1511.287,"Well, the question that the Ninth Circuit answered in this case was a question that concerns the justification for the interview at its inception."
2010.09-1454,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1522.743,1528.896,"That -- you see, that's the problem with taking up a case with no case in controversy, because what do we do?"
2010.09-1454,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1535.835,1538.437,"Well, I -- I would disagree with that proposition."
2010.09-1454,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1554.13,1555.649,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,1568.539,1570.189,Thank you.
2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1580.347,1581.581,Then why are you -- why are you here?
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,1584.683,1585.418,--Precisely.

2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,1590.32,1595.124,"Mr. Chief Justice, we are not here voluntarily."
2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1595.791,1596.557,"No, I know that."

2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1633.816,1640.803,So you have objection if we entered a Munsingwear order vacating the decision of the Ninth Circuit on the merits of the dispute?
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,1640.803,1664.787,"--Well, Your Honor, the -- we would submit that the Munsingwear test would not apply in this case because Munsingwear, which permitted vacating a decision when it became moot, talked about decisions which become moot through happenstance, and--"
2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1664.787,1665.537,"Well, again--"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,1665.537,1668.255,--the reason for that is because of preclusion.
2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1668.872,1669.372,--I'm sorry.
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,1679.361,1687.884,"That -- our client has no legally binding, legally cognizable interest in the case."
2010.09-1454,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1700.091,1714.601,"She's asserting the interests of other children who would be in the situation that she was once in, but no longer; but we have said the plaintiff herself must have a live controversy, and there was no class action here."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,1714.601,1716.803,"That -- that is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-1454,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1719.755,1746.489,"But you want to have the Fourth Amendment decision preserved and have it govern an enormous chunk of the country so that all the States in the Ninth Circuit have to comply with it, and anybody -- any individual officer who doesn't comply with it would do so on pain of personal liability, but you don't want that ground-breaking decision to be subject to review by this Court on the merits."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,1750.559,1788.768,"Your Honor, the -- the case -- if the case is truly as important to other employees of the States in -- within the confines of the Ninth Circuit, it will arise again, and this Court will have the opportunity to decide the issue again between parties who have a live stake in the issue; or it will arise in another circuit, and it will present a live controversy between parties who have a stake."
2010.09-1454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1788.768,1790.318,"So, you want us -- so Munsingwear."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,1800.659,1803.611,"No, Your Honor, we would not ask the holding below be erased."
2010.09-1454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.144,1806.813,"Well, then -- then the answer you just gave doesn't make any sense."

2010.09-1454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1831.928,1832.778,--who wants us to Munsingwear.
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,1832.778,1834.296,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, I misspoke."
2010.09-1454,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1848.39,1851.091,"Well, but Justice Alito's question was addressed to the Ninth Circuit."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,1862.08,1863.746,"--Well, Your Honor, I guess that's--"
2010.09-1454,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1863.746,1868.484,"And you -- and you want them to be bound, and yet you say there's -- that the case is moot."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,1869.65,1876.137,"--Well, Your Honor, that leads to the question of what exactly are they bound by?"
2010.09-1454,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1904.371,1907.739,Where are you reading in the holding of the court of appeals?
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,1922.083,1927.987,"--That was -- that was the ruling as it applied to S.G. herself, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-1454,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1939.593,1947.964,"Well, let's see where they -- I thought that, yes, the case is about a single plaintiff; it's not a class action."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,1951.383,1952.102,Okay.
2010.09-1454,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2004.635,2013.991,"What is there in the Ninth Circuit's opinion, which -- which generally requires a warrant, to suggest that the length of the interrogation was relevant to their decision?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2031.018,2039.208,"Well, Your Honor, the -- the length of the questioning has been historically important to this Court's jurisprudence."
2010.09-1454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2079.75,2080.452,I don't understand.
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2103.215,2104.733,--We would--
2010.09-1454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.733,2106.0,Because it was a short interview?
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2106.0,2116.125,"--The -- I didn't mean to -- that the length of the interview is the only factor, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2116.125,2117.358,Oh.
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2117.358,2131.884,One of the other factors is that the -- that the seizure is determined by the fact that the police and child welfare worker removed the child or removed any individual from the place where she is--
2010.09-1454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.884,2132.317,Right.
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2134.152,2135.252,"--and bring her to another place, and then--"
2010.09-1454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2135.252,2138.138,"But once they take her in a room, it depends on how long the interview is; is that right?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2138.138,2144.442,--That -- that goes to the question of whether or not there was a seizure.
2010.09-1454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2144.442,2145.81,Whatever.
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2145.81,2149.096,"In this case, it was stipulated that there was a seizure."
2010.09-1454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2149.096,2160.702,"We're talking about rules for the future; we're not talking about this case, and you're asking us to adopt a rule for the future that says if it's very brief, it's okay, but if it's longer it isn't okay."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2162.287,2174.127,That -- that if -- if it were very brief and the child was not removed from her classroom--
2010.09-1454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2174.127,2174.861,"No, no, no, no."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2181.9,2205.933,"--Our position would be that because the -- of the importance of consent here to a seizure, that the -- that there would need to be a court order to remove a child from her classroom and to take her to another room and then--"
2010.09-1454,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2205.933,2206.416,On the issue--
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2206.416,2208.135,--or parental consent.
2010.09-1454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2208.135,2211.669,"So you're changing your position: You need a court order, no matter how brief; is that it?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2211.669,2217.073,"I think that has been our position, and I'm sorry if I didn't make it clear."
2010.09-1454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.073,2217.556,"Oh, okay."
2010.09-1454,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2217.556,2222.792,"--Well, on the issue of consent, do you read the Ninth Circuit's opinion as having an age limit?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2232.083,2267.173,"Well, the way that we read the Court of Appeals decision and the rule that we would ask this Court to adopt, that is, seizure and for a custodial interrogation is presumptively unreasonable without parental consent or a court order leaves open the possibility that there are, in fact, some children who are of suitable age and discretion to knowingly make a decision whether or not to talk to an armed police officer and a caseworker without their parents having to make it for them."
2010.09-1454,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2267.739,2272.225,"Counsel, are you -- I just want to make sure I understand your position."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2315.754,2321.224,"--A seizure, yes, but that would have exigent circumstances, and that would get it out of the warrant requirement."
2010.09-1454,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2321.224,2330.83,"--Well, but what does that have to do or change the police bringing a child into a room and just asking the question?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2344.006,2344.806,Well--
2010.09-1454,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2344.806,2349.993,They don't know if there's exigent circumstances until they ask the question.
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2349.993,2352.945,--That -- that's correct.
2010.09-1454,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2352.945,2354.495,"You got a stipulation that there was a seizure, so--"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2354.495,2355.179,What?
2010.09-1454,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2357.431,2360.783,--There was never any argument that was not at issue in this case.
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2362.635,2363.268,That's -- that's correct.
2010.09-1454,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2363.268,2366.17,--the question is: Is it reasonable?
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2366.17,2367.087,Correct.
2010.09-1454,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2367.087,2377.81,"Have you, in the -- many of the questions have gone to leads, but this is initially a social worker's investigation."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2404.462,2417.185,"Well, it would depend on, I think, the larger picture, whether or not there was police entanglement, as this Court ruled in Ferguson v. The City of Charleston."
2010.09-1454,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2419.171,2432.029,"If the information elicited from the child is that she has been abused by her father, then there is a likelihood that there will be police interest in that."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2432.029,2456.346,"--Well, and this -- this Court recognized also that possibility in Ferguson v. The City of Charleston, that the -- the nurses at the hospital would call child protective services, but the -- the -- you have to look at it from the beginning, and in this case, the case began when -- on February 10th, when the police got involved."
2010.09-1454,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2486.782,2495.388,"But what is your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, suppose it was just Mr. Camreta or suppose it was the school nurse, would the answer be the same?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2495.388,2499.423,"No, it would not be the same if it was the school nurse or Mr. Camreta."
2010.09-1454,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2522.972,2524.157,So if it was just Mr. Camreta and he--
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2524.157,2525.457,--If Mr.--
2010.09-1454,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2525.457,2535.18,"--and he taped the conversation and then later turned it over to the -- to the police if he discovered evidence of child abuse, there would be no problem?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2536.631,2568.77,"--If Mr. Camreta came in from the outside, he would not fall within the T.L.O. rule, because in T.L.O. this Court said specifically that their ruling does not apply to individuals such as police officers who come from the outside in -- in order to deal with situations that are not related to the school, and nobody is saying that S.G. was abused while she was at the school."
2010.09-1454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2568.77,2570.253,Same circumstance.
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2576.674,2577.958,If -- if--
2010.09-1454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2577.958,2579.008,School nurse?
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2579.008,2579.925,--The school nurse?
2010.09-1454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2579.925,2580.827,Seizure?
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2580.827,2583.029,Probably not a seizure.
2010.09-1454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2583.029,2590.533,"And so, it's not a seizure if exactly the same thing happens but there is no outside person there, but it is a seizure if there's an outside person?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2590.533,2593.551,If the outside person comes into the school--
2010.09-1454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2593.551,2595.753,That's the rule as to whether there's a seizure?
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2595.753,2598.039,--That's one of the factors to look at.
2010.09-1454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2598.039,2599.755,"No, no, no, whether there's a seizure?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2599.755,2600.372,Yes.
2010.09-1454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2600.372,2600.991,Okay.
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2614.849,2623.92,"Your Honor, I believe that it -- it would be considered a seizure, although that's not our case."

2010.09-1454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2634.395,2642.734,"Well, that's what I need to know, because I don't know see if there is no seizure, how it could have been an unreasonable thing, if there isn't even a seizure."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2642.734,2652.424,--If -- if the caseworker comes to the school under circumstances where a child would feel free to leave or--

2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2873.401,2879.472,He was not trying to help you.
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2881.257,2881.99,I'm aware of that.
2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2918.513,2918.947,So you're--
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2918.947,2921.049,Those facts were not developed.
2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2921.049,2924.684,"--So that's your argument, again, that we shouldn't reach the merits?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2924.684,2925.453,That's correct.
2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2925.453,2937.777,"Now, do you agree that if we vacate the court of appeals' decision on the merits, that if Camreta had did exactly what he did in this case again, that he would not face personal liability?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2937.777,2944.014,If you -- if you vacate the decision on the merits--
2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2944.014,2944.614,Right.
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2956.722,2958.59,--That -- that would be correct.
2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2958.59,2963.828,"So if he did exactly the same thing, he would still be entitled to qualified immunity?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2963.828,2992.961,"He would still be entitled to qualified immunity, but if this Court were to vacate, this Court would be effectively be telling lower courts that they should not follow the Pearson sequence ever because if they -- if the lower court reaches a constitutional issue and then rules that the defendant has qualified immunity, which Pearson said that they could do, that this Court would then say no, don't--"
2010.09-1454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2992.961,2993.513,Not always.
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,2999.251,2999.784,--Well--
2010.09-1454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2999.784,3004.369,It will be something that could be replicated again in the future for some other reason.
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3018.093,3023.764,--Which is -- that's -- that's correct--
2010.09-1454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3023.764,3026.782,"But you moved away, I mean if -- you know, it's a different situation."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3026.782,3060.872,"--It -- it's a different situation, but if they're in the situations where individual defendants have qualified immunity, it has been the procedure in this Court not only since Pearson but really going all the way back to Siegert v. Gilley, 1991, where the Court recommended that the lower courts reach the constitutional issue -- in Siegert this Court said that they can."
2010.09-1454,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3065.908,3073.863,"Well, could you have cross-petitioned in an effort to get damages, so if you had wanted to preserve the issue, you surely could have done that, couldn't you?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3073.863,3080.017,"S.G. could have cross-petitioned, but she decided not to."
2010.09-1454,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3080.017,3081.535,But then we wouldn't have a case.
2010.09-1454,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3081.535,3090.825,"But there's nothing in the record that indicates that you're withdrawing your Monell action against the municipality, is there?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3090.825,3096.129,The Monell action against the municipality was dismissed on the facts.
2010.09-1454,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3096.129,3099.081,But isn't it -- isn't a motion to reinstate it still pending in the district court?
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3099.081,3104.818,"The motion to reinstate it was denied without prejudice to reinstate after this Court rules, and--"
2010.09-1454,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3104.818,3106.935,"All right, so it's still alive."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3107.485,3108.019,--It's still alive.
2010.09-1454,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3108.019,3111.554,--there's nothing in the record to indicate that you won't ask that it be reinstated.
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3111.554,3112.988,That's correct.
2010.09-1454,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3112.988,3115.34,"Is that against a different party, Ms. Kubitschek?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3115.34,3119.142,"That is against Deschutes County, Justice Kagan."
2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3119.142,3121.494,But who is -- who is on the other side of the county?
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3121.494,3123.677,I'm sorry; who's on the other side of the--
2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3123.677,3126.946,The claim pending below involves which two parties?
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3126.946,3130.85,"--Oh, it -- it involves S.G. and the county."
2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3130.85,3131.25,Oh.
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3131.7,3133.302,--claim that it's alive?
2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3142.574,3147.293,--Does the decision on the merits here have any relevance whatever to the action that's still pending?
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3147.293,3148.062,--No.
2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3148.062,3155.381,"So you agree that if -- if this is -- we vacate the decision on the merits, that's of no meaning whatever in the pending action below?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3155.381,3158.083,It would not have an effect on the action.
2010.09-1454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3158.083,3174.01,"Suppose that we dismiss the case as improvidently granted, while indicating in an opinion some of the questions that we find difficult such, for example, as the seizure question, et cetera; what kind of impact would that have in your opinion?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3174.01,3177.378,If the Court were to dismiss the case as--
2010.09-1454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3177.378,3184.199,"Yes, if -- while indicating the reasons being in part that there are difficult questions here, suggesting what they are."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3186.484,3193.471,"--Well, Your Honor, it would have some impact at least on the Petitioner's position."
2010.09-1454,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3208.064,3239.468,"It wouldn't affect your client in any way, because she's out of it and you were candid from the beginning to say as far as she's concerned this is a moot case; but as far as Camreta and the other officers are concerned, we were told by Oregon's representative that they are not -- that they have tailored their behavior to conform to this decision."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3239.468,3245.189,"--And, Your Honor, that--"
2010.09-1454,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3245.189,3246.256,So--
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3246.256,3268.805,"--that would be to -- to tell the officials who investigate child abuse that in the name of protecting children, they do not have free rein to do anything and everything that they think is appropriate, because what they do harms children, including the very children they claim to be trying to protect."
2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3293.587,3300.074,If you're making an argument on something that you've already told us you have no cognizable interest in -- correct?
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3300.074,3300.791,Correct.
2010.09-1454,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3300.791,3322.189,"If you were designing what you would regard as an ideal system, and you're very knowledgeable in this -- in this area, and you concluded that some kind of approval by a detached individual should be required before something like this is allowed, would you set the standard at probable cause?"
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3332.478,3402.058,"Well, in fact, Your Honor, the -- most of the States have a procedure for seeking court approval, and their -- they differ in whether they require probable cause or reasonable suspicion or something like reasonable cause; and so while we put in our brief that the seizure of S.G. should have been based upon probable cause, given the law enforcement component, if there was -- if Alford, the deputy sheriff, were not there at all, and it was purely a child welfare seizure and the child welfare caseworker were going to a juvenile court judge and seeking some kind of judicial approval, the -- because the laws of the States differ between reasonable suspicion and probable cause, I would suggest that the better course would be to let this play itself out between those two legal standards."
2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3402.058,3402.908,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1454,2,19370,carolyn_kubitschek,,3402.908,3404.26,Thank you.
2010.09-1454,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3404.26,3406.476,"General Kroger, you have 4 minutes remaining."
2010.09-1454,3,31312,john_r_kroger,,3406.476,3411.164,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2010.09-1454,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3411.164,3415.799,"General, just a point of clarification before you go on."
2010.09-1454,3,31312,john_r_kroger,,3435.796,3446.003,"--No, Your Honor, but they would have to talk to children in a way which runs no risk of being found of seizing the children within the meaning of the Ninth Circuit decision."
2010.09-1454,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3446.003,3448.437,"Well, so then walking along the hall in the school, right?"
2010.09-1454,3,31312,john_r_kroger,,3448.437,3449.255,I--
2010.09-1454,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3449.255,3450.172,Just come up alongside:
2010.09-1454,3,31312,john_r_kroger,,3453.891,3460.763,"--Yes, Your Honor, and you can see the problem which the Ninth Circuit decision causes practically on the child welfare system in the State of Oregon."
2010.09-1454,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3487.33,3488.164,What's the standard?
2010.09-1454,3,31312,john_r_kroger,,3498.888,3505.959,"--No, Your Honor, we believe that reasonable suspicion is the -- is the proper basis before making a seizure of a child to conduct one of these inquiries."
2010.09-1454,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3538.097,3545.434,"But, General, I take it that that problem disappears -- tell me if I'm wrong -- if we find there's no jurisdiction."
2010.09-1454,3,31312,john_r_kroger,,3555.859,3556.425,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3574.52,3580.34,"Would you -- are you -- and I guess what I'm asking is, let's assume we go ex ante."
2010.09-1454,3,31312,john_r_kroger,,3591.565,3592.465,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3592.465,3599.42,"And law enforcement is never going to know where that line of reasonableness or unreasonableness is, is that correct?"
2010.09-1454,3,31312,john_r_kroger,,3599.42,3600.153,That's correct.
2010.09-1454,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3600.153,3603.039,"That's in -- that's in the nature of doing this without a warrant, isn't it?"
2010.09-1454,3,31312,john_r_kroger,,3603.039,3604.289,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1454,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3615.197,3623.286,"But they do it anyway, meaning even if we say that they can seize the child, you would still have to not do a seizure that was unreasonable."
2010.09-1454,3,31312,john_r_kroger,,3627.655,3628.94,"--No, Your Honor, that's correct."
2010.09-1454,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3645.716,3652.388,"I'm not quite sure why you stipulated to a seizure in this case, but that was your strategic choice."
2010.09-1454,3,31312,john_r_kroger,,3652.388,3659.976,"Mr. Chief Justice, the question is whether vacating the decision will have an impact on the litigation below, and it will."
2010.09-1454,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3685.193,3687.895,Ms. Kubitschek said it was based on different events.
2010.09-1454,3,31312,john_r_kroger,,3689.395,3691.263,The due process--
2010.09-1454,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3691.263,3696.315,The Fourth Amendment claim against the county is based on -- on this interview?
2010.09-1454,3,31312,john_r_kroger,,3696.315,3702.571,"--Your Honor, I have not seen the new complaint, but my understanding is that it is the same event and same claim."
2010.09-1454,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3702.571,3704.355,"Thank you, Counsel."
