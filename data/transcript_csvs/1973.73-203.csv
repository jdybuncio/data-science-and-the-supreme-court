1973.73-203,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,46.988,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-203, Eisen against Carlisle & Jacquelin."
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,50.39,54.482,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-203,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,334.696,353.982,"Well, then what you’re saying, is there any suggestion or are you suggesting that a circumstance can arise where the determination of the District Court on the class action is unreviewable because of the way it’s moved back and forth between the District Court and the Court of Appeals?"
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,353.982,356.574,I think it’s unreviewable at this stage of the case.
1973.73-203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,417.563,427.394,"Mr. Fine, was Cohen the basis for the Court of Appeals holding an Eisen I that it had jurisdiction to review Judge Tyler’s original order?"
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,427.394,428.133,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-203,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,478.303,487.833,"What can you do about the payment of the order, requiring the payment of costs for notice?"
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,487.833,491.402,"Well, that’s no different, Your Honor, from discovery orders."
1973.73-203,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,510.939,516.816,"Well, do you think that’s quite the same as requiring the defendant to advance the costs through notice?"
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,516.816,523.474,"I think it is, Your Honor, because the rule doesn’t impose the burden of costs on the plaintiff."
1973.73-203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,571.838,588.886,"But your security for cause Mr. Fine, is traditionally when the costs are taxed at the end of the case, expenditures that you have incurred to your own travel, or your own pay to a court reporter, you maybe able to tax against the opposite party."
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,594.744,614.898,"Well, Your Honor, I think there is some instances for example, where a master is appointed and the parties are required to advance the expenses of the master before the end of the case, and there may be a division I think under the equity powers, under Rule 54 (b) to allocate those costs."
1973.73-203,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,709.839,738.66,"Mr. Fine, what if we not only agreed with you, but went further and came to the conclusion that this late date that the ""death knell"" doctrine as developed in the Second Circuit is wholly inappropriate and improper, that there was no right to appeal whatsoever in Eisen I from the District Court’s first disposition of this case, what would be the result?"
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,741.098,742.091,I doubt it Your Honor.
1973.73-203,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,756.245,758.301,"Well, he’s right."
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,764.58,765.088,"I think that’s right, Your Honor."
1973.73-203,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,765.088,767.801,"Having erased everything that the Court of Appeals has done in the meantime, right?"
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,767.801,769.427,That’s right.
1973.73-203,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,917.588,930.493,"Just before we leave the question of appealability, I understand that the ""death knell"" doctrine was originally developed in the Second Circuit and is adhered to there."
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,942.431,945.853,I think in the Fifth Circuit it’s recognized.
1973.73-203,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,962.497,963.478,Are the Second and the Third?
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,963.478,968.57,-- for and against on are the Second and the Third.
1973.73-203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1314.134,1323.672,"Mr. Fine, as a procedural practical matter, you say that these burdens are largely assumed by accounting firms or data processing firms."
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1331.027,1336.133,"It comes up in two contexts, first in a settlement or after final judgment."
1973.73-203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1349.3,1354.3,"And you don’t have to worry about it until either you have agreed on a settlement, or until after final judgment?"
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1354.3,1355.414,That’s right.
1973.73-203,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1420.805,1427.218,"Mr. Fine, you said the District Court hasn’t taken a position as to what would be done with the unclaimed remainder."
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1429.786,1432.126,"Well, I think there are many alternatives Your Honor."
1973.73-203,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1472.897,1477.434,"Well, Bebchick was quite a different kind of a case, wasn’t it?"
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1478.634,1482.883,"It wasn’t a class action, but you have class actions where the same approach was taken."
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1562.543,1569.614,"Mr. Fine, he explained here he talked about the -- has such a small claim that he won’t bother to file at all."
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1578.544,1579.588,"Well, people with small claims --"
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1579.588,1582.526,Or that he’s made an assignment to somebody?
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1582.526,1593.017,That’s just one of the possibilities to be considered and I have had experience in class actions where people would claim of as much as $10.00 in a class where some people had claims of thousands of dollars.
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1731.456,1737.409,Did the Court of Appeals look at this case as a (c) --
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1737.409,1742.91,(b) (3) action where that kind of notice required a (b) (3) actions have to be given.
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1743.656,1745.636,What about (b) (2)?
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1745.636,1748.009,"Well, it could be looked as a (b) (2) action and there are a number --"
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1748.009,1749.215,Court of Appeals says it wasn’t.
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1749.215,1750.232,It says it wasn’t.
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1754.878,1756.358,You also say (b) (1)?
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1756.358,1757.828,(b) (1) where it’s hybrid.
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1757.828,1759.331,But the Court of Appeals could --
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1759.331,1759.958,It said no.
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1760.676,1764.938,"Let’s assume it’s neither 1 or 2, but it is 3."
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1764.938,1766.191,"Well, there are a number --"
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1766.191,1767.269,Then what about the notice requirements?
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1767.269,1773.061,"There are a number of decisions that say that if it can be viewed as (b) (1) or (b) (2), you view it as (b) (1) or (b) (2) even if it's also a (b) (3)."
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1773.061,1775.424,"But let’s assume, let’s assume that it isn’t."
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1775.424,1775.834,It isn’t --
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1775.834,1777.888,Let’s assume you must look at it as a (b) (3) --
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1777.888,1786.923,"If you must look at it as a (b) (3) action then the question is what’s reasonable notice within the intendment of the rule, and what are the interests to be served by notice."
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.495,1792.758,Doesn’t the rule just say that you serve notice?
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1792.758,1800.939,"No, it says the court shall direct to the members of the class the best notice practicable under the circumstances."
1973.73-203,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1802.411,1803.867,In theory and it goes on and it says --
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1803.867,1808.682,"Well, it says including individual notice to all members who can be identified through a reasonable effort."
1973.73-203,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1808.682,1809.417,Right.
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1809.417,1811.456,"But, first --"
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1811.456,1812.225,How do you read that?
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1816.331,1819.035,"Yes, whatever the effort and whatever the circumstances."
1973.73-203,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1900.459,1904.022,"Well, that’s a very specific purpose for a sit to notice though, Mr. Fine, isn’t there?"
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1908.973,1909.545,"That’s right, but that --"
1973.73-203,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1909.545,1911.943,Or to hire his own lawyer if he wants to.
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1913.354,1914.276,"That’s right, but --"
1973.73-203,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1914.276,1919.756,"And it’s quite unlike (b) (1) or (b) (2), (b) (2) which is primarily an injunctive action."
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1919.756,1927.358,But you still have to look at the purpose to be served by the emeritus when it talks in terms of the best notice practicable under the circumstances.
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.514,1937.865,"But Mr. Fine, what if you lose your case?"
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1937.865,1938.165,Well --
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1938.165,1942.888,Here talk about a fund then once we win the case then we can give people notice.
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1946.448,1959.747,"That’s right, but the Court of Appeals found that their interests, because their claims are so small and more theoretic than practical anyway, they would not bring in individual suits anymore than Eisen could bring an individual suit without the class."
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1959.747,1968.098,And yet you say their interests are substantial enough that for a failure to respond should be interpreted as a waiver.
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1968.098,1976.1,"Well, that’s only one possibility Your Honor, that may or may not be adopted depending upon the circumstances at that stage of the case, but certainly --"
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1976.1,1977.961,But they’re not barred?
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1977.961,1979.62,"They are barred, Your Honor."
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1980.637,1984.979,"Well, isn’t that one of the purposes of the notice to make sure that they have a chance not to be barred?"
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,1984.979,1993.35,Although they are barred as I think the advisory committee its decisions points out it's something that they could litigate subsequently.
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2002.981,2005.314,They can always have a chance of litigating --
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,2005.314,2007.186,"Well, that --"
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2007.186,2011.367,"I thought one of the, maybe names of amending the rules as to --"
1973.73-203,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2011.367,2012.443,Make it res judicata.
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2012.443,2014.662,-- was to bar people.
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,2014.662,2016.335,"That’s right, but in --"
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2016.335,2019.084,"Well, if it’s right, where is it wrong?"
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,2019.084,2026.648,"Well, it’s right, but res judicata depends on the Hansberry and Lee, and such cases as that on adequacy of representation."
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2026.648,2029.335,"Well, so the rule really didn’t accomplish itself?"
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,2029.335,2031.033,I don’t know whether the rule was necessary.
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.304,2117.363,Let’s assume you lost your case again.
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,2117.363,2118.443,Yes.
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2118.443,2124.283,"Horrible thought, but assume you lost it, what about -- what about the cost of notice, who’s going to pay for all that?"
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,2124.283,2128.6,"Well, under Rule 54 (d), I think equitable principles could be applied."
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2130.131,2131.768,Can they be passed to the plaintiff?
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,2131.768,2133.53,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.53,2134.581,But probably?
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,2134.581,2135.873,"No, not even probably."
1973.73-203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.716,2139.75,But you don’t have to say that or otherwise you would have to put up the bond?
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,2139.75,2144.678,"No, I say, well there is no bond provision for any plaintiff under the anti trust law."
1973.73-203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2169.638,2173.5,"But if you lose your antitrust suit, presumably you wouldn’t put out a business by those defendants?"
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,2173.5,2176.635,"Well, that’s something that might depend on the jury."
1973.73-203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2178.01,2181.189,"Well, but that’s the way we resolve those questions."
1973.73-203,0,15938,aaron_m_fine,,2185.72,2200.974,"There’s a case where a plaintiff established that the defendant had violated the Robinson-Patman Act, but the jury found he hadn’t been damaged, and the judgment was entered for the defendants, but the court still taxed the cost to the defendants because they had violated the law."
1973.73-203,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2240.368,2244.12,Very well Mr. Fine.
1973.73-203,1,21214,devereux_milburn,,2246.258,2250.229,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-203,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2407.102,2413.097,"Mr. Milburn, why isn’t Mr. Fine right on the $19,000.00 business under Hickman against Taylor?"
1973.73-203,1,21214,devereux_milburn,,2422.659,2443.821,"Well, I think that that is a possibility, but we feel that we have a right under the Cohen doctrine to appeal at this time, and I would find, I am just guessing, that my clients might have some objection to following the course you suggest and maybe going to jail pending on appeal."
1973.73-203,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2453.121,2460.028,"But, after Eisen I in this Court, didn’t you -- there was a petition for certiorari here, was it not?"
1973.73-203,1,21214,devereux_milburn,,2460.028,2462.379,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-203,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2462.379,2465.508,Which brought by you or your client?
1973.73-203,1,21214,devereux_milburn,,2465.508,2466.685,That is correct.
1973.73-203,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2466.685,2468.18,Which was denied?
1973.73-203,1,21214,devereux_milburn,,2468.18,2469.816,That’s correct Your Honor.
1973.73-203,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2469.816,2477.211,"Your client and its counsel still the same view that the ""death knell"" doctrine is an invalid doctrine?"
1973.73-203,1,21214,devereux_milburn,,2477.211,2485.114,"Your Honor, we stand by our brief in the petition for certiorari in that case."
1973.73-203,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2544.781,2553.324,"You think the question of the validity of the ""death knell"" rule is before us here?"
1973.73-203,1,21214,devereux_milburn,,2553.324,2553.803,I do.
1973.73-203,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2569.784,2571.024,"Well, quite apart from the --"
1973.73-203,1,21214,devereux_milburn,,2571.024,2571.595,Quite apart.
1973.73-203,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2571.595,2572.842,-- retain jurisdiction.
1973.73-203,1,21214,devereux_milburn,,2572.842,2582.15,"Yes, I think in Eisen I, you have a conflict in the circuits that you mentioned, and certainly this Court has jurisdiction, and probably a responsibility to resolve it at this time."
1973.73-203,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2873.633,2877.447,"Just a minute, Mr. Milburn, he has suggested that you now mail checks, before you won the case?"

1973.73-203,1,21214,devereux_milburn,,2911.912,2912.763,It stops the distribution.
1973.73-203,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2912.763,2913.807,It never stops your point?

1973.73-203,1,21214,devereux_milburn,,3112.06,3113.956,I don’t think there was a formula.
1973.73-203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.956,3115.27,But then you’re objecting to a formula?

1973.73-203,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3368.315,3370.342,Because of the use of the word “individual?”

1973.73-203,1,21214,devereux_milburn,,3377.646,3380.064,Yes.

1973.73-203,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3397.074,3397.47,Yes.
1973.73-203,1,21214,devereux_milburn,,3397.47,3399.379,Yes sir.

1973.73-203,1,21214,devereux_milburn,,3493.719,3496.956,I would say that we couldn’t give him individual notice.
1973.73-203,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3515.097,3521.253,Very well Mr. Milburn.
1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,3526.597,3530.724,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.73-203,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4045.476,4064.702,"Sorry Mr. Jackson, now there not some Federal Court decisions that have said that if a case is in fact for money damages and for an injunction that notice need not be given, where we told that by your brother at the bar here?"
1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,4064.702,4068.93,I believe he intimated that that was the case.
1973.73-203,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4090.169,4097.845,Your view would be that the plaintiff would have to forgo his money damage claim if --
1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,4097.845,4098.809,Or give the notice.
1973.73-203,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4098.809,4100.1,-- or give the notice.
1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,4100.1,4105.169,"Yes, Your Honor, that's right."
1973.73-203,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4399.615,4404.637,"I suppose, Mr. Jackson you'd make that argument if the percentages were reversed?"
1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,4404.637,4405.676,Yes.
1973.73-203,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4410.098,4420.008,"Well, Mr. Jackson, how about the situation where you want to take someone’s deposition out of town and your opponent comes in and says “We just can’t, we’re poor."
1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,4432.309,4436.87,"I think it is, Your Honor."
1973.73-203,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4534.102,4538.776,I suppose he can avoid that cost by simply electing to proceed individually?
1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,4538.776,4540.779,There’s nothing to prevent that.
1973.73-203,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4569.569,4570.412,If he wins.
1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,4570.412,4573.613,"If he wins, yes Your Honor, only if he wins."
1973.73-203,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4576.692,4600.785,"I suppose when one of the litigants asks to take a deposition in a distant place faced with the situation that I understood Mr. Justice Rehnquist referred to, he is asking to use the court’s machinery, and that’s a distinction, the defendants here, the odd-lot traders are asking the court to do anything?"
1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,4600.785,4603.336,That’s right Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.73-203,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4702.249,4725.582,"Mr. Jackson, I take it that even if there isn’t a proper class of six million, if the plaintiff had been willing to put up costs of notice and accept the job of giving notice to two million identifiable people, what should have kept that class action from going forward, if the plaintiff had been willing to give notice and pay for it?"
1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,4725.582,4730.927,The cost of individual notice to the readily identifiable members of the class?
1973.73-203,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4738.016,4739.675,What would’ve been?
1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,4739.675,4742.329,"Well, I think the question of manageability, Your Honor."
1973.73-203,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4742.329,4744.05,Still manageability?
1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,4744.05,4745.354,Oh! Yes.
1973.73-203,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4839.935,4853.113,"Well, what is so inherently difficult, let’s just take a name out of the two million, now what’s so inherently difficult about figuring out what that one person is claim is, or in deciding it?"
1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,4853.113,4856.265,"Well, as Mr. Milburn has stated --"
1973.73-203,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4856.265,4857.837,There isn’t any formula?
1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,4857.837,4858.735,There’s no formula.
1973.73-203,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4915.363,4923.116,"So even if you find that there was an antitrust violation, the damage formulation might be a matter of difference in each individual case?"

1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,4931.279,4943.601,"No, Your Honor, they don’t have to come in person, but they do have to communicate with the court and with the clerk’s office and we know the difficulties from other situations."

1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,4960.86,4961.958,Well --
1973.73-203,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4961.958,4970.889,I’m just wondering whether you are pushing this manageability point too far by saying that the court building has to be used.
1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,4980.613,4981.758,"Yes, of course Your Honor."

1973.73-203,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4987.83,4988.965,"Oh, that was the only court --"
1973.73-203,2,45124,william_eldred_jackson,,4988.965,4993.03,-- but the court’s facilities and its auspices and its personnel.

1973.73-203,3,15938,aaron_m_fine,,5004.441,5005.277,Thank you.
1973.73-203,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5048.948,5052.178,"Well, more than likely, but he didn’t decide what the formula was?"
1973.73-203,3,15938,aaron_m_fine,,5052.178,5052.929,No.
1973.73-203,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5052.929,5057.575,I couldn’t find anything on the A11 or A212 that would --
1973.73-203,3,15938,aaron_m_fine,,5057.575,5058.768,All that we’re suggesting is that --
1973.73-203,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5058.768,5060.872,-- that would help you make out two million checks.
1973.73-203,3,15938,aaron_m_fine,,5060.872,5068.879,"-- that in light of the comments of Judge Tyler, it’s more than likely that this case will be manageable pursuant to a formula."
1973.73-203,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5069.662,5072.664,Well you don’t suggest then that he’s already devised a formula?
1973.73-203,3,15938,aaron_m_fine,,5072.664,5075.65,"No, he hasn’t devised one, because we have to go through the trial."
1973.73-203,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5075.65,5077.133,Oh! I misunderstood you earlier --
1973.73-203,3,15938,aaron_m_fine,,5077.133,5083.359,"No, but we have to go through the trial on the question of damages to find out exactly what the overcharge was."
1973.73-203,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5090.395,5096.839,You think now that the evidence would validate that conception?
1973.73-203,3,15938,aaron_m_fine,,5096.839,5103.626,"That’s right, and if it isn’t clear that’s certainly something that should be made clear by the District Court and it could be made clear."
1973.73-203,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5103.626,5106.785,"There’s no evidence on the subject one way or the other right now, is there really?"
1973.73-203,3,15938,aaron_m_fine,,5106.785,5119.484,"Well, I think the fact that he has found that common question predominate, and this is one of the common questions that he thought predominated, and the basis that he’s used for it is sufficient on which to proceed at this time."
1973.73-203,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5119.484,5123.25,You mean in the mini-hearing so-called?
1973.73-203,3,15938,aaron_m_fine,,5123.25,5125.555,I think this was before the mini-hearing.
1973.73-203,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5125.555,5127.715,On what evidence did he rely then?
1973.73-203,3,15938,aaron_m_fine,,5127.715,5136.55,On the basis of the SEC special study where they pointed out that exactly the same rates have been charged.
1973.73-203,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5160.686,5167.103,Could the SEC deal with this in the general area of the injunctive relief that was sought?
1973.73-203,3,15938,aaron_m_fine,,5167.103,5169.443,"No, Your Honor, they did not."
1973.73-203,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5361.723,5376.832,"Mr. Fine, throughout your brief, there was mention of the fact that the statute to have limitations may run as to many members of this class, and that therefore, that affects the necessity of notice, I gather?"
1973.73-203,3,15938,aaron_m_fine,,5377.646,5380.63,"I think, Your Honor, in light of your decision in the Utah case --"
1973.73-203,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5380.63,5382.178,Doesn’t Utah take care of that problem?
1973.73-203,3,15938,aaron_m_fine,,5382.178,5383.997,-- we have two years left.
1973.73-203,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5383.997,5384.409,I thought so.
1973.73-203,3,15938,aaron_m_fine,,5384.409,5391.781,"It was in and out of class status here, and I think we can tackle of the different periods of time, we have about two years --"
1973.73-203,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5391.781,5394.681,The American Pipe takes care of that argument?
1973.73-203,3,15938,aaron_m_fine,,5394.681,5395.982,I think so.
1973.73-203,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5395.982,5396.928,Thank you.
1973.73-203,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5396.928,5397.662,Thank you gentlemen.
