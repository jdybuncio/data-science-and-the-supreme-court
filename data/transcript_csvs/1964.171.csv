1964.171,0,30325,james_j_fitzpatrick,,14.877,25.187,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to present Attorney Albert P. Zabin of the Boston, Massachusetts Bar who is -- who did not have all of the qualifications from membership to this Bar."
1964.171,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,32.732,33.882,"Motion is granted, (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.171,0,30325,james_j_fitzpatrick,,33.882,34.432,Thank you very much.
1964.171,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,34.432,35.249,"You may argue, Mr. --"
1964.171,0,30325,james_j_fitzpatrick,,35.249,38.817,Mr. Fitzpatrick.
1964.171,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,38.817,40.971,Mr. Zabin.
1964.171,1,17310,albert_p_zabin,,40.971,45.153,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.171,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,266.14,269.249,"There's no question about actual notice here, is there?"
1964.171,1,17310,albert_p_zabin,,269.249,270.766,The -- I was going to come to that.
1964.171,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,270.795,272.238,"Well, come to it at your own time."
1964.171,1,17310,albert_p_zabin,,272.238,273.983,"But I can deal with it now, Your Honor."
1964.171,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,299.575,303.096,That he had nothing but the --(Inaudible)
1964.171,1,17310,albert_p_zabin,,303.096,326.655,"I believe, Your Honor, that it would not, except in answer to the decision of the Court of Appeals, this reasoning that the -- this is a matter of substance because of the legislative policy of Massachusetts, simply to point out to the Court that in fact in this case, to whatever with -- if any weight at all should be given to the Massachusetts' policy, that policy has been substantially satisfied."
1964.171,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,532.008,540.273,(Inaudible) -- then why does not the state law implement it in saying that there are certain facts of litigation?
1964.171,1,17310,albert_p_zabin,,554.715,555.25,"That's right, Your Honor --"
1964.171,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,555.25,562.626,"-- and you come after that, then (Inaudible)?"
1964.171,1,17310,albert_p_zabin,,562.626,566.363,"I should say, Your Honor, that a state may have an interest."
1964.171,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,589.881,605.573,But you would have to interpret (Inaudible)?
1964.171,1,17310,albert_p_zabin,,605.573,627.949,"Well, I should say, Your Honor, that that interpretation would require a reading of the Enabling Act, the term ""substantive right"" I think in a strange manner, whereas I argue before and I think that as you, Your Honor points out, a state may have an interest but it doesn't have a substantive right."
1964.171,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,641.843,652.881,In other words you -- (Inaudible) maybe the rule ought to be admitted and the petitioner is going to do this and if you don't concede (Inaudible) substantive right.
1964.171,1,17310,albert_p_zabin,,652.881,658.124,"That's right, Your Honor."
1964.171,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,931.995,934.097,Mr. Fitzpatrick.
1964.171,2,30325,james_j_fitzpatrick,,934.097,948.729,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1964.171,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1185.488,1189.673,Could you state what the (Inaudible)?
1964.171,2,30325,james_j_fitzpatrick,,1189.673,1196.775,"The right to have a defense and to close an estate up, to settle the estate."
1964.171,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1203.406,1222.064,"(Inaudible) argued that the passing of the limitations (Inaudible), what more is involved in getting this (Inaudible)?"
1964.171,2,30325,james_j_fitzpatrick,,1222.064,1236.189,"Well, the statute -- actually, in terms of construction, I believe, makes a condition precedent certain actions which can be followed in any one of three situations."
1964.171,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1239.072,1256.291,"(Inaudible) substantive term, this is what you're arguing, substantive terms, what is involved here is more (Inaudible)."
1964.171,2,30325,james_j_fitzpatrick,,1256.291,1258.212,"In this case, that's correct."
1964.171,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1258.212,1260.612,And you handed what?
1964.171,2,30325,james_j_fitzpatrick,,1260.612,1261.061,Apparent -- that's --
1964.171,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1261.061,1262.058,(Inaudible)
1964.171,2,30325,james_j_fitzpatrick,,1262.058,1263.272,That's correct.
1964.171,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1263.272,1268.19,"And I was referring, how do you define the substantive right?"
1964.171,2,30325,james_j_fitzpatrick,,1273.243,1291.509,"Well, the -- not only the right to be handed the summons, but the right also that the executor may have a protection both from term creditors and also from a -- any actions by heirs as against him, it protects him under the Massachusetts General Laws."
1964.171,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1311.226,1330.014,"But the -- as my Brother Goldberg has said, the interest of Massachusetts is in closing up an estate with dispatch, and also in seeing to it that the executor administrator have prompt notice of any claims."
1964.171,2,30325,james_j_fitzpatrick,,1344.158,1345.867,There was a question Your Honor in this case.
1964.171,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1390.336,1398.681,"But the policy served by the Massachusetts legislation was -- that it was served here, there was -- was it not?"
1964.171,2,30325,james_j_fitzpatrick,,1412.479,1433.069,"I think that the policy of the state -- of the statute was not complied with to this extent that in 1954, the addition to the statute was related to the service or the (Inaudible) -- strike that -- the filing of notice for the registry of probate."
1964.171,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1761.372,1766.976,"Mr. Zabin, do you have a oral argument?"
1964.171,3,17310,albert_p_zabin,,1766.976,1771.269,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court."
