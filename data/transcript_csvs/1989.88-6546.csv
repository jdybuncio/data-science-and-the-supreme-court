1989.88-6546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.557,"We'll hear argument first this afternoon in Number 88-6546, Albert Duro v. Edward Reina."
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,11.47,12.248,Thank you.
1989.88-6546,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,92.196,93.285,It resulted in a death?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,93.285,96.136,"It did result in death, Justice O'Connor, yes."
1989.88-6546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,183.897,190.001,Did the Ninth Circuit adopt the context rule as part of a statutory analysis?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,192.832,200.889,It... it purported to justify it on the basis that the tribe had an interest in someone over whom they had a significant contact.
1989.88-6546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,206.142,210.824,Did... did... did it purport to be some sort of a constitutional analysis?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,210.824,211.685,"No, it did not."
1989.88-6546,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,223.154,236.372,"Well, now, if you were to prevail here, I take it no prosecution for the discharge of the firearm would be possible in this case?"
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,236.372,239.885,"Well, Justice O'Connor, we don't necessarily feel that that is true."
1989.88-6546,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,240.466,241.577,Why not?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,241.577,249.632,"--Well, first of all, we think that two separate sovereigns could fill the supposed void that the Respondents argue exist."
1989.88-6546,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,250.784,260.659,"Well, in Arizona it has not, of course, come within the purview of Public Law 280."
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,263.721,264.112,"--You're correct, Justice O'Connor."
1989.88-6546,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.372,264.863,--So that's out.
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,264.863,265.654,That's true.
1989.88-6546,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.654,266.165,All right.
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,266.165,280.262,"But the State of Arizona continues to exercise criminal jurisdiction for crimes committed on the reservation between two non-Indians, and that jurisdiction exists regardless of whether or not it's a 280 state."
1989.88-6546,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,291.931,300.486,Is there any case from this Court that you would point to to indicate that the State of Arizona has criminal jurisdiction here?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,303.498,308.803,--This Court has not directly focused upon that issue as of yet.
1989.88-6546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,340.055,347.108,"But if... not a non-member Indian attacking a member, could it?"
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,347.108,349.5,"No, I would think... well, yes."
1989.88-6546,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,357.469,359.75,So your response to me was wrong.
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,363.784,369.066,I think the State of Arizona could assert jurisdiction involving an offense on the reservation--
1989.88-6546,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,369.066,370.508,"No, we're talking about this offense."
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,375.411,375.962,--It was not.
1989.88-6546,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,377.674,380.026,It's a non-Indian who was killed?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,380.026,380.777,It's a non-member.
1989.88-6546,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,394.698,394.938,All right.
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,405.516,416.532,"Let me say, Justice O'Connor, I cannot answer that question in the definitive manner now, but it is very likely that the State of Arizona could have jurisdiction under the rationale of McBratney."
1989.88-6546,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,420.546,430.213,"Well, I thought the federal government had dismissed the suit, and the solicitor general representing the federal government says it has no jurisdiction over this offense."
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,430.213,430.654,That's true.
1989.88-6546,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,437.71,438.407,"Well, I don't know about liking to."
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,442.271,446.174,--The government said the same thing to this Court in Oliphant.
1989.88-6546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,460.646,463.908,And how was that?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,463.908,468.412,State courts exercise jurisdiction after Oliphant.
1989.88-6546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,468.412,481.021,Is it also a possibility that no void exists because we interpret the exception clause of 1152 to apply to tribal members?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,481.021,481.632,Precisely.
1989.88-6546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,486.185,491.588,Is there... is there any precedent that would allow us... would we have to go contrary to our precedence to do that?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,491.588,497.813,--The only case that the Court would have to go contrary to arguably would be the dicta in United States v. Rogers.
1989.88-6546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,691.786,714.062,"Couldn't one say that what Indians, what all Indians meant in... at the time 1152 was adopted is not necessarily what all Indians means today; that in light of the later legislation providing for enrollment and so forth, who constitutes an Indian has simply been changed?"
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,715.953,725.019,--It would if the Court was willing to change the definition of Indian as generally applied to federal jurisdiction since Indian law began.
1989.88-6546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,754.079,764.114,"So that response to Justice Scalia indicates that it would be difficult, it seems to me, to interpret 1152 to avoid... to prevent the void?"
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,764.114,770.739,"--I think that's true, unless the Court does as you suggested, Justice Kennedy, define that it means tribal members."
1989.88-6546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,773.182,777.496,"Well, but... but how can you do that consistently with what you just told Justice Scalia?"
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,777.496,778.948,"--Well, I think the way you do it--"
1989.88-6546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,778.948,779.816,"Because we're talking about the word ""Indian""."
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,779.816,788.512,"--The way you do it, I believe, is not to find that you redefine the term ""Indian"", but you look at the legislative history to see what Congress meant."
1989.88-6546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,804.674,813.941,"On any theory, you... you would still say... when you say it means a member of the tribe, you assert an enrolled member of the tribe, don't you?"
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,815.623,818.415,--Not necessarily.
1989.88-6546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.415,818.895,Not necessarily.
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,830.605,830.986,No.
1989.88-6546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,836.431,837.351,Enrolled members.
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,837.351,841.144,--However the tribe defines its own membership.
1989.88-6546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.825,855.712,"Yes, but at the time of 1152, if you assert that Indian there just means an Indian of that tribe, it surely, as you just say, doesn't mean an enrolled member of that tribe since there was no enrollment."
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,855.712,856.473,That's correct.
1989.88-6546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,856.473,859.947,It must mean an Indian who by blood belonged to that tribe.
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,859.947,863.148,And the Indian who's considered a member by the tribe itself.
1989.88-6546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,863.148,864.379,All right.
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,864.379,883.292,"That, we submit, would... would be the end of tribal jurisdiction and that the state has an interest in any non-member, someone who isn't affiliated by the tribe, who doesn't have the privileges of membership and who's not considered a member by the tribe."
1989.88-6546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,883.292,887.213,Equivalent to the definition of enrollment?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,887.213,890.047,I don't believe it's exactly equivalent to the definition--
1989.88-6546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,890.047,894.018,"Well, if it isn't exactly equivalent, then you're going to have the void of jurisdiction."
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,894.018,910.029,"--Well, the void, in fact, in this case, if you decide that the tribe has jurisdiction over enrolled Indians, it's interesting to know that 14 percent of the Pimas and 16 percent of the Maricopas in this case are not enrolled."
1989.88-6546,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1028.8,1031.679,Do you think Oliphant was correctly decided?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,1031.679,1033.261,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1989.88-6546,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1033.261,1036.284,It has been criticized.
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,1036.284,1037.065,It has.
1989.88-6546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1144.266,1148.036,Would you consider that a treaty obligation or a treaty right?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,1148.036,1149.809,--Treaty obligation.
1989.88-6546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1149.809,1151.289,"Well, why?"
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,1151.289,1153.97,An obligation on the part of the United States and a right on the part of the tribe.
1989.88-6546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.97,1167.601,"Well, you... in these treaties, the United States was given by... by the tribe the right to take care of trials of non-members of the tribe."
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,1174.626,1176.767,"Justice Scalia, I believe that you're mistaken."
1989.88-6546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1189.275,1209.16,"That's exactly what I'm saying, but I... but it seems to me that that power on the part of the United States, I... I would not regard that as an obligation of the United States which... which it is repudiating in the statute but, rather, as a right of the United States which it is permitted to give up by the statute if it wants to."
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,1215.833,1217.014,--At the time--
1989.88-6546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1217.014,1218.585,As a right.
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,1218.585,1226.671,"--At the time that those treaties were negotiated, the United States undertook what I would call an obligation in order to prevent Indian wars."
1989.88-6546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1234.896,1239.979,"They told the tribes, though, you can't... you cannot try members of other tribes."
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,1240.96,1241.929,Correct.
1989.88-6546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1241.929,1246.032,Do you think the tribes thought that the U.S. was doing them a favor when they said you can't try members of other tribes?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,1250.536,1255.571,"I would characterize it not merely as a favor, Your Honor, but as an obligation of the United States."
1989.88-6546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1316.543,1327.382,Is it the position of the... of your opponents that Duro could not have resigned his membership in his tribe and thereby avoided jurisdiction?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,1327.382,1331.523,They say that he could give up his membership.
1989.88-6546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1331.523,1334.027,And that would make him a non-Indian?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,1334.027,1338.279,It would make him a non-enrolled Indian.
1989.88-6546,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1368.048,1369.818,May I ask you this question?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,1378.165,1382.828,I would have made the same argument but for two reasons.
1989.88-6546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1423.517,1440.106,"Aside from the equal protection point, do you argue that there is any constitutional problem with the United States consenting to the tribes asserting jurisdiction over Duro?"
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,1440.106,1441.896,"Yes, Your Honor, we do."
1989.88-6546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1441.896,1443.298,What... what is that constitutional argument?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,1443.298,1454.227,"Well, the Indian Civil Rights Act was passed and applied some of the constitutional protections of the Bill of Rights to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction by Indian tribes but not all."
1989.88-6546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1463.233,1472.279,But what is the constitutional principle that would be violated if the United States were to say that Duro could be tried by this tribe?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,1472.279,1475.351,"Number one, no right to counsel."
1989.88-6546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1519.253,1522.994,Do you have any... do you have any cases on... on that... for that proposition?
1989.88-6546,0,33187,john_trebon,,1522.994,1527.418,"--Nevada v. Hall, I believe, is a case on point for consent of the governed."
1989.88-6546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1604.892,1607.324,"Very well, Mr. Trebon."
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,1608.375,1613.59,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-6546,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1743.038,1753.183,"Well, the... the Indian Civil Rights Act gives one pause when if that requires us to make an equal protection sort of analysis."
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,1753.183,1758.919,"I don't think it requires an equal protection analysis in this case, Justice O'Connor."
1989.88-6546,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1824.482,1824.712,"Mr. Wilks, why just--"
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,1824.712,1839.113,"--give up the benefits that accrue to Indian people under federal law and perhaps gain other benefits, as Mr. Duro might have, had he not been a member of a federally recognized tribe."
1989.88-6546,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.113,1842.185,"--Mr. Wilks, why just enrolled Indians?"
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,1858.617,1873.967,"What I did not say, Justice Scalia, is that the rights that the tribes had before American sovereignty have as to criminal jurisdiction over Indians has remained unchanged through history."
1989.88-6546,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1958.306,1964.871,"Does... does that act, Mr. Wilks, in effect make all Indians fungible for... for purposes like this?"
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,1964.871,1997.913,"I don't know if I'd use that word, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think that the answer is yes, and I think that, for instance, this Court, in Morton v. Mancari, did the same thing or recognized that principle when it upheld the Indian preference law on the grounds that Indian employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, even though they are not members of the tribes to which they are assigned, would benefit those tribes in their... in their ability to govern themselves."
1989.88-6546,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2050.46,2071.184,"Based on... based on that analysis, if... if we were to find that there was a void here, I take it Congress couldn't cure it by giving the Indian tribes additional jurisdiction without then laying itself open to the charge that they're surrendering the rights of citizens?"
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2084.223,2098.722,"That's correct; and as the Court pointed out in Wheeler in an... in the unresolved question as to whether if... if the sovereignty, if the jurisdiction had been accorded by Congress to the tribes, would there then be the dual jurisdictions."
1989.88-6546,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2116.374,2120.678,My... my suggestion is that perhaps it could not be cured.
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2120.678,2122.849,It could not be totally cured.
1989.88-6546,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2132.255,2149.416,"Well, now, under your view, Mr. Wilks, the tribe has jurisdiction over any enrolled member of any Indian tribe if the offense is committed by that member on the reservation?"
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2149.416,2151.339,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1989.88-6546,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2151.339,2166.148,"But if the person were not an enrolled member and yet were an Indian living on the reservation but not of that tribe, then the tribe could not exercise?"
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2166.148,2167.8,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1989.88-6546,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.8,2169.64,Then there would be a void.
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2169.64,2171.683,I think there would not be a void if--
1989.88-6546,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.683,2172.303,"There would be, wouldn't there?"
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2172.303,2174.446,--I think there would not be a void.
1989.88-6546,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.446,2174.576,Why?
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2174.576,2190.616,"Because the individual as defined was not an enrolled member of any tribe, of any Indian tribe, and there... of any federally recognized Indian tribe, and, therefore, could be dealt with either in federal or state court, depending on what the circumstances are."
1989.88-6546,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2190.616,2198.7,You don't think under federal law that they might look to see if the person was in fact of Indian blood?
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2198.7,2205.836,I have some difficulty in answering that definitively because of the 50 percent blood quantum in the--
1989.88-6546,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.836,2206.667,Exactly.
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2212.11,2218.695,"--Yes, and I think, as it was earlier pointed out, Indian is now defined."
1989.88-6546,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.126,2225.939,"I know, but it certainly isn't defined as an enrolled Indian."
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2225.939,2227.301,--Yes.
1989.88-6546,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2249.778,2256.472,"And those latter two people wouldn't be covered for purposes of tribal jurisdiction, I take it?"
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2256.472,2264.038,"I... I think that they probably would be, but I... that again... again is not something that has been determined."
1989.88-6546,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2367.126,2370.709,The problem... go ahead.
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2376.832,2379.922,Would not be... we're dealing only with misdemeanors.
1989.88-6546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2428.796,2431.347,"But is that true, Mr. Wilks, if--"
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2450.431,2450.899,That's correct.
1989.88-6546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2450.899,2451.56,--citizens of the tribe.
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2468.833,2471.544,That's a very large leap of faith.
1989.88-6546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2482.05,2484.063,"It, itself, did some manhandling."
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2484.063,2485.183,--To some extent.
1989.88-6546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2485.183,2485.463,Yes.
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2485.463,2486.685,I don't disagree with that.
1989.88-6546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2496.639,2496.789,Right.
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2496.789,2498.191,--implicit amendment.
1989.88-6546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2499.301,2504.987,But the gap argument that you make is really the same gap argument that the government made in Oliphant.
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2504.987,2508.229,"And if that is correct, and I... I--"
1989.88-6546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2508.229,2509.679,And it may or may not have been valid.
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2514.955,2526.903,"--It was not valid, I think, because the state had jurisdiction at the time of Oliphant, and the state does not now have jurisdiction."
1989.88-6546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2529.597,2535.712,"I know not under Public Law 280, that's right, but under the line of reasoning that applied in McBratney."
1989.88-6546,1,40794,richard_b_wilks,,2535.712,2538.112,"--McBratney line of reasoning does not apply, I think."
1989.88-6546,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2538.112,2541.943,"Thank you, Mr. Wilks."
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2543.735,2554.301,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-6546,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2795.052,2796.812,And so we might read it.
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2797.824,2820.219,"--And the provision has been reenacted repeatedly, interpreted in an opinion of the Attorney General that we cite, and there has never been any repudiation of that interpretation by Congress as it has carried that provision forward."
1989.88-6546,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2820.219,2827.954,"But Mr. Wallace, does it raise equal protection concerns, do you think, that kind of race-based division?"
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2827.954,2839.151,"Well, we think it is not entirely race based even though as we say there is an ancestral element included in it."
1989.88-6546,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.298,2912.65,"Mr. Wallace, can I interrupt you for a moment on the Rogers case?"
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2925.758,2926.589,That is correct.
1989.88-6546,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2926.589,2927.491,--which is no longer true.
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2939.738,2946.433,"That is correct, and we don't think that does make a difference."
1989.88-6546,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2947.473,2949.305,"But it makes this difference, doesn't it?"
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2962.575,2986.751,"--That was the question before this Court in United States v. Antelope, and the Court unanimously held that Congress justifiably could treat members of Indian tribes who are citizens of the United States differently from other citizens with respect to which court has criminal jurisdiction over them and the punishment to which they are subjected."
1989.88-6546,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2992.254,3001.02,"Yes, but the rationale was that they were... there were characteristics which differentiated them from other citizens; namely, their Indian status: But that isn't true here."
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3001.02,3002.812,But it is true here.
1989.88-6546,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3054.563,3057.775,"Well, what about non-enrolled?"
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3057.775,3090.797,"While that question need not be faced in this case because we're dealing with an enrolled member, we think that if... if a person is eligible for enrollment as a member and has not repudiated membership in the tribe, that that person should be treated the same as an enrolled member for these purposes just as someone who hasn't registered to vote."
1989.88-6546,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3102.875,3108.761,That's really allows a construction of the federal statute.
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3108.761,3110.173,"It does, but--"
1989.88-6546,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3110.173,3114.197,"And if you can construe it that way, you might be able to construe it some other way."
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3114.197,3137.853,"--Well, that is correct, but otherwise you would get into a peculiar anomaly with respect to the members of the tribe itself who are resident on the reservation, some of whom may not have bothered to get their names onto the tribal rolls; and why they should be treated differently with respect to the tribal court's jurisdiction is not apparent."
1989.88-6546,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3137.853,3148.15,"Under that line of reasoning, I take it that Duro could not opt out his Indian status?"
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3148.15,3150.872,Duro can opt out.
1989.88-6546,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3156.438,3161.633,"Well, why, if you say he's entitled, if... if the test is he's entitled to enrollment?"
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3161.633,3167.077,"No, and I... but I... I added and he has not repudiated his membership in the tribe."
1989.88-6546,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3175.001,3181.355,"Well, then he would... he would not be an Indian with respect... in the... the--"
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3181.355,3183.497,In any of the jurisdictional statutes.
1989.88-6546,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3183.497,3190.051,--He would not be considered an Indian even though he was just because he wasn't enrolled and that he had opted out.
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3190.051,3191.874,"That's correct, but not retroactively."
1989.88-6546,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3193.544,3195.674,"Well, I know, but then... then he be subject to federal jurisdiction."
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3195.674,3201.839,--Or even or to state jurisdiction if there was no Indian involved in the crime.
1989.88-6546,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3202.88,3213.619,"Are there laws, Mr. Wallace, under which we treat unenrolled Indians who are eligible for enrollment but have chosen not to enroll the same as enrolled Indians?"
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3213.619,3229.2,"--There's no decision of this Court on the subject, but I think the logic of the Court's decisions are assumed in the 19th Century that Indians are all members of tribes."
1989.88-6546,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3256.769,3273.589,"Mr. Wallace, if... if... if we were to read 1153 to mean tribal member as the Petitioners here wish us to, should we read the exception clause in 1152 the same way to prevent the void from arising?"
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3273.589,3284.158,"--Well, there would still be a considerable problem when the... when an Indian was involved in the crime."
1989.88-6546,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3287.962,3290.142,"Well, the Federal Government... the Federal Government--"
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3290.142,3300.38,"--through Public Law 280, and that would require a reinterpretation of that exception."
1989.88-6546,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3454.853,3455.594,--Why is that so?
1989.88-6546,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3466.563,3475.292,"--On many reservations that is true, and those are the reservations where other enforcement authorities tend to be more available."
1989.88-6546,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3482.674,3484.434,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1989.88-6546,3,33187,john_trebon,,3487.299,3488.287,Thank you.
1989.88-6546,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3549.085,3553.079,How would you like us to read 1152?
1989.88-6546,3,33187,john_trebon,,3553.079,3561.454,"I believe 1152... and just not my opinion but the legislative history, we believe, supports that it should be member on member."
1989.88-6546,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3577.437,3588.393,But what about an enrolled Indian who says I want out and I opt out and he's no longer an enrolled member and doesn't want to be?
1989.88-6546,3,33187,john_trebon,,3592.757,3592.978,Of course.
1989.88-6546,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3702.495,3709.48,Could your client be charged and tried and tried by his own tribe for this offense?
1989.88-6546,3,33187,john_trebon,,3709.48,3711.912,Very good argument that he could.
1989.88-6546,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3723.632,3725.443,"So if you win, there isn't any gap at all?"
1989.88-6546,3,33187,john_trebon,,3725.443,3726.955,--That's true.
1989.88-6546,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3726.955,3730.135,"Thank you, Mr. Trebon."
