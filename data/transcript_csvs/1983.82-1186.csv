1983.82-1186,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.388,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Transworld Airlines, Inc., against Franklin Mint and the consolidated case."
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,11.28,14.512,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-1186,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,51.675,52.676,When?
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,52.676,56.089,"In March of 1979, Your Honor."
1983.82-1186,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,56.089,57.911,"I don't believe the briefs put it out, but I am curious."
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,57.911,61.424,That is when... March of 1979.
1983.82-1186,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,61.424,64.436,And will you tell us how they were lost as you go along?
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,64.436,68.087,"Your Honor, if I knew how they were lost, we might not be here today."
1983.82-1186,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,170.655,174.487,The procedure you just described is permissible under the Warsaw Convention?
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,174.487,176.079,"Absolutely right, Your Honor."
1983.82-1186,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,583.976,590.331,Why should that be favored simply because the United States as a party litigant favors it?
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,590.331,596.045,"Your Honor, the United States is here amicus curiae."
1983.82-1186,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,614.876,619.439,Do any of those units of the government have the power to abrogate or modify treaties?
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,619.439,620.8,"--Yes, Your Honor, they do."
1983.82-1186,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.734,629.807,The executive by himself could modify this treaty?
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,629.807,630.708,To abrogate the treaty.
1983.82-1186,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,632.26,636.382,"Well, really, you are not contending it is no longer in force."
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,636.382,637.834,"No, Your Honor, I am not, but--"
1983.82-1186,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,637.834,639.013,You are arguing it is in force.
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,639.013,651.391,"--I am contending that for all practical purposes it has been abrogated, that the United States promised all of its treaty partners to enforce a certain limit and a floor, and that is not being done."
1983.82-1186,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,651.391,657.666,"Well, if it has been abrogated, what is the source of a limit of liability, any limit, now?"
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,660.728,661.118,Correct.
1983.82-1186,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,661.118,661.549,Well--
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,661.549,663.58,That's... yes.
1983.82-1186,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,664.371,667.894,--But you are referring to all these other branches of the United States government.
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,673.938,674.827,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1186,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,680.891,686.137,So why are the views of the Solicitor General any more persuasive than those of any other litigant?
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,686.137,702.336,"Because it seems to me that when this Court interprets a treaty, it is very helpful to understand how the government, which is more experienced in the delicate areas of foreign relations, views the treaty."
1983.82-1186,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,702.336,704.927,"Well, it isn't just their experience, is it?"
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,714.965,745.483,"Absolutely right, Your Honor, and as the government has said in its brief, several treaty partners have communicated their displeasure with the decision of the Second Circuit, and the United States informs this Court that our foreign relations with those countries in the aviation area will be seriously affected, and this is a way, Mr. Justice Stevens, that the United States can assist this Court, bringing this kind of information to it."
1983.82-1186,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,745.483,766.638,"I suppose, counsel, that even before the repeal of the Par Value Modification Act, the free market price of gold had fluctuated and might have been above that value, so people were well aware of that before the repeal, weren't they?"
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,766.638,767.549,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1186,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,773.552,781.367,And I guess no one then questioned whether it should be the official price that was followed under the Warsaw Convention.
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,781.367,784.149,"Not in the United States, Your Honor, because the law was very clear."
1983.82-1186,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,784.149,785.731,"Right, I am talking about this country."
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,785.731,791.234,"That the Civil Aeronautics Board had issued an order, and that order is still in effect."
1983.82-1186,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,798.748,809.566,"So, in the absence of any indication by Congress that it intended to alter the Warsaw Convention, there would be no reason to alter the formula that we follow, would there?"
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,809.566,810.826,--Precisely.
1983.82-1186,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,810.826,836.204,"Mr. Romans, is there any room here for an interpretation that the parties intended to take the dollar value of gold, which I gather is what you are suggesting, of the gold franc just before we went off the gold standard and inflating it by some appropriate index of inflation of the dollar since that time?"
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,836.204,838.124,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1186,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,840.385,844.529,"Well, wouldn't that come closer to effectuating the signatories in fact?"
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,844.529,850.764,"Well, actually, this question has been studied as late as 1975."
1983.82-1186,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,964.687,984.228,"Could TWA by contract, by its contract, given all the limitations of the treaty and the statutes, have provided that liability should not be beyond the declared value of the shipment?"
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,984.228,996.797,"No, Your Honor, because the Warsaw Convention includes in its provisions an Article 23, which says any agreement leading to a lower price is void."
1983.82-1186,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1003.853,1007.105,"Did you say what the declared value was here, or was there one?"
1983.82-1186,0,32609,john_n_romans,,1007.105,1008.315,There was no declared value.
1983.82-1186,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1070.264,1072.886,Very well.
1983.82-1186,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1081.163,1086.047,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-1186,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1408.147,1427.111,"Of course, Mr. Schwartz, there are cases under the law of contracts and contract remedies, aren't there, where the courts won't say that a particular contract is non-justiciable, but they will say that the contract is simply unenforceable, or that impossibility has arisen."
1983.82-1186,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1431.616,1458.353,"--Yes, but if I could pursue that analogy, we would simply submit that while an analogous factor might operate here, in fact it does not, because it was not impossible to give effect to this contract, and the events that intervened were not of a kind that in light of the purpose of the liability limitation should be regarded as requiring a regime of unbounded liability."
1983.82-1186,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1467.017,1468.289,"Mr. Schwartz, could I ask you one question?"
1983.82-1186,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1479.233,1497.346,--The government's view is that the $42.22 per troy ounce most closely approximates the intent of the framers of the Convention.
1983.82-1186,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1497.637,1497.977,I understand that.
1983.82-1186,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1499.069,1502.141,--I don't... I am about to acknowledge that.
1983.82-1186,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1508.704,1510.697,Do you prefer not to answer my question?
1983.82-1186,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1514.31,1519.151,--I don't really think I have an answer that would be useful.
1983.82-1186,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1526.104,1532.029,"I take it, though, you do not contend the position that you advocate most closely approximates the language of the agreement."
1983.82-1186,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1533.581,1554.255,"--I guess if forced to answer the question, I would contend that our alternative does, but the overriding government contention in this case is that that choice must be made whether it is perfect or not."
1983.82-1186,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1554.255,1557.216,But you would only refer to the plain language if forced to do so?
1983.82-1186,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1557.216,1562.829,"No, we would read the plain... we would read the language together with the history."
1983.82-1186,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1708.065,1711.986,Very well.
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,1713.218,1716.971,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1983.82-1186,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1853.878,1863.355,"Well, the treaty also expressly refers, does it not, to conversion to a national currency?"
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,1863.355,1864.407,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1186,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1864.407,1873.513,"And at the time the treaty was adopted, that was clearly thought in this country to refer to the official rate of gold, was it not?"
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,1873.513,1875.294,"Well, yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1186,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1877.244,1892.654,"You are just unhappy because the free market has changed so much and the Par Value Modification Act was repealed, but I don't see how that alters the intent of the drafters of the treaty at the time it was done."
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,1892.654,1904.673,"--Well, at the time that the treaty was drafted, Your Honor, there really wasn't a conflict between an official price and a free market price, because they were for all intents and purposes one and the same."
1983.82-1186,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1904.673,1918.991,"All right, but there certainly was, before the repeal of the Par Value Modification Act, there was quite a disparity, and nobody was objecting to the Warsaw Convention official rate price."
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,1918.991,1920.282,"Well, yes and no, Your Honor."
1983.82-1186,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1979.863,1989.958,Let me ask you why Franklin Mint didn't declare the value of these items--
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,1989.958,1990.729,"Well, two--"
1983.82-1186,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1990.729,1991.591,--when it shipped them.
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,1991.591,1993.781,"--Well, two points on that, Your Honor."
1983.82-1186,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2034.219,2038.604,A valuable cargo for which the Franklin Mint didn't want to pay anything but the base rate.
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2038.604,2051.701,"--Yes, Your Honor, and going back to Justice O'Connor's reason, the reason for that is that most at least sophisticated international shippers cover the problem by insurance."
1983.82-1186,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2054.243,2059.428,And I suppose... And Franklin got independent insurance coverage for these things?
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2059.428,2070.533,"There's no reason why they should pay an insurance premium and increased freight rate, when the increased freight rate is solely for the benefit of the insurance underwriter--"
1983.82-1186,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2070.533,2079.081,"--Well, if that is the case, why do you care, is it really a quarrel of the insurance carrier that is at issue here, wanting something back?"
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2079.081,2080.681,"Yes and no, Your Honor."
1983.82-1186,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2504.929,2513.642,"--Mr. Foster, before you leave that, under your proposal that they take the date of the... due date of delivery, what would the limit have been in this case?"
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2513.642,2523.6,"--In this particular case, Your Honor, as I recall, the limit would have been approximately around $80,000."
1983.82-1186,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2555.82,2560.873,Why is there that great difference between 67 and 200?
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2560.873,2577.585,"--Well, because, Your Honor, the Customs value was based on the sale by Franklin Mint Company in Pennsylvania to Franklin Mint, Limited, in England."
1983.82-1186,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2609.566,2616.701,"The cargo really had three different values, then, the real value, the Customs value, and the declared value of TWA."
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2616.701,2618.201,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1186,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2618.201,2629.007,"I am bothered by the way these different values are tossed around as though they are completely insignificant, that there is a virtue in inconsistency."
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2629.007,2630.419,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2793.246,2801.351,"Mr. Foster, you don't support the Second Circuit's conclusion that the convention is unenforceable for the future?"
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2801.351,2806.053,"Well, I think, Your Honor, that the best way of avoiding the whole problem--"
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2806.053,2807.184,"Well, do you support it?"
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2807.184,2811.787,"--Yes, Your Honor, although not as a first option."
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2811.787,2822.454,As I read your... you ask us to reverse and direct the entry of a judgment for the actual amount of Franklin Mint's damages.
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2822.454,2823.135,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2823.135,2827.597,Or alternatively to enter a judgment for Franklin Mint for the lower of the two amounts.
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2827.597,2828.158,Based on--
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2828.158,2830.159,How does that support--
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2830.159,2837.315,"--Well, Your Honor, it is based on Franklin Mint's preferred resolution of the problem--"
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2837.315,2841.356,"--I know, but that is by interpretation of the convention, isn't it?"
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2841.356,2842.207,"--Yes, Your Honor, taking--"
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2842.207,2845.41,"So you are not asking us to say, as the Second Circuit said--"
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2845.41,2846.161,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2846.161,2848.612,"--that the convention is unenforceable for the future, are you?"
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2848.612,2857.729,"--Well, if the Court is unable to take the free market value, then I think the only alternative is to adopt the Second Circuit's rationale."
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2857.729,2859.919,I don't reach your conclusion.
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2859.919,2870.507,"Well, the conclusion, Your Honor, is based on when the case is remanded to the District Court, there will be a trial or a finding on damages."
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2880.433,2885.057,"Well, you say, enter a judgment for the actual amount of Franklin Mint's damages."
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2886.036,2913.994,"Well, that's... I mean, the theoretical possibility that, say, Franklin Mint is bound by the amounts stated for Customs purposes, which could be lower than the amount of the limit using the free market value, but... in other words, if the free market value limit is $80,000, and Franklin Mint's damages are $67,000 because of the Customs value, then the Court would have to take the lower amount."
1983.82-1186,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2960.765,2975.536,"Mr. Foster, these arguments sound very much like arguments that might well be addressed to the Congress rather than the courts, and I wonder whether the Congress is presently considering any legislation to correct--"
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,2975.536,2987.282,"--Well, Your Honor, in March the Senate had before it the Montreal Protocols, and that set of protocols would do... would resolve the whole problem."
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3052.966,3071.257,"--Perhaps I don't understand you, Mr. Foster, but you just told me that if we don't adopt your suggestion of the free market value price of gold, that then we should, what, affirm the Court of Appeals?"
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,3072.477,3073.258,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3073.258,3075.97,"And affirm including the $42.22, whatever that price is?"
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,3075.97,3076.38,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3080.073,3080.723,"Well, I didn't think so."
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,3080.723,3082.886,--is that if--
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3082.886,3089.34,"Well, what are we going to replace that with, if we reject your free market value of gold?"
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,3089.34,3130.357,"--Then what the Court should do is say... and take it a step further than the Second Circuit did, that as of April 1st, 1978, given the changes in the nature of gold in our system, the Article 22 limit is unenforceable, and it is up to the other branches to resolve the problem, because the problem here is, if you take SDR's, if you take $42.22 an ounce, you are changing the basic nature of Article 22 from a gold clause into a currency clause, and that isn't interpretation."
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3137.641,3144.797,"So what you are saying is, that applies as much to the portion of the District Court judgment to fix $42.22 insofar as it did--"
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,3144.797,3146.115,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3146.115,3147.086,--as it does to the rest of it.
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,3147.086,3148.138,"Yes, Your Honor, because--"
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3148.138,3153.891,"And we should just say that this is something beyond judicial competence to handle, and--"
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,3153.891,3156.012,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3156.012,3157.332,--toss the whole problem to the Congress.
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,3157.332,3159.275,"It goes back to Baker v. Carr, Your Honor."
1983.82-1186,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3160.704,3161.536,Well--
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,3161.536,3168.631,"--In other words, is this an issue that has been delegated by the Constitution to the other branch?"
1983.82-1186,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3220.415,3221.066,"--May I ask you a question, Mr. Foster?"
1983.82-1186,2,30254,john_r_foster,,3238.617,3239.886,"Well, Your Honor, because--"
1983.82-1186,3,32609,john_n_romans,,3586.494,3588.056,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1186,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3640.57,3641.982,"Mr. Romans, may I ask you a question?"
1983.82-1186,3,32609,john_n_romans,,3641.982,3642.841,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1186,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3642.841,3649.797,"Supposing the treaty had been drafted in the plainest of language, which said, we want to use the price of gold."
1983.82-1186,3,32609,john_n_romans,,3663.217,3665.877,"Well, Your Honor, I contend that--"
1983.82-1186,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3665.877,3668.799,The language clearly picked gold.
1983.82-1186,3,32609,john_n_romans,,3672.66,3677.194,"--The language says gold, but... can I suggest that the language also says, to be converted into national currency."
1983.82-1186,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3677.194,3677.715,"Well, I understand."
1983.82-1186,3,32609,john_n_romans,,3680.397,3685.61,"But the words in the treaty, the words in that Article 22 say, to be converted into national currency."
1983.82-1186,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3685.61,3686.481,I understand that.
1983.82-1186,3,32609,john_n_romans,,3703.793,3706.423,"Your Honor, that would be a more difficult case, obviously."
1983.82-1186,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3706.774,3708.624,Nobody wants to answer my question.
1983.82-1186,3,32609,john_n_romans,,3708.624,3709.435,"However... no, no, no."
1983.82-1186,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3722.515,3723.284,"Well, but I have given you all the facts."
1983.82-1186,3,32609,john_n_romans,,3725.637,3726.797,--What would my argument be?
1983.82-1186,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3726.797,3730.2,What would our duty be on that hypothetical?
1983.82-1186,3,32609,john_n_romans,,3735.393,3735.914,All right.
1983.82-1186,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3790.787,3803.928,"Well, Mr. Romans, if for some reason the free market price of gold were the conversion factor, I suppose businessmen could protect themselves by buying gold futures or something of that sort."
1983.82-1186,3,32609,john_n_romans,,3803.928,3814.544,"Well, I suppose that everybody could become a very sophisticated person, and I suppose we would have to adopt these kinds of things, buy and sell gold futures."
1983.82-1186,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3853.411,3853.622,"Thank you, gentlemen."
