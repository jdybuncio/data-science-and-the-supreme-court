1975.75-292,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,43.557,"We will hear arguments next in number 75-292, the Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese against Milivojevich."
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,45.752,51.94,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-292,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,175.506,182.772,Can the -- is the Court free to disregard Church decisions about that initial question?
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,182.772,194.301,"It is not and that is included in the briefs that we have filed to which I will point, I hope during the course of my argument."
1975.75-292,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,298.138,301.826,"So only it may create Bishops, is it not correct?"
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,301.826,309.047,"And only it as Your Honor has stated, that is absolutely right, the only body in this Orthodox Church."
1975.75-292,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,356.794,361.892,"That is why this Respondent Diocesan Bishop became a Diocesan Bishop, was it not?"
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,361.892,367.753,"Precisely, if Your Honor pleases, that is exactly the way we have Diocesan Bishop."
1975.75-292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,404.384,409.257,Watson is not touching on the First Amendment at all?
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,409.257,413.058,You are correct that Watson did not refer to the First Amendment.
1975.75-292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,413.058,414.994,I thought you just said it did?
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,414.994,417.542,"If I said that, then I am sorry."
1975.75-292,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,519.087,520.715,So it is dictum?
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,520.715,522.624,It is dictum.
1975.75-292,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,534.558,544.596,Have you distinguished in any way between fraud and collusion on one hand and arbitrariness on the other as to the reach of judicial review?
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,544.596,549.665,"Yes, I would if your Honor pleases."
1975.75-292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,581.838,584.459,What if it were simply an allegation of fraud?
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,590.975,607.867,"The Court, in my judgment, if Your Honor pleases, would be entitled to sit and hear whether there had been fraud to the extent that the Church body was not sitting and exercising its rights and judgments as a church body."
1975.75-292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,611.934,614.426,But how do you apply that to a practical case?
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,633.634,638.035,"If Your Honor pleases, my answer to that is of quite affirmative no."
1975.75-292,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,668.55,682.866,"Really, truly under your understanding of that exception to the rule, fraud or collusion or arbitrariness, it is -- particularly fraud or collusion, it is difficult to imagine that case in the real word, is it not?"
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,682.866,698.449,"It is very difficult and I think that Your Honor, let us put the figure on it, it really never would occur and that is why I have trouble with that fraud, collusion and arbitrariness exception."
1975.75-292,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,719.546,736.903,"I suppose, would you think that if you could absolutely prove that the decision makers in the church have been bribed to reach the decision, they did and reached it for that reason that that would come within the exception?"
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,736.903,745.394,"I have to say on my own, I would find it very difficult not to say that there be some measure, possibly of relief."
1975.75-292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,806.494,815.323,I thought your client in its original complaint had requested some sort of an injunction against a bank where there was some money tied up?
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,815.323,819.312,"Well, Bishop Firmilian, as I recall the facts if Your Honor pleases."
1975.75-292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,860.702,862.462,So it is a form of property strictly?
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,862.462,864.956,"It is a form of property, yes."
1975.75-292,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,864.956,865.952,Mr. Jenner?
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,865.952,867.028,Yes sir?
1975.75-292,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,867.028,870.971,You talked a bit about what might happen if there were fraud.
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,899.275,907.477,I do not think they would come in the arbitrariness provision announced in the Gonzalez case.
1975.75-292,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,934.245,949.279,"My assumption was that it was perfectly clear that Church Law required a due process hearing, not the United States Constitution?"
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,949.279,949.696,I am sorry.
1975.75-292,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,949.696,966.428,"I suppose is that the College of Cardinals are the equivalent of Council of Bishops here, could say, that is very clear in the language of Church Law and we decided in this Court, in a case that that means no hearing at all and that would be the end of it?"
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,966.428,967.393,That is correct.
1975.75-292,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,967.393,974.178,Because they would have the exclusive power to decide what that meant and by their action they would have decided it?
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,974.178,989.147,That is precisely my position and I believe that is precisely the position this Court took in Watson versus Jones which it has been a great care to affirm very affirmatively every time this issue has come before this Court.
1975.75-292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,989.147,1003.967,"Well, but that really boils down to saying that your client, the diocese comes into Court and presents an injunction and the Circuit Judge of Lake County just has to sign it, no matter what sort of defense the party might raise."
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,1007.798,1030.858,"Only if, with what, this Clause Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the Civil Court inquires into whether or not the appropriate judicial authority in the tiers of hierarchy interpreted its Church Laws, that those Church regulations and matters of that character."
1975.75-292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1030.858,1031.296,What if that --
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,1031.296,1032.255,If it did.
1975.75-292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1032.255,1035.053,What if it is unclear though to the Court?
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,1041.559,1051.647,It is said in Watson v. Jones and other cases that Your Honors have decided that they generally are conflicting.
1975.75-292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1087.433,1095.402,What if there is a question under Church Law as to whether the Council of Bishops say that Traineo (ph) Convention had the authority to do this.
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,1099.86,1119.195,"No, all the Civil Court can do is to look to see if the judicial body, having the jurisdiction with respect to a particular matter of organization or a particular matter of jurisdiction has exercised that judgment."
1975.75-292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1119.195,1120.0,But how does it decide?
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,1120.0,1121.131,As to fraud.
1975.75-292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1121.131,1130.936,"How does it decide what judicial body has that jurisdiction, supposing there are two different judicial bodies in the church?"
1975.75-292,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,1130.936,1142.795,"Mr. Justice, the reason I am thinking here is, there are different judicial bodies in this Church, but they are in tiers."
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,1708.004,1714.302,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the members of the Court.
1975.75-292,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1989.885,2003.267,"Of course when you say that the diocese had the choice of keeping its own property, I suppose Mr. Jennerâ€™s argument is that whether or not that was the diocese's own property, it is something that has to be decided by the Church Courts?"
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2003.267,2017.32,"No sir, the Constitution of the American-Canadian Diocese makes it quite explicit and quite clear that the diocese owns, I may not be able to quote it accurately, owns its own property and it is without rights of anyone else in it and --"
1975.75-292,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2017.32,2029.505,"Are you contending that the American-Canadian diocese is a separate juridical entity, not just a branch of the Serbian Orthodox Church?"
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2029.505,2031.856,The answer to your question is yes sir.
1975.75-292,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2044.499,2051.027,"Mr. Sullivan, I am looking at page 25 at the Illinois Supreme Court opinion, I mean appendix 25."
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2051.027,2052.007,Yes sir.
1975.75-292,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2052.007,2061.466,The Plaintiffs argue and defendant does not dispute that the Serbian Orthodox Church is a hierarchical and Episcopal Church.
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2077.427,2080.283,"I do disagree with all of it sir, but I --"
1975.75-292,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2080.283,2082.992,(Inaudible) Do we not have to take it as --
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2082.992,2090.029,"Well, let me address myself to the hierarchical aspects."
1975.75-292,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2090.029,2094.788,It goes on to say all parties maintain at the sole limitation on this rule.
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2103.126,2104.379,In agreement with that completely sir.
1975.75-292,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2104.379,2105.256,I know.
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2105.256,2105.873,Okay.
1975.75-292,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2113.713,2119.326,You got to the argument so far that this is not a case involving an hierarchical church?
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2119.326,2125.49,Oh! Who was it Mr. Justice Holmes who said a word is --
1975.75-292,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2125.49,2126.693,"(Inaudible) living thought, I know."
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2126.693,2128.735,Yes (Voice Overlap) living right.
1975.75-292,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2130.493,2133.423,So it is a little bit like the difference between the corporation and the partnership.
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2137.009,2145.089,"Well, it is a world of theology and it is from a different discipline than ours and our discipline is jurisprudence."
1975.75-292,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2158.287,2163.039,Can the Midwest Group appoint its own bishops?
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2163.039,2170.325,"It could not before May 10, 1963 when then, prior to the date that they attempted to divide this."
1975.75-292,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2195.19,2198.111,What are the bishops currently?
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2200.241,2202.564,To the American Canadian Diocese?
1975.75-292,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2215.446,2227.576,"Suppose you are right in that the Illinois Supreme Court is right, who will appoint the successor of the respondent Bishop here?"
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2227.576,2232.53,That will be up to the members of the Church National Assembly or Sabors.
1975.75-292,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2240.236,2244.208,But without reference to the assembly of Bishops in Belgrade?
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2244.208,2247.438,"I think they could choose, if they want it, they could choose a Serbian Bishop."
1975.75-292,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2271.609,2282.069,"But have any bishops been appointed in these three categories now, these three geographical areas other than Belgrade authority?"
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2282.069,2284.985,"In the three new dioceses, Your Honor?"
1975.75-292,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2293.944,2298.079,My question is who has been appointing the bishops lately?
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2298.079,2304.412,"To the three diocese represented by Mr. Jenner, the Holy Assembly of Bishops of Belgrade, Yugoslavia."
1975.75-292,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2304.412,2309.04,"That sounds something like hierarchical, does it not?"
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2309.04,2309.573,Yes sir.
1975.75-292,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2394.249,2398.534,What you are saying -- it sounds like you are saying one or two things.
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2404.879,2405.812,Article --
1975.75-292,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2405.812,2409.225,That may be one of your arguments.
1975.75-292,1,35131,leo_j_sullivan_iii,,2414.568,2418.238,"No sir, I hope I am not misleading you."
1975.75-292,2,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,3381.383,3384.146,"Thank you, if your Honors please."
1975.75-292,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3711.433,3714.395,The case is submitted.
