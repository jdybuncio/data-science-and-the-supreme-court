1966.4,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,40.699,"Number 4, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation versus El Paso Natural Gas Company, et al., Number 5, People of the State of California, appellant versus El Paso Natural Gas Company, et al., and Number 24, Southern Pacific -- Southern California Edison Company, appellant versus El Paso Natural Gas Company."
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,42.334,42.975,Yes.
1966.4,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,215.653,218.476,"Mr. Bennett, what we have is a consent type --"
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,218.476,219.318,"Pardon, Your Honor?"
1966.4,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,219.318,222.053,Is the decree below entered by consent?
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,222.053,234.971,"There was a stipulation between the United States of America and El Paso that a decree for the divestiture would be filed, the party will have 30 days to object and it would be signed and that is what was done."
1966.4,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,252.185,256.937,"Well, does that -- does that have any relevance to your position here?"
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,256.937,259.303,"Yes, it does in this sense."
1966.4,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,298.615,302.288,But this is the -- this litigation was brought by the United States?
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,302.288,303.735,"Yes, it was."
1966.4,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,303.735,309.372,And it has expressed to tell for entering or by consenting to this form of --
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,309.372,309.668,"Yes, it is."
1966.4,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,309.668,314.373,-- that satisfied that this is the disposition of any inputs that it had?
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,314.373,318.704,"Well, at purports to say it's satisfied and that it meets the mandate of this Court."
1966.4,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,329.851,335.442,"Of course, the United States in fact there are last position had decided to give up the whole litigation."
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,342.771,345.16,He may not go back to the District Court to have the --
1966.4,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,345.16,347.746,It dismissed the proceeding?
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,347.746,349.607,"No, you had given a mandate."
1966.4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,378.806,383.329,"Of course, in the du Pont case, United States is not satisfied with what they're doing there."
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,383.329,384.256,That is correct.
1966.4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,384.256,386.296,I'm just wondering.
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,395.946,402.978,I think they could attempt to give up the whole litigation or I think they could attempt to give away the victory which in our judgment they did here.
1966.4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,420.471,424.019,"Now, are you -- are you in the case of intervenor?"
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,424.019,433.452,I'm in the case as a would be intervenor who was denied and I have appealed from the order of Judge Ritter denying intervention on behalf of the State of California.
1966.4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,433.452,437.927,Don't we have to cite that question before we reach the question you now argue?
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,437.927,439.547,"That is whether or not, we're entitled to everything --"
1966.4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,439.547,446.232,Whether or not entitled to become a party of this lawsuit so that it is not entirely the Government could control.
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,446.232,456.171,"Well, if you read the General Motors case, you will find there that they -- that you cited the Continental case which point out that when you give a mandate."
1966.4,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,478.293,486.128,But your -- you got to show surely first that the -- your denial of intervention was error on the part of the Court.
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,504.519,505.659,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1966.4,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,514.121,519.27,So why don't you address yourself to the intervention question for this?
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,519.27,523.91,"Well, aside from the history of it, Your Honors."
1966.4,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,577.025,579.474,"Well, the Government didn't withdraw from case."
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,591.566,597.981,I don't think we have to use words such as bad faith or malfeasance or neglect of duty.
1966.4,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,710.315,713.656,"Is that what you say, gives you a right to intervene?"
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,713.656,726.37,"Yes, because the Government failed to follow what your mandate which made their -- the result inadequate because of the inadequate insistence upon a decree meeting your mandate."
1966.4,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,750.53,757.625,We'll recess now.
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,757.625,760.182,"Your Honors, in the approximately four minutes remaining."
1966.4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,852.542,856.301,(Inaudible)
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,856.301,865.14,The Attorney General of the California has authorized me to come back and represent the State of California and he's paying for my travel expenses.
1966.4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,883.944,885.733,(Inaudible)
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,885.733,892.291,I appear on behalf of the State of California pursuant to the authority of Attorney General of the State of California.
1966.4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,907.431,909.963,(Inaudible)
1966.4,0,44028,william_m_bennett,,909.963,915.711,"Well, I presume I can get back by Greyhound bus if no other way."
1966.4,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1162.057,1168.894,Mr. Woodbury.
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1168.894,1176.371,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1484.536,1487.273,"Mr. Woodbury, are you going to argue the intervention to us?"
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1487.273,1490.043,I'll be happy to direct my -- to state my position Mr. Justice --
1966.4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1490.043,1494.089,I'm just wondering if you don't have to resolve that before we get to the merits of --
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1494.089,1497.046,"I don't believe we do, Your Honor, and let me state why."
1966.4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1516.37,1519.056,"Well, that's an argument that you're entitle of right --"
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1519.056,1519.968,Yes.
1966.4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1520.257,1521.381,Not discretionary interventions --
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1521.381,1521.761,"Yes, sir."
1966.4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1521.761,1522.568,-- as you see it.
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1522.568,1523.603,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1966.4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1543.755,1545.278,Were you in the original case?
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1545.278,1545.667,Sir?
1966.4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1545.667,1547.296,Are you in the original case?
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1547.296,1547.738,"No, sir."
1966.4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1576.748,1587.145,"Well, may I ask Mr. Woodbury, am I right, the question of adequacy of representation goes to discretionary intervention does it rather than to universal division of rights?"
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1587.145,1590.069,"I believe it was my recollection, Your Honor, that it went to both."
1966.4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1590.069,1591.219,"When it goes both, I see."
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1591.219,1592.463,"Yes, sir."
1966.4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1676.614,1681.448,"Let -- let's assume as I suggest to Mr. Bennett, they stipulate for the dismissal of the litigation."
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1681.448,1683.671,I do not believe they could have do that Mr. Justice Brennan.
1966.4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1683.671,1684.196,Why?
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1684.196,1688.271,Because the mandate of this Court would then clearly be frustrate.
1966.4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1691.686,1699.061,"But for example, we may decide, issues here which nevertheless result in a settlement between the parties on a different basis."
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1699.061,1707.291,"Well, in the antitrust field Your Honor and in view of the responsibilities which this Court refers to quite at length in du Pont."
1966.4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1714.879,1721.641,But there of course the Government was still insisting that there was a public interest of require indication.
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1721.641,1722.296,Precisely.
1966.4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1750.123,1751.375,I guess I put it there.
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1751.375,1755.699,"Well, I'm glad you did Your Honor because I think it is significant."
1966.4,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1810.748,1815.041,I wonder how you get to this Court to make that argument unless you (Inaudible)?
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1815.041,1816.763,"Well, Your Honor --"
1966.4,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1816.763,1818.654,You were not in the original case as I recall --
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1818.654,1819.675,"No, sir."
1966.4,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1820.27,1823.76,I guess even California would go to amicus in the original case.
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1823.76,1826.265,"I -- I think that's right, Your Honor."
1966.4,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1881.179,1889.036,Unless there is some intervention here this decree will -- is unreviewable.
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1889.036,1889.733,"Yes, sir."
1966.4,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1914.236,1917.221,But we say -- what was the language we use in the mandate?
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1918.033,1920.358,Ordered you divestiture without delay.
1966.4,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1920.358,1921.933,Without delay.
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1921.933,1922.36,"Yes, sir."
1966.4,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1922.36,1924.121,And how much delay has there been?
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1924.121,1931.054,"Well that was in 1964, of course this case started as Mr. Bennett pointed out about 10 years ago."
1966.4,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1932.598,1934.151,Our mandate was dated 1964?
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,1934.151,1934.761,1964.
1966.4,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2016.228,2018.483,Can you claim that you have the right to litigate?
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,2018.483,2018.986,Sir?
1966.4,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2018.986,2025.501,Can you claim that you have the right to litigate (Inaudible)?
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,2025.501,2038.218,"Well grant -- if we were permitted intervention Your Honor, we would claim that we would have a right to litigate the propriety of requiring as the Government contended all through the divestiture hearings."
1966.4,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2052.312,2060.659,Do you claim the right to litigate to decide whether the decree would be (Inaudible)?
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,2060.659,2061.357,Conform to the --
1966.4,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2061.357,2062.339,(Inaudible)
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,2062.339,2064.67,Conforms to the mandate of this Court.
1966.4,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2064.67,2078.69,"Suppose, they just inform the mandate of the court with no right to litigate at all, (Inaudible) position to stay in, a reason of the Government to stand its position?"
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,2078.69,2097.38,"Well, I would think Your Honor, if we're permitted to intervene that the -- that we would to be permitted to litigate all of the questions and issues involved in reestablishing a new company that was as strong as and able to compete for the California market as was the old company."
1966.4,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2099.397,2115.819,"Well, then (Inaudible) would then indicate to the Government's position to litigate the (Inaudible)."
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,2121.158,2123.581,"Well I would think, we would have the right to litigate --"
1966.4,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2123.581,2134.233,Do you claim that this decree has to be followed by (Inaudible)?
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,2134.233,2135.992,I would think so.
1966.4,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2135.992,2137.999,No chance to change it?
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,2137.999,2139.336,"Well, I claim."
1966.4,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2168.494,2172.631,But the divestiture must be out at all means?
1966.4,1,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,2172.631,2176.726,I think so until this Court's mandate would change.
1966.4,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2269.0,2271.541,Mr. Hooper.
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2271.541,2276.796,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1966.4,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2525.489,2526.351,You -- I'm sorry about that.
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2526.351,2549.604,"Now, whether to answer to this is to be arrived at by allowing interested parties to intervene and present critical evidence concerning the various provisions of this decree or whether it is to be decided by the exercise of the plenary power of this Court."
1966.4,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2580.41,2596.329,"Physically, I have with that statement if what's involved in this appeal is simply this that your appeal, unless I'm mistaken tell me if I am as well as the other two appeals, are appeals from denials and motions to intervene."
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2605.15,2606.533,That may it please --
1966.4,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2606.533,2624.633,"-- which involves to subsections about (a) whether or not you had a right to intervene and if not, (b) whether you had a --the Court had discretion to allow to intervene in subsection 1 under (b), whether or not if so he had used that discretion."
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2630.237,2631.923,Yes.
1966.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2705.995,2711.855,But may I ask I have Chief Justice Taft's opinion in the Continental case.
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2779.452,2782.378,"That's exactly the way we read it, Your Honor."
1966.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2782.378,2784.745,But I might correct this for the facts of Continental?
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2784.745,2785.254,Yes.
1966.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2785.254,2785.427,And of course --
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2785.427,2792.0,And that the party appealing in that case was an intervenor --
1966.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2792.0,2793.666,It has been in the District Courts.
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2793.666,2794.583,Yes.
1966.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2794.583,2803.051,"And the course in du Pont, the United States is the (Voice Overlap) brought the decree back here, wasn't it?"
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2821.137,2821.858,"We feel it does, Your Honor."
1966.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2821.858,2822.481,You think it does.
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2822.481,2832.833,We feel that Mr. -- that Mr. Justice Taft's opinion in that case really throws in almost as an afterthought.
1966.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2847.632,2872.457,"Well, I may ask this if you're right about this, does it follow that any citizen of the United States unhappy with this decree's post Cascade and California and Edison were content but some citizen of California was upset about it, that he come up here and has this thing to say that the District Court have not complied with our mandate?"
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2872.457,2877.354,"I think that to answer that question, we must consider the context of this case."
1966.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2893.931,2895.44,"Well, let me put it this way."
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2920.317,2940.113,I think that might be disposed of Your Honor by this Court's refusal to note probable jurisdiction in the event of a denial of intervention to such a party and subsequent appeal to this Court.
1966.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2950.407,2954.24,On what question?
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2954.24,2954.455,If --
1966.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2954.455,2955.31,If he illustrate --
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2955.31,2955.959,-- on the question of that --
1966.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2955.959,2959.185,--from a denial of motion to intervene.
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2959.185,2960.066,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2980.162,2982.133,"But at the very least, if we agree with you."
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2986.046,2987.771,But you are not going beyond --
1966.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2987.771,2988.616,"Now, we are going beyond --"
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2988.616,2990.718,-- the decisions require not in this Court.
1966.4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2990.718,2994.353,"-- the situations in Continental certainly, aren't we?"
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,2994.353,2998.903,We think this case cries out for such action.
1966.4,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2998.903,3008.865,"You would read the Chief Justice Taft's, if you would expand Chief Justice Taft's word without properly brought before this Court to properly or improperly, is that right?"
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,3008.865,3010.057,"No, sir."
1966.4,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3010.057,3018.992,And it isn't a question here from -- isn't the decisions from which you have an appeal here which is before us for argument today.
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,3024.015,3025.553,That is one of the two questions.
1966.4,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3025.553,3031.025,I thought that was the only order from which an appeal have been taken?
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,3031.025,3032.513,Yes.
1966.4,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3065.453,3083.936,"I thought that the point in Continental was sort of the Court there without dealing with the person who -- parties who had intervened, not merely those who had tried to intervene tell itself not bound by the bare assignments of error, is that right?"
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,3095.406,3101.528,I -- I believe that is an element in the case but I think that supports our position.
1966.4,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3101.528,3102.581,That's what I thought here.
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,3102.581,3123.716,Once this case is before the Court on this type and my new -- we restrict our proposition to this type of case where there is a prior order of divestiture and the question is as the mandate of this Court improperly carried out.
1966.4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3153.548,3161.321,I take it you make this argument if instead of noting the problem with jurisdiction we have postponed?
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,3170.789,3171.097,"No, sir."
1966.4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.848,3180.26,As long as we -- said we'll hear you one of that --
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,3180.26,3180.345,"Yes, sir."
1966.4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3180.345,3181.684,--to answer that.
1966.4,2,39523,richard_b_hooper,,3181.684,3183.387,That -- that's our position.
1966.4,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3288.856,3290.586,Mr. Sabin.
1966.4,3,40566,richard_w_sabin,,3290.586,3293.583,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.4,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3312.116,3313.882,Would you speak a little louder please.
1966.4,3,40566,richard_w_sabin,,3313.882,3314.456,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3864.724,3869.696,"What happens to this $45 million, would you suggest if you did follow?"
1966.4,3,40566,richard_w_sabin,,3869.696,3871.582,If you follow the plan I'm advocating.
1966.4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3871.582,3873.008,Yes.
1966.4,3,40566,richard_w_sabin,,3873.008,3879.593,In effect would depend upon the manner of sale of the assets.
1966.4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3920.504,3922.56,If it's some benefits found?
1966.4,3,40566,richard_w_sabin,,3922.56,3926.5,It's an indirect benefit but there is one.
1966.4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3926.5,3927.731,What is it?
1966.4,3,40566,richard_w_sabin,,3927.731,3934.034,"Well, you have a financially strong pipeline company as the immediate benefit."
1966.4,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3949.793,3954.806,Mr. Friedman.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3954.806,3958.446,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.4,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3980.433,3996.902,"Further -- further question if we read Continental correctly, if I read Continental correctly that if the case is here, as it is apparently is as we noted jurisdiction of whether the Court on this motion couldn't consider these matters."
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3996.902,4002.391,"Mr. Justice, I would like to suggest that the Continental situation, we think was a very different question."
1966.4,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4006.057,4009.765,Is there any question of what this case is properly here whatever is here?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4009.765,4012.268,"Well, I would suggest -- yes, Mr. Justice."
1966.4,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4021.458,4024.899,But the case is that -- the case is properly here to consider that question --
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4024.899,4026.778,"The case is properly here to consider the questions, we think --"
1966.4,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4026.778,4030.6,Or another case being properly here doesn't Continental --
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4030.6,4032.733,I -- I don't think so Mr. Justice.
1966.4,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4047.024,4050.265,But what's the question here whether if there's --
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4050.265,4052.239,"Well, I would -- well, I would disagree Mr. Justice."
1966.4,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4052.375,4054.836,It depends what case you're talking about here.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4054.836,4067.209,"Yes, if it seems that this is as charged Mr. Justice, if intervention was properly denied in this case, if these appellants were properly told, they had no interest and we're not in this case."
1966.4,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4070.181,4079.248,"But if we reach that point first that if since the thing is here for the -- for adjudication, I read the Continental as meaning that we could under our own motion?"
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4079.248,4082.17,"Well, I don't think so Mr. Justice because I think there's no case --"
1966.4,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4082.17,4084.765,"Well, maybe we should on own our motion then?"
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4084.765,4084.949,"Well, I --"
1966.4,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4084.949,4086.16,But they have new precedent?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4086.16,4096.582,I would think not Mr. Justice because it seems to me as far as the parties to this case are concerned and the only parties thus far the United States in El Paso.
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4099.59,4108.29,"But suppose Mr. Friedman, we take your view that we have to first to decide that they should whether they should been allowed to intervene."
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4112.357,4113.194,Yes.
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4113.194,4115.576,"Now, then what's the answer to Mr. Justice Douglas' question?"
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4115.576,4116.269,"Well, I would --"
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4116.269,4126.77,"Now, if we decide that it should have intervened, may we then under the Continental in our motion to say, well, the Government had no right in light of our mandate makes the deal it did."
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4126.77,4130.376,I -- I would think as a matter of power the Court would have that power.
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4146.618,4150.41,You know -- any question of intervention raised in the Continental principle?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4150.41,4151.669,I don't know --
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4151.669,4152.51,If I read the opinion.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4153.086,4153.925,It's a very --
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4153.925,4154.651,-- whether they were --
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4154.651,4156.002,It's a very cryptic question.
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4213.21,4215.109,"May I contest -- well, excuse me Mr. Friedman."
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4215.109,4215.562,Yes.
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4215.562,4223.0,"If -- if that so, there's somebody -- if we decide somebody should have been allowed in and we may do then as you said as a matter of power."
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4246.409,4248.198,"No, no, no Mr. Justice."
1966.4,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4249.023,4250.256,I didn't think it was.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4250.256,4252.501,"No, no, we said they had --"
1966.4,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4252.501,4253.8,You would want me to read it that way.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4253.8,4268.618,"No, all we were attempting to do was to contrast that the position of California in the state and consulting California Edison which would have been standing to maintain a treble-damage suit with the standing of Cascade that we don't believe would have such thing."
1966.4,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4559.648,4564.777,You mean you think pertaining there in the amendment relates to pending --
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4564.777,4567.14,To the pending proceedings.
1966.4,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4567.14,4569.152,Where do the case may be after that?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4569.152,4578.801,"Yes, I think -- and Mr. Justice I also point out that this Court of course is reviewing the propriety of the ruling of the District Court denying intervention."
1966.4,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4587.966,4593.843,You don't imply a concession with the amended rule applied when the District Court was on?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4593.843,4614.559,"Oh no Mr. Justice, that's about I'm coming to that because that's my very next point that even assuming the amended rule does apply intervention with nevertheless correctly denied because as I have mentioned under the amended rule they have to show that their interest was not adequately represented by the existing parties."
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4648.29,4650.701,Suppose it was not?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4650.701,4652.206,If it were not Mr. Justice?
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4652.206,4653.025,Yes.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4653.025,4660.457,"Well, if it were not if the representation was not adequate then we would say they have made a case for intervention that's what the rule says."
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4660.457,4672.646,"Well, what if they had not make the case also if the case is here but assume that the court's decision is suppose to be obeyed and it is also limited."
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4680.443,4689.443,"Well, I think Mr. Justice -- well first let me just say that as I'll come to a moment, we don't think that they have shown that this is inadequate representation in fact --"
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4689.443,4693.41,And I suppose to -- you wanted to dispose of before you have (Inaudible)?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4693.41,4694.936,But that -- that's correct Mr. Justice.
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4714.104,4718.019,Suppose it were not to be obtained until -- for someone else?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4743.975,4752.797,"Well I think, Mr. Justice, the answer is that under our adversary system of litigation the basic control of litigation is with the parties."
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4758.93,4774.626,You would say that goes to the extent that the court is without power even when it's brought (Inaudible) because without the power they let it on decree to (Inaudible) of the party?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4774.626,4778.687,"Well, to be -- there's no controversy between the parties anymore Mr. Justice."
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4778.687,4783.666,So I would -- And I think the controversies he knows what it is but call somebody else.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4783.666,4783.989,"Well, I --"
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4783.989,4787.837,I find it investigated in the -- but failure to carry out the proceeding.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4787.837,4808.867,"I -- I don't think with all due respect, Mr. Justice that, under our system if the party set it's controversy there's any way that the third party who was entered thereby can challenge that except by doing one of two things either becoming a party to the case and appealing it or bringing his own lawsuit."
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4819.12,4828.478,What if he arose the confusion of rolling evidence if the court will take to protect its own decree.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4840.171,4856.569,"Well, I think Mr. Justice when you say properly before the Court, I think for him to be here properly before this Court so that this Court can re-examine the question of compliance that that requires that somehow he'd be in the case properly and we think these people --"
1966.4,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4856.569,4864.621,"Well that goes so far I gather, Mr. Friedman, that it does that in this litigation after your victory here you could have dismissed the whole lawsuit."
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4864.621,4867.07,"Well, I would suppose, I don't think we would have done it Mr. Justice --"
1966.4,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4867.07,4877.264,I'm not suggesting it I'm – doesn't your argument goes so far as to say even though you're here and of course that's the only reason that you bring the lawsuit is in the public interest.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4884.326,4890.211,I would suppose if for whatever reasons we conclude it was in the public interest we would have the power to do that.
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4890.211,4894.085,Where does the question finally comes back.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4894.085,4895.658,"Sorry, I don't understand your question Mr. Justice."
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4895.658,4899.125,When will this question finally end?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4923.586,4933.615,And our answer to that Mr. Justice is that under our system they cannot be heard to complain that the Government is settling a case has thrown away the public interest.
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4933.615,4947.141,(Voice Overlap) right to complain in this Court give us all from us were saying something -- something even though they may not witness.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4947.141,4968.186,"Well, I -- with all due respect Mr. Justice, I don't think so -- I don't think this Court unless these people were properly parties in this case unless they were entitled to get into this case when the Court speaks of a case being properly here, I think that's what it means."
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4974.451,4984.008,As long as that as their statement down the shadow was absolutely true opposite and this Court concede that the decree in its order to be taken out.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4988.141,4988.799,"Well, Mr. Justice --"
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4988.799,4990.164,This Government had an end?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4990.164,5004.567,"Let me say Mr. Justice in dealing with the question, it seems to me in that case if there was a claim of bad faith, malfeasance, nonfeasance, it seems to me they would then make out a claim for intervention."
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5009.956,5019.161,"-- big brother doing bad faith, I'd have been adjudicated by this Court."
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5020.691,5035.961,I -- I think Mr. Justice with all due respect it does make a great deal of difference whether the claim is that the Government is acting in bad faith or the claim is only that the Attorney General made a mistake in settling the case on a particular term.
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5065.771,5070.353,"Well, what if now they stated to form a unit?"
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5070.353,5080.063,I think it's a failure to perform a duty in this sense that the Government had failed to take into consideration certain things.
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5086.828,5091.885,Didn't you say all -- do you say give that to public as it have been adjudicated by this Court.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5091.885,5093.673,"Well, we denied that of course Mr. --"
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5093.673,5094.996,Why did you deny it?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5097.944,5109.446,"Well, we say we don't want to -- as you said we don't want to get to that point because we think they haven't made a sufficient showing on the basis of their claim to entitle them to intervene."
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5126.091,5128.193,If you said it would have given up divestiture.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5128.193,5131.209,"We have not given up divestiture, Mr. Justice Black."
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5131.333,5132.801,Even on all (Inaudible)?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5132.801,5133.1,No.
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5196.977,5204.177,"Well Mr. Friedman, if there've been divestiture that the du Pont sends, there's not been that here does it?"
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5204.177,5205.587,There will be ultimately.
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5205.587,5206.518,Well --
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5206.518,5207.379,There will be ultimately.
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5207.788,5213.883,"Well, I don't know enough for the record but I thought Mr. Bennett told us that they can't be ultimately."
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5220.93,5226.464,These are just a couple of quotations I think that he was referring from the District Court there is complete divestiture.
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5227.698,5232.156,But why is this -- why isn't this complete as it was in the du Pont sense?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5232.156,5233.324,"I believe, I think it is Mr. Justice."
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5233.324,5234.142,"Oh, you do think of it?"
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5234.142,5234.894,We think it is.
1966.4,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5387.468,5412.196,"What is your answer to the argument to the commissioner that these two companies, El Paso and the new company are not going to relate the adversary relationship and if they are creating a new company in a way that will not afford the benefits to these intervenors?"
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5412.196,5412.55,"Well, I --"
1966.4,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5412.55,5417.76,But they are entitled to under the decree as we rendered.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5417.76,5420.878,I have three answers to that if I may Mr. Chief Justice.
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5499.725,5507.207,There's something you said about the El Paso financing on these operations at this time. How about that?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5507.207,5519.174,"Well, I -- obviously, since the new company is not going to have any assets to speak of until it's divestiture El Paso will have to finance the preparation of the certificate application in some."
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5552.721,5560.297,Rather it -- but El Paso has enough reserves that what the new companies will gather inadequate that is El Paso required to provide?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5560.297,5561.831,"No, Mr. Justice, El Paso --"
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5561.831,5563.164,Well then what happen?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5563.164,5563.79,Well then I --
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5563.79,5567.041,Suppose the Commission decides finally that the inadequate.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5567.041,5572.878,The -- it would then -- the burden will then be upon the new company to get some additional reserves.
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5576.402,5587.596,But is there something -- did you say there's something about these reserves which El Paso applied by reason of its acquisition of the companies?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5587.596,5588.712,New Companies?
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5588.712,5589.84,Yes.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5589.84,5598.164,"All the reserves, all the reserves that El Paso acquired as a result of the merger are being turned back."
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5607.705,5608.791,Acquired after the acquisition?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5608.791,5610.187,After the acquisition.
1966.4,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5635.179,5646.387,"Well, it's a suggestion that if the acquisition had not occurred, the reserves to El Paso since acquired might have been acquired by the acquired company?"
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5646.387,5647.997,That is the claim Mr. Justice.
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5739.537,5749.828,I was wondering when did the Government change its position as to the advocacy of the divestiture and why?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5749.828,5774.864,"Well, we changed it Mr. Justice, all I can tell you is this, we changed it some time between the 23rd of February 1965 which is one of the proceedings we closed in District Court and the 24th of March, I'm sorry, the 24th of May roughly three months later when we filed this stipulation."
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5863.289,5865.231,Complete separation you say?
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5865.231,5869.716,"Complete separation, that is the separation of the stock interest of the two companies."
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5869.716,5874.571,"Well at that time they have made a stipulation that it has already been decreed by this Court, hasn't it?"
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5874.571,5884.764,"No, no, not the stock separation Mr. Justice, the question, this Court has decreed that there was to be divestiture by El Paso of Pacific Northwest."
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5885.44,5886.236,"Immediately, without delay?"
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5886.236,5887.843,"That's correct, without delay."
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6017.79,6020.334,This is not a settlement of an antitrust case.
1966.4,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6020.334,6020.915,This is a not a --
1966.4,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6020.915,6029.813,This is a settlement where that one side charges that the other is not trying to bring about a complete division to this court order.
1966.4,5,25504,gregory_a_harrison,,6873.867,6877.634,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.4,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7064.973,7069.734,"Mr. Harrison, I don't think any question of good faith has been raised here at all."
1966.4,5,25504,gregory_a_harrison,,7069.734,7071.434,"Very well, Your Honor."
1966.4,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7418.314,7426.63,"Mr. Harrison, by opposing do you refer to that $45 million that the Attorney General's argument is talking about?"
1966.4,5,25504,gregory_a_harrison,,7429.369,7434.896,"Well, the fact of the matter is that the West Coast Transmission stock was acquired from Pacific Southwest."
1966.4,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7434.896,7435.212,Yes.
1966.4,5,25504,gregory_a_harrison,,7435.212,7437.196,It is ordered to be divested.
1966.4,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7445.019,7449.454,What then does the $45 million item that --
1966.4,5,25504,gregory_a_harrison,,7449.454,7450.084,May it please the Court.
1966.4,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7619.521,7621.156,There is some time left.
1966.4,6,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,7622.622,7623.576,"In fact, I will, Your Honor."
1966.4,6,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7623.576,7630.738,You may Mr. Woodbury.
1966.4,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7630.738,7639.614,"Mr. Woodbury are you going to tell us what was divested, I'm hearing a lot of things that are being divested, now what's left for El Paso?"
1966.4,6,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,7639.614,7642.935,If Your Honor please.
1966.4,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7705.93,7711.622,Permitted by present demand as today's demand that the Congress to this reports?
1966.4,6,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,7714.239,7716.019,It is a relative concept yes.
1966.4,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7716.019,7717.953,That is as of today?
1966.4,6,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,7719.548,7733.49,"At that time, at that time, the Pacific Northwest Pipeline had 1.95 times the reserves in San Juan that it had in Canada."
1966.4,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7780.985,7785.43,You said there had 1.95 times the Canadian reserve at the time of merger.
1966.4,6,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,7785.43,7787.447,In the San Juan Basin alone.
1966.4,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7787.447,7788.866,Right in the San Juan Basin.
1966.4,6,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,7788.866,7789.305,Yes.
1966.4,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7789.305,7791.949,"Now, this present plan leaves them what?"
1966.4,6,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,7791.949,7810.618,"It leaves them with roughly one-third in the from Canada, one-third from San Juan, and one-third from the rocky mountain area based upon the figures which El Paso submitted in the District Court hearing."
1966.4,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7810.618,7816.171,But this one third is relative to the increase demand for gas?
1966.4,6,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,7816.171,7819.228,It -- it's a relative manner.
1966.4,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7869.205,7875.34,To put Pacific Northwest where it would be today if the merger had never happened in terms of reserves.
1966.4,6,40789,rollin_e_woodbury,,7877.245,7878.992,That is our position.
1966.4,6,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7972.989,7974.995,We'll adjourn.
