1997.96-8422,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.257,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-8422, Sillasse Bryan v. United States."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,9.858,11.06,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-8422,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,24.856,27.178,"Mr. Adler, our acoustics are very good here."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,30.18,31.021,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-8422,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,54.637,66.945,"Mr. Adler, do you take the position that, in order to act wilfully within the meaning of this particular statute, that the defendant has to have knowledge of the specific statutory provision?"
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,66.945,67.914,"--No, Your Honor."
1997.96-8422,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,79.905,86.878,"Well, you urge, then, that the defendant has to know there is a Federal licensing requirement for gun dealers?"
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,86.878,102.169,"--Yes, Your Honor, knowledge or suspicion of the existence of a State licensing requirement, municipal ordinance or the like, will not suffice under respect for federalism this statute penalizes, as only it can, a violation of a Federal licensing requirement, and--"
1997.96-8422,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,102.169,106.819,"It isn't enough for him to know he can't sell firearms with out a license, generally?"
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,110.092,111.274,--That is what Congress wrote.
1997.96-8422,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,153.202,169.782,"Well, why would the Congress want to exonerate or not to punish under this statute a man who was quite sure that a license was required but he thought it was a State license."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,169.782,171.643,Congress--
1997.96-8422,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,171.643,177.968,You say respect for federalism means that we have to accept your view that he has to know that it's a Federal statute.
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,194.877,200.791,"--Well, quite to the contrary, and I think it has to be viewed in the following context, Justice Kennedy."
1997.96-8422,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,209.897,219.925,"No, but in the hypothetical case he thinks that... he knows that there... what he's doing is illegal, and he knows that it's illegal because he doesn't have a license."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,229.491,229.962,--That's correct.
1997.96-8422,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,229.962,236.495,"And I'm asking, why would Congress want to exonerate him in the first instance where he thinks it's a State license."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,238.427,249.014,"Part of the background to the enactment of the so called FOPA statute in 1986 reflected, as the legislative history indicates, a concern by the Congress."
1997.96-8422,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,273.52,275.511,"What was that statute you said, the FOPA statute?"
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,276.072,277.661,--Firearm Owners Protection Act.
1997.96-8422,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,316.477,338.934,"Mr. Adler, supposing you were to accept, hypothetically, the idea that all that was required under (D) was to know that there was a licensing requirement, be it State or Federal, the district court, as I understand this case, charged that the Government is not required to prove that petitioner knew that a license was required."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,349.189,351.111,"--That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-8422,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,394.278,396.239,"Mr. Adler, why do you need to put Federal in there."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,430.252,441.249,"I appreciate that, Justice Ginsburg and petitioner respectfully submits that, under the charge as given to this jury, and presuming that the jury followed the law, you're absolutely correct that petitioner should prevail."
1997.96-8422,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,444.562,446.983,"Well, but you didn't raise that issue."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,455.498,455.928,Yes.
1997.96-8422,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,455.928,457.671,--firearm dealers license--
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,457.671,458.05,Because we do not--
1997.96-8422,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,458.05,459.061,--That's all you brought here.
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,459.061,459.362,--Right.
1997.96-8422,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,459.362,464.494,"Now, the instructions may have been totally bad, but we don't reach that, presumably."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,465.826,466.086,"Well, it's the second question."
1997.96-8422,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,466.086,466.887,"--Well, I don't think it is."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,479.096,492.625,"Yes, and petitioner's position is that the Congress lacks the power to create a Federal crime for failing to follow a municipal county or State statute that may relate to dealership and, indeed, the legislative intent in the statute was clear."
1997.96-8422,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,599.554,600.956,"Did the President know about it, too?"
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,600.956,604.449,--In addition to the knowledge of the--
1997.96-8422,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,604.449,605.378,Do we know if the President knew about it?
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,605.378,611.431,"--We must presume that all officials, including the President, had knowledge of the law and followed their duties."
1997.96-8422,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,611.431,612.713,Why don't we do that for Congress?
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,612.713,622.309,"In addition to the contextual analysis that we have spoken to, the statute itself, 924, uses knowingly as noted on three other occasions."
1997.96-8422,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,676.605,686.823,"How much weight do you put on the distinction between knowingly, the word knowingly, the adverb in sections (A), (B), (C), and the word wilfully in section (D)?"
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,686.823,700.751,"Oh, I think the use of wilfully in subdivision (D) connotes the highest mens rea standard that our law, our criminal law recognizes, whereas knowingly speaks to only an awareness of one's acts, or conduct."
1997.96-8422,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,732.91,740.895,"Well, now, you say that we know that Congress has married wilfully to the chapter."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,742.678,763.783,"Well, a reading of section 924(a)(1)(D) indicates, most respectfully, that it punishes those who wilfully violate any provision of this chapter, and so the use of the term, wilfully violates any section of this chapter, connotes it is wilfully violates the chapter, not wilfully engages, or knowingly engages in certain conduct."
1997.96-8422,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,772.488,775.36,And you say knowingly simply means you're aware of the act that you're performing.
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,775.36,801.226,"And don't act by reason of mistake or misapprehension of the law, but so it's clear, we concede that one could wilfully violate this chapter by engaging in what is frequently called conscious avoidance behavior of a kind such as if there were a sign posted in a gunshop and a particular defendant operated through what is sometimes called straw purchases, sending in an accomplice to purchase the weapon."
1997.96-8422,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,811.841,833.197,"I thought they were straw persons used here, and there was misrepresentation of the purchaser's criminal record and, unlike Ratzlaf and the Cheek case, where the conduct looked okay, except that there was a statute that said no structuring on the one case, but here the whole thing looks bad, doesn't it?"
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,833.197,841.231,"Well, there are individuals who can engage in conduct that may violate a provision of law, or simply is inappropriate behavior."
1997.96-8422,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,863.567,868.35,"But Mr. Adler, is it not correct that one could still draw a distinction between knowingly and wilfully?"
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,881.859,885.392,"Well, it's not our contention, Justice Stevens, that you have to know exactly what--"
1997.96-8422,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,885.392,887.413,"Well, you can know that there's a Federal licensing requirement."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,887.413,888.712,--You have to know it's a Federal licensing--
1997.96-8422,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,888.712,888.923,Why?
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,888.923,907.175,"--and... because the wilfully in this case is followed not by a description of specific factual behavior, it is coupled with the use of the term, wilfully violates this chapter, and this chapter is speaking to in this case the Federal firearm dealers license."
1997.96-8422,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,921.895,930.661,"So you're not merely relying on the difference between knowingly and wilfully, and (A), (B) and (C) versus (D), you're also putting heavy reliance on violates any other provision of this chapter."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,930.661,931.312,--Exactly.
1997.96-8422,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,931.312,933.261,You'd read into that he must know he's violating--
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,933.261,933.773,As--
1997.96-8422,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,933.773,937.235,"--That's not a necessary reading, but certainly I understand your position."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,937.235,938.226,"--Yes, and the--"
1997.96-8422,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,938.226,948.652,"You'd say if it meant the other it would have been written, or should have been written, wilfully... wilfully sells a gun without a license."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,956.537,956.827,--Yes.
1997.96-8422,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,960.641,965.363,"Well, wilfully selling a gun without a license wouldn't necessarily mean that you knew you had to have a license."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,969.245,972.017,--With the knowledge that you're intentionally violating a known legal duty.
1997.96-8422,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,978.301,987.227,"But known legal duty also can mean knowing that you have a legal duty, so you are violating... you don't have to necessarily know which one."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,999.356,1000.117,No.
1997.96-8422,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1009.752,1010.773,"No, you're not following what I'm saying."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,1074.185,1087.254,"--We take the position that 1) under the judge's charge the Government cannot prevail because even the standard that the court would suggest, generalized knowledge that there's some section of Federal law prohibits the behavior--"
1997.96-8422,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1087.254,1087.584,All right.
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,1122.606,1128.951,--The charge is deficient and was objected to.
1997.96-8422,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1157.339,1160.05,"You objected to, he did not have to know he was breaking the law?"
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,1160.05,1173.25,"Yes, and indeed our request to charge asked the Court to make it clear that this defendant, who was learning disabled and acting in a State which has no licensing requirement in Ohio to begin with, certainly had no basis to know that there was a Federal--"
1997.96-8422,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1173.25,1173.959,I've read... I've read number--
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,1179.753,1182.434,"--Yes, and we had a charge conference, and we objected to it."
1997.96-8422,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1182.434,1182.665,--Fine.
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,1183.266,1183.626,Yes.
1997.96-8422,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1183.626,1183.967,Where?
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,1209.071,1212.664,"I don't have that charge reference with me here today, Your Honor."
1997.96-8422,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1227.204,1236.781,"In other words, you're saying that even assuming that you'd lost the battle over Ratzlaf you made the further objection that this instruction is wrong--"
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,1236.781,1237.282,--Yes.
1997.96-8422,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1237.282,1238.641,--even under the Government's theory?
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,1238.641,1259.427,"Yes, we do, and we respectfully submit that where the Government is coming from on this case is attempting to hold that guns are inherently dangerous substances, and relying on cases like Balint, that deal with narcotics, hand grenades, such as United States v. Freed, and silencers, such as in the cases, the circuit court cases cited in our brief."
1997.96-8422,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1349.275,1358.932,"But you say it was never submitted to this jury, but the instruction... one of the sentences says, a person acts intentionally if he acts deliberately and with the specific intent to do something the law forbids."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,1360.982,1378.052,"--But then unfortunately the court at the same time then instructed the jury that in the context of deciding mens rea knowledge and intent the jury should know that the defendant was not... need not be shown to have known the licensing requirement or, most importantly, Justice Stevens, the knowledge that he was breaking the law."
1997.96-8422,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1380.764,1402.299,"Well, the instructions are internally inconsistent, and the Government... the Government argues, in effect, that the message was the one that I described, and the question, though, is whether you really focused on that narrower objection, because the portion of your objection that's quoted on page 18, right before the judge says take it to the Supreme Court, relied entirely on the absence of an instruction about the licensee."
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,1405.06,1405.791,"--Yes, in the context--"
1997.96-8422,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1405.791,1411.024,I haven't found in the papers that we have the narrower objection to the--
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,1411.024,1412.456,"--Yes, sir."
1997.96-8422,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1412.456,1413.115,--You know what I'm talking about.
1997.96-8422,0,38556,roger_b_adler,,1413.115,1413.485,"Yes, sir, I do."
1997.96-8422,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1516.854,1518.005,"Thank you, Mr. Adler."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1519.796,1523.189,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-8422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1553.238,1555.219,"He's only 19 and he had a hard childhood, though."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1556.841,1559.593,--I'm not... I can't endorse that conclusion.
1997.96-8422,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1573.121,1576.765,"Well, wilfully means something more than knowingly, so we have to figure out--"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1576.765,1577.085,--Yes.
1997.96-8422,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1577.085,1583.579,"--what it does mean, and in any event the instructions seem to be totally confused."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1583.579,1584.738,"Well, let's start--"
1997.96-8422,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1584.738,1591.623,"They could be said not even to require knowingly, so I don't know where we are on this case."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1591.623,1593.256,--Let's start with what wilfully means.
1997.96-8422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1612.997,1621.904,"Well now, Mr. Jones, do you think the word wilfully just has a uniform meaning no matter what the other context in which Congress has used it?"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1621.904,1622.124,No.
1997.96-8422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.446,1631.503,"And here you have it juxtaposed with three previous sections, all of which used the word knowingly."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1631.503,1636.095,"Yes, and the word knowingly, as this Court has said in cases like Staples, is simply knowledge of the facts."
1997.96-8422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1636.095,1638.656,Knowledge that... conscious of your actions.
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1638.656,1638.907,That's right.
1997.96-8422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1649.732,1650.383,Wilful--
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1650.383,1651.963,--wilful behavior is.
1997.96-8422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1651.963,1652.815,"--Just a minute, Mr. Jones."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1652.815,1653.485,"Yes, sir."
1997.96-8422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1653.485,1656.488,Actions taken with a bad purpose to disregard the law.
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1658.608,1668.276,"It could include that, certainly, but it could also include the situation where someone is, as the Court said again in Murdock, unjustifiably indifferent to the requirements of the law."
1997.96-8422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1680.034,1681.814,"Well now, how does a judge charge the jury?"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1685.807,1692.241,"Well, the basic charge that this Court has approved in cases like Pomponio is exactly the charge that the Court gave, which is--"
1997.96-8422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1692.241,1693.541,This confused--
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1693.541,1703.548,"--Not all of it, but the portion of the charge the Court gave that says that the act must be with the... the Government has the burden of showing that the act was with the bad purpose to disobey or disregard the law."
1997.96-8422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1706.281,1706.501,"--Well, okay."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1714.925,1716.267,Certainly that would satis--
1997.96-8422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1716.267,1717.667,"Well, I mean, answer my question."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1717.667,1720.128,"--It includes that, Justice... Chief Justice."
1997.96-8422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1725.831,1727.203,But what else does it include?
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1727.203,1733.658,"--Well, it can include an appreciation or an understanding that's short of knowledge that there are legal requirements that apply here."
1997.96-8422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1737.499,1746.195,How would one prove in a trial that a person was indifferent to the law although not knowing that it was violative of the law?
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1746.195,1746.686,The--
1997.96-8422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1746.686,1749.077,He failed to look up the U.S. Code?
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1749.077,1749.448,"--Well, no."
1997.96-8422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1767.569,1769.662,"So if you act furtively, that would--"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1769.662,1772.822,"Furtively, or as Spies said, to cover it up or to hide it."
1997.96-8422,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1792.608,1794.068,--That's the tax case--
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1794.068,1794.779,The tax cases--
1997.96-8422,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1794.779,1796.939,--and the welfare... the food stamps?
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1796.939,1797.15,--No.
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1817.602,1824.928,"I... let me think that wilful sometimes means two totally opposite things, sort of like unpeeled."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1875.772,1877.633,Or is a sufficient substitute for it.
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1877.633,1879.433,"Or... now, we could say that."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1879.433,1880.364,And you have said that.
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.364,1886.608,"If you... if we said that, is there anything in your opinion that would wrongly be left out?"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1886.608,1896.893,I think that that sort of description can be found in decisions like--
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1896.893,1898.946,I'm not asking whether it could be found.
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1898.946,1899.715,--Well--
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1899.715,1902.169,"I'm asking, if we clarified it in that way--"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1902.169,1902.429,--You're--
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1902.429,1905.413,"--is there anything that would be wrongly, in your opinion, left out?"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1905.413,1924.154,"--I... the only... the only... the hesitation that I have is that the Court has adopted a variety of formulations that address this ordinary meaning of wilfulness, and I'm a little bit uncomfortable in saying that you can pick out a single one of them and be certain that it accomplishes everything that the Court has done with the other formulations."
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1924.554,1928.498,"Another thing we could say... could we say this, because you can't think of an example."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1928.498,1929.156,--That's true.
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1929.156,1932.82,"Could you say, it includes... normally it means--"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1932.82,1933.24,Yes.
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1933.24,1939.625,"--Normally it means you must know the legal duty, as in this case, know that there is a legal duty."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1950.291,1950.522,No.
1997.96-8422,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2006.768,2015.073,"Well, except that that conflates it, it seems to me, with knowing, and we weren't trying to distinguish knowing and wilful, were we?"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2015.073,2021.027,"--You have distinguished knowing from wilful, and we want to make... I want to be clear on that, especially since this the statute distinguishes it."
1997.96-8422,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2021.027,2022.339,"No, but did we do it... and I just don't know the answer to this."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2026.47,2037.98,"In Murdock... Murdock would have been a statute that contained separate offenses for knowing and wilful, but that's not the issue there."
1997.96-8422,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2037.98,2047.333,"I guess my only point is, sure, I can understand circumstances, textual circumstances in which it would make perfect sense for us to explain wilfully just as you have done."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2063.996,2088.911,"Well, what this Court's cases have explained to me in reading them is that the Court has distinguished between a knowing violation in cases like Staples and Freed, which is simply proceeding with knowledge of the facts that constitute the violation, and a wilful violation in cases like Murdock and Screws and Thurston, which is knowledge of the facts plus action with taking those acts with the bad purpose to disobey or disregard the law."
1997.96-8422,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2098.698,2105.594,"Mr. Jones, I'm not sure Ratzlaf is an exception, because there the violation was structuring the transaction in a way that--"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2105.594,2106.342,--That's--
1997.96-8422,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2106.342,2114.85,"--evaded the reporting requirement, but the... my understanding of the facts was that the defendant in that case didn't even know that it was unlawful to structure the transaction."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2123.026,2123.216,--Yes.
1997.96-8422,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2146.139,2164.532,"Well, I'm not sure it even needed a special meaning, other than the meaning you have here, because the assumption was that a person would not necessarily know that breaking up a $100,000 transaction into $10,000 components was itself prohibited, and that had to be found in order to satisfy the ordinary definition of wilfully."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2166.012,2170.505,Especially since the statute only applied if it was with the purpose of evading the other requirement.
1997.96-8422,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2170.505,2170.876,--Right.
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2176.269,2176.988,Yes.
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2190.569,2191.33,Do we have that?
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2200.584,2204.808,Petition... the charging conference is not in the record to the... whatever--
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2204.808,2206.619,"Well, we can get the record, can't we?"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2207.099,2215.433,"--But our point is beyond that, and frankly I don't mean to stand here telling you that I am certain whether he's wrong about what he says he may have said at the charging--"
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2215.433,2215.663,All right.
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2217.395,2222.158,--Because he didn't raise it in the court of appeals and he didn't raise it in this Court in the question presented.
1997.96-8422,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2254.999,2265.998,"Just before you get there, when the defendant proffers an instruction, which he did, and it's rejected, and the judge then gives his instructions, does he have the duty to make the further objection?"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2265.998,2278.027,"He has a duty to preserve the objection for sure, and I think he should... yes, he should object to each instruction given that's inconsistent with his theory of the case, but beyond that he has to raise it in the court of appeals."
1997.96-8422,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2282.118,2283.831,"I was talking just about at the trial, at the trial court level."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2283.831,2287.411,At the trial court he should object to any instruction that he thinks is improper.
1997.96-8422,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2298.53,2299.108,"No, he--"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2307.115,2308.425,Litigants bear the burden--
1997.96-8422,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2308.425,2308.956,--to do in the trial context.
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2308.956,2310.678,"--Well, that's precisely for the reason the court mentioned."
1997.96-8422,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2314.69,2321.494,"Mr. Jones, he did object on page 18 of the joint appendix... he objected, but he gave as the reason for it the failure to require specific knowledge of the license."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2324.616,2332.08,"--If it hypothetically preserved the objection at that point, it has been waived by not raising it in the court of appeals or in this Court."
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2379.641,2380.362,--What about this one?
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2388.079,2390.31,I believe that's the sentence that follows the instruction.
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2390.31,2390.828,Yes.
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2390.828,2394.502,That he doesn't have to... the Government doesn't have to show that he had--
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2394.502,2395.133,That's right.
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2397.664,2397.904,--Yes.
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2397.904,2403.928,And he says in this case the Government is not required to prove that the defendant knew that a license is required.
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2403.928,2404.478,That's correct.
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2404.478,2411.053,Nor is the Government required to prove that he had knowledge that he was breaking the law.
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2417.355,2441.131,"Well, in the context of this instruction which, as I said, was preceded by the clarity that you don't have to... the Government doesn't have to prove he had specific knowledge of this requirement, it's our understanding that this adequately informed the jury that the witness... that the defendant does not have to have been shown to have known that by not having a Federal license his conduct was unlawful."
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2452.729,2465.998,"Are you prejudiced in any way if we were to say, take your interpretation of wilfully and then say that on... even on that interpretation the judge didn't apply it because of the language I quoted?"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2466.72,2469.291,It would just be the expense and delay.
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2472.594,2473.565,"--I mean, you've argued it, I mean."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2476.975,2477.356,--Yes.
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2479.637,2480.468,Yes.
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2480.468,2491.364,"--I mean, instructions are reviewed with a certain amount of latitude for the realities of the concrete problems that the court has addressed, and especially when we don't have this objection preserved throughout the case."
1997.96-8422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2500.45,2502.573,This was not urged in the court of appeals.
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2502.573,2503.211,"--No, sir."
1997.96-8422,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2512.147,2521.024,"Mr. Jones, do I understand that to the extent that the defendant made requests to charge and they were denied it's not necessary to say exception after that."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2528.7,2533.563,--We're not contending that he can't continue to raise the objection that he wanted the instruction that was denied.
1997.96-8422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2595.783,2616.967,"--Mr. Jones, you focus exclusively on the word wilfully, but it seems to me that in lining up all these cases you have to look at what follows wilfully, wilfully what, and it's particularly hard in this case to argue your point."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2635.75,2636.752,But actually--
1997.96-8422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2636.752,2643.104,"--and that just brings to mind, you know, knowledge that he is violating the provision of this chapter."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2643.104,2664.508,"--Justice Scalia, that's the point I was addressing earlier about the Court's opinion in the International Minerals case, that the right way to read this statute is that it... that what has... what Congress has proscribed is a wilful, in this case dealing in firearms without a license, because what the statute says is, wilfully violate any other provision of this chapter."
1997.96-8422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2680.04,2681.913,With the same... the same... the very same text?
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2681.913,2684.605,--Yes.
1997.96-8422,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2701.204,2703.895,Was that a statute that also had a... had knowingly--
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2703.895,2706.667,"--Actually, that was what I was about to correct myself."
1997.96-8422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2750.956,2753.838,--You flatter Congress to think that they had that case in mind in--
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2753.838,2755.14,"--Well, I certainly think--"
1997.96-8422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2755.14,2756.092,--this careful drafting that they do.
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2756.092,2762.376,"--They're entitled... I would think that they would have that case in mind, because it's not uncommon for Congress to have this sort of provision that... about a--"
1997.96-8422,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2762.376,2779.186,"But that's a case that doesn't have knowing, for some section, wilful for others, and so would you just clarify once more what the difference would be if this statute had read knowing instead of, as it does, wilful?"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2783.75,2791.864,"--A knowing violation, this Court has said in numerous cases, is acting with knowledge of the facts that constitute the violation."
1997.96-8422,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2816.059,2819.963,"In other words, knowing that there was some law that prohibited this."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2819.963,2822.924,That would certainly be evidence of the bad purpose--
1997.96-8422,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2822.924,2824.286,"No, but what else would suffice?"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2827.118,2829.539,--This Court has never really tried to answer that question except--
1997.96-8422,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2829.539,2829.83,"--Well, we're trying now."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2830.25,2841.137,"--No... well, maybe you are, but you've answered it only indirectly by saying, as in Spies, well clearly evidence of concealment, covering up would be sufficient."
1997.96-8422,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2841.137,2857.959,"Because that is circumstantial evidence that he knew what he was doing was prohibited by some law, so ultimately that gets us I think to a standard that says there's got to be knowledge with some degree of specificity that he is violating the law in doing these acts which he understands he's doing."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2857.959,2861.729,I don't think that there has to be evidence of that.
1997.96-8422,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2863.161,2864.851,"Well, that is the conclusion--"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2864.851,2865.122,--I'm having trouble--
1997.96-8422,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2865.122,2866.173,--that has to be drawn.
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2867.984,2868.254,--Yes.
1997.96-8422,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2876.499,2876.89,The purpose--
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2880.943,2887.367,I think that the general knowledge instruc... the general knowledge articulation given by the court of appeals in this case is directed at that.
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2900.776,2901.587,Why do you keep saying--
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2901.587,2904.599,"--acted, as the Court said in Murdock, with unjustified indifference to it."
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2904.599,2911.532,"--Why do you keep saying purpose, because again, if we're supposed to clarify, it seems that purpose isn't right."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2929.414,2934.439,"One of the formulations the Court has given is, with the bad purpose or evil intent of violating the law."
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2934.439,2935.678,"Well, is there any reason to use--"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2935.678,2936.409,It's a blameworthiness standard.
1997.96-8422,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2987.563,2990.856,"--Yet criminal statutes are supposed to be clear, are they not?"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2990.856,3000.561,"Well, it's... I think jurors in their common experience understand what wilful behavior is, and certainly this Court has long upheld statutes that impose that as an element of the offense."
1997.96-8422,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3000.561,3004.725,Are you suggesting the judge just read them wilful and not define it for them?
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,3004.725,3007.125,The purpose of instructions is to assist the jury.
1997.96-8422,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3016.522,3019.213,"No, but the question was, does he have to instruct them at all?"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,3020.505,3021.164,Pardon me?
1997.96-8422,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3021.164,3026.698,"--I think Justice Ginsburg's question was, is wilful sufficiently clear so that there is, in fact, no need to instruct at all?"
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,3029.301,3030.24,I think some assistance is appropriate.
1997.96-8422,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3035.926,3038.187,"It's sort of like, beyond a reasonable doubt."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,3038.187,3039.178,--Perhaps.
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3050.926,3056.948,"But the reason you've said purpose... I'm thinking of the clarification, my impression of what you just said."
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,3068.387,3068.835,I don't--
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3068.835,3071.008,--I'm trying to pin down what's making you nervous about it.
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,3071.008,3071.299,--You've asked me what my reason was.
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3075.159,3075.81,Yes.
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,3075.81,3089.88,"It would be... the Court's treading here over decades of statutes, and it's important that we don't reinvent the wheel in a way that maybe leaves a spoke out that we need somewhere and that, frankly, I'm not in a position to describe at this point."
1997.96-8422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3089.88,3090.951,Thank you.
1997.96-8422,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,3090.951,3092.951,If there are no further questions--
1997.96-8422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3092.951,3094.443,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
1997.96-8422,2,38556,roger_b_adler,,3095.983,3097.365,Petitioner waives rebuttal time.
1997.96-8422,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3098.434,3098.655,Very well.
