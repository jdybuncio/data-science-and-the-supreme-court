1989.88-5986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.628,"We'll hear argument now in No. 88-5986, Clyde Osborne v. Ohio."
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,11.04,13.473,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please Court:"
1989.88-5986,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,228.25,231.473,How old was the child in question here?
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,231.473,238.998,There was hearsay testimony that the child was either 13 or 14.
1989.88-5986,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,246.642,255.09,Any question that what Mr. Osborne... Mr. Osborne knew the age?
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,255.09,270.879,"Your Honor, Mr. Osborne did testify that he had been told that the age of the child was 14, however, he had no actual or personal knowledge, and this was brought out in the course of the presentation of evidence at trial."
1989.88-5986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,294.035,307.426,"Well, correct me if I'm wrong, please, but those cases were not ones, were they, in which this Court or any other court held they were susceptible of being sustained under a narrowing construction?"
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,307.426,308.945,"Well, Your Honor--"
1989.88-5986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,308.945,309.867,Or am I incorrect about that?
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,309.867,339.268,"--In Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, the court had in effect already given a narrowing construction... this is the second Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, because there are two of the same name... had already been construed by the court by the time... by the lower state court by the time it reached this Court, and the Court accepted, for purposes of that case, that the new construction was constitutional, but still held that conviction under the old unconstitutional statute was not allowable."
1989.88-5986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,339.268,343.98,"But... but that wasn't because the statute was a nullity, was it?"
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,343.98,345.001,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-5986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,348.684,353.478,"Well, did... did... the court hold it had to be reenacted by the legislature?"
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,353.478,361.435,"--No, because, in the interim, it has been subjected to a new constitutionalizing construction, which the court--"
1989.88-5986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,361.435,371.539,"Well, then, if you say... then, if you say it a nullity, it seems to me that's a term that's not... the definition of which is not self-evident."
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,375.463,380.325,"--Well, I think one of the clear points that demonstrates that it was a nullity--"
1989.88-5986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,380.325,380.485,I am right about that.
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,380.485,381.737,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1989.88-5986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,381.737,387.44,The legislature did not have to reenact it; it was still on the books with the narrowing construction after the state narrowed it.
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,387.44,388.502,That's true.
1989.88-5986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,432.443,433.141,Excuse me.
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,481.874,490.759,"--Well, I think that the court can do just what you said and say we cannot prosecute this particular defendant because the statute is unconstitutional."
1989.88-5986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,490.759,492.001,And all the rest is dictum?
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,492.001,499.056,"I don't think that that would necessarily be true, because oftentimes the courts--"
1989.88-5986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,499.056,502.888,"No, the... the court then goes on and says, but, if you bring us another defendant, right--"
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,502.888,504.159,--That... this is how--
1989.88-5986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,504.159,508.072,"--under this same statute, in the future, this is how we would interpret it."
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,513.116,518.379,"--Well, but, Your Honor, it's no different than when the court makes that same determination at the appellate level."
1989.88-5986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,573.265,582.752,"Ms. Shank, in... in your view, could the State of Ohio constitutionally apply this statute, now that the supreme court has construed it, to another defendant?"
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,582.752,592.579,"--Well, Your Honor, our third issue is that we do think that it's still prescribes protected materials and that it is... fails to serve a compelling state interest."
1989.88-5986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,600.895,612.932,"Well, so, in that sense, as Justice Kennedy points out, there may be some problem with calling it a nullity, if it can be applied to people in the future after the living... after the limiting construction?"
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,612.932,631.693,"I understand what you're saying, Your Honor, and I thought about that in terms of whether or not it would be better to try to address the question of void/voidable, but this Court's own language has always been either that it was invalid or that the statute itself was void."
1989.88-5986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,686.331,688.544,"It's a possession statute, right?"
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,688.544,689.993,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1989.88-5986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,689.993,695.637,"Well, is it... is it clear that we would apply the overbreadth doctrine to this?"
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,704.822,707.565,What's being prohibited--
1989.88-5986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.565,715.231,"He's not expressing this photograph to anybody, it's... it's his own photograph, he could have taken it himself for his own delight, right?"
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,715.231,722.748,"--That's true, but it's just like a book that you buy for yourself or a diary that you write for yourself, it's... it's a communication that you hold."
1989.88-5986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,722.748,722.908,To yourself?
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,722.908,723.739,"Well, certainly."
1989.88-5986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,734.487,741.592,"If there were restrictions upon the distribution of that book to you, those restrictions would relate to the First Amendment, to communication."
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,751.949,762.345,"Well, Your Honor, I think that anything that one uses... and now we're moving towards the issue of the privacy interest in your own home--"
1989.88-5986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,762.345,762.495,Right.
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,762.495,775.614,"--anything that one uses in one's own home, whether you want to characterize it as eliciting feelings or as being communicative or generating new thought processes, it's all protected by the First Amendment."
1989.88-5986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,793.536,798.08,"A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since Stanley, Ms. Shank."
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,815.141,833.633,"Well, one of the things about this case is I don't believe that the state has demonstrated any kind of compelling interest in regulating the materials addressed in this statute, at least with regard to those that depict children under the age of 18 and over the age of 15."
1989.88-5986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,833.633,836.736,"Well, why does the state... why does the state have to demonstrate a compelling interest?"
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,836.736,844.25,"Well, even if the Court wanted to say it was merely substantial, but we are talking about fundamental constitutionally guaranteed rights--"
1989.88-5986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,844.25,847.412,"A fundamental, constitutionally guaranteed to have child pornography?"
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,847.412,849.933,"--No, it's not a right to child pornography."
1989.88-5986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,855.239,867.707,"Well, but... but you're... in this case, this man was convicted of having pictures of nude, minor males in his possession, so as to apply it to him, it's a right to receive child pornography, isn't it?"
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,867.707,874.943,"--It would be... that... that would be included within that broad right, yes, Your Honor, it would be."
1989.88-5986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,874.943,887.032,"That's... that's the interest the state has to show some... you say a compelling interest, but perhaps that isn't the test; that's the interest the state is protecting here."
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,887.032,897.07,"Well, the state does claim to be protecting its right to stop sexual abuse of children, which it says is necessarily involved in production of these types of pictures."
1989.88-5986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,948.585,956.34,"I think having... having sexual relations with a... with... with a minor under... what is it, under... 15 is the age?"
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,956.34,956.71,Yes.
1989.88-5986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,956.71,968.548,"I mean, I assume that if you didn't make 15 the age, or you would... you might be convicting many 18-year-olds for having sexual relations with... with 17-year-olds."
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,985.01,990.966,"Well, it is a different interest, and the states recognize that different interest in other statutes."
1989.88-5986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1061.666,1069.202,I'm saying the activity is different from being in the career of portraying the activity.
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,1085.613,1098.293,"I see what you're saying, Justice Scalia, and I do think that there's a difference between a commercialized drawing in of a child into a life of pornography and the things that are dealt with in this statute."
1989.88-5986,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1107.89,1111.91,xxx but the evil at which it's directed is that.
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,1129.261,1146.065,"Well, the state certainly has an obligation, before it starts trying to allege that it's working towards that goal, to make the activity involved in such depictions illegal, and it has not."
1989.88-5986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1248.622,1258.289,Do you read our cases as saying a compelling state interest is required before the state or the Federal Government may enact a law prohibiting the sale of obscenity?
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,1258.289,1264.922,I read Stanley v. Georgia--
1989.88-5986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1264.922,1267.994,"I think the answer to that is no, that obscenity is just deemed not to be protected speech."
1989.88-5986,0,42151,s_adele_shank,,1267.994,1290.781,"--That's true, but I believe that when you go to the point of prohibiting the private, in-home possession, as noted in Stanley v. Georgia, and there, are again attacking or invading the fundamental rights to privacy to receive information and to think thoughts, you have again moved into the area of fundamental rights and a compelling interest is in fact required."
1989.88-5986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1426.203,1427.842,"Very well, Ms. Shank."
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,1429.754,1434.607,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-5986,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.917,1779.649,"Mr. O'Brien, what do you do about the overbreadth contention that... I mean the... the defense's argument here is that Mr. Osborne had every reason to read this statute and say, that's a ridiculous statute; it's... it's just too broad."
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,1793.07,1820.269,"--Well, I think, Justice... Justice Scalia, I think that the defendant, or anyone else like him, looking at this statute, even before the Ohio Supreme Court construed it could look at that the continuum I mentioned earlier, look also specifically at this statute that prohibits the possession of nudity-oriented material, except under the following circumstances, and the statute itself sets forth the kinds of circumstances that would be exempted or accepted."
1989.88-5986,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1830.908,1831.058,"Oh, I'm sure he knows that."
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,1850.471,1872.806,"Well, I think the... the Ohio Supreme Court, in addressing that, is how I believe I should respond, and that is looking at the statute as a whole, and looking at the exemptions and exceptions in there, that it did give fair notice, fair warning to Mr. Osborne and others that this is the kind of material that it was designed to address, and not just mere nudity."
1989.88-5986,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1899.486,1900.124,I'm not sure I understand what you're saying.
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,1917.527,1924.873,"Not the only question, but I think it's one of the questions that would be before the Court, and I think that the Court would say, looking at the--"
1989.88-5986,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1924.873,1925.394,I know it's one of them.
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,1931.478,1939.255,"--Well, I think the Court would ask... yes, it was overbroad on its face before it was construed by the state court."
1989.88-5986,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1939.255,1939.405,It was?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,1939.405,1940.306,Correct.
1989.88-5986,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1951.382,1963.46,But didn't the majority of the... the members of the Court in Oakes want to look at the statute as it was originally written and... and wouldn't accept a subsequent mooting of the case?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,1963.46,1967.013,"--Well, that was a legislative mooting, Justice O'Connor--"
1989.88-5986,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1967.013,1972.019,"Well, but, nonetheless, the focus was on the statute as originally written?"
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,1972.019,1973.127,--That's correct.
1989.88-5986,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1973.127,1974.689,And what if that is done here?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,1974.689,1992.919,"I think if that is done here that, looking at the statute as... as originally written, it seems to me that when you consider the proper purposes, exceptions and the other exceptions and exemptions in the statute, and the entire statutory scheme, it seems to me that it is not overbroad, even before the narrowing construction."
1989.88-5986,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1992.919,2002.967,"But what if a majority of this Court thinks that it is overbroad as originally written, as apparently the members of the Ohio Supreme Court thought?"
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2007.962,2039.273,"Well, I think that would leave us, if a... if a majority of the Court thinks the statute as written prior to being narrowed is overbroad, at least five members of the Court in the Oakes case would say that the statute was a nullity from the beginning and that it is a proper method to say the defendant's conduct was lawful at the time committed, and therefore can raise that overbreadth defense and have the conviction reversed."
1989.88-5986,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2049.0,2050.853,Is that inconsistent with Shuttlesworth?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2050.853,2076.799,"--I... I think, Your Honor, it's our position that even if the Court would look at the overbreadth argument and say it's invalid on its face, the conduct was lawful, the statute not applicable, that the defendant may be entitled to have the conviction reversed, and be retried, but not discharged."
1989.88-5986,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2098.563,2121.579,"xxx a state court where... where an overbreadth objection to a conviction is urged and the... the state supreme court says, well, that isn't what the statute means at all; it's not overbroad at all because here is what that statute means."
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2131.243,2136.138,"That's what my position is, Your Honor, they took a statute, not only the Ohio Supreme Court, but--"
1989.88-5986,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.138,2136.909,They just construed it?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2136.909,2137.82,--Correct.
1989.88-5986,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2137.82,2139.793,This is what it's always meant?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2139.793,2143.144,I believe that's... that's my view of what they did.
1989.88-5986,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2143.144,2145.527,"And if you... and if you think it meant something else, you're wrong?"
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2145.527,2165.712,"That's... that's my view of what they did, yes, Your Honor, and I think it was a proper and rational decision by them, looking at the statute, what... what its purposes are in the context of all the statutes that deal in this area, together with what the legislature was trying to get at, including the exceptions and exemptions."
1989.88-5986,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.416,2185.698,"But for a person who is confronted with that statute, ex ante, before the supreme court has adopted that construction, for him to be bound by it, surely he has to be able, reasonably, to predict that kind of construction?"
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2185.698,2187.878,"I... I agree with that, Your Honor."
1989.88-5986,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.9,2212.457,"Well, wouldn't you go further than that and say that the state must also put in the... those elements of the statute as part of its case, which you didn't do?"
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2214.637,2216.708,I think--
1989.88-5986,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2216.708,2218.1,--you didn't show lewd exhibition.
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2220.012,2226.367,"--Well, I think I would make a distinction as to... as to whether the state proved it and whether there was a jury instruction on it."
1989.88-5986,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2236.735,2238.137,But the jury wasn't charged on that.
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2238.137,2248.973,"The jury wasn't charged on that, and the Ohio Supreme Court, I think, Your Honor, addressed that by saying, we agree that jury was not charged on this issue, we are not going to relieve the state from that burden."
1989.88-5986,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2271.782,2274.534,The case is so obvious we don't really need a jury trial?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2274.534,2276.144,"--No, I'm not saying that, Your Honor."
1989.88-5986,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2276.144,2278.666,"That's, in essence, what the appeals court is saying, right?"
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2278.666,2279.727,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1989.88-5986,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2279.727,2282.94,"The jury never found it, but it's so obvious that any jury could find it."
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2285.812,2287.935,"Well, I don't think that's what happened in this case, Your Honor."
1989.88-5986,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2295.719,2301.122,"But the jury was never asked to find it, and the jury never did find it, did it?"
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2301.122,2302.163,--No--
1989.88-5986,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2302.163,2303.024,The jury never found it?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2303.024,2304.776,"--No, Your... no, Justice Scalia, they did not."
1989.88-5986,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2330.615,2334.736,Did the... did the defendant request any... any charge on intent?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2334.736,2349.746,--The defendant did not request a scienter intent charge or did not request a limiting instruction with respect to the lewd exhibition of the genitals that was later the narrowing construction by the Ohio Supreme Court.
1989.88-5986,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2349.746,2373.243,"Do you think the... do you think the Ohio Supreme Court's opinion really means that they said that, to the extent this statute reaches mere nudity and other things, it is unconstitutional and... but we'll just declare it unconstitutional to that extent?"
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2377.726,2388.874,"I... I read it, Justice White, as saying that we are construing this statute, and this is what it meant when it was enacted and when it was adopted, and that's what it's directed at."
1989.88-5986,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2398.331,2406.586,So that's different than a legislative revision of the statute pending appeal?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2406.586,2426.111,"In my view it is, because in a tradition of common law, the courts, on appeal, have that option of construing statute, and I think it's different than a subsequent legislative amendment changing the elements of the offense, particularly with respect to what happened in Oakes."
1989.88-5986,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2432.574,2443.714,"Suppose the defendant here had asked that... that the jury be charged with reference to intent, and the trial judge had refused the instruction, the same result, a valid trial?"
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2443.714,2447.697,"--And when you say intent, you mean regarding a lewd exhibition of the genitals or--"
1989.88-5986,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2447.697,2447.848,Yes.
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2448.139,2456.397,"--If the defendant had requested it and it had been denied, I would agree there would be a problem, yes."
1989.88-5986,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2456.397,2459.879,Well... how is that different from what we have here?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2459.879,2469.033,"I think it's different from what we have here because at first the defendant didn't request it, and... and [inaudible]."
1989.88-5986,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2469.033,2470.365,"Well, I mean, why... why do you say there's a problem?"
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2480.422,2493.221,"Well, I guess, just in my own mind, in terms of making a record, I would... I would think the defendant would be better off had that requested instruction been made, had it been denied and then they were claiming that was error."
1989.88-5986,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2493.221,2500.007,But you... you acknowledge that there is a real problem if he request the instruction and it's not given.
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2519.361,2529.999,"Well, I guess it just seems to me that the defendant would be better positioned to argue that... that it was error and... and reversal of his conviction is justified had he requested it and had it been denied."
1989.88-5986,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2553.136,2560.992,Does Ohio have any doctrine that the courts will imply an intent requirement?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2587.539,2624.434,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, 2901.22 of the Ohio Revised Code, and it's discussed in the Ohio Supreme Court opinion in this regard, says that when a statute is silent with respect to intent or scienter that unless the... the criminal proscription plainly indicates that strict liability is to be imposed, that you pick up another statute with a minimum culpable mental state of recklessness, which... which, at least in this regard, is... is the perverse... the disregard of a known risk."
1989.88-5986,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2624.434,2635.702,"So a defendant defending a prosecution under this statute would have presumably been justified in asking for an instruction on recklessness in this case, on the basis of that statute?"
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2635.702,2638.894,"That would be my view, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-5986,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2855.833,2864.89,"The fact... let me just ask... the fact that it's gone underground, I don't see why that makes efforts to prohibit the sale or the commercial distribution unlawful, though."
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2867.694,2875.872,"It's an effective way, Justice Stevens, but I... I believe that the states need that additional tool of a possessory offense."
1989.88-5986,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2903.811,2905.612,"Well, but that's true of a lot of criminal activity."
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2913.119,2915.51,And many of the arrests are on possession offenses.
1989.88-5986,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2915.51,2915.74,Right.
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2915.74,2924.636,"And because you are able to arrest those people on possession offenses, you are able to even move up the ladder to those involved in the sale and distribution."
1989.88-5986,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2924.636,2933.892,"But... but you seem to talk about the fact that it's underground means that... that the prohibition against sale and production is meaningless, but I just don't quite follow."
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,2933.892,2935.304,"No, it's not meaningless, Your Honor."
1989.88-5986,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3061.761,3062.462,Another question I had.
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,3068.366,3070.97,It would be recklessness under the--
1989.88-5986,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3070.97,3072.79,--Reckless... what sort of recklessness?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,3074.002,3075.402,"--Well, there is... there is a specific definition."
1989.88-5986,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3080.386,3081.237,"--Well, purposely... say it's purposely knowing."
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,3084.319,3089.734,He has to perversely disregard a known risk is the statutory language.
1989.88-5986,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3089.734,3091.596,"Well, but... but, risk of what?"
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,3095.619,3108.369,"Well, it seems to me, he has to know it's a picture of a minor, he has to know that it is a minor which is nude, and not only nude but involving a lewd exhibition or graphic focus on the genitals."
1989.88-5986,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3108.369,3112.482,"And the defendant contends he didn't know any of these things, is that what it amounts to?"
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,3112.482,3122.536,"I'm not sure he contends he didn't know those things; I think he's contending that the statute, at the time, before its construction, would not lead him to believe that."
1989.88-5986,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3122.536,3124.369,Not--
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,3129.182,3132.394,"I... I think that's correct, Justice Scalia."
1989.88-5986,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3140.799,3143.1,Would that apply if he was blind?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,3143.1,3156.08,"--I would say not, because there's no way the state could prove that he... that he knew the material that he possessed depicted the visual depiction of a minor and that the depiction was a--"
1989.88-5986,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3156.08,3165.146,xxx Ohio [inaudible] with the possession of one marijuana cigarette are you guilty of a crime?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,3165.146,3178.677,"--One marijuana cigarette would be what is known in Ohio as a minor misdemeanor, and particularly with respect to marijuana if the amount is less than I believe 100 grams, which is approximately three ounces."
1989.88-5986,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3180.337,3185.261,Isn't the usual statute possession with intent to distribute?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,3185.261,3192.047,"There are statutes like that, but in addition to that, Justice Marshall, there are also simple possession statutes."
1989.88-5986,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3210.389,3212.32,So your main idea is to protect the children?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,3212.32,3214.563,"Correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-5986,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3214.563,3216.413,Where were these children from?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,3216.413,3234.086,"The record in this regard, Justice Marshall, indicates that the defendant obtained them from a man... in Columbus he obtained them... from a man in Florida who was charged with federal postal mailing of child pornography."
1989.88-5986,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3234.086,3237.879,And what... what interest does Ohio have to protect the children in Florida?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,3237.879,3240.601,"Well, there's no evidence that the photographs were taken in Florida."
1989.88-5986,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3246.397,3249.208,Were the pictures taken in Ohio?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,3249.208,3253.039,The record says the pictures could have been taken anywhere.
1989.88-5986,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3255.991,3256.832,Including Egypt?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,3256.832,3262.115,"--The pictures, according to the records, could have been taken anywhere."
1989.88-5986,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3262.115,3263.658,I don't see how you protected the children in Ohio.
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,3263.658,3267.909,"Well, I... I think that protecting the children in the State of Ohio--"
1989.88-5986,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3267.909,3269.701,Wouldn't you call that overbroad?
1989.88-5986,1,40119,ronald_j_obrien,,3269.701,3272.023,"--I don't think I would, Your Honor."
1989.88-5986,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3277.036,3278.338,"Thank you, Mr. O'Brien."
1989.88-5986,2,42151,s_adele_shank,,3281.12,3293.367,I think one of the remarks that was made close to the end of Mr. O'Brien's comments is telling about the effects of this statute.
1989.88-5986,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3350.006,3357.201,"xxx the supreme court's opinion, they... they say this is what the statute always meant."
1989.88-5986,2,42151,s_adele_shank,,3369.56,3377.586,"Well, Your Honor, I know that they do claim that it is not overbroad."
1989.88-5986,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3402.944,3412.03,"Not expressly, but then they say if you take into consideration the other aspects of the statute, it doesn't cover just nudity."
1989.88-5986,2,42151,s_adele_shank,,3412.03,3417.214,"I agree that they do say that, but they say it in a very--"
1989.88-5986,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3417.214,3418.083,"Well, that's the construction."
1989.88-5986,2,42151,s_adele_shank,,3418.083,3442.069,"--It's a... Your Honor, I have to... I simply point out to the Court that their language is kind of back and forth, and that at the conclusion of that little discussion, they do then say, and that's... this is in the center of the final full paragraph, again, on page 42 of the joint appendix, that as... authoritatively construed that day by the court."
1989.88-5986,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3506.206,3506.346,Excuse me.
1989.88-5986,2,42151,s_adele_shank,,3508.168,3509.128,That's after the construction.
1989.88-5986,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3509.128,3509.729,--After the construction.
1989.88-5986,2,42151,s_adele_shank,,3509.729,3524.629,"Yes, because even after the construction, Ohio still includes mere viewing, and Ohio includes possession without any restriction for why it's possessed, and Ohio does not require that genitals be depicted."
1989.88-5986,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3556.261,3568.13,"But if... if the state supreme court has construed it more narrowly, surely the defendant must have been given notice by the language of the statute of everything he possibly could have been subjected to, and perhaps more?"
1989.88-5986,2,42151,s_adele_shank,,3568.13,3572.865,"--Well, in fact, I believe that what you're saying is the essence of the concept of overbreadth again."
1989.88-5986,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3572.865,3576.187,"No, it's the essence of the contest... concept of fair notice."
1989.88-5986,2,42151,s_adele_shank,,3576.187,3578.157,"Exactly, which is part of what the problem--"
1989.88-5986,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3578.157,3578.287,"Well, no."
1989.88-5986,2,42151,s_adele_shank,,3587.295,3591.279,"--Well, and I understand what you're saying, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1989.88-5986,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3636.269,3639.203,Does it make a difference that Shuttlesworth was a prior restraint case?
1989.88-5986,2,42151,s_adele_shank,,3639.203,3645.917,"I don't believe it does, because the same principles were followed, as I just noted, in Ashton, which was not."
1989.88-5986,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3687.513,3687.653,"Thank you, Ms. Shank."
1989.88-5986,2,42151,s_adele_shank,,3687.653,3688.334,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1989.88-5986,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3688.334,3689.736,The case is submitted.
