1993.92-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.037,"We'll hear argument next in No. 92-1500, Paul Caspari v. Christopher Bohlen."
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,53.235,54.147,"Jung, Your... Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,54.147,54.988,"Jung, Mr. Jung."
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,54.988,55.629,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,212.651,227.15,"But, Mr. Jung, what... the consequences of habitual offender in Missouri, do I understand right that the only consequence is that the judge... that the jury will no longer recommend the sentence, but that the range would be identical?"
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,227.15,229.621,"In this case, Your Honor, it would be."
1993.92-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,240.901,247.503,But in this case the only difference was that the... the jury would not have an opportunity to set the ceiling--
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,247.503,248.335,--Yes.
1993.92-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,248.335,250.966,--For the term of incarceration.
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,250.966,251.567,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,262.264,270.899,But it's not like the usual add-on enhancement of a sentence... Missouri... is this scheme unusual?
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,279.367,280.859,"In this case, Your Honor, that is correct."
1993.92-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,294.988,301.452,"Do you know if this scheme is unusual, or are there other States that have it too where the range is the same?"
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,301.452,310.088,"I... my investigation of that, Your Honor, is... basically found that States are split on that issue."
1993.92-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.256,338.228,"Mr. Jung, if you claim that applying Bullington in this case would be wrong, it seems to me, a fortiori, you must claim that applying Bullington in this case would be new?"
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,338.228,340.569,"That's... that's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,340.569,342.258,And so why isn't all of this Teague-barred?
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,342.258,342.939,That's... Your Honor.
1993.92-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,363.407,380.711,"So it's your view that our choice is essentially between two things; either we hold it Teague-barred or we overrule Bullington, but there's no way to say that this... to rule on the merits of this question if we incline toward your view?"
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,380.711,391.809,"I think, Your Honor, the Court could state that double jeopardy doesn't apply to noncapital sentencing proceedings in and or itself, and not have to reach whether it is a new rule."
1993.92-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,409.982,418.328,And back... are you saying that we would get to the Teague question only if we are inclined to rule against you?
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,418.328,426.475,"I believe so, Your Honor, even though I... there are cases that say Teague is a threshold issue, so it seems like it could be, in some certain situations."
1993.92-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,431.579,432.55,"Teague said that, didn't it?"
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,432.55,437.222,"--I believe your... in Saffle v. Parks, I believe, also stated that also, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,437.222,439.933,"But, I mean, in Teague itself they didn't reach the merits."
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,446.978,439.933,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,448.097,449.94,And it would be new.
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,463.801,464.961,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,542.452,545.414,Is there any indication--
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,553.051,554.891,That's correct.
1993.92-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,574.004,582.249,"Is there any indication why, the first time around, there was nothing in the record to show the prior convictions?"
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,582.249,586.283,"No, Your Honor, there is nothing in the record."
1993.92-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,670.967,672.397,"Now, what case was that, Mr. Jung?"
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,672.397,675.279,That was in United States v. DiFrancesco.
1993.92-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,690.489,694.152,"But that... that was decided before Bullington, wasn't it?"
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,694.152,695.604,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,695.604,703.679,"So you really can't say that that case decided that Bullington didn't extend to noncapital cases, if it came before Bullington."
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,703.679,706.16,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,799.185,818.456,"May I ask, just to be sure I understand your position, supposing all those things were true, supposing you decided in Missouri to have the multiple offender statute... I forget the name of it... apply only after a jury found all the facts that the judge now finds, prior convictions and... would it make any difference to you?"
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,818.456,820.579,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,836.63,840.642,What is the standard of proof in this proceeding before us today?
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,840.642,841.944,"Beyond a reasonable doubt, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,841.944,843.273,So that does apply.
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,844.515,846.107,The limited choice between life and death.
1993.92-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,846.107,857.103,"You think that's different from a limited choice... say that... say the multiple offender had to have a mandatory sentence longer, say it was a little more severe than it is here, would that be a distinguishing feature then?"
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,857.103,860.536,"I think that could be considered, Your Honor, if you looked at it and you saw all three factors."
1993.92-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.536,861.415,Yeah.
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,861.415,863.098,Then you could probably say it looked more like Bullington.
1993.92-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,875.674,882.109,"Is the main point that this... that here the judge does the sentencing, and in Bullington it was the jury?"
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,882.109,892.716,"I... case law, Your Honor, I believe states that there is no distinction between judge sentencing and jury sentencing, so that wouldn't be that relevant, whether the judge or jury did the sentencing."
1993.92-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,892.716,898.13,"So as soon as you... as soon as you've acknowledged that, then the absence of instructions to the jury, of course, is just because it's a judge, not a jury."
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,898.13,899.231,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,903.433,903.954,Right.
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,903.954,905.156,Is this an adversarial proceeding.
1993.92-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.737,910.441,"Even though it requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it's not a trial-like setting."
1993.92-1500,0,24141,frank_a_jung,,910.441,912.001,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,918.715,920.808,Very well.
1993.92-1500,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,927.103,934.899,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1500,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1011.502,1024.601,"Well, was it Rum... Arizona against Rumsey where we had a life or death determination determined by the judge, not the jury, and we said Bullington applied?"
1993.92-1500,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1024.601,1025.913,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1077.187,1084.751,"Well, do you take the position that Bullington should just be limited to capital sentencing proceedings?"
1993.92-1500,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1084.751,1094.158,"Justice O'Connor, our position is that Bullington's rationale, under current sentencing practices, really only applies in capital sentencing proceedings in this country."
1993.92-1500,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1115.612,1119.355,"Now, you take no position on whether this is Teague-barred?"
1993.92-1500,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1119.355,1125.7,"Your Honor, we did not address that issue in our brief because the Federal interest in this case, we believe, is on the merits of the Bullington question."
1993.92-1500,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1125.7,1131.623,"Well, the Federal interest might also turn on a Teague determination in some cases, I would think."
1993.92-1500,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1131.623,1132.234,That is quite true.
1993.92-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1161.254,1163.297,"If it's a wrong rule, it's got to be a new rule, doesn't it?"
1993.92-1500,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1163.297,1164.318,"We think that's quite clear, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1177.088,1198.252,"May I ask if your view... supposing a State that did not have capital punishment and instead had life imprisonment without possibility of parole as a very... for very, very serious crimes, decided to impose a sentencing procedure that's analogous to those that are used in the death penalty States, to be... because it's such a serious crime, and they had all the trial-like procedures there; do you think Bullington would apply or not?"
1993.92-1500,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1198.252,1200.565,"Well, Justice Stevens, I think that would be a hard question."
1993.92-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1200.565,1201.747,"Well, I think it's a hard question."
1993.92-1500,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1201.747,1210.983,"The rationale of Bullington would, of course, be applicable in that situation, and you would have to decide whether all of the features that were present in Bullington were present in that system."
1993.92-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1210.983,1214.526,"Suppose all... see, my hypothesis, all of them are present except it's a different sentence."
1993.92-1500,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1214.526,1217.137,"Well, I have two responses."
1993.92-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1253.882,1260.865,"But you would not... you don't rest... neither of your grounds, then, rests on the fact that death is different from a noncapital case?"
1993.92-1500,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1260.865,1263.236,No.
1993.92-1500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1311.639,1318.893,"Mr. Kelley, your position is clear that Bullington should not be extended to the circumstances of this case."
1993.92-1500,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1336.625,1348.882,"I think it's quite plain, Justice Ginsburg, under the Teague analysis, that the new rule inquiry is a threshold question, so the Court could not reach the merits and rule in favor of the respondent in this case if it thought that would be a new rule."
1993.92-1500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1365.555,1371.699,"So the end result of your argument, then, is that we should hold this claim Teague-barred?"
1993.92-1500,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1371.699,1375.242,"We think, Your Honor, that under Teague--"
1993.92-1500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1375.242,1376.143,If Teague is a threshold question.
1993.92-1500,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1376.143,1378.807,"--And its progeny, that the claim clearly is Teague-barred."
1993.92-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1399.978,1400.499,It's interesting.
1993.92-1500,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1403.19,1404.282,"No, we do not, Justice Stevens."
1993.92-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1407.064,1409.756,You would like us to go ahead and decide the case because you think maybe you can win it.
1993.92-1500,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1409.756,1412.246,"--Well, that is not... that is not at all our position, Justice Stevens."
1993.92-1500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1423.255,1424.257,"Very well, Mr. Kelley."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1425.467,1431.302,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1471.137,1476.981,"By increasing the scope of punishment, is just... but here isn't it just a question of who sets the ceiling?"
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1488.859,1490.01,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1500.277,1501.769,And the range is rather large.
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1501.769,1505.391,The range is 10 years to 30 years or life imprisonment.
1993.92-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1505.391,1519.4,"And so the only consequence, as I understand it, is that this case would have to go back, if you're right, for an entire new trial before a new jury; is that right?"
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1519.4,1520.809,"That is State law, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1520.809,1525.253,"Because you couldn't have a jury just come in for the penalty, not having heard the evidence."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1525.253,1526.044,That is correct.
1993.92-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1531.438,1537.231,"So there would be a whole new trial, but then the jury would be faced with that same 10 to 30 year range."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1537.231,1543.554,"The jury would be instructed as to the range of punishment, if they were, in fact, to find him guilty of the offense as charged, robbery, first degree."
1993.92-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1543.554,1544.235,Right.
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1549.939,1552.501,You could end up with a larger sentence as well.
1993.92-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1552.501,1553.12,Right.
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1553.12,1559.304,"But in this situation, the most valued right that was lost to this defendant was his right to have that jury determine his sentence."
1993.92-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1559.304,1573.895,"So that... so that within a Bullington frame of reference, how can one say that the defendant has been acquitted of any portion of this penalty if, as you just said, he could get the very same penalty... in fact, he could get an even higher penalty?"
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1573.895,1577.628,Our position is not at all that he was acquitted of the penalty.
1993.92-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1634.424,1638.137,"How did they, in fact, prove the prior convictions the second time around?"
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1638.137,1648.795,"The second time there were submitted certified copies of the records, and the statute allows for certified copies to be utilized by the Court in making a prima facie determination as to whether or not the State has proved their case."
1993.92-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1648.795,1655.381,"So to that extent, it's quite different from the assessment of life versus death, where you take into account aggravating factors, mitigating factors."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1662.264,1664.217,"Well, that is true."
1993.92-1500,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1739.567,1741.888,Are you referring to the Missouri Court of Appeals or the Eighth Circuit?
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1741.888,1743.598,"I'm sorry, the Missouri Court... State court of appeals, correct."
1993.92-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1743.598,1746.38,May I--
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1746.38,1759.079,"It is also our position... I've heard... it is referred to as a hearing, but there is the option and opportunity to present evidence, and in other State proceedings evidence is often presented, in the terms of testimony, and the defendant has all the rights that are available to him at the trial."
1993.92-1500,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1759.079,1768.756,"--What sort of evidence would you present if you... the issue is persistent offender, habitual offender, and the State comes in with certified copies?"
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1768.756,1777.821,"Well, if they... let's say if I represent the defendant and we could contend, A, the identity of an individual named in the certified copies is not the defendant."
1993.92-1500,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1819.69,1826.304,"The second time around, did you present any evidence challenging the prior convictions?"
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1826.304,1830.005,I wasn't the attorney at that particular time.
1993.92-1500,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.005,1830.987,Well did the respondent's attorney?
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1830.987,1831.678,I understand.
1993.92-1500,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1838.042,1839.922,"Unsuccessful, I gather."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1839.922,1841.424,"Unsuccessful is correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1841.424,1860.466,"Mr. Sindel, I guess there are decisions of various courts going both ways on whether Bullington extends to this kind of a noncapital setting."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1862.258,1867.27,There are decisions from State courts that hold that it doesn't extend to noncapital settings.
1993.92-1500,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1868.482,1871.712,And they were out there before this decision was handed down?
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1873.154,1875.115,"--Yes, I believe that's correct."
1993.92-1500,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1879.329,1892.105,"And the State courts in Missouri had, in the Lee case, said that this persistent offender proceeding is different from the capital sentencing proceeding within Bullington."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1892.105,1905.015,"State v.... State v. Lee relied on... and in fact the court indicated it was constrained by the application of the Supreme Court of Missouri in three or four other State cases, all of which were decided before Bullington."
1993.92-1500,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1906.287,1913.13,"But, I guess, it did say that the persistent offender scheme bears no similarity to the capital sentencing scheme in Bullington."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1913.13,1914.903,--And I don't believe that is correct.
1993.92-1500,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1914.903,1916.563,At least that's what they said.
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1916.563,1917.474,That is what they said.
1993.92-1500,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1917.474,1918.085,Okay.
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1924.556,1925.637,"Well, I believe--"
1993.92-1500,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1925.637,1929.731,Is it a new rule that's been adopted here under our precedents?
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1929.731,1930.6,--Your Honor... excuse me.
1993.92-1500,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2011.329,2019.743,"Well, this Court has at least reserved the question of the applicability of Bullington in proceedings--"
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2019.743,2020.615,In a footnote--
1993.92-1500,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2020.615,2024.826,"--like this, and there are lower-court decisions going the other way."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2030.2,2040.248,"--I don't believe that the existence of lower-court opinions, in and of itself, is enough to preclude an examination of this particular issue under Teague."
1993.92-1500,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2124.605,2128.638,"Well, if that were the only issue in the proceeding, you'd have a comparatively strong argument."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2144.149,2148.46,"The... in terms of deciding the sentence, you're correct."
1993.92-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2164.602,2166.943,How are you not appealing the sentence?
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2183.225,2192.632,"--Every case which is returned to the court for determination as to whether or not... or a new trial, is going to have the possibility or prospects of a new or different sentence."
1993.92-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2192.632,2198.453,"So you're appealing from a judgment of conviction and a sentence, and you're seeking to get the sentence set aside."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2204.179,2205.178,"Under State law, that is correct."
1993.92-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2205.178,2208.581,So it's rather technical to say that you're not appealing from the sentence.
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2208.581,2222.01,"Well I... what I am trying to emphasize to the Court, that it is not... we are not appealing from the determination that a 15-year sentence is appropriate, as opposed to a 17-year sentence, as opposed to a 30-year sentence, as opposed to a 10-year sentence."
1993.92-1500,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2254.591,2257.325,"Mr. Sindel, did you argue Bullington here?"
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2257.325,2258.595,"I did, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2258.595,2261.887,May I ask a question about your statute?
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2269.321,2270.233,"It does, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2270.233,2274.146,"Does it... is it defined in terms of prior convictions, or just general behavior?"
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2274.146,2277.618,"Prior convictions, as well as the elements of the underlying offense of conviction."
1993.92-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2277.618,2290.656,"Are there... is it conceivable that there will be issues of fact in a... say the charge was dangerous offender rather than persistent offender, that might involve more conflicts in evidence than just whether or not there was a certified copy of a conviction?"
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2290.656,2291.557,That is correct.
1993.92-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.705,2353.079,May I ask you another question about Missouri procedure?
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2365.337,2365.906,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2365.906,2367.108,I see.
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2367.108,2369.309,Although I would... I would suggest that that very infrequently happens.
1993.92-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2369.309,2377.924,"No, but I suppose it could happen, if, say, the indictment had failed to allege the prior fact, or something like that."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2377.924,2380.535,If the indictment had failed to allege or--
1993.92-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2380.535,2381.756,That'd be the end of the game right there.
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2381.756,2383.086,--That would be the end of the game.
1993.92-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2398.497,2405.162,"But it's not too unusual, is it, to have a guilty plea on the merits and then have a hearing on sentencing, on mitigation and aggravation, even in a noncapital case?"
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2405.162,2414.018,"The only reason I say it, Your Honor, is that... I like to think of myself as a trial lawyer, as opposed to an appellate lawyer; I'm a little unfamiliar up here."
1993.92-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.091,2421.941,"Well, I understand, but the judge isn't always bound by the negotiations."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2421.941,2436.201,"If the judge in Missouri indicates that he is not going to be bound by the negotiations, then he will probably tell the parties that, and the plea may then go forward, but obviously the defense counsel would probably be well advised to search for a more lenient tribunal."
1993.92-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2439.326,2455.235,"Your answer to the Teague question that Justice O'Connor asked is simply that the contrary authority was, as the Eighth Circuit said... they used some adjective besides mistaken... seriously mistaken, is that... that's it?"
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2455.235,2458.627,"--That's the adjective, I believe, that's in the opinion, that's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2533.137,2534.636,"But that was long before Teague, though, wasn't it?"
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2534.636,2535.728,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2563.167,2567.97,You mean that it doesn't come under that justification for accepting Teague?
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2567.97,2588.022,"It... there are, obviously, in the cases throughout this Court's opinion, that accuracy is one of the underlying concepts in the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause, for fear that the State use... with use of their resources over and over, will undermine the defendant and eventually be able to obtain a verdict, even though he may be innocent."
1993.92-1500,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2588.022,2598.43,"But you're concerned... or we are concerned in this case with an entirely different accuracy concern, and that is the concern for adequate evidence before making a determination."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2609.707,2612.118,"That... that is conceivably correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2646.92,2651.855,"Well, that's good double jeopardy analysis, but I don't think it gets you where you want to go under the second Teague exception."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2651.855,2661.95,I do not believe that our position... I'd like to tell the Court that our position under the second Teague analysis is pristine and easily determined.
1993.92-1500,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2694.374,2697.376,"Yes, but it wasn't in the name of accuracy that they did it."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2697.376,2699.438,In the Robinson case?
1993.92-1500,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2699.438,2703.43,"Well either Robinson or Ashe against Swenson, I don't think."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2703.43,2708.533,"Well, Ashe v. Swenson obviously had some concerns for accuracy because the individual was acquitted the first time around."
1993.92-1500,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2710.784,2716.357,"Yeah, but to say you basically had your shot is counter to accuracy, it seems to me."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2732.399,2745.956,"In Ashe v. Swenson, however, the concern was, that as the State admitted at that... in that particular proceeding, was that we had used the first trial simply to hone our strategies as a dry run on the subsequent trial."
1993.92-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2770.236,2775.328,As far as that evidence is concerned... and I perhaps didn't understand an answer you gave to Justice Stevens' question.
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2799.975,2802.657,The character of the felony is the felony itself.
1993.92-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2803.499,2806.44,"The felony of indictment, but not the prior felonies."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2817.61,2818.569,--That is correct.
1993.92-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2819.861,2821.981,"Of course, that's not true of the dangerous offender."
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2821.981,2823.754,"--No, that is not true with the dangerous offender."
1993.92-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2823.754,2824.733,There is goes to the character.
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2824.733,2826.084,But it is true of the prior and persistent offender.
1993.92-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2826.084,2828.645,"Which is what we're dealing with here, if it's a persistent offender?"
1993.92-1500,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2828.645,2829.517,That is correct.
1993.92-1500,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2986.211,2988.681,"Thank you, Mr. Sindel."
1993.92-1500,3,24141,frank_a_jung,,2991.125,2991.986,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1500,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2991.986,2994.019,"Before you start, can I just ask you one question?"
1993.92-1500,3,24141,frank_a_jung,,2994.019,2994.638,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2994.638,2996.711,Your questions presented do not mention the Teague issue.
1993.92-1500,3,24141,frank_a_jung,,2997.74,3001.282,"I believe it's encompassed... fairly encompassed in the first question, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3001.282,3003.114,It doesn't mention Teague.
1993.92-1500,3,24141,frank_a_jung,,3008.348,3009.407,"No, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3020.655,3022.318,"Well, the first question doesn't say anything about extending."
1993.92-1500,3,24141,frank_a_jung,,3023.677,3024.358,"--Well, should apply."
1993.92-1500,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3025.069,3027.17,"That, you think, implicitly raises a Teague issue?"
1993.92-1500,3,24141,frank_a_jung,,3027.17,3028.021,"--We believe so, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3041.538,3046.303,"Well, that's part of what Izumi was all about, wasn't it?"
1993.92-1500,3,24141,frank_a_jung,,3046.303,3049.665,"--Pardon me, Your Honor, that it wasn't an important question or it wasn't--"
1993.92-1500,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3049.665,3056.911,"Well, the circumstances under which we will address things that aren't raised in the Petition for Certiorari."
1993.92-1500,3,24141,frank_a_jung,,3056.911,3057.572,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3076.265,3086.172,"The intervention, whether the Federal circuit erred in refusing to allow Izumi to intervene was not a cosmic question."
1993.92-1500,3,24141,frank_a_jung,,3086.172,3086.753,"--Correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3230.726,3239.801,But would you make the same argument if there were a dangerous offender and the issue was whether or not the particular crime had all the aggravating circumstances attached to it that the State relied on?
1993.92-1500,3,24141,frank_a_jung,,3242.893,3246.285,"I think in that situation, Your Honor, it would be different."
1993.92-1500,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3247.285,3249.909,"And this statute does cover that very situation, doesn't it?"
1993.92-1500,3,24141,frank_a_jung,,3249.909,3251.401,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1500,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3254.964,3256.294,"No, I understand, but your argument applies to it."
1993.92-1500,3,24141,frank_a_jung,,3256.294,3257.305,"Thank you, Your Honors."
1993.92-1500,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3257.305,3258.137,"Thank you, Mr. Jung."
