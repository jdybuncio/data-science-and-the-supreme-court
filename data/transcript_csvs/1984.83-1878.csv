1984.83-1878,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,77.359,"Mr. Geller, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,77.359,78.078,Thank you.
1984.83-1878,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,105.895,118.374,"Mr. Geller, let me stop you right off the bat, if you don't mind, to just see whether that's the question we would necessarily have to answer."
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,136.914,143.583,"Justice O'Connor, that was one of many reasons that the FDA gave for not bringing an enforcement action in this case."
1984.83-1878,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,143.99,145.878,"Well, if we thought that was right?"
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,145.878,154.297,"--Well, before the Court could reach the question of whether that was right or not, it would seem that the Court would first have to answer the question whether this decision of the FDA is reviewable."
1984.83-1878,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,158.437,159.015,Yes.
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,170.089,176.164,Not when the question arises in the context of a challenge to the failure or the refusal to bring enforcement proceedings.
1984.83-1878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,449.318,452.645,"Well, the Court of Appeals' decision isn't limited to the FDA."
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,452.645,454.364,"That's another problem, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,557.712,569.753,"Mr. Geller, do you think your position in this case is consistent with the Government's position in the Florida Power & Light case involving atomic energy, where there you took the position that there was reviewability in the Court of Appeals?"
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,572.144,574.83,"Clearly, many agency actions are reviewable."
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,576.126,578.609,"No, this was inaction, refusal to institute a proceeding."
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,578.609,580.625,"--Well, the question is what Congress has provided."
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,585.185,587.201,It did not in that case.
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,587.201,592.854,"--There's a mandatory duty to initiate rulemaking, for example, under many statutes: the OSHA statute, the EPA statute."
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,682.192,691.501,"Mr. Geller, what if in this case, as I understand your position, that the explanation given by the agency had been simply, we have no jurisdiction, that they had said nothing more?"
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,693.219,702.045,"Well, our first... as I thought I said in the answer to Justice O'Connor's question, the threshold question is whether the agency's decision not to institute enforcement proceedings is reviewable in court."
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,703.605,707.168,"No, I'm asking you would it be reviewable if that's what they'd said and nothing more?"
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,707.168,716.476,"--The question would still be, has Congress circumscribed in any way the discretion of the agency to bring enforcement proceedings, and there would have to be some law to apply."
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,728.174,732.859,"Well, you don't support, as I understand your brief, you do not support the view that they don't have jurisdiction?"
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,732.859,738.451,--We contend here that the FDA in fact does not have jurisdiction to proceed.
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,738.451,744.152,"If they exercise their discretion to proceed here, you say that would be in excess of their statutory authority?"
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,744.152,753.429,"Well, the FDA has taken the position, and we think that there is certainly textual support for it, that Congress never intended intended the food and drug laws to cover this situation, that's correct."
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,753.429,754.71,"Well, I'm not sure that's an answer."
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,754.71,756.177,"Well, the answer--"
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,756.177,763.487,"If they had done exactly the opposite and gone forward with an investigation as requested, you say they would have violated the statute, or do you not?"
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,763.487,771.702,"--Well, as an advocate obviously we would think some argument could be made in support of the assertion of jurisdiction."
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,774.123,775.78,"Well, I'm still not quite clear what your position is."
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,778.919,779.2,--That's correct.
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,779.2,780.574,Do you agree or disagree with that statement?
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,780.574,781.495,"We agree with that, we agree."
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,781.495,782.837,You agree with it?
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,782.837,789.835,We agree that the FDA does not have jurisdiction to regulate the method of carrying out capital punishment by the states.
1984.83-1878,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,800.894,804.596,"Well, do courts have jurisdiction to review that issue and decide it?"
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,804.596,808.157,The issue of whether the FDA has jurisdiction?
1984.83-1878,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,808.157,808.954,Yes.
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,808.954,819.37,"If the FDA brought an enforcement proceeding and the states sought to have it dismissed on the ground that this would not be within the FDA's jurisdiction, then of course the courts would have something to review."
1984.83-1878,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,819.37,824.477,You don't think the issue is before us and we could decide that in this case?
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,824.477,833.974,I think there is a threshold issue before the Court of whether or not the agency's decision not to institute enforcement proceedings is a decision that is subject to judicial review.
1984.83-1878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,860.916,890.311,"But your answer to the combined import of Justice O'Connor's and Justice Stevens' questions, as I understand those questions, is that if the FDA had said only in this case, we have no jurisdiction to institute a prosecution or to institute an action, this Court should decide, because that type of decision, whether or not to institute an action, is not reviewable by the courts, that we don't reach the question of FDA jurisdiction because we don't review that kind of decision?"
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,890.311,890.999,That is precisely correct.
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,898.307,905.148,"Mr. Geller, I don't understand how you can take that position, which is directly opposed to the position you took in the Florida Power & Light case."
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,910.037,912.972,"Well, I'm not familiar with the position that we took in that case."
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,912.972,915.612,That was an agency inaction case in which the Government--
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,915.612,918.721,"But it is not... Justice Stevens, it is not simply agency inaction."
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1062.648,1064.834,"--Mr. Geller, I'm sorry to interrupt you so often."
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1082.592,1082.873,Precisely.
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1082.873,1084.059,It's the latter that you're contending?
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1084.059,1085.294,"Precisely, it's the latter, and that is the area that--"
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1085.294,1093.994,"So that whenever there's a statute which does not describe the circumstances under which enforcement proceedings should be started, your no law to apply rule would apply?"
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1093.994,1095.51,--That's exactly our position.
1984.83-1878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1130.387,1134.072,Is there any statute in which Congress has provided law on that decision?
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1134.072,1143.179,"Well, the only statute that I am aware of is Title IV of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, which is of course what was involved in Dunlop versus Bachowski."
1984.83-1878,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1447.541,1462.066,"Mr. Geller, would the use by law enforcement officers of Mace in control of riots or in their police work be something that's subject to FDA regulation?"
1984.83-1878,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1462.066,1469.671,"I would think that the D.C. Circuit's construction of the misbranding provisions would extend that far, or the use of chloroform by a mugger."
1984.83-1878,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1557.885,1562.525,Mr. Kristovich.
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,1562.525,1569.178,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1984.83-1878,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1835.538,1840.411,Are you suggesting that there's no social question involved here?
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,1840.411,1842.473,"--Not at all, Your Honor."
1984.83-1878,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1845.316,1847.939,I took it from your prior statement you were ruling that out.
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,1847.939,1848.47,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1931.437,1934.186,"Mr. Kristovich, can I interrupt, please."
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,1945.649,1948.038,"Well, he tried to distinguish it away, Your Honor."
1984.83-1878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1958.191,1966.172,But do you think the presumption is equally strong in favor of review cf a decision not to bring a proceeding as there is review of some action that affects rights?
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,1966.172,1967.828,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1984.83-1878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1967.828,1975.216,"I mean, his basic distinction, his basic point is there's a big distinction between refusing to act and deciding to act."
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,1975.216,1986.148,"--Well, as this Court stated in Marshall v. Jerrico, the decision to enforce or not to enforce often places a significant burden on the statutory beneficiary, as is shown by this case."
1984.83-1878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1991.366,1996.66,Where are the rules that tell us whether they have acted correctly in refusing to enforce the statute?
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2001.173,2009.967,"Your Honor, the law to apply is in the express language of the statute itself, the 1972 FDA policy statement, and FDA and court interpretations of the statute."
1984.83-1878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2016.996,2020.745,But then every nonenforcement decision has law to apply to it?
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2029.647,2046.468,"Well, Your Honor, in the Dunlop v. Bachowski case this Court held there was law to apply because You could look at the Secretary of Labor's decision and determine whether he was correct in saying there was no probable cause that there was a violation and no probable cause that that violation had affected the outcome of the union election."
1984.83-1878,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2135.807,2143.257,"Mr. Kristovich, are you also relying on Judge Wright's reliance on the preamble to the '72 FDA legislation?"
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2143.257,2143.632,Yes.
1984.83-1878,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2147.194,2149.24,"That was never adopted, though, was it?"
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2149.24,2152.989,--It was a preamble to a proposed rulemaking that was never adopted.
1984.83-1878,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2214.291,2222.523,"Well, under your view I suppose the use of an electric chair as well would be a device subject to FDA regulation?"
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2222.523,2223.71,"No, it would not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1878,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2235.564,2239.234,But it would affect the structure or function of the body.
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2239.234,2239.906,--It certainly would.
1984.83-1878,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2239.906,2241.312,And I assumed you were relying on that.
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2241.312,2242.607,"No, we are not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2247.106,2250.433,Does an electric chair go to the Consumer Product Safety Commission?
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2252.807,2254.743,"I do not know the answer to that, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.83-1878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2555.903,2565.618,Do you think an ordinary... am I taking your time?
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2565.618,2568.585,"No, that's fine, Your Honor, please."
1984.83-1878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2569.304,2578.816,Is it part of your position that an ordinary prosecutorial decision to bring a criminal case is subject to judicial review?
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2578.816,2581.643,"That is not our position, Your Honor."
1984.83-1878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2581.643,2584.72,"Well, what's the difference between that kind of a case and this one?"
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2584.72,2592.108,"Your Honor, a criminal prosecution is brought for the benefit of society at large, not for the benefit of any particular individual."
1984.83-1878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2612.193,2631.623,"Well, any member... let's suppose that there is a complaint with the Food and Drug Administration that a certain food is on the shelves that is unsafe, and the Food and Drug Administration says: No, we're not going to start any action against that; you're just wrong."
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2634.481,2639.868,"--Your Honor, if an individual could meet the standing requirements--"
1984.83-1878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2639.868,2642.586,"Well, that's what I'm asking you."
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2652.692,2658.377,"--Well, Your Honor, certainly in this case only the prisoners have standing to complain about the use of lethal injection drugs."
1984.83-1878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.377,2659.736,What about my example?
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2659.736,2676.011,"Your Honor, I believe if an individual in that case could show that there was a likelihood that he would be in cured by that drug, that therefore he could file a citizen's petition, as respondents did here, with the agency and request that they take action."
1984.83-1878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2676.011,2686.382,And what standard would determine whether the agency had failed to act properly if they refused to take action?
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2686.382,2699.235,"Well, Your Honor, that case, unlike our case, would be an individual retail type enforcement decision, at which point Mr. Geller's arguments about marshalling the agency's resources would come into play."
1984.83-1878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2699.235,2701.344,"In other words, the arbitrary and capricious standard would apply?"
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2701.344,2702.906,"Yes, Your Honor, that's right."
1984.83-1878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2702.906,2706.218,Why wouldn't the arbitrary and capricious standard apply to this case?
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2706.218,2710.778,"Well, Your Honor, I believe it does But we are also arguing--"
1984.83-1878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2710.778,2716.354,"Well, could not this decision be held to be non-arbitrary even if they gave the wrong reason when they refused to go forward?"
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2729.598,2737.627,"--Well, Your Honor, if I understand your question, the Court then would be saying that the FDA's decision here was not arbitrary and capricious."
1984.83-1878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2737.627,2738.22,"Correct, yes."
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2740.359,2741.265,"That's right, Your Honor."
1984.83-1878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2772.143,2775.471,The agency did consider this.
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2775.471,2778.703,"--Your Honor, the agency--"
1984.83-1878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2778.703,2784.873,"The agency considered it and did what any legal body would do, said: We find no jurisdiction."
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2788.825,2791.605,"--That's right, Your Honor, that was the basis for their decision."
1984.83-1878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2791.605,2792.105,So they did say it.
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2793.698,2798.15,Only to the extent that they said they had no jurisdiction.
1984.83-1878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2798.15,2801.21,"Well, I'm objecting to you saying they didn't consider it."
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2801.21,2801.648,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2811.894,2814.642,They didn't consider it the way you wanted them to determine.
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2814.642,2816.127,"--That's right, Your Honor, that's right."
1984.83-1878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2816.127,2819.062,And you're unhappy.
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2819.062,2820.655,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1984.83-1878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2820.655,2823.592,And I don't know what section of the Constitution protects that.
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2823.592,2830.793,"Well, Your Honor, the Administrative Procedure Act, which provides that agency actions shall not be arbitrary and capricious, protects us here."
1984.83-1878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2915.79,2922.647,Could you have brought this case in the state court against a state?
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2922.647,2924.475,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1984.83-1878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2924.475,2931.065,"Could you have brought the case in a state court against a state, saying you can't use this horrible drug?"
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2931.065,2936.578,"Well, Your Honor, in the O'Brien case which Mr. Geller alluded to Mr. O'Brien brought a 1983 action."
1984.83-1878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2943.654,2950.089,"I didn't say that, I said against a state, to enjoin the state from using this horrible drug."
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2950.089,2957.056,"--Your Honor, I suppose under a 1983-type argument such a case could be brought."
1984.83-1878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2957.056,2960.866,But you'd much rather bring it up here.
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2960.866,2961.694,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1984.83-1878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2961.694,2964.63,You'd much rather take this sideways.
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2964.63,2979.905,"Well, Your Honor, we thought it'd be better to go to the agency itself, the agency that has jurisdiction over drugs, the agency with the expertise to investigate these drugs, to determine whether they will do what they are being touted as doing."
1984.83-1878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2979.905,2994.415,"Mr. Kristovich, there was an argument made in some Texas appellate case, wasn't there, that death by lethal injection amounted to a cruel and unusual punishment in the criminal case itself?"
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,2994.415,2995.679,"Yes, Your Honor, that's right."
1984.83-1878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3000.1,3001.179,Statute.
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,3001.179,3001.614,--purely a statutory argument.
1984.83-1878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3001.614,3007.44,May I ask one other question about the state of the record on the effects of using the drugs.
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,3026.542,3032.649,"Well, Your Honor, I think the allegations are the same in both, both in the complaint--"
1984.83-1878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3032.649,3042.754,"Well, the letter to the agency more or less says there's an absence of consensus and there's a possibility that they might be misused in particular cases, rather than that there's a probability."
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,3043.457,3054.314,"--Your Honor, the letter to the agency had attached to it the affidavits from the anesthesiologists that said there is a substantial likelihood that these drugs will produce an excruciating death."
1984.83-1878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3116.272,3120.973,You're submitting on your brief the question of the agency's jurisdiction?
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,3120.973,3123.129,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1984.83-1878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3129.329,3133.86,"Well, I thought it claimed it didn't have any jurisdiction."
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,3133.86,3143.948,"It did, Your Honor, and we would request that this Court affirm Judge Wright's opinion which held that they did have jurisdiction."
1984.83-1878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.15,3147.994,"Well, you haven't orally argued that, have you?"
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,3147.994,3150.617,"--Well, Your Honor, I thought I had."
1984.83-1878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3151.633,3152.21,I didn't understand that.
1984.83-1878,1,41618,stephen_m_kristovich,,3152.21,3165.002,"Well, if I haven't, we are certainly making that request, that this Court find that it does have jurisdiction and that it exercise this jurisdiction, and that it do the investigation that it should have done in the first place."
1984.83-1878,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3166.018,3168.735,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Geller?"
1984.83-1878,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3168.735,3172.203,"Just a few short matters, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.83-1878,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3297.87,3298.886,"Thank you, gentlemen."
