2004.03-1395,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,5.479,We'll now hear argument in the case of Tenet against John Doe.
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,6.092,9.507,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1395,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,20.695,28.223,"Now, do you take the position that the Federal Government couldn't enforce any provision of such an agreement either?"
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,28.223,29.705,That's correct.
2004.03-1395,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,35.3,49.42,"Well, suppose... suppose somebody, allegedly a former spy, is alleged to... by the Government to have breached the agreement by writing and publishing a tell-all book about it."
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,49.42,60.316,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I think that actually points up the important differences between the way that the CIA deals with its employees and the way that it deals with its espionage agents like respondents are alleged to be."
2004.03-1395,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,60.316,60.615,"Yes, okay."
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,60.615,62.551,With respect to espionage agents--
2004.03-1395,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,62.551,68.068,Would the Government be without any recourse if it was an alleged espionage agent?
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,68.068,74.104,"--I believe that's true, Justice O'Connor, because the espionage agents do not sign prepublication review agreements."
2004.03-1395,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,112.493,118.95,But what if the employment contract is with an American citizen to act as an espionage agent and nobody else knew about it.
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,123.238,132.479,"If I understand your hypothetical, Justice Stevens, I think that individual would be treated as an espionage agent if it's just somebody for sort of a one-off assignment."
2004.03-1395,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,157.894,159.493,I... I'd like your help on this.
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,177.15,185.219,"Well, Justice Kennedy, it's a difficult question to answer because I think there are a lot of different strains underlying the Totten decision, and I think there is--"
2004.03-1395,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.219,195.225,"Yes, but you need to get to whether there is... do you urge dismissal for lack of jurisdiction in the district court or a dismissal on the merits?"
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,196.636,204.697,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, I think it's better understood as simply a rule of dismissal, that it's not really a pure jurisdictional defect."
2004.03-1395,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,217.61,220.998,"Well, I'm... I'm not going away with a clear idea of your position."
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,220.998,221.943,Well--
2004.03-1395,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,221.943,227.543,"Do I... do I... does the Government file under 12(b)(1) like a jurisdiction, 12(b)(6), no cause of action?"
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,230.61,231.265,--Well--
2004.03-1395,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,231.265,232.895,--what your best thinking is of what Totten means.
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,238.377,242.205,"--Justice Kennedy, I think the general practice of the Government is to file under both."
2004.03-1395,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,315.104,319.821,"If there's no cause of action, there's nothing to... to claim on, what's... what's the closest analogy?"
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,327.011,333.771,"I... I mean, I... you know, one... one way of thinking about it, but I think it's a very rough analogy, is it's almost like an unlawful contract."
2004.03-1395,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,371.654,377.274,Does... does that mean... the no legal recourse at all mean that you could torture an agent if you were dissatisfied with his work performance?
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,377.274,389.896,"--I... I don't believe that's true, Justice Stevens, and what I would distinguish is between a constitutional claim that an... an agent... an alleged agent might have that doesn't depend on the espionage relationship."
2004.03-1395,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,405.243,411.238,Could I... could I bring your back to your... your earlier discussion of a spy who is also a... a Government employee?
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,428.894,430.183,"Well, Justice--"
2004.03-1395,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,430.183,432.76,He has no recourse for that check just because he's been doing spy work?
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,432.76,438.502,"--No, that's not the position, and... and I... and I apologize if I gave that impression in answering Justice Stevens' hypothetical."
2004.03-1395,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,449.077,451.65,"Okay, not... not for his regular GS salary."
2004.03-1395,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,451.65,451.863,No.
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,458.823,459.891,Exactly.
2004.03-1395,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,480.332,482.103,"He couldn't get the 5,000 bonus for being a spy."
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,482.419,483.128,--That's exactly right.
2004.03-1395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,485.605,488.863,Could you clarify on the employment question something else?
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,522.203,537.485,"I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg, but the point is that the reason that... that I think that the Government would have had almost no ability to invoke a Totten-type defense in Webster or in a title VII case is because of its course of dealing with its employees."
2004.03-1395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,579.343,580.003,May I--
2004.03-1395,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,580.003,583.308,I guess the Government can't enforce... cannot enforce these contracts either.
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,585.848,587.495,"That's exactly right, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-1395,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.495,591.053,You've never sued a spy to... who hasn't carried out his mission?
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,591.053,595.873,"Certainly not... I'm not aware of such a suit, and I've been told by the agency that it's impossible."
2004.03-1395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,600.248,604.098,--Can... can we go back to the... another threshold question?
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,626.017,628.939,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in fact we have abandoned it."
2004.03-1395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,637.568,639.296,Are you free... are you free to abandon it?
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,663.329,677.524,"Justice Ginsburg, I think the answer to that is that it probably is jurisdictional in the pure sense and so if this Court disagreed with our view that there wasn't a Tucker Act problem, this Court could reach that issue and send the case back on the Tucker Act grounds."
2004.03-1395,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,807.746,817.749,"That... that would make a lot of sense if you really felt that what Totten is is... is a dismissal on the merits, just saying there's... there's no contractual claim."
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,853.46,866.22,"Well, I think whatever the status the contract question has, whether it's 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6), I think it's a... it's a threshold issue and I think this Court under the Rohrgas authority can reach that issue at the outset."
2004.03-1395,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,897.444,908.243,"And you're saying that if there's no contract, then there's no substantive liberty to protect under the... under due process procedures."
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,908.243,910.304,"I... I think that follows, Justice Kennedy."
2004.03-1395,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1063.94,1064.723,"Mr. Clement, the--"
2004.03-1395,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1064.723,1064.925,Mr.--
2004.03-1395,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1064.925,1065.38,--Go ahead.
2004.03-1395,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1065.83,1066.82,--I just wanted to ask one.
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1077.31,1080.581,"Justice Stevens, there is such a statute."
2004.03-1395,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1103.575,1106.896,And does the statute impose a penalty on anyone for revealing the name of a secret agent?
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1106.896,1110.777,--I don't think it... it certainly doesn't impose any kind of monetary penalty.
2004.03-1395,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1117.343,1122.921,But is the identity of an agent a... a type of classified information protected by the statute?
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1122.921,1123.666,--I think it is.
2004.03-1395,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1148.896,1149.491,Mr. Clement--
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1149.491,1150.162,And this case involves both.
2004.03-1395,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1150.162,1164.021,"--the... the argument made by the other side, which seems to me has some plausibility to it, is that Totten was decided in an age when courts were not as flexible as they are today."
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1206.798,1209.603,"Well, Justice Scalia, there's a couple of points to be made about that."
2004.03-1395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1265.95,1271.852,But you're not making that statement with respect to anything that's classified.
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1297.922,1314.963,"Justice Ginsburg, I think there can be certain arrangements in certain civil litigation where the Government can agree with a party to proceed... as part of their overall agreement, to proceed on the basis of classified information, but that would involve a very different way of... of proceeding than the normal default rules."
2004.03-1395,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1326.051,1326.474,But you lose.
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1332.721,1335.591,"Absolutely not, Justice Scalia, not in civil litigation."
2004.03-1395,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1340.376,1341.069,You're talking about civil only.
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1341.069,1342.041,Only civil.
2004.03-1395,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1342.041,1342.812,I'm thinking of gray mail.
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1346.626,1348.01,"That's exactly right, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-1395,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.01,1349.233,You either cough it up or you lose.
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1349.233,1362.731,"Right, and a different bargain has been reached in the criminal context, and in that context to ameliorate the consequence of the sometimes difficult choice of revealing classified information or proceeding, the Congress has come through with the Classified Information Procedures Act."
2004.03-1395,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1364.878,1366.011,I just want to ask one question.
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1403.613,1406.053,"Justice Breyer, I have two responses to that."
2004.03-1395,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1412.332,1415.931,"But it doesn't extend to torts, does it?"
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1415.931,1418.49,"I would... I mean, I would need a specific hypothetical."
2004.03-1395,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1420.667,1421.467,"Oh, you go--"
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1421.467,1422.355,--depends on the relationship.
2004.03-1395,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1422.355,1422.552,--You go ahead.
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1422.882,1426.364,I can't imagine a tort that depends on its very nature on the relationship.
2004.03-1395,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1444.292,1464.471,"So... so you're saying if in fact, when you look at those allegations, they're about regulations for handling secret contracts, it's about a contract, but if there were to be an allegation that has nothing to do with the contract at all, it's just a way we handle retired foreign spies, Smiley for example, or someone like that."
2004.03-1395,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1468.404,1481.176,"I still think the answer would be that there would be no relief under that circumstance because their... their... still their claim to having any entitlement under those rules at all would... I mean, you know, total strangers don't have rights under those regulations."
2004.03-1395,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1528.276,1531.304,Mr. Burman.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1531.304,1534.713,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1571.204,1577.692,But they are regulations that the... that depend upon the existence of a spy-principal relationship--
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1577.692,1580.599,"Actually we don't believe that's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1581.328,1584.056,"--Well, are you claiming that your... your people are... were not spies?"
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1584.056,1588.601,"--We allege that they were coerced into that relationship, but we do--"
2004.03-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1588.601,1589.661,"Well, however got there--"
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1589.661,1590.737,--Correct.
2004.03-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1590.737,1605.141,"--they... they... your claim is that they're spies and that, therefore, whatever your procedural claims may be, whatever your substantive due process rights may be, as I understand it, depends upon the assumption of a spy-principal relationship."
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1605.141,1606.948,"We do not agree with that, Your Honor."
2004.03-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1606.948,1607.234,Why?
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1607.234,1623.677,"We believe that PL-110 allowed the admission of people essential to the United States without any comment on whether they had formerly been spies and that these regulations do not require us to prove as an essential element even to the CIA, much less to the district court--"
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1623.677,1623.983,You--
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1623.983,1625.588,--that they were spies for the CIA.
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.588,1631.327,"--you don't have to prove that they were spies, but you have to prove that... that they had a contractual relationship with the United States."
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1636.688,1638.033,"We disagree with that, Your Honor."
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1638.033,1638.296,Oh--
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1638.296,1649.614,"We do not believe... and in fact, the Ninth Circuit went out of its way to make very clear to the district court that if we try to plead around and base a claim on a contract, the district court should dismiss that."
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1649.614,1649.873,"--Now, wait."
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1655.449,1655.973,We--
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1655.973,1656.435,--to your client?
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1656.435,1664.753,"--we say that the... we believe we can show, once we are allowed to proceed... and it's premature at this time to decide whether we'll be successful in this or not."
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1679.01,1686.099,"And... and the agency comes in and says, prove that you're a PL-110 resettlee."
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1686.099,1687.365,The agency--
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1687.365,1688.989,And... and what is your response to that?
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1688.989,1689.994,--The agency has never--
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.994,1692.224,Your response is I was resettled because I was a spy.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1692.224,1693.125,--No.
2004.03-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1707.009,1723.573,"What if... what if the Government takes a slightly different tack and... and you bring your essentially PL-110 neutral claim, and the Government says, the only relationship upon which this claim can be based by these particular Does is a spy relationship?"
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1729.437,1733.782,"If that were an essential element of our claim, which we believe it is not--"
2004.03-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1733.782,1740.019,"Well, they're not saying it's an essential element in the sense that only a spy can make a 110 claim."
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1748.74,1751.2,--Hence the reason we brought the case as Does.
2004.03-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1765.806,1767.336,"But, look, you're talking about procedural means."
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1773.79,1781.083,"--The advantage of the Reynolds procedure is if they had made the claim of privilege, we would know what they were claiming was privileged."
2004.03-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1781.083,1792.597,"They are making the claim of privilege on the ground that the only basis for your 110 claim is or can be, on facts known to them, that your clients were spies."

2004.03-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1806.051,1808.312,Let's assume that you have a really obnoxious court--
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1816.901,1823.11,--If their position is that they can't confirm or deny to the district court whether we were spies--
2004.03-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1823.11,1833.212,They are claiming a privilege on the grounds that the only basis for your claim can possibly be the spy relationship based on facts known to them.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1842.512,1845.136,--We are not going to say we were not spies.
2004.03-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1846.022,1847.962,Then I don't know why you're not out of court on Totten.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1847.962,1852.12,--Because we are not claiming the benefit of a bargain to be a spy.
2004.03-1395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1853.625,1854.249,What is a PL--
2004.03-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1854.249,1854.489,You are... you are--
2004.03-1395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1854.489,1856.728,--What is a PL-110 settlee?
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1856.728,1868.995,--A PL-110 resettlee allowed the CIA and the FBI to bring in up to 100 people per year that were deemed essential to the U.S. They could have been simply very important scientists who wished to defect.
2004.03-1395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1868.995,1869.215,Okay.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1870.24,1870.454,They could have been any--
2004.03-1395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1870.454,1882.262,"--Are... are you claiming that your answer to Justice Souter's question is we will assume for purposes of this case... we're not admitting whether it's true or not, but we're going to assume we're not spies--"
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1882.262,1883.56,--We believe--
2004.03-1395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1883.56,1888.058,--because we win even if we're not spies because we are essential persons?
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1888.058,1901.534,"--If we had made the Totten mistake of suing in our own name, we would be out of court, but we have sued as Does and we have said we are satisfied with the CIA concluding internally whether we are entitled to PL-110 status."
2004.03-1395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1901.534,1910.023,"All right, but my guess is... well, he's pushed you and it sounds like it to me... that the only basis on which you could say you were an essential person is that you're a spy."
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1910.023,1910.512,We don't--
2004.03-1395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1910.512,1911.427,He's... he's not a scientist.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1912.458,1932.863,"--Since they have not contested our PL-110 status until a somewhat desperate comment in the reply brief, we have never had to face this question because there has been no question that we are PL-110 resettlees, and that as long as we do not disclose our identity, which we've been careful not to do, unlike Totten, there is no state secret that is... is at risk."
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1932.863,1934.954,"But if the question comes up, you're going to have to disclose the identity."
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1951.317,1951.932,We--
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1951.932,1952.812,"--trust me, it doesn't."
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1952.812,1962.712,--We do not believe that we have to have... that we have to disclose anything to the district court to have standing as Does to seek a fair procedure within the CIA.
2004.03-1395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1972.507,1973.505,--Do we have to change Totten?
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1998.857,2003.784,"--I do not believe so, but you should not expand Totten in the dramatic way the Government asks."
2004.03-1395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2099.277,2100.224,Attached to what?
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2112.44,2118.787,That's what we haven't yet had the opportunity to prove as to what it is in these regulations.
2004.03-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2161.824,2162.27,What's--
2004.03-1395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2162.27,2162.774,You still have--
2004.03-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2162.774,2163.457,--what's your best case for that?
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2165.436,2166.961,"--Well, certainly Matthews v. Eldridge."
2004.03-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2166.961,2169.529,Because it sounds to me like due process in... in the air.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2169.529,2171.802,"We don't believe it is, Your Honor."
2004.03-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2176.008,2176.669,"No, no."
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2183.179,2184.624,"Well, there has been no summary judgment--"
2004.03-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2184.624,2185.589,Or dismissal stage.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2185.589,2197.348,"--At... at the dismissal stage, our pleadings have to be accepted as true, and we believe that the pleadings sufficiently assert that there are regulations there that create a... a property interest and that--"
2004.03-1395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2197.348,2199.242,--That create a property right?
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2199.242,2199.803,--Yes.
2004.03-1395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2199.803,2205.804,But the property right is the contract with the United States.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2211.695,2215.226,We do not believe there is a contract and we do not believe we have to rely on it.
2004.03-1395,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.305,2221.587,But what is your strongest case?
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2228.364,2234.421,Probably Perry v. Sindermann in the sense that there... it was clear that the contract was over but the Court indicated that--
2004.03-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2234.421,2235.991,"Well, that was the firing of a school teacher."
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2238.2,2239.229,--It was a nonrenewal.
2004.03-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2239.229,2247.231,"--there was... there was an interest in having your job, contract property, and interest in getting back salary, contract property."
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2248.139,2255.406,"The... what the Court actually, I believe, focused on there and in Goldberg v. Kelly was the question of whether there were regulations--"
2004.03-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2255.406,2257.874,"Goldberg v. Kelly, welfare benefits, money."
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2257.874,2261.628,--We believe this is in a sense the equivalent of a welfare benefit.
2004.03-1395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2261.628,2262.02,Perry v. Sindermann.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2264.039,2264.438,Yes.
2004.03-1395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2264.438,2266.58,"There's no property right there, I don't think."
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2274.121,2289.445,And I believe the Court indicated that it would be possible if there were practices and policies that had been established that set substantive standards for continuing that there would be a property right in a fair procedure for determining that internally at the school.
2004.03-1395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2289.445,2291.126,You're probably right if they have... I see what you're saying.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2291.126,2293.087,We also believe there is a liberty interest.
2004.03-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2387.345,2393.161,You think that Totten would be decided differently today because of the... our due process jurisprudence?
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2393.161,2396.658,We believe that Totten didn't know to make a claim other than contract.
2004.03-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2396.658,2397.839,I... that's not my question.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2397.839,2398.654,"Yes, we do."
2004.03-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2398.654,2399.805,Suppose Mr. Totten is here today.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2399.805,2415.607,"And if there were regulations in the Totten situation that created some sort of meaningful standard that would be applied by an internal procedure, which the record shows here the CIA has an internal procedure, not just regulations setting out the standard, but a review process."
2004.03-1395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2428.949,2432.71,How would the court... a court go about monitoring this fair procedure--
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2432.71,2436.658,--We... we don't believe the court would have a role in monitoring the fair procedure.
2004.03-1395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2448.661,2457.227,"--And then you... you said that... suppose you knew what it was on paper and then you wanted to complain to a court, that's not what they gave us."
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2461.354,2468.376,--It's possible that the CIA would assert that there is some reason that it gave less than its regulations that would be a state secret.
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2476.007,2481.807,Do these regulations just set forth a procedure or do they set forth some substantive entitlement?
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2481.807,2482.819,They seem to do both.
2004.03-1395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2496.613,2497.623,Then it will be worse for them.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2518.263,2526.482,"--If that was an external process, but we agree it should be internal to the CIA, that the process for applying that standard must remain internal to the CIA."
2004.03-1395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2538.873,2539.559,What's your answer?
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2541.066,2561.354,"--That there's no external... there... there will be no public knowledge of that information, that they can explain their... they can apply their process internally, apply the need-based process internally, and that will not be litigated in the courts if they assert executive... or state secret privilege as to that, and we assume that they would at that point."
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2562.955,2568.814,But the court would say you don't have a cause of action unless it knows what... what these regulations say.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2572.129,2584.239,"--We... we believe that's the case and they have not yet said that it would hinder the state secrets at all to disclose them, and they have disclosed quite a bit and said that the remainder they are holding back only a need-to-know basis."
2004.03-1395,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2719.13,2721.453,May... may I ask you what is probably a stupid question?
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2724.494,2730.714,"Well, we haven't thought about that because we haven't proceeded on... on the contract."
2004.03-1395,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2733.514,2734.112,Yes.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2734.112,2738.514,And there... we... we... but we do not proceed on the contract.
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2779.035,2786.041,Are all of these what you call 110 resettlees... are they all CIA resettlees?
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2786.041,2787.626,It does not appear that they are.
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2787.626,2788.826,Some of them State Department and--
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2788.826,2797.254,At... at least... my understanding is at least the FBI and perhaps the Commissioner of INS at the time for... perhaps at the request of other agencies.
2004.03-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2850.002,2851.792,I'm not quite sure where the Government has said that.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2859.573,2863.811,--And also in footnote 1 in the... in their brief on the merits to this Court.
2004.03-1395,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2890.23,2891.282,Do you agree--
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2891.282,2891.63,--I'm just wondering what--
2004.03-1395,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2891.63,2892.177,--Excuse me.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2897.825,2898.275,Yes.
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2898.275,2908.537,"--I'm just wondering what's, you know, some foreign... I don't know who... who the Does spied on, but let's assume... you say they're in danger."
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2925.356,2929.634,"In... in general, we have not been allowed to take information outside of the agency."
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2930.619,2931.167,--I'm not talking about the agency.
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2937.94,2943.436,"--That was their decision to trust us with that, and ironically under the Government's theory of this case, the Does--"
2004.03-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2943.436,2964.527,"Well, but it may lead... it may lead to other agents and... and one of the problems about allowing suits like this is that this information about who the agents are will be brought to a lawyer, kept in his law office, and much more readily accessible to... to foreign powers than... than it would be at Langley."
2004.03-1395,1,20555,david_j_burman,,2964.527,2975.475,"--And under the agency's theory of this case, there is nothing that stops the Does from making their identities public because there is no enforceable contract that the agency can enforce."
2004.03-1395,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3029.756,3030.806,"Thank you, Mr. Burman."
