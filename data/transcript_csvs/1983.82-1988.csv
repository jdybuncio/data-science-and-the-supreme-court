1983.82-1988,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.591,We will hear arguments first this morning in Tower against Glover.
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,13.464,26.77,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the narrow subject presented by this case is whether public defenders are immune from their clients' Section 1983 claims when they are cast as conspiracies."
1983.82-1988,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,146.473,153.017,"You limit your argument to public defenders, not to privately-retained defenders."
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,153.017,159.53,"Mr. Chief Justice, the facts of this case, of course, just present the issue of public defender."
1983.82-1988,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,177.007,185.347,"Well, what of the private lawyer who is just appointed to represent an accused or a particular case?"
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,189.72,190.392,Yes.
1983.82-1988,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,220.832,229.892,"But, nevertheless do not some of the suggestions you made in your initial summation apply as much to the appointed counsel as they do to the public defender?"
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,229.892,230.859,"Yes, they could."
1983.82-1988,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,260.926,265.252,"On the one point you made, I'm not sure it's consistent with history."
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,301.269,315.232,"I think that that is the tradition, Chief Justice Burger, but I think that the common practice in some jurisdictions, obviously, gives counsel who wish to be appointed some flexibility in determining whether they wish to be on the list for a particular court or for a particular time."
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,372.272,375.88,What about private legal aid societies?
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,375.88,378.394,With respect to--
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,378.394,380.471,Your point.
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,382.814,389.374,"--Well, in the State of Oregon, the private legal aid society does not provide for criminal defense."
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,389.374,400.446,I'm not talking about... I'm saying what about states other than Oregon that have private public assistance programs for lawyers defending indigent clients?
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,402.414,413.723,"We would submit that many of the common law arguments for immunity and many of the policy arguments for immunity would apply equally to the private legal aid organization, at least to the extent that it could not control its intake."
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,413.723,418.737,"Well, what makes you think they can control their intake?"
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,418.737,420.861,"It may well be that they cannot, and if they cannot--"
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,420.861,432.154,"Well, if they can, but they take 99 percent of the cases, would they be immune?"
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,432.154,432.747,--Yes.
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,434.84,435.387,Why?
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,435.387,438.011,Because of the nature of the risk which they accept.
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,451.208,453.676,Then I get back to the Chief Justice.
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,459.767,462.798,"Under some of the policies that we urge, yes."
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,463.704,471.232,"You mean he collects a $50,000 fee, and he doesn't have to account for what he does?"
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,481.213,483.492,"--Your Honor, this is a very interesting point because--"
1983.82-1988,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,483.492,484.835,"Well, are you or not?"
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,484.835,486.849,--We find--
1983.82-1988,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,486.849,488.537,This is the 1983 action.
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,498.017,510.544,"--Justice White, we have found in the authority cited by respondent on page 28 of its brief, that there are only eight reported criminal defense malpractice cases in the history of the United States up until the year 1984."
1983.82-1988,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,512.809,513.684,Criminal?
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,517.432,524.321,"--Well, a malpractice suit which arises from the conduct of a criminal defense."
1983.82-1988,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,527.804,541.423,"That may be, but would... you wouldn't say that a private lawyer who earned the fee that Justice Marshall mentioned is immune from a malpractice suit, would you?"
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,541.423,543.483,"Not from a malpractice suit, but--"
1983.82-1988,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,543.483,549.732,"Well, is he different from the legal aid society or from the public defender?"
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,549.732,565.726,"--He's different in two respects, Justice White, and those two respects are, first of all, that the client does have an independent contract remedy against the attorney; and, secondly, the client has an economic incentive not to urge the pressing of frivolous claims on behalf of his case."
1983.82-1988,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,565.726,572.768,"Well, we haven't held that the appointed counsel is not immune from malpractice suits?"
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,572.768,575.627,I don't believe that you have.
1983.82-1988,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,599.383,600.227,"Well, I wasn't asking that."
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,616.813,619.313,That depends on the state.
1983.82-1988,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,619.313,622.39,"Well, how about the great State of Oregon?"
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,622.39,625.655,That issue has never been litigated by the Oregon Supreme Court.
1983.82-1988,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.634,643.725,"Well, do you think the public defender is wielding state authority in the State of Oregon?"
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,643.725,652.564,--We must look at the Oregon statutes cast against the rationale of this Court's analysis in Polk County v. Dodson.
1983.82-1988,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,652.564,652.908,Right.
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,654.674,658.843,What if he is not exerting state authority?
1983.82-1988,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,658.843,661.436,"There isn't any basis for immunity then, is there?"
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,661.436,670.417,"Well, unless there is conspiratorial... unless there is the allegation of conspiratorial liability, which is the issue that we have before us."
1983.82-1988,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,670.417,685.537,"Mr. Frohnmayer, none of our immunity cases, whether judicial immunity, prosecutorial immunity, suggest that there is immunity as a matter of federal law from state actions, do they?"
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,685.537,689.098,From state actions at common law or statutorily based?
1983.82-1988,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,689.098,689.832,Whichever.
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,689.832,692.674,"No, there's not, and we're not contending that's the case."
1983.82-1988,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,692.674,702.78,"So, whether or not the petitioner here would be liable under an Oregon malpractice statute, is something we certainly don't have to decide."
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,702.78,705.638,"That's correct, and we have not suggested to the Court that it need decide that."
1983.82-1988,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,705.638,711.963,"Well, I thought you were kind of weaving together kind of malpractice arguments, together with 1983 arguments."
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,711.963,712.275,"No, no."
1983.82-1988,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,716.102,719.476,"I attempted to get him to weave them together, but he refused."
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,739.89,740.905,I think not.
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,800.194,802.646,May I get back to the... we're talking about a different guy.
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,814.829,822.496,"In the situation in which he is alleged to have conspired, as the facts would have indicated here, yes."
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,823.106,823.527,Would have immunity?
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,823.527,824.198,--yes.
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,826.245,826.464,Why?
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,827.806,830.118,"Because that leads, really, to one--"
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,830.118,833.726,What has the government done to bring this about?
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,838.037,844.566,"--Well, the allegation is that there exists state action under the Dennis v. Sparks theory, because--"
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,844.566,846.035,"Well, how is it state action?"
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,846.035,847.987,"--Well, for the same reason that--"
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,847.987,854.031,"The man volunteered to defend him, and they came to complete agreement as to that."
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,862.73,866.447,"--Under Section 1983 under a conspiracy claim of this kind, yes."
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,866.447,869.759,I don't see how you get 1983 on him.
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,869.759,874.398,"Well, for the same reason that 1983 is alleged to be present in this case."
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,876.257,879.52,Is operating pursuant to an Oregon statute.
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,879.52,880.708,--That is correct.
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,880.708,883.675,"Now, what statute is my man operating under?"
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,883.675,903.042,"If I may submit this, Justice Marshall, under this Court's holding in Polk County v. Dodson, the fact that a statute authorizes the operation of the public defender was not sufficient, in this Court's judgment in that case, to add the color of law requirement for 1983 jurisdiction."
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,918.286,920.692,"Well, what did the state court judge do in my case?"
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,920.692,921.754,--I'm sorry?
1983.82-1988,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,921.754,928.845,"Where the man volunteered his services, what did the state court judge do to bring that about?"
1983.82-1988,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,928.845,937.935,"Well, I thought that you were saying, Justice Marshall, that you were simply changing the facts in the hypothetical you gave me so that it would be a volunteer attorney instead of a public defender."
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,1635.606,1672.529,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, Glover's allegations in this matter, if true, present a classic situation that the 42nd Congress intended to remedy by the enactment of the 1871 Civil Rights Act, where it's alleged that state trial judges, state appellate judges, and state officials engaged in a conspiracy to deprive a citizen of constitutional rights, a federal avenue of redress must remain open to ensure the protection of those constitutional rights and to ensure that a citizen has an adequate avenue to obtain redress for that derivation."
1983.82-1988,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1672.529,1673.779,How about the jury?
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,1675.138,1683.837,"Members of the jury may not have been joined under that legislation, but members of the jury would perform a greater public interest."
1983.82-1988,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1701.126,1722.04,"When this Court decided the Agersinger case and the earlier case, certainly there was some thought that there was a public concern about having a person who was charged with crime by the government be provided with counsel."
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,1722.04,1743.594,"--Your Honor, where counsel is appointed or is a public defender to represent the accused's best interest, that counselor, whether retained, appointed, or a public defender, has not other duty but to represent and to advance the interests of the accused."
1983.82-1988,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1744.64,1745.968,You say no other duty?
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,1745.968,1748.06,--There may be--
1983.82-1988,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1748.06,1750.013,What about his duties as an officer of the court?
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,1750.013,1753.449,"--Well, certainly, there are obligations to the court and--"
1983.82-1988,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1753.449,1757.166,You suggest he could advance perjured testimony?
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,1757.166,1757.963,--No.
1983.82-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.028,1840.992,There is a practical observation that I think the Court is bound to have in mind when it considers claims like this.
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,1901.638,1908.621,"Your Honor, certainly there is no way to stop a frivolous complaint from being filed under Section 1983."
1983.82-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1938.327,1940.872,Fiat justitia ruat coelum.
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,1944.356,1950.307,"Your Honor, the constitutional rights are precious."
1983.82-1988,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1950.307,1951.243,"Well, that's not a bad position."
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,1962.225,1978.14,"Your Honor, my point is that those rights are precious, and that at any time that government acts to deprive a citizen of those rights, the purpose behind the 1871 Civil Rights Act should be available to a citizen to utilize that independent avenue of redress."
1983.82-1988,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1978.14,1983.856,"Well, do you have a malpractice suit in state courts against the, I guess, the public defender?"
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,1983.856,1988.714,It's my position that there certainly could be a malpractice in state courts against the public defender.
1983.82-1988,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1998.975,2005.77,"Would it differ substantially from what you're suing for in the federal court, or not?"
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2005.77,2014.048,"It certainly would, because if we were suing in the federal court for just a malpractice claim, we couldn't get to the color of law requirement under 1983."
1983.82-1988,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.048,2023.434,And you... but you can't get to... the only person you can get to in the federal court is the public defender.
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2023.434,2026.761,"Is the public defender, because the defense attorney who is--"
1983.82-1988,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2026.761,2027.869,And you have to prove a conspiracy.
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2027.869,2028.885,--That's right.
1983.82-1988,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2028.885,2032.072,Which is in agreement with the judge.
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2044.254,2053.032,"In many cases, Your Honor, where a malpractice remedy is available, it's very difficult for an indigent accused to be able to retain an attorney."
1983.82-1988,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.656,2065.995,And why is it so... it isn't hard to retain an attorney for a 1983 suit because in 1988?
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2065.995,2066.4,--No.
1983.82-1988,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2074.679,2078.209,"Well, why can't he... why doesn't he just sue for malpractice pro se?"
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2078.209,2081.426,"Well, the pleading requirements are difficult to meet in the state court."
1983.82-1988,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2084.863,2088.971,"Well, could he have brought this 1983 suit in the state court in Oregon?"
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2088.971,2094.376,"--Not... he could have brought, alleging conspiracy."
1983.82-1988,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2094.376,2095.219,"Well, this very suit."
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2097.937,2098.468,"Yes, he could have."
1983.82-1988,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2117.772,2124.957,"No, but if he had brought this 1983 suit in state court, would not the very issue we are dealing with today have been raised?"
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2124.957,2129.08,"--Yes, it would, Your Honor, but this fellow doesn't have much confidence in the state courts."
1983.82-1988,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2129.08,2130.049,He was convicted?
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2130.049,2133.985,"He was convicted, and he says as a result of the conspiracy."
1983.82-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2134.875,2135.11,Yes.
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2140.81,2143.699,That's what I was driving at before.
1983.82-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2145.23,2148.057,And so that's pretty... sometimes a pretty heavy burden.
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2148.057,2149.276,--That certainly is a heavy burden.
1983.82-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2149.276,2156.163,"What would be wrong with a federal rule in the 1983 area that said that in this kind of case, you have to allege innocence?"
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2156.163,2162.973,"That may be a way to address the floodgates problem, Your Honor."
1983.82-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2162.973,2169.408,"It would be pretty hard for him to prove damages if he would have been convicted, you know, if he's really guilty and would have been convicted anyway."
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2169.408,2186.822,"Well, frankly, I think he would have a difficult time in proving the amount of damages that he's alleged, and that even though there is the state malpractice ""but for"" proposition, that he may have a difficult time obtaining damages if he could not prove that this conviction was a result of conspiracy."
1983.82-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2186.822,2188.041,"In this case, did this man allege he was innocent?"
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2188.041,2192.898,He believe that he was deprived of his constitutional right to--
1983.82-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2192.898,2194.132,"I know, but that's not my question."
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2197.694,2197.912,--Yes.
1983.82-1988,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.277,2224.871,So you're saying he was illegally convicted.
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2224.871,2229.665,He was convicted without due process of law.
1983.82-1988,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.04,2243.424,"Well, I take it he's the... it would sound like that if you win, if you prove up your case, what you've really done is you're really collaterally attacking his conviction."
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2246.36,2252.577,"--Well, Your Honor, at this time this fellow is out of prison, and a petition of habeas corpus does him no good."
1983.82-1988,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2256.638,2258.793,"Is he on parole, or--"
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2258.793,2260.433,--He may be.
1983.82-1988,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2265.104,2268.728,--Do you think he's still technically in custody or not?
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2268.728,2270.086,I do not know.
1983.82-1988,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2274.302,2286.408,"Counsel, is there anything in the legislative history of 1983 which, by any stretch of the imagination, thought about this case?"
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2286.408,2300.324,"Your Honor, I would suggest that the legislative history of 1983, just in the enactment itself, where this Court has interpreted 1983 and Polk County v. Dodson, that a public defender is immune--"
1983.82-1988,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2300.324,2302.354,I didn't say one word about Polk County.
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2311.366,2315.833,"--There is nothing, other than the Act itself, the language of the Act itself."
1983.82-1988,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2315.833,2317.535,"Well, that's all I wanted to know."
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2317.535,2334.34,"I would suggest that that language holds that... or would dictate that public defenders, during the course of traditional defense functions, would be immune, would be effectively immune from a lawsuit brought by a dissatisfied client."
1983.82-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2371.514,2373.512,How about Briscoe v. the witnesses?
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2375.558,2383.306,That's the only case where a private party has been afforded immunity without performing a quasi-judicial function.
1983.82-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2428.599,2436.627,"--Well, you could say the same thing, apply that same analysis to Briscoe, I think, that you're allowing witnesses to perjure themselves."
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2462.164,2472.754,"--Your Honor, I would believe that a witness who testifies and perjures him or herself should be liable."
1983.82-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2517.001,2521.53,How often would you estimate this sort of a conspiracy takes place in Oregon?
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2521.53,2529.12,"I would submit that it probably does not occur very often, Your Honor, and I would hope that it does not occur very often."
1983.82-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2552.58,2556.875,"But we don't know at this stage whether any claims have merit to them, I guess."
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2568.729,2585.816,"I understand that, Your Honor, but to the extent that a public defender performs in the interest of the public in providing efficient and economic assistance to indigent accused, we should not take that liability away."
1983.82-1988,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2756.934,2762.511,"Well, you make a tangential argument for qualified immunity for public defenders."
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2762.511,2764.495,"Well, to the extent that--"
1983.82-1988,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2764.495,2768.306,"The policeman has it, and the prosecutor has it, and the judge has it, and the witnesses have it."
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2768.306,2769.118,--Okay.
1983.82-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2814.099,2824.719,"Mr. Edwards, your position, then, is that the public defender is not a public official, but he nonetheless acts under color of state law."
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2824.719,2830.811,"He's acting under color of state law here, only because he has conspired with state officials."
1983.82-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2830.811,2832.342,And that's the Dennis holding.
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2832.342,2833.108,That's right.
1983.82-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2844.04,2845.054,"Why, logically, should that be?"
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2845.054,2846.648,Well--
1983.82-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2846.648,2860.533,"I mean why, logically, should someone who is not ordinarily acting under color of state in law in performing the functions allotted to him, when he conspires with a state official, why should that person's action be transformed into--"
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2860.533,2867.889,"--Well, it's clear that private parties who conspire with state officials obtain color of law, act under color of law."
1983.82-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2867.889,2868.296,"--Well, why is it clear?"
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2869.498,2877.636,"Well, if you act in concurrence with the state official to further the state's purpose, you are acting under color of law."
1983.82-1988,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2877.636,2883.103,Even if the purpose is an illegal purpose?
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2883.103,2886.46,"Even if the purpose is illegal, especially if the purpose is illegal."
1983.82-1988,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2890.865,2907.638,"Well, I suppose you could say that state action is certainly involved in a conviction, and that this person is accused of subverting the proper conduct of public officials."
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2907.638,2912.747,I think that I would argue that the public officials--
1983.82-1988,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.747,2915.074,"You're really accusing of conspiracy, aren't you?"
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2915.074,2919.15,--I think that the public officials have subverted his defense attorney.
1983.82-1988,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2919.697,2926.226,Aren't you saying you're action is really... has to be a claim of conspiracy?
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2926.226,2927.818,"Yes, it does."
1983.82-1988,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2933.068,2938.722,"Well, if you prove an agreement, why you've subverted... there's a subversion of the prosecutor's function, too."
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2938.722,2942.064,"--That's right, but there is a public interest--"
1983.82-1988,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2942.064,2952.871,"So his liability could be for doing that, not acting for the state, but acting against the state by subverting its proper conduct."
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2952.871,2970.13,"--Well, to the extent, though, under 1983 that he has acted under color of law, and that the state is involved here or the government is involved with the private citizen to deprive another of constitutional rights, he should have an avenue of redress, a federal avenue of redress under 1983."
1983.82-1988,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2973.864,2993.104,"Mr. Edwards, how is it that you distinguish the Briscoe v. Lahue approach, which indicated that all people, governmental or otherwise, who are integral parts of the judicial process, are covered by immunity?"
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,2998.68,3027.529,"--Because the public defender performs such a unique role, the public defender is the representative of the accused and, necessarily, to maintain the adversarial tradition that is paramount in ascertaining truth, the public defender should not be... the public defender may perform a critical role in the judicial process, but that alone is not enough to make it the quasi-judicial role, or to--"
1983.82-1988,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3027.529,3034.213,"Well, I don't think that Briscoe turned on making witnesses quasi-judicial."
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,3052.237,3065.467,"--Your Honor, I understand that, but I think, again, that the mere location as part of the judicial function is not enough to avoid immunity."
1983.82-1988,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3083.146,3083.553,Of course.
1983.82-1988,1,18857,craig_k_edwards,,3105.685,3110.73,--I think that the greater public interest is in maintaining a strong adversarial process.
1983.82-1988,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3110.73,3120.568,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Attorney General?"
1983.82-1988,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3122.975,3124.505,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1988,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3195.914,3196.414,May I ask a question right there?
1983.82-1988,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3216.78,3220.965,"That's true, and there is a state proceeding, a post-conviction proceeding in Oregon, which would allow--"
1983.82-1988,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3220.965,3230.118,"And if you've gone through all that machiner and, say, the state prevailed and said there was no merit to these charges, wouldn't you be able to get rid of it on a summary judgment, in most cases?"
1983.82-1988,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3230.118,3235.21,"--It may well be, if that were an exhaustion requirement or a preclusion requirement that either the state or the--"
1983.82-1988,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3235.21,3239.754,"But I just think, realistically, most of these allegations would produce that kind of litigation, wouldn't it?"
1983.82-1988,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3239.754,3247.393,"--Yes, although the issues that one brings up in habeas corpus proceeding would be directed to the underlying constitutional violation--"
1983.82-1988,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3247.393,3247.69,Yeah.
1983.82-1988,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3251.079,3252.109,--That's correct.
1983.82-1988,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3253.687,3263.619,"I just have trouble... I'm just trying to wrestle with the notion of whether there really is a mountain of litigation of this kind out there, or just a few isolated cases."
1983.82-1988,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3263.619,3274.802,"--Well, we believe that there is likely to be an increasing caseload, simply because it was not until recent years that there was even thought to be any question about the public defender's immunity or the immunity of defense counsel."
1983.82-1988,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3295.857,3307.773,To what extent do you think the availability of attorneys' fees to a successful plaintiff under 1983 is an incentive to use that as a cause of action?
1983.82-1988,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3307.773,3313.678,"To use Section 198... I think that still hangs in the balance, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-1988,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3398.972,3400.066,"Thank you, gentlemen."
