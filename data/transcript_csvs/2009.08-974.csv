2009.08-974,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.904,"We'll hear argument next in Case 08-974, Lewis v. The City of Chicago."
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,6.57,17.878,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: On 11 separate occasions, Chicago used an unlawful cutoff score to determine which applicants it would hire as firefighters."
2009.08-974,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,86.272,100.866,"So under your position, say the City adopts a discriminatory -- takes a -- issues a discriminatory test; people take it; they come out with the results; the City says these -- this is the test we're going to use, but, you know, we don't have any vacancies."
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,102.882,104.233,"No, no."
2009.08-974,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,168.51,170.893,There's an independent violation without an impact?
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,180.751,182.318,"Well, there is an impact."
2009.08-974,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,184.02,184.569,Right.
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,184.569,195.443,"When the announcement is made -- let me make two points: First of all, I believe we -- you could clearly seek to enjoin Chicago from doing something unlawful in the future--"
2009.08-974,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,195.443,195.893,Sure.
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,195.893,198.195,--as you clearly have a cause of action at the announcement.
2009.08-974,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,198.745,200.279,"Well, that's because of an impending violation."
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,200.279,201.581,Because an impending violation--
2009.08-974,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,201.581,202.881,But you say -- you say it is an actual violation.
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,202.881,203.314,--Yes.
2009.08-974,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,247.46,252.93,"Counsel, the language of the statute of 703 is to"
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,255.032,255.582,Yes.
2009.08-974,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,255.582,278.231,"So is it your position that the violation occurs at the classification that's announced and that every subsequent hiring has limited someone's opportunity so that they -- there's a violation subsequently under the limit clause as opposed to the classification clause, or it's each event is a classification violation?"
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,278.231,287.587,"It's our position that, in fact, all three of the sections I quoted from are implicated in the actions that Chicago took."
2009.08-974,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,337.77,346.625,"Your position may -- may follow from the language of Title VII, but you began by saying that it also represents the best policy."
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,385.584,395.272,"I think the answer is that this is completely consistent with how the statute works, but I'm going to address the policy concern as well."
2009.08-974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,433.481,440.901,"If it -- if it stopped using it, it might be vulnerable to a Rizzo-type suit from the people who were benefiting."
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,440.901,447.241,I actually think that that conflict is not present.
2009.08-974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,473.339,481.878,"I thought in Ricci that was New Haven's position, that they thought that the test was unlawful because of the disparate impact."
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,481.878,482.414,I understand.
2009.08-974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,557.126,560.478,How long does the City's exposure persist?
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,603.757,605.79,--Let me give you two responses to that.
2009.08-974,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,691.21,693.729,"Mr. Payton, can I ask this general question?"
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,714.575,737.841,"The group of the black qualified applicants that are in the qualified category, but the qualified category is qualified as the other category -- every time the city made decisions about filling jobs in the fire department, it excluded every single one of those applicants, even though they were qualified."
2009.08-974,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.297,750.6,"But surely they couldn't all recover, because there was only one job available."
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,750.6,751.318,--No.
2009.08-974,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,771.145,774.68,What is -- what is the remedy other than saying change your practice?
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,785.905,788.088,--It may be very little.
2009.08-974,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,836.337,851.93,"But that -- each -- each qualified firefighter who did not get a job because the well-qualified one did has a new cause of action, I guess, every time somebody is hired from the -- the well-qualified pool?"
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,851.93,852.847,Every time--
2009.08-974,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,852.847,863.155,"In other words, somebody is hired, that constitutes discrimination against the qualified black firefighter who was not hired, and then another -- then somebody else is hired -- each time it's a new cause of action?"
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,863.155,866.44,--They had 11 rounds of hiring--
2009.08-974,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,866.44,867.074,Yes.
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,867.074,867.69,--that are relevant to this case.
2009.08-974,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,888.639,890.222,"Yes, so they would have a new cause of action, sure."
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,890.222,890.689,--That's a cause of action.
2009.08-974,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,890.689,900.697,"Now, but they -- but if 300 days go from the first round of hiring, they don't -- they cannot sort of piggyback that onto a later cause of action."
2009.08-974,0,32390,john_a_payton,,900.697,914.438,"Yes, if they sue -- in this case, the EEOC charge was filed after the second round of hiring, and in this case then, therefore, no remedy can take account of the first round of hiring."
2009.08-974,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,927.014,927.78,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-974,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,942.338,962.799,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the questions I think reveal, I think the bottom line question in this case is whether or not under the text of Title VII there was a present violation in each of the 11 rounds of hiring when the City of Chicago relied on its concededly discriminatory test to exclude the plaintiffs from consideration."
2009.08-974,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1031.293,1037.798,Why would Congress have wanted to allow a question like this to be left open for such an extended period of time?
2009.08-974,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1076.007,1086.713,"I agree that there -- there might be policy arguments against it as well as for it, but here's the way I think we look at it -- and the United States is the nation's largest employer, and we face similar concerns."
2009.08-974,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1206.992,1214.479,"Well, actually in -- in this case, am I correct that -- that 9 years has gone by, but that's because of the litigation?"
2009.08-974,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1218.883,1225.554,"The first charge was filed, I believe, 420 days after the January 26th announcement of the test results."
2009.08-974,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1290.312,1291.112,So you get--
2009.08-974,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1291.112,1295.497,Was it -- was it 132 named people or was it just 132 undifferentiated?
2009.08-974,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1295.497,1305.503,"I think it was 132 undifferentiated people, and then I think there -- and Mr. Payton can, I think, fully explain how the randomization of awards was allocated."
2009.08-974,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1305.503,1313.959,"--So everybody gets 132 over 6,000 times whatever the number of people who would have been hired?"
2009.08-974,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1313.959,1314.442,Right.
2009.08-974,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1314.978,1315.811,I mean the pay for the number of people.
2009.08-974,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1315.811,1316.261,--Right.
2009.08-974,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1344.247,1354.853,I think you had a footnote in your reply brief that said that if your position prevails there would need to be an adjustment in the relief granted by the district court--
2009.08-974,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1354.853,1355.253,That is--
2009.08-974,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1355.253,1355.836,--wasn't it?
2009.08-974,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1355.836,1356.721,--That is correct.
2009.08-974,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.343,1422.43,And that would be clear even though it had not been established much earlier that the test was invalid.
2009.08-974,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1435.757,1437.09,"That's exactly correct, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-974,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1437.09,1442.844,What -- of what use is a statute of limitations that -- that -- that operates that way?
2009.08-974,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1442.844,1454.384,"Let me say two things: First is I think (h)(2) refers to 10 years is itself action upon the results, and so I think as a statutory matter the language decides it."
2009.08-974,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1493.259,1502.715,So I suppose the benefit is not that the City knows it's safe -- it can rely on a test and all that -- but knows that it only has to pay 300 days back.
2009.08-974,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1502.715,1511.155,"That is -- that is -- that is the benefit of that particular back pay limitation, yes."
2009.08-974,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1531.051,1532.184,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1540.657,1552.382,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In January 1996, the City adopted and announced an eligibility list for hiring candidates who sat for the firefighters' examination."
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1616.49,1628.982,"Suppose there were no list, but each time there was a hiring round the City just took from the top -- from the top score down."
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1637.654,1647.01,"If I understand correctly, that would be the same case as this, for this reason: A list is used in a couple of different ways."
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1665.221,1668.339,"No, my -- my hypothetical was there's no list at all."
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1668.339,1669.023,If--
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1669.023,1673.741,"They just go back to the raw scores, and each time they picked the top people."
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1673.741,1688.667,"--So that actually -- if we're going back to the scores but no announcement has been made ever that we are going to use the scores in a certain way, we agree that every time the city actually consulted the scores, there would be a new claim."
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1689.584,1696.587,"Well, what is -- what is the list, other than an administratively convenient way to use the scores?"
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1696.587,1703.841,"--The list was the device that limited and classified Petitioners in this case, and that's why it's so important."
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1750.303,1770.265,"So even though there is a clear case on the merits of disparate impact, unless the suit is commenced within 30 days of the announcement, then it's as though it were lawful."
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1771.65,1776.685,"--The statute, (a)(2), requires an unlawful--"
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1776.685,1779.822,Is that -- is that -- there's a free pass.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1800.568,1806.555,"--That is the function of the operation of the statute of limitations, and of course it's not unique to Title VII."
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1806.555,1810.424,But this is not exactly a title -- a statute of limitations.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1814.443,1815.328,Correct.
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1815.945,1818.697,There's also a 2-year statute of limitations in Title VII.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1822.165,1833.123,"--The 300-day charging period under Title VII functions like a statute of limitations, and when a timely charge is not filed, no recovery can be had for that claim."
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1838.861,1844.764,"You -- you don't have one case, I think, certainly not from this Court, of disparate impact."
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1848.382,1871.998,"--The cases are disparate treatment cases, Justice Ginsburg, but the rule should be the same in this case for several reasons: First, those cases reflect that the reason there is not a present violation when the consequences of a prior discriminatory act are felt is because the defining feature of the claim is absent within the charging period."
2009.08-974,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1897.03,1897.982,How is it absent?
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1912.742,1913.475,Right.
2009.08-974,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1913.475,1917.61,--a particular employment practice that has a disparate impact.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1935.838,1947.213,"I -- I have two responses, Justice Breyer, and the first is that section (k), which is what Your Honor is quoting from, does not describe accrual, and it does not define the underlying violation."
2009.08-974,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1982.8,1986.937,So why don't we look at subsection (h)--
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1986.937,1987.587,--Subsection--
2009.08-974,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1987.587,1989.889,--that says -- and it's an --
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1999.929,2000.362,--Correct.
2009.08-974,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2000.362,2003.364,"So when you hire, aren't you acting upon the results?"
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2013.338,2016.29,Because there is no act that limits and classifies.
2009.08-974,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2019.508,2022.194,I -- I go back to Justice Breyer's point.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2037.37,2039.572,"--Well, that's what is actually missing in this case."
2009.08-974,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2047.641,2050.11,"But isn't that what ""practice and policy"" means?"
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2057.949,2072.959,"Petitioners continued to be ineligible for as long as the list was used in the way that we said at the outset it was going to be used; namely, that the well-qualified pool, the priority hiring pool, would be called first."
2009.08-974,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2093.02,2094.37,"May I ask this question, Ms. Solomon?"
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2106.261,2106.78,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-974,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2108.647,2112.165,Suppose the practice were a high school diploma.
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2115.969,2119.505,"And let's add to that, that it was adopted 10 years ago--"
2009.08-974,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2119.505,2119.955,That's right.
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2119.955,2124.825,--and Duke Power announced to the world that it was going to use a high school diploma.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2131.562,2150.44,A case like that might present different accrual problems for this reason: There might be several appropriate times when a person affected by a policy like that could be said actually to have been limited and classified in their employment opportunities.
2009.08-974,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2184.113,2187.982,"No, but -- but in my example, everybody who is not a high school graduate would have been affected right away."
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2187.982,2204.242,"--But if they are not interested in employment with that employer, then they are not -- it -- you -- they are certainly affected in one sense of the word, but they're perhaps -- it would not be possible to say their employment opportunities had been affected."
2009.08-974,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2220.101,2225.405,You force people to challenge the practice when they don't even know if it's going to affect them.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2240.515,2241.117,--Right.
2009.08-974,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2241.117,2247.271,"And I think your position is that, well, he should have filed that suit earlier, no?"
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2247.271,2252.924,Our position is that the charging period runs from the unlawful practice.
2009.08-974,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2255.207,2256.376,"Well, but what is the unlawful practice?"
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2256.376,2264.982,--The unlawful practice here was limiting and classifying Petitioners in a way that deprived them of their employment opportunities.
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2268.1,2269.267,Can we put that in concrete terms?
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2282.342,2282.827,--Correct.
2009.08-974,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2295.501,2299.536,So could you answer Justice Stevens's hypothetical?
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2329.675,2338.011,--The statute requires that the -- the complainant be limited and classified in their employment opportunity.
2009.08-974,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2338.53,2353.29,"So what is the difference between the policy announcement that each time I hire, I'm not going to use a high school -- I'm not going to look at people who don't have a high school diploma, and I'm not going to look at people who don't have a test score above 89."
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2355.156,2364.246,"--The difference is that once Petitioners here were classified out of the eligible pool for priority hiring, they were out."
2009.08-974,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2375.786,2380.19,"Well, somebody getting -- someone getting a letter that you sent to people who were qualified didn't know that."
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2408.59,2409.19,--With respect--
2009.08-974,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2409.19,2409.709,--did you?
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2409.709,2423.267,"--With respect, Justice Alito, the letter does say that because of the large number of people who were classified well-qualified, a step ahead of where Petitioners were classified, it was not likely that they were going to be hired."
2009.08-974,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2423.267,2423.583,Right.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2424.0,2427.921,"And for that reason, that is when the injury and the impact was felt."
2009.08-974,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2448.115,2452.202,"Just to follow up on Justice Alito's question, what if it were different?"
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2464.26,2464.927,--Correct.
2009.08-974,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2477.318,2479.218,"Well, that's kind of a bad policy, isn't it?"
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2485.139,2488.975,"--With respect, Chief Justice Roberts, they are injured."
2009.08-974,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2491.994,2492.477,"Oh, sure."
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2506.068,2508.52,They are injured by a 4-month delay.
2009.08-974,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2508.52,2508.97,Yes.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2508.97,2522.78,"But there may be circumstances in which information is not conveyed in a way that would put a reasonable person on notice that he or she had a claim right at the outset, and that relates also to the high school diploma hypothetical."
2009.08-974,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2523.114,2531.535,"Well, why did the City say that it was planning to give a new test in 3 years and then wait more than a decade before giving a new test?"
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2544.962,2556.318,"--But it wouldn't change the fact that there had been, at least a -- if you wait for the next list, you still have been delayed at least 3 years in your ability to be hired as a firefighter."
2009.08-974,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2596.528,2597.111,But you don't challenge that.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2597.111,2597.594,--surely the Court--
2009.08-974,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2597.594,2598.544,You don't challenge that.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2602.848,2604.698,--We have not pressed that claim.
2009.08-974,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2606.734,2610.502,And were you prejudiced by the delay in the filing of the EEOC charge?
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2610.502,2618.774,--There was some testimony -- and we quote it in our brief -- about things that the person responsible for setting the cutoff score could not remember.
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2649.794,2651.144,You didn't have to take the list down.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2661.268,2662.051,--I -- I believe--
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2662.051,2662.984,You didn't have to throw out the list.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2662.984,2663.534,--I believe--
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2663.534,2664.817,You didn't have to throw out the test.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2664.817,2667.436,--I believe the Court's opinion in Ricci addresses that as well.
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2676.542,2684.714,I thought the expert said -- the test devisor said he didn't make up that 89 percent cutoff.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2687.249,2692.403,--He -- his reason for suggesting the 65 cutoff score was because of the adverse impact.
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2718.769,2720.471,But you -- you've lost -- you've lost on that.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2720.471,2720.887,--We have.
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2751.173,2764.833,"No, but -- but going to 65, opening up the classification, is not adjusting the scores; it's not taking the list down; it's just saying anyone who passes the test can proceed to the next step."
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2764.833,2769.618,--It seriously diminished the opportunities of the people who were at 89 and above.
2009.08-974,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2778.791,2789.448,"You've got to -- I mean, you've just got to take your -- get as good legal advice as you can and determine is it -- are we going to be in more trouble if we follow the test or more trouble if we -- if we take it down?"
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2795.769,2799.721,"--Correct, but read in conjunction with the 300-day charging period."
2009.08-974,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2805.125,2805.841,"Well, I'm sorry."
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2810.779,2811.679,I -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-974,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2903.121,2910.894,"How do you -- the problem I have with all of this -- it makes entire sense, except when you read subpart (k), it says"
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2928.189,2928.872,--Correct.
2009.08-974,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2929.472,2930.389,Which is what happened here.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2930.389,2931.308,--But the fact--
2009.08-974,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2931.308,2931.958,They used--
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2931.958,2933.141,"--Excuse me, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-974,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2940.264,2941.43,--Where -- where does it go on?
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2942.597,2953.255,"--It goes on to say that the respondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged process is job-related, or subpart (ii), there is an alternative practice with less disparate impact."
2009.08-974,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3028.053,3030.905,Is my impression -- is there anything else in that (k)?
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,3055.401,3056.353,"--Right, and that's why--"
2009.08-974,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3056.353,3060.488,"And -- and so I thought, looking at the list, it's quite right that it's used for a different purpose but--"
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,3060.488,3061.338,--It's not--
2009.08-974,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3061.338,3068.161,"--But, I mean, this (k) has to do with a different thing, but -- but -- and the critical element of it was that the practice be used."
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,3068.161,3074.565,"--You -- but again, even if (k) is consulted -- and for the reasons that I just outlined we don't think that it should be."
2009.08-974,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3091.175,3097.162,"Well, you'd have to then say that all the things that are there, the other nine and so forth -- all those nine things--"
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,3097.162,3097.729,This is actually--
2009.08-974,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3097.729,3098.179,--Well--
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,3098.179,3099.145,"--Excuse me, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-974,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3108.351,3108.851,--Yes.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,3108.851,3110.637,--you really can't pluck a few words out of the middle.
2009.08-974,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3110.637,3111.837,"No, well, that's true -- it does--"
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,3111.837,3120.675,"But even if one is going to consult it to determine accrual, what it says is that the use of an employment practice with adverse impact."
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3174.96,3177.245,That was a disparate treatment case.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,3177.245,3178.745,"Correct, but there is no--"
2009.08-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3178.745,3187.601,And the -- the argument here is disparate impact is different because there's no need to show intent of disparate impact.
2009.08-974,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,3187.601,3188.052,--Correct.
2009.08-974,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3344.47,3345.27,"--Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-974,3,32390,john_a_payton,,3347.755,3348.922,Thank you.
2009.08-974,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3558.024,3559.508,"Thank you, counsel."
