1978.78-425,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.161,We'll hear arguments next in Pfeiffer Company against the Diversion Ford and others.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,18.062,23.386,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,183.763,191.567,"Mr. Vickery, this case doesn't involve any controversy about situs, does it, but only about status?"
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,191.567,211.806,"Situs is not at issue, Bryant, the cotton header was injured in a warehouse and the vessel would moor outside at the pier alongside this warehouse and Diversion Ford was injured on railroad tracks, it ran out onto the pier in the Port of Beaumont Navigation District, so situs is not an issue."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,211.806,212.596,And does exist.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,212.926,214.274,It does exist in this case.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,214.91,217.176,This is over the question of status.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,217.176,218.927,Question of status.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,226.729,227.771,"Hmm, yes."
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,227.771,232.406,"But other than that, situs is not involved."
1978.78-425,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,379.976,381.821,Do they strip containers?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,381.821,383.027,"No, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,383.027,385.17,They're not subject to that type of work?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,385.17,385.683,"No, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,385.683,388.192,"Ford is special, he's not subject to that assignment?"
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,388.192,394.304,The union contract provides that that is deep sea long shore work.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,397.143,415.576,"In your brief, Mr. Vickery you urged the court not to place too much or any emphasis in its test in determining status on whether or not the claimant is a longshoreman, at least as I read your brief."
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,415.576,416.682,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,416.682,422.139,"Although the statute does make that one of the tests, doesn't it?"
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,422.139,431.558,"Well, I think the statute requires him to be both a longshoreman and at the time of his injury to be engaged in maritime employment."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,432.216,436.655,"So right, so then being a longshoreman is part of the test or one of the tests, isn't it?"
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,436.655,437.142,"Yes, but if he --"
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,437.142,440.593,Under the statute whether we like it or not?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,440.593,448.788,But let me give you an illustration of why I think you have to consider something other than longshoreman as an occupation.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,461.406,461.857,"Well, what if he --"
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,461.857,464.025,He would've been a longshoreman by occupation.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,464.025,481.745,"What if the collective bargaining agreement was the Teamsters Local, would then that trucking company had said in this case, we're going to call every truck driver a longshoreman and that's your job, longshoreman, just because you might someday want to get the advantage of this federal statute."
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,481.745,482.331,"Well, I think that's --"
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,482.331,486.107,Does that make him a longshoreman if he's called so and if that's a job classification?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,486.107,486.418,"No, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,486.712,488.025,-- Hmm?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,488.025,488.633,"No, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,488.734,489.472,Why does it exist?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,492.356,498.331,"In my submission, the test is the traditional definition of maritime and along what this Court has given it."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,498.331,503.28,But it says -- the statute says including any longshoreman and so what does that mean?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,503.28,506.832,A longshoreman is a man who loads and unloads vessels.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,506.832,507.973,On the day he was hurt --
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,507.973,508.001,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,508.001,509.265,-- according to the statute?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,509.265,510.414,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,510.414,513.532,Whatever his job description is?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,513.532,516.534,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,524.466,531.654,Even though his job description is something else like a laborer or messenger or something else.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,531.654,532.005,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,539.71,540.962,Who is drafted?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,540.962,541.427,Sir?
1978.78-425,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,541.427,546.125,What if he is a night watchman who is drafted to do some loading and unloading?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,546.125,556.022,"I think if he's involved in a loading or the unloading of the vessel, Congress intended to cover him because I think he is subject to being assigned to work either on the dock or on the vessel and --"
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,556.022,556.234,"Oh, that's covered by other persons --"
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,556.234,558.048,-- he becomes an amphibious worker.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,558.048,561.206,That's covered by other person engaged in longshoring operations?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,561.206,561.648,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,561.648,568.507,What I'm -- my question goes to what your understanding is of the statutory meaning of longshoreman.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,570.04,570.276,Alright.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,578.698,587.053,"Well, then why isn't it tautological in view of the other statutory language person engaged in longshoring operations?"
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,587.053,588.732,Why did they have to add that?
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,588.732,593.412,"Yes, why isn't -- why is it -- how -- wholly meaningless if that's all it means?"
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,593.412,599.779,"Well, it -- there are other people who engage in longshoring operations beside a longshoreman."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,599.779,601.924,You said that's the definition of what a longshoreman is.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,601.924,602.968,Alright.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,668.237,674.446,"And is it on the day of the accident, what if he was a longshoreman up until yesterday?"
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,674.446,674.66,That's why you need --
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,674.66,675.865,How many are there?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,675.865,678.406,That's why you need the maritime employment.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,678.406,679.161,"Oh, I know but that's a separate --"
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,679.161,679.711,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,679.711,681.985,-- that stat -- a separate statutory language.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,681.985,682.852,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,682.852,686.81,It's our duty to try to give meaning to every word of the statute if we can.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,686.81,703.578,"And what I'm trying to say to you is and -- because he is a longshoreman today, if he -- he has to be engaged in maritime employment tomorrow just like he does today when he's working as a longshoreman."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,789.298,790.333,And what did the Ninth Circuit -- to say?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,790.333,794.768,The Ninth Circuit held that he was no longer a longshoreman.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,801.69,802.705,So he wasn't covered by the statute.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,802.705,805.5,So he was not covered by the statute.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,824.516,830.347,"Well, whatever the word means, you think he has to be that at the time that he's injured or killed?"
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,830.347,830.898,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,830.898,832.797,To be covered by the statute?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,832.797,833.976,If you're going to use just the word --
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,833.976,838.279,"I mean if he'd never been a longshoreman, maybe he'd been a electro -- a lawyer --"
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,838.279,838.609,Right.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,838.609,843.163,"-- until this morning he was hired as a longshoreman, if he is here -- if he is killed today then he is a longshoreman --"
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,843.163,843.832,He's a longshoreman.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,843.869,844.288,-- he'd covered by the statute.
1978.78-425,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,844.288,864.597,"Well, suppose he didnt died a longshoreman wheeled something off a ship and wheeled it right to a truck, wheeled it right to a truck that was going to carry it away and he was helped by Mr. Ford and the truck driver to load the truck and all three got hurt."
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,869.847,875.106,Mr. -- that's -- the legislative history makes it clear that he is not covered.
1978.78-425,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,875.106,877.81,Then is it because of what?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,877.81,880.122,Because he is not engaged in maritime employment.
1978.78-425,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,880.122,882.811,That he isn't engaged in longshoring operations?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,882.811,884.133,He's not engaged in longshoring operation.
1978.78-425,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.133,892.326,"Well, but this piece of cargo came straight off the ship and is being loaded right on the truck."
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,892.326,892.949,Alright.
1978.78-425,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.077,904.671,So you'd say that the driver --
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,904.671,906.122,All have to meet maritime employment test.
1978.78-425,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,906.122,910.289,"Did the truck driver just isn't engaged in maritime employment, that excludes him, you say?"
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,910.289,910.398,That's right.
1978.78-425,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,910.398,917.389,"How about -- how about in this same accident at the same moment, the longshoreman would be -- clearly be covered."
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,917.389,918.247,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,918.247,919.657,Because he is unloading the ship.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,919.657,920.003,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,920.003,921.132,Then he is a longshoreman.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,942.12,947.884,I do not think he would covered because he would not meet the maritime employment status test.
1978.78-425,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,956.828,960.023,"Oh, I know but here comes a piece of cargo off the vessel."
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,968.198,971.543,He is engaged in longshoring operations at that time.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1000.006,1010.68,"But Mr. Vickery, its not your contention that the injured employee has to be engaged in work on mari -- navigable waters at the time of his injury to be covered --"
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1010.68,1011.255,"No, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1011.255,1011.766,"-- at all, isn't it?"
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1011.766,1012.261,"No, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1023.858,1024.267,Right.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1024.267,1037.387,"Prior to the 1972 amendments, men who are engaged in maritime employment as this Court have repeatedly defined it were subject to having a compensation remedy determined as Congress said."
1978.78-425,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1037.387,1040.827,"Well, you said -- I thought you said a while ago there wasn't any situs problem in this case?"
1978.78-425,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1040.827,1041.285,There isn't.
1978.78-425,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1041.285,1045.434,And there wouldn't -- why would there have been a situs problem in my example?
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1045.434,1055.689,There is no situs problem involved in your example Mr. Justice White but in determining maritime employment where the person is working is determinative to that issue.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1112.287,1116.919,"But your case and some of the other cases were purely situs cases, weren't they?"
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1120.363,1121.328,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1121.328,1123.09,That was his job.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1123.09,1123.957,That's right.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1123.957,1130.668,But he was injured on navigable waters and therefore it was held that the FELA was not applicable.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1130.668,1131.706,That's right because --
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1131.706,1133.496,And it was a situs case.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1133.496,1136.96,Because -- because he was working on navigable waters is --
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1136.96,1137.002,Correct.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1137.002,1139.344,This is what made him engaged in maritime employment.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1139.344,1140.747,Even though he is a railroad brakeman.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1140.747,1142.88,Even though he was a railroad brakeman.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1143.632,1146.35,"So it wasn't a status, it was a situs case."
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1146.35,1163.065,"Well, the only person who had to have any stat -- status prior to the 1972 amendments was the employer and the employer had to meet the maritime employment test by showing that it had employees who worked on navigable waters."
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1172.591,1173.545,Was an employer --
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1173.545,1173.679,Was --
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1173.679,1175.023,-- within the meaning of the then statute.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1175.023,1177.608,Alright and that required maritime employment.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1177.608,1178.4,Right.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1178.4,1185.16,And that's what I'm saying that's where the court got the definition of maritime employment from the employer definition.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1197.313,1198.07,Right.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1204.411,1206.129,It was a five to four -- I'm sorry I don't recall who wrote it.
1978.78-425,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1206.129,1207.697,I think Mr. Justice Reed wrote the opinion.
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1207.697,1209.856,But it was a five to four decision.
1978.78-425,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1214.206,1215.214,"Very well, Mr. Vickery."
1978.78-425,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1215.214,1218.448,Thank you.
1978.78-425,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1218.448,1225.777,Mr. Bryson.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1225.777,1228.897,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1296.811,1300.685,Would that definition of yours include Mr. Justice White's truck driver in this case?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1300.685,1303.423,"No, it would not Mr. Justice Blackmun and the reason would be --"
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1303.423,1305.901,How would he be excluded?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1308.291,1315.326,"Well, there -- essentially the reason is that that truck driver would not be engaged in maritime employment."
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1341.094,1342.469,"Well, you said most of his efforts."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1345.253,1345.435,But --
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1345.435,1350.112,"-- in Mr. Justice White's illustration, he was doing something more than that."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1350.112,1363.34,"Exactly, but as this Court pointed out in the Caputo case, the whole thrust of the Act is to look to the nature of employment not the particular act of the employee, he is engaged in at the time."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1363.34,1364.132,"Yes, it is over by both --"
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1364.132,1364.676,(Inaudible)
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1364.676,1365.729,Excuse me.
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1365.729,1371.548,Caputo case -- the opinion expressly excluded the truck driver.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1371.548,1372.077,Exactly.
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1372.077,1376.65,And my question of course is whether your proposed test doesn't include him?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1376.65,1397.369,"No, I think not and the reason being that we focused on the marine terminal worker because this is a person who spends all of his time who as a matter of profession, as a matter of occupation, is someone who is constantly dealing with cargo that has immediately been unloaded from a vessel or is about to be loaded on to a vessel."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1422.509,1429.669,"And Mr. Bryson, what do you think the phrase maritime employment means?"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1429.669,1433.856,"Well, the term of course is not given --"
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1433.856,1439.698,"Well, it has been defined rather -- it's become almost a term of art in the decisions of this Court, hasn't it?"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1439.698,1441.739,"Well, the decisions of the court which counsel referred --"
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1441.739,1447.452,And indeed the predecessor statute required the employer to be in the maritime employment in order to be a covered employer.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1449.095,1449.929,He had to have some of his --
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1449.929,1456.509,"-- in maritime employment and that was given a specific and almost -- became almost a term of art, didn't it?"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1456.509,1458.778,He had some of his employment -- employees --
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1458.778,1459.329,In maritime --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1459.329,1461.557,-- engaged in -- over navigable waters.
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1461.557,1462.453,Yes.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1462.453,1465.842,"Now, navigable waters has been redefined."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1467.521,1469.99,"Yes, but maritime employment hasn't been defined at all, has it?"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1469.99,1470.196,No.
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1471.159,1471.396,-- in the statute?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1471.396,1471.642,-- been defined.
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1471.642,1478.42,So wouldn't it be the national thing to look at -- to see what that term means in the decisions of the courts?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1478.42,1483.124,"Well, but the problem Mr. Justice Stewart with trying to define maritime employment the way it was used although I think not defined in the old cases."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1504.457,1504.475,But they are --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1504.475,1505.682,"-- for instance, ship builders."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1505.682,1508.515,But they are because they're specifically covered by the statute.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1508.515,1528.664,"Well, that's right but the statute says maritime employment and then proceeds to include a number of groups within that concept of maritime employment and the legislative history on that point is quite clear that it means the entire group of specific occupations to be within the notion of maritime employment."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1590.099,1590.129,So that's why we're here.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1590.129,1591.488,-- in trying to find the statute.
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1591.488,1593.675,What's a shipbreaker?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1593.675,1606.267,"A shipbreaker I believe is someone who is either in the conversion, it's a form of ship repair, that I think it's a form of converting ships from one form to another."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1614.956,1615.993,You mean --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1615.993,1616.374,"-- excuse me, on sea."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1616.374,1617.442,Set foot on navigable waters --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1617.442,1617.94,On navigable waters --
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1617.94,1618.269,If he --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1618.269,1619.631,-- as it used to be defined.
1978.78-425,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1644.04,1652.611,"Mr. Bryson, are those two separate entities or one entity for purposes of appellate review, the director and the board?"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1652.611,1655.475,"For the purpose -- well, they are clearly two different entities."
1978.78-425,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1670.464,1674.371,Who -- where is the director authorized to be a party in these proceedings?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1691.204,1697.627,"Well, the director is designated to defend the board's orders and I do not know that --"
1978.78-425,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1697.627,1698.451,By whom?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1698.451,1705.291,"I believe in the statute, there is a provision which provide --"
1978.78-425,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1705.291,1706.051,In the statute?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1706.051,1719.675,In the statute there's a provision which provides that the Secretary of Labor shall assign attorneys to administer the Act and to -- I believe it says to defend the board's orders as well.
1978.78-425,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1721.01,1726.748,Why wouldn't the board nonetheless be the party all -- albeit defended by attorneys assigned by the --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1726.748,1731.064,"Well, then it -- and there have been some cases in which the board has been named as a party."
1978.78-425,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1740.712,1742.719,And you feel that's immaterial?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1742.719,1755.577,"Here, because what happened here that -- although there is some dispute in -- as to whether the board has the power -- excuse me, the director has the power to seek review of the board order which is contrary to the director's position."
1978.78-425,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1767.43,1769.924,There was no internal inconsistency?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1769.924,1771.708,"That's right, no not here."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1794.835,1809.219,"Doesn't that go very far toward a -- as I think was suggested in question a few moments ago by my Brother Blackmun, doesn't that go very far toward eliminating this -- the status requirement in the statute?"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1809.219,1809.986,It doesn't --
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1809.986,1814.234,Assuming the employer is a covered employer could -- because he has other employees who work --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1814.234,1815.415,Exactly.
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1815.415,1821.644,"And then doesn't that go awfully forward toward eliminating the status requirement as to the employee, the claimant?"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1821.644,1826.42,"Well, with respect to cargo handlers, it certainly does."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1838.238,1838.636,Alright.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1838.636,1850.141,"Now, the legislative history does point out that certain kinds of employees even though they may be there on the situs are not covered and that would include for instance clerical employees."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1850.141,1852.867,"It's one thing if their employer is not covered, they are not covered."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1852.867,1856.341,"Well, if their employer is -- their employer maybe covered."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1856.341,1859.407,If he's not in “employer” as defined by the Act?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1859.407,1861.923,"No, he may be an employer and then they still not be covered."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1861.923,1863.858,"Yes, but if he is not then they're not covered."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1863.858,1864.464,Oh exactly.
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1864.464,1866.138,"And if he is, they may or may not be covered."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1866.138,1866.803,Exactly.
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1866.803,1867.429,That's right.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1867.429,1868.569,Right.
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1873.092,1873.739,Clerical employees --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1873.739,1876.703,Clerical employees may well not be because it's --
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1876.703,1883.313,"It may well, what about a clerical employee who's doing clerical work in connection with moving cargo from -- within the maritime --"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1883.313,1884.868,"Well, that -- that gets --"
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1884.868,1885.933,As a trucker?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1885.933,1887.287,"Well, that's exactly right."
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1903.522,1913.583,"What if he had a truck driver -- what if he had a truck driver who worked exclusively on the pier between, say a warehouse and hauling cargo from the warehouse to a railroad pick up?"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1913.583,1914.677,He would be covered.
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1914.677,1916.066,As a truck driver he would be covered?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1916.066,1930.99,"Well, he would be covered because he would be engaged in the overall process of moving the cargo in the marine terminal area between the vessel and the land for the land transportation which is the railroad which would take it off."
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1935.518,1939.913,And within the railroad to which he is delivered it was five miles off the maritime site.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1939.913,1941.577,"Well, if it was off the --"
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1941.577,1946.746,But he regularly picked -- took it up from the warehouse on the site to the --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1946.746,1947.396,Well --
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1947.396,1950.966,-- railroad station five miles away?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1950.966,1952.382,That's a difficult question to answer.
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1974.041,1977.584,It could be under your definition as I understand your brief.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1977.584,1978.356,I don't believe so.
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1997.143,2005.788,"He regularly worked within the terminal moving cargo between maritime transportation and land transportation, everyday he does it."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2005.788,2009.584,But he is not working within the confines of the terminal.
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2010.54,2014.659,Not all day but he does for the first portion of his journey.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2014.659,2016.312,The portion of the journey in which he --
1978.78-425,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2016.312,2022.348,"Are you -- is your test limited to the case in which the land transportation commences within the terminal, is that the test?"
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2022.348,2023.616,He in fact know.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2023.616,2038.556,Where the land transportation commences at the interface between the term -- where the terminal employees give the cargo over to a mode of land transportation at that point and the land transportation takes it elsewhere.
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2038.556,2041.055,"Well, that's unloading but not how about the loading?"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2041.055,2043.117,"Well, in the case of loading, the reverse should apply."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2053.568,2057.042,"-- of the discredited point of rest test, doesn't it?"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2057.042,2058.946,"Well, I think not."
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.199,2079.342,Your hypothesis is that land transportation always commences right on the edge of the terminal?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2079.342,2081.454,"No, it may not be but --"
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2081.454,2085.183,"Couldn't he not -- sometimes commenced within, sometimes on the edge and sometimes without."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2085.183,2085.751,Exactly.
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2085.906,2087.878,And you get different results in those three cases?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2087.878,2089.07,"No, I don't think so Mr. Justice Stevens."
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2089.07,2098.244,"So that even if the land transportation commences five miles outside the terminal, if the truck driver regularly goes within the terminal, he's covered."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2099.757,2101.697,"No, I think not because he would be basically --"
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2101.697,2102.812,"Well, there are three cases."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2110.213,2110.338,I think the --
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2110.338,2112.307,You'll get different results in the three?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2112.307,2112.836,I don't think so.
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2120.659,2123.144,"He always picks it up within, he's unloading."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2142.555,2145.903,I may have your hypothetical somewhat mixed up.
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2149.933,2151.71,You put some cotton in the warehouse.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2167.326,2171.441,"No, I would say none of those three cases would be covered."
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2171.441,2172.325,"Oh, none would be covered."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2172.325,2174.81,"No, I think none of those three cases would be covered."
1978.78-425,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2175.288,2177.48,He's working on the water?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2177.48,2181.094,"If -- well, but the point is that the railroad employee here --"
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2181.094,2182.261,He's not a railroad employee.
1978.78-425,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2184.341,2184.556,That's right.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2184.556,2184.792,Right.
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2184.792,2186.564,"That's our hypothesis all the way through, an employer --"
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2186.564,2186.979,Right.
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2186.979,2188.272,-- who has some employees.
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2188.272,2188.681,Right.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2188.681,2194.303,-- and if the -- his basic employment was to move the --
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2194.303,2196.833,Countervails from a warehouse to a railroad?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2196.833,2207.577,"I would say he would not be covered because he would be moving basically engaged in land transportation into a marine terminal and further activities once you get to the marine terminal, further activities within the terminal --"
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2207.577,2209.613,"Oh, I was talking about unloading."
1978.78-425,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2209.613,2213.469,"Oh, I think he -- you're -- Justice Stevens is asking you about just taking the stuff away, aren't you?"
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2213.469,2213.966,That's right.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2216.643,2216.858,Right.
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2216.858,2219.56,-- from the ship to the land transportation.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2220.798,2221.271,Right.
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2221.271,2224.038,"And you say he's never covered because he's a truck driver, is that it?"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2224.038,2225.645,"Well, that is different."
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2225.922,2226.716,-- it's --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2226.716,2228.398,-- an important element in determining --
1978.78-425,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2228.398,2229.655,Well --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2229.655,2236.647,"Well, because he's basically engaged in transporting cargo from a marine terminal to somewhere else."
1978.78-425,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.647,2237.546,To a railroad?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2237.546,2237.633,Right.
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2237.633,2244.12,Every example I give you is from a warehouse within the terminal to a railroad which is going to ship it to New York or some place --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2244.12,2244.215,Right.
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.215,2244.971,-- across the country.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2244.971,2245.279,Right.
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2245.279,2252.999,"And the three different examples are one, where the railroad has the spur on the terminal, secondly right at the edge and thirdly outside."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2252.999,2254.96,"I'm sorry, I did misunderstand your example."
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2260.608,2261.172,Alright.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2261.172,2262.385,"I'm -- I am sorry, I --"
1978.78-425,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2262.385,2265.297,And you'd say he'd be covered if it's right at the edge?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2265.297,2266.387,"If it is right at the edge, if the --"
1978.78-425,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2266.387,2268.599,"Now, what if it is six inches outside the edge?"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2268.599,2271.019,"Well, if it's six inches outside the edge, I think he would also --"
1978.78-425,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2271.019,2272.854,What if it's ten feet outside the edge?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2272.854,2274.932,"Well, that's the kind of problem you're going to get."
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2275.985,2280.218,"You're asking us to draw a good hard fast line and have you got that line firmly in mind, that's what --"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2280.218,2280.506,"Well, the --"
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2280.506,2281.745,-- I'm trying to find out.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2281.745,2286.582,The problem is that this situation doesn't appear very often in the industry.
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2316.286,2320.39,But then are you saying that his entire employment must be on the situs?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2320.39,2321.481,No.
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2321.573,2323.055,Then --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2323.055,2329.156,He may -- it may be that he is basically employed on the situs.
1978.78-425,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2342.687,2350.148,"I have seen some of these term, but I guess we all did, and I am seeing one yet that has a sign that says this is six inches passed."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2354.715,2355.189,"Well, the --"
1978.78-425,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2355.189,2356.724,Isn't that true?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2359.729,2361.56,"Well, in these cases it was --"
1978.78-425,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2361.56,2364.663,"If they don't have a fence, how do you know where the end of it?"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2364.805,2380.247,"Well, the -- the terminal is generally defined by the relationship of the land transportation and the sea, transmittal of cargo between the sea and the land transportation device as either the railroad or a truck."
1978.78-425,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2383.693,2399.81,"When this -- where truck comes in, what I'm trying to get in my mind clear, onto the wharf, onto the pier, or whatever you want to call it, do you know exactly when it's on the pier?"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2399.81,2400.4,When it's on the --
1978.78-425,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2400.4,2404.369,Is there a sign that says this is the pier?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2404.369,2404.822,It may well --
1978.78-425,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2404.822,2406.105,Of course there is none.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2406.105,2414.58,"Well, in many cases for instance as in the Port of Beaumont, there is a sign that says this is the Port of Beaumont and in some cases it's true."
1978.78-425,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2414.58,2415.767,It's up in there?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2415.767,2416.76,"Well, that's true."
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2425.364,2442.578,"But in the point, the -- Mr. Bryson in the Caputo, reading from page 253 of the opinion, the container Blundo was checking, had been taken off a vessels at another pier facility outside of Brooklyn and brought overland unopened by an independent trucking company to the 21st Street pier."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2448.94,2453.369,"Well, that truck driver -- I believe, although I'm not sure that the record reflects it."
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2456.941,2459.123,"Again, assuming he was employed by an employer, would that --"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2459.123,2475.444,"Well, if he were employed by the terminal operator let's say, I would think he would be covered because he'd be moving between one facility of the terminal and another where you'd basically -- well, that may be and he would still be -- because the cargo had not been unloaded at that point he would still be --"
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2475.444,2486.259,"All I'm suggesting to you is that moving from one maritime terminal to another, it isn't very different for moving from one maritime terminal to a railroad station five miles away and I'm sure that happens fairly often."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2486.259,2501.707,"Well, I think that the usual pattern is for the railroad spur to be coming up to the terminal and if it is the employee of the terminal operator that is doing the moving, he would be engaged in longshoring operations."
1978.78-425,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.347,2507.522,I think -- but then the gang point now is just -- extends to the edge of the terminal?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2507.522,2508.935,That's right.
1978.78-425,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2561.163,2562.843,What if that's situs again.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2569.885,2571.318,"Certainly, except that before 1972 --"
1978.78-425,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2571.318,2573.623,Isn't it important not to confuse the -- confuse them.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2573.623,2573.976,Exactly.
1978.78-425,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.976,2576.092,Because they're confusing enough statute as it is.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2576.092,2577.756,It certainly is.
1978.78-425,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2613.16,2620.441,"Oh, do you say that you can have maritime employment without ever being subject to assignment and employment as --"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2620.441,2623.488,"Exactly, as in the case of a shipbuilder for instance."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2649.405,2652.082,"Well, the result might have been different if he had not been."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2652.082,2652.843,"Well, but the court did not --"
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2652.843,2654.573,It's hard to tell from that opinion.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2654.573,2670.463,"The court did not in discussing Mr. Blundo's status and why he was in -- was -- had a status that was a maritime status, they did not -- the court did not referred to the fact that he was subject to assignment on the ship."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2670.463,2672.284,Whether it should be -- an opinion as a matter of --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2672.284,2674.404,"It's in the facts, that's true."
1978.78-425,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2675.241,2682.431,The outer limit then of this employment test is maritime employment?
1978.78-425,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2682.431,2685.372,"A case like this, which should not have --"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2685.372,2686.255,That's right.
1978.78-425,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2686.255,2690.619,Someone who was not engaged in maritime employment couldn't qualify?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2690.619,2691.625,That's right.
1978.78-425,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2754.291,2764.481,So you would -- but your test could also cover the worker who took a cargo out of a warehouse on the dock that have been stored there for five or six days.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2764.481,2765.216,"Well, that's true."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2765.216,2766.89,"How was that in that -- this case, with respect to --"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2766.89,2767.635,That's this case.
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2834.841,2836.286,This isn't really the petitioner's test.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2840.088,2840.917,"Well, that's right."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2841.924,2851.417,"And if -- suppose a vessel weren't there on the date of the injury, the -- under his -- I understand the -- what the petitioner thinks the statute means will tell us the statute means then he wouldn't be covered."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2851.417,2856.305,"Well, that's right but we suggest that that would not make good sense in applying --"
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2856.305,2859.225,"Maybe not, maybe nothing in the statute that's very good sense --"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2859.225,2859.777,Well --
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2859.777,2863.358,-- but we're -- our duty is to decide what the statute means.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2863.358,2900.251,"Well, that's certainly true and our suggestion is that particularly in light of the doctrine that this statute should be given an expansive construction in favor of the injury claimant that a narrow construction of the statute which would exclude claimants who were injured on the dock moving cargo clearly engaged in longshoring operations for instances suppose unloading a container, the fact that they were injured on a day when the ship was not in port should not determine their coverage."
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2901.448,2903.916,"Mr. Bryson, could I ask one other question?"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2918.941,2919.875,"Well, that's right."
1978.78-425,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2940.831,2943.643,"Yes, but -- wouldn't that -- the Caputo case is like that, wasn't it?"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2943.643,2945.646,"Well, Caputo was busy loading a truck."
1978.78-425,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2945.646,2947.756,Where the trucks right on the dock?
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2947.756,2948.308,Yes.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2948.308,2949.363,"Well, that's right and --"
1978.78-425,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2949.363,2950.634,It was right on --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2950.634,2953.447,But Caputo was covered but the truck driver who was --
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2953.447,2954.293,Was not.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2954.293,2955.448,"-- was not, who was busy --"
1978.78-425,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2955.448,2956.742,But the trucks were on the dock.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2956.742,2957.562,That's right.
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2960.42,2970.705,"I thought earlier, when we were talking before, you assumed the truck driver would be performing the kind of work that would normally be covered if it was at the right place in the chain of movement of good."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2970.705,2988.952,"Well, if you have a -- I mean, certainly a truck driver could be employed in a marine terminal to move cargo from the vessel, the side of the vessel all the way to the railroad spur and he would be covered even though typically be --"
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2988.952,2994.236,"He did none of the actual physical loading of the truck himself, all he did was sit behind the wheel and drive back and forth, --"
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2994.236,2996.707,That's right forklift drivers often do just that.
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2996.707,2997.753,I understand forklift truck is a little --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2997.753,2998.984,"Right,"
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2998.984,3001.895,-- that's a little more like what typical longshoreman --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3001.895,3002.053,That's right.
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3002.053,3006.809,"We're talking about a driver of a, you know, a teamster."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3012.381,3013.409,I would certainly suggest --
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3013.409,3013.702,That it woud be covered --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3013.702,3014.392,"-- that he would be covered, yes."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3014.392,3016.744,"Oh, that's -- the petitioners certainly wouldn't agree with you."
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3016.744,3019.339,"Oh no, because they would say that he is not subject to go in on a vessel."
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3023.314,3023.489,Assigned in that day --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3023.489,3024.427,-- he could to drive --
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3024.427,3024.966,To being assigned --
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3024.966,3025.61,-- to being assigned that day.
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3025.61,3026.113,(Inaudible)
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3026.113,3029.054,If he could drive his truck onto a vessel.
1978.78-425,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3029.054,3031.892,If he had to go on the ship to have the captain sign the bill of lading or whatever it might be.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3031.892,3032.628,Exactly.
1978.78-425,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3032.969,3033.403,He'd be covered.
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3033.403,3040.439,"Well, I -- that's my understanding of the petitioner's test because that would be an assignment onto the ship in the course of his employment."
1978.78-425,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3040.439,3043.792,Wouldn't the union send him onto that?
1978.78-425,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3043.792,3049.265,"Well, that's a possibility and that may be how this will all be resolved."
1978.78-425,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3050.215,3055.017,We're all concern with the brief --
1978.78-425,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3055.017,3056.05,Mr. Vickery.
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3056.05,3060.941,May it please the Court.
1978.78-425,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3076.519,3078.386,Who doesn't agree?
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3078.386,3080.409,Footnote 36 on page 13?
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3080.409,3081.524,Alright.
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3083.072,3083.357,Is that correct?
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3083.357,3090.334,-- this Court's definition of maritime employment as being used in connection with the 1972 amendments.
1978.78-425,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3147.4,3149.611,The dock is one --
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3149.611,3150.058,Sir?
1978.78-425,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3150.058,3151.508,The dock is --
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3151.508,3155.436,"Yes, this Court has held many times the dock is an extension of the land --"
1978.78-425,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3155.436,3156.183,Suppose you --
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3156.183,3157.085,-- and has nothing to do
1978.78-425,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3157.085,3159.333,But it -- that's the type (Inaudible)?
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3159.333,3159.809,Sorry?
1978.78-425,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3159.809,3161.89,That's the type you're talking about.
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3166.625,3177.917,"Well, because of the -- because it's well settled in the law that a dock is the extension of the land whether there is water underneath the dock or a land underneath the dock Mr. Justice Marshall, I don't think it makes any difference."
1978.78-425,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3177.917,3179.109,I just wanted to know.
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3179.109,3180.273,I see.
1978.78-425,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3185.085,3185.848,That's --
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3185.848,3191.962,"-- involved in Bryant's case, most of the piers and warehouses in Galveston are --"
1978.78-425,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3191.962,3192.453,Didn't you understand?
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3192.453,3194.089,"Oh, the water, I'm sorry, I misunderstood you."
1978.78-425,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3194.089,3194.636,Yes.
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3194.636,3196.833,I misunderstood your question.
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3245.717,3268.32,"Now, Mr. Vickery, looking at the definition of the term employee in Section 2 (3), it says as you indicate that it means first of all that any person engaged in maritime employment including and then it says including a ship repairman, a shipbuilder and a shipbreaker."
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3284.534,3288.998,I believe that same maritime employment --
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3288.998,3290.403,"That can be answered yes or no, my question."
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3290.403,3291.064,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3294.444,3311.421,"So if he is a shipbuilder, full time, life long career, a shipbuilder but he's a shipbuilder -- on building a ship before it whatever is on navigable waters, then he's not covered at all and never was and never can be by this Act, is that it?"
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3311.421,3314.538,"Your Honor, I believe that's what Congress says."
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3322.534,3325.285,"No, no, what the statute does express --"
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3325.285,3339.566,"But the Secretary of Labor had defined all of these terms that are used in the Act in connection with the Safety and Health Regulations for longshoring and ship repairers, shipbreakers and shipbuilders."
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3357.746,3361.62,"Now, my -- my question doesn't have anything to do with longshoring operations."
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3364.001,3364.403,Right.
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3364.675,3365.627,-- of an employee.
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3374.024,3374.791,Right.
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3374.791,3384.844,"But let's assume that he is and always has been during his occupation in life, a shipbuilder but that his work is in building ships before they are ever on navigable waters."
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3389.194,3390.093,And that is correct.
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3392.332,3393.29,That's right.
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3393.29,3395.033,-- within the meaning of the Act.
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3395.033,3400.027,And you do concede that there are shipbuilders all of whose occupational time is spent not on navigable waters.
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3400.027,3407.148,I believe the estimate given in the Senate hearings at about 65 to 70% of the work on a shipyard was on navigable waters.
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3407.666,3410.259,And there's 30 to 35% that's not.
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3410.259,3413.615,That there would be about 35 that would be not.
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3416.991,3421.197,And if he is subject on the day of his injury or death to assignment to navigable waters --
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3421.197,3421.766,That's right.
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3421.766,3422.777,-- in his occupation --
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3422.777,3423.409,He is not engaged in --
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3423.409,3424.375,-- he is not covered by this --
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3424.375,3426.907,He is not engaged in maritime employment.
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3426.907,3427.091,(Inaudible)
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3427.091,3427.212,There are shipbuilders --
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3427.212,3428.719,I thought that he was.
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3428.719,3435.352,"Your Honor, there are shipbuilders who build tugs, barges and things like that entirely on land taken by trailer --"
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3435.352,3436.359,You mean --
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3436.359,3437.297,-- and then launch them.
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3437.297,3438.511,Right.
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3438.511,3440.324,And in my opinion those people are not engaged in --
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3440.324,3443.087,"Some of them in World War II, I remember in Iowa as I remember it."
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3443.087,3444.387,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-425,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3444.971,3445.672,Steamships too.
1978.78-425,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3445.672,3446.701,Yes.
1978.78-425,2,23328,e_d_vickery,,3446.701,3449.78,"Yes, they can be built entirely on land."
1978.78-425,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3450.826,3451.616,Thank you gentlemen.
