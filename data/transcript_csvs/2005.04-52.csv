2005.04-52,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.412,We'll hear argument next in Rice v. Collins.
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,5.977,9.105,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.04-52,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,40.089,48.794,"Just at the... at the outset... and I'm... I'm not sure you're prepared for this, but the joint appendix, volume 2, is under seal."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,48.794,49.897,--Yes.
2005.04-52,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,49.897,59.527,"In the course of the argument, I think we'd be very interested in knowing about the colloquy that the trial judge had with the attorneys, and if it's under seal, it's a little bit awkward to do that."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,62.828,65.346,"None... none at all, Justice Kennedy."
2005.04-52,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,66.779,68.664,I... I take it--
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,68.664,69.124,--appendix 2--
2005.04-52,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,69.124,75.304,--I take it that the... the names of the jurors we don't know because they're given numbers.
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,75.304,76.357,--That's correct.
2005.04-52,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,76.357,83.488,"So far as you know, the counsel for the respondent would also have no objection?"
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,83.488,88.124,"Neither of us have any objection, and it's been quoted extensively--"
2005.04-52,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,88.124,90.289,"Yes, it was then quoted extensively in the Ninth Circuit I thought."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,90.289,91.533,--In... in the briefs as well.
2005.04-52,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,91.533,91.734,Thank you.
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,91.734,93.52,"Thank you, Mr. Kennedy... Justice Kennedy."
2005.04-52,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,261.112,271.324,"Well, it is... it is a little unusual to have under your view two different sections, both addressed to the question of the appropriate standard of review in a particular type of proceeding."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,283.32,285.536,"--That's true, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-52,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,385.906,403.982,"What about the contention in the particular proceeding that the district court... or the State fact finder did not, in fact, make a determination, but simply gave the benefit of the doubt to the prosecutor?"
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,403.982,455.225,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I... I think that reading the transcript will show that the judge, hearing the Batson motion, asking counsel to explain the reasons for her strikes, allowing defense counsel to comment and explain, and then the ruling of the judge seems to be a general one, both contemplating both demeanor and youthfulness, and benefit of the doubt may refer back to the fact that there's a dispute about the challenged juror and whether she turned aside, rolled her eyes in a dismissive and disrespectful way."
2005.04-52,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,469.497,471.104,"Well, I thought youthfulness--"
2005.04-52,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,471.104,487.883,"And I... I noticed the defense attorney, respondent here, did not comment in any way on the... the demeanor of the... of witness 16, which means either the... he... he saw it and said nothing or he... he didn't see it at all."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,488.626,489.91,"Justice Kennedy, that's correct."
2005.04-52,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,490.681,505.957,What... what is the obligation that we impose on the prosecution in this case to give a coherent explanation of why there... the juror was excused?
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,516.892,517.342,Well--
2005.04-52,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,517.342,525.366,"Here, it seems that the prosecutor was somewhat caught off guard or... or certainly was not extremely clear."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,525.366,535.075,"--Well, we are in the middle of a... a trial, of course, and it happens quickly and, as the Court has suggested, often peremptory--"
2005.04-52,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,535.075,535.696,"Well, I'm not so sure quickly."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,539.137,539.979,"--Yes, sir."
2005.04-52,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,563.7,567.772,"But the point is once there's a Batson challenge, it has to be articulated."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,567.772,570.35,"--Well, I think that happens."
2005.04-52,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,625.807,633.831,"--But... but isn't... isn't the difficulty with your analysis there, General, that, yes, she started out by... by talking about youthfulness."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,640.301,640.611,Yes.
2005.04-52,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,640.611,644.653,"Sort of at the second stage, again she spoke of youthfulness."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,750.252,752.87,"Well, thank you, Justice Souter."
2005.04-52,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,776.97,786.832,"Yes, but the district attorney has... I mean, the... the point here is we're judging the district attorney's responses, not the judge's responses."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,786.832,787.092,Right.
2005.04-52,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,787.092,790.08,What we want to know is what the judge found and ruled upon.
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,823.05,826.489,"If I may, Justice Souter."
2005.04-52,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,831.054,845.026,"--Well, didn't the DA say, look, youth alone doesn't... doesn't explain my reasons because there are other young people on the jury that... that we're not challenging, and... and I don't want to suggest that all young people should be disqualified?"
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,845.026,845.257,Right.
2005.04-52,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,845.257,854.503,"General, does... does the judge have to find what the reason for the strike was, or does the judge have to find what the reason for the strike wasn't?"
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,854.503,861.294,The judge has to find that it was not a racially discriminatory strike.
2005.04-52,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,861.294,880.792,"And if there are several allegations and... and each of them is somewhat doubtful but, on balance, he says, I give the benefit of the... of the doubt to the... to the district attorney, it's his indication that, as a matter of fact, he finds that the reason wasn't race."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,880.792,883.702,"Justice Scalia, your direct--"
2005.04-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,883.702,884.926,"May I ask this question, General?"
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,884.926,885.076,--Yes.
2005.04-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,885.076,888.455,There are really two kinds of Batson problems as I see it.
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,921.033,930.553,"Well, probably not, because the requirement is that the strike be intentionally done."
2005.04-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.465,946.698,"If, for example, the judge saw that over a period of time, a particular prosecutor had hunches about jurors over and over again and they just happened to be black most of the time."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,950.741,954.523,"Well, there might be a pattern over time."
2005.04-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,954.523,958.102,But... but she's totally convinced of the good faith of the prosecutor.
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,959.657,959.849,Yes.
2005.04-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,959.849,966.116,But just realizes this person has an unconscious bias that shows up in the... in the pattern of challenges.
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,968.143,973.589,You might be able to deduce intent from... infer it from a variety of challenges.
2005.04-52,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.589,973.77,No.
2005.04-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,981.333,981.894,Right.
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,981.894,985.737,In good faith?
2005.04-52,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,985.737,985.927,Yes.
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,994.021,1006.82,"Justice Stevens and Scalia, I would rely on the trial judge to make a determination of the intention of the district attorney--"
2005.04-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.82,1008.545,And if the trial judge determined--
2005.04-52,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1008.545,1009.166,"Well, the question is would he--"
2005.04-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.166,1021.263,"--based... based on the history of several trials and so forth, that this prosecutor unconsciously had this hunch with respect to black jurors but not others, that would be a sufficient basis for a challenge."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1021.263,1022.857,--I'd be inclined to say yes.
2005.04-52,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1022.857,1027.142,"But there is no such... that... that's very far from this case, General Lockyer."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1027.142,1027.321,Yes.
2005.04-52,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1027.321,1028.896,I did... I did have one--
2005.04-52,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.896,1032.518,"That... that gives a lot of power to district... to... to the district judge, doesn't it?"
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1052.145,1052.518,Justice Scalia--
2005.04-52,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1052.518,1053.83,--you really want the system to run that way?
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1053.83,1059.096,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I hope to brief that one some day, but--"
2005.04-52,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1059.096,1059.878,--Can we... can we go back--
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1059.878,1069.567,--but... but it's a good... it's a good question even though I... I don't think it's what's happening in this instance.
2005.04-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1074.342,1081.274,"Except in this very case, one gets the impression that the prosecutor was pretty confused, but maybe she was acting in good faith."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1081.274,1084.773,--I... I believe that's clear from the record.
2005.04-52,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1084.773,1087.02,--She was certainly... she was certainly wrong on the law.
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1130.901,1153.89,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that perhaps an explanation... and, again, if the trial judge thought it was reasonable... is there some compelling reason to read it a different way years later on appeal after the California Court of Appeal, a Federal magistrate, and a Federal district judge have agreed with the trial judge's perspectives."
2005.04-52,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1212.705,1222.063,What... what is the... where... where is the place in what the judge... when did this eye rolling take place?
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1223.238,1223.428,Okay.
2005.04-52,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1226.065,1227.61,"Yes, I have that in front of me."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1227.61,1227.732,And--
2005.04-52,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1227.732,1232.775,What was the statement that the judge made in respect to which the juror is supposed to have rolled her eyes?
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1232.775,1242.243,--The district attorney simply says with one of the questions to which you... the prospective--
2005.04-52,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1242.243,1242.947,Which question?
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1242.947,1244.039,--It's unclear.
2005.04-52,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1244.039,1246.629,So the reason I can't find it out is none of us know.
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1246.629,1247.14,"No, you're right."
2005.04-52,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1250.309,1253.449,And it actually says it wasn't a question.
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1255.634,1263.759,"It... it seems to be where the juror said yes in response to the voir dire, and then--"
2005.04-52,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1263.759,1264.982,Which was a question you said--
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1264.982,1266.397,--turned aside.
2005.04-52,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1270.098,1270.529,--I see.
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1270.529,1288.192,"The... a point I guess to be made about this confusing transcript... and of course, I don't know what the file looked like with respect to Miller El, but this is it."
2005.04-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1390.019,1393.399,May I ask just a... kind of a background question?
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1407.071,1407.311,Yes.
2005.04-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1407.311,1411.977,Does that... does that requirement apply after the Ninth Circuit decision?
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1417.623,1427.492,"We tried to research it, Justice Stevens, and we believe that it was a... a State court rule adopted subsequent to Wheeler."
2005.04-52,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1447.073,1455.587,"--Well, I... I read it as saying, and therefore I'm going to be careful about finding that there's been a Batson violation."
2005.04-52,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1461.344,1465.586,"Justice Kennedy, I frankly didn't read it that way."
2005.04-52,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1491.062,1495.598,"If you have a minute, you might... I don't know if you... if this is very useful."
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1508.948,1513.071,"Well, I know that's your view, Justice Breyer."
2005.04-52,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1513.071,1514.264,You have 30 seconds.
2005.04-52,0,45308,william_w_lockyer,,1515.989,1521.675,I prefer to keep the tradition and allow the peremptory challenges.
2005.04-52,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1523.38,1524.343,"Thank you, General."
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,1527.293,1535.397,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.04-52,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1549.45,1552.407,Why isn't the rolling of the eyes a persuasive reason?
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,1552.407,1559.822,"--Well, here the rolling of the eyes, first, is uncorroborated by the trial judge."
2005.04-52,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1566.219,1574.494,"Well, what... what should happen if the trial judge doesn't see it and a counsel, who's observant, said, judge, I've got a problem with this juror?"
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,1580.883,1585.438,"That could be, but here the trial court's--"
2005.04-52,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1585.438,1598.637,We've... we've all been... been in court and... and noticed that sometimes witnesses or jurors or parties or even attorneys will make faces and so forth that's not consistent with... with proper demeanor in a courtroom.
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,1598.637,1600.253,--That's correct.
2005.04-52,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1609.741,1610.172,So you're--
2005.04-52,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1610.172,1611.837,Maybe the judge is reading.
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,1615.568,1624.587,"--As the Court has previously mentioned, what we also have here is there's no... there's no corroboration in the transcript that juror--"
2005.04-52,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1624.587,1625.68,So what is the point.
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,1646.53,1652.54,"--Well, here, the trial court's ruling... he says, I did not see the demeanor complained of."
2005.04-52,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1667.534,1668.887,Why?
2005.04-52,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1668.887,1671.335,You mean benefit of the doubt just refers to youth.
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,1673.883,1674.937,--Well--
2005.04-52,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1674.937,1680.394,"I mean, I... it's pretty hard to read that as saying, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt in respect to the youth."
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,1715.286,1716.92,"--Well... well, even--"
2005.04-52,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1716.92,1717.652,So tell me.
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,1717.652,1718.765,--Okay.
2005.04-52,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1761.265,1765.277,"--Well, isn't this just another way of saying you don't believe the proffered justification?"
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,1779.588,1782.659,--I... I think two things.
2005.04-52,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1801.275,1802.579,So you're saying you don't believe it.
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,1825.286,1838.526,"--And the Ninth Circuit properly found that the conclusion was both unreasonable and rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, and it's because none of these reasons, when we look at the totality... what I'm trying to say is--"
2005.04-52,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1838.526,1848.628,"What was the... on the... on the eye roll, which I thought also the... the prosecutor said that she turned her head."
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,1865.707,1879.898,"--Well, we cited a case on page 24 in our brief, a Third Circuit case, Riley, that says a reviewing court's suspicion may be raised by a series of very weak explanations given for the strike."
2005.04-52,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1879.898,1888.756,"There... there's no doubt that the court... or at least in my mind, that... that the trial court could have come out the other way."
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,1946.235,1953.479,"Well, Miller El emphasizes that we need to view the prosecutor's behavior cumulatively."
2005.04-52,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1971.301,1972.775,I thought there was another... another.
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,1981.483,1992.566,"--Juror 20 Collins explains... Mr.... trial counsel... defense counsel, explained at the hearing was a person of color but not African American."
2005.04-52,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1998.192,2001.491,"Now... now, number 19 was excused and was a black person."
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2001.491,2003.137,That's correct.
2005.04-52,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2003.137,2004.632,And... and a woman.
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2053.588,2060.348,"Well, on the State appeal, it's true that Collins' attorney dropped the claim specifically as to juror 19."
2005.04-52,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.257,2085.112,So what is the remedy... the remedy if we say and hold with you that prosecutors can't give reasons like they gave here?
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2123.688,2131.089,"Well, I... I think... I think the record here reinforces Your Honor's view on--"
2005.04-52,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2131.089,2132.624,But I'm asking for your experience.
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2136.979,2164.16,"--Well, I... I think if... if the Court allows to happen what... what happened here, then I think the message it could be saying to prosecutors, as long as you can just rifle off a series of... of reasons for your strike and then the trial court latches onto one of them, taking it out the context of the plausibility of all the other strikes, then we're going to allow this type of behavior to continue."
2005.04-52,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2164.16,2194.842,"This prosecutor presumably appears before this judge on other occasions, and... and don't you think we... we can give some weight to the fact that the judge is there, sees the woman, sees what she's saying, and... and can judge better than we can whether she's making this up or just... just is... is somewhat confused, especially since, as... as I think the General pointed out, we're dealing with a kind of determination that is usually instinctive on the part of trial counsel."
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2236.186,2245.594,"First of all, there's nothing in the record to indicate that this prosecutor had appeared many times before this trial judge."
2005.04-52,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2248.474,2254.992,"Well, she might in the future, if she's got a job as a prosecutor in this court."
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2261.964,2273.227,"--That's right, but I guess what I'm trying to say is it's not that the judge said, you know, Ms. Prosecutor, you've appeared before me many times and I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt because I know the way you are."
2005.04-52,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2290.107,2291.27,I'm saying that it's hard.
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2304.551,2310.6,"--I understand, but what's significant here is when she is flopping around, the reason she comes up with... she says gender."
2005.04-52,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2321.353,2321.783,All right.
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2405.395,2411.394,"Well, that... that would be a... a tougher case for us because we would have an explicit ruling--"
2005.04-52,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2411.394,2411.674,Right.
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2411.674,2412.647,--of what actually happened.
2005.04-52,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2412.647,2413.769,What would your position be?
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2413.769,2429.157,"I still think that in this case, given the entire context and all the other reasons given, including the gender reason, that it would still... that those demeanor and youth reasons would still not be persuasive looking at the context--"
2005.04-52,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2429.157,2433.219,So you would say that those two conclusions on the part of the court were unreasonable?
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2433.219,2440.589,"--On... on this record, yes, given all the other reasons we have given by the prosecutor."
2005.04-52,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2440.589,2443.197,And you would say you've established that by clear and convincing evidence?
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2443.197,2456.297,"I would because when we go through the comparative juror analysis and look at the record of the whole, we see that the reasons given, for example, on youth are not used for similarly situated white jurors."
2005.04-52,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2456.297,2463.509,"Well, but number 6 was a young white... young white male, I believe, and he was excused on the ground of youth."
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2464.662,2475.707,"6 was different in that he was unemployed, in fact, had never been employed, and also he had an uncle who was a recovered alcoholic, and that made him quite different from juror 16."
2005.04-52,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2475.707,2488.534,"What's wrong with the explanation, as far as youth is concerned, is that she didn't want to across the board strike young people, but she just wanted to come up with a jury that had dominantly older people."
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2495.554,2504.892,"Well, I think she's also admitting that youth wasn't a reason because she's saying there are other young people on the jury, and the significant question here--"
2005.04-52,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2504.892,2514.842,"Well, what's... one... one point could be I don't want too many young people, so I'm going to exercise some peremptories to make sure that the jury is dominantly older people."
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2516.759,2526.797,--What's wrong with that here is the question is why is she using that rationale against the young black juror and not the... the young white jurors on the panel?
2005.04-52,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2530.259,2530.439,"Well, she did."
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2534.329,2535.273,Correct.
2005.04-52,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2535.273,2538.474,And youth was a factor there.
2005.04-52,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2543.608,2545.094,And this one rolled her eyes.
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2545.094,2561.192,"Right, but when we look at the totality of the reasons, which include looking at the way she treated juror 19, we have the lack of ties in the community--"
2005.04-52,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2561.192,2569.648,Juror 19... you just said earlier the fact that the one juror's uncle had an alcohol problem was... was a legitimate factor.
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2579.456,2592.226,"--The significance of the treatment of juror 19 is, right out of the box, the prosecutor is coming up with reasons that she says apply to both 16 and 19, the only two black women on the jury."
2005.04-52,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2613.88,2620.217,"But that... that was so obviously a slip, and Judge Hall pointed that out in her dissent."
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2635.566,2638.704,I respectfully disagree that it was a mistake.
2005.04-52,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2672.666,2683.931,"Would you say the same thing about the defense counsel confusing jurors 16 and 19 at page 9, the bottom of page 9?"
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2703.308,2718.313,"Well, I'm... I... I don't think so because on the next page she continues discussing juror 19 at the top of page 10."
2005.04-52,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2718.313,2727.54,"Well, I... I don't think it's a necessary reading."
2005.04-52,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2727.54,2734.382,Maybe I'm... what... what is the inference you try to draw from the treatment of juror 19?
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2742.195,2743.73,"No, no."
2005.04-52,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2748.625,2753.951,And then what do you do with the fact that juror 19's daughter had a cocaine problem and this was a cocaine case?
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2758.494,2760.178,--Right.
2005.04-52,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2900.803,2916.268,"What do you do with the argument that your reading of the two sections means that (e)(1) would only apply in a very small number of cases, and it's obvious that Congress was trying to tighten the habeas review procedures?"
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2916.268,2930.081,Our argument is based on the... the structure and text of statute and... and the fact that the clear and convincing requirement is tied to the presumption of correctness.
2005.04-52,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2946.69,2949.319,"In... in a sense, the standards perhaps ought to be reversed."
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,2962.67,2966.259,Right.
2005.04-52,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3064.504,3073.76,Do you think that (d)(2) or (e)(1) is the... is the stricter requirement?
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,3099.829,3102.297,I... I think they're different standards.
2005.04-52,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3111.856,3118.617,--If... if I might ask.
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,3124.183,3125.597,"No, we don't."
2005.04-52,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3125.597,3125.988,Thank you.
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,3125.988,3130.763,If I could briefly sum up.
2005.04-52,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3167.853,3179.959,"Do you, by any means... you don't contend, though, the fact that she did rely, in part, on an unconstitutional reason is a sufficient reason for sustaining a Batson type challenge?"
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,3179.959,3185.458,"In this case, it's very significant that she relied on the unconstitutional reason."
2005.04-52,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3185.458,3190.161,But you have not argued that that would be a sufficient reason for setting aside the verdict.
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,3190.161,3196.691,"This claim was not raised in State court as a gender challenge as opposed to race, if I'm answering the Court's question."
2005.04-52,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3196.691,3198.808,Do you think it would have had merit if you had made that argument?
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,3198.808,3207.744,"Absolutely, and I think it has merit here because it's... it's a reason the district attorney admitted that was motivating her strike."
2005.04-52,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3211.846,3219.109,"Counsel, is there anything in the record to alert us to the race of the prosecutor?"
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,3219.109,3224.023,There is not besides her name.
2005.04-52,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3224.023,3225.377,Would it make any difference?
2005.04-52,1,35718,mark_r_drozdowski,,3230.332,3231.396,No.
2005.04-52,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3247.222,3248.196,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.04-52,2,45308,william_w_lockyer,,3251.647,3253.924,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-52,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3445.26,3450.566,"Of course, you're coming up with still more reasons than the prosecutor came up with."
2005.04-52,2,45308,william_w_lockyer,,3450.566,3454.125,"Well, they're just the ones in the record, Your Honor."
2005.04-52,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3474.145,3474.888,"Thank you, counsel."
