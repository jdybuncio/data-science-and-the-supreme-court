1998.98-387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.168,"We'll hear argument now in Number 98-387, Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Association v United States."
1998.98-387,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,11.169,17.973,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-387,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,67.065,76.773,"Make the assumption, and it's an assumption I'm sure you would disagree with, that Congress could prohibit advertising for casino gambling, that that's a stable category."
1998.98-387,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,99.536,107.613,"Well, first, Justice Kennedy, this statute doesn't even prohibit all advertising for private casinos."
1998.98-387,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,110.375,111.404,This is a hypothetical case.
1998.98-387,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,116.96,117.498,--The reason--
1998.98-387,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,117.498,118.88,--I just want to test the reason for the exception.
1998.98-387,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,118.88,142.455,"--The reason, Justice Kennedy, is that the Government doesn't assert, and it's certainly not obvious that there is any difference in the social costs between gambling at Government and Indian casinos and gambling at private casinos, particularly when the Federal law allows the Government and Indian casinos to provide the same games operated by the very same private companies."
1998.98-387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,142.455,159.927,"But can't the Government weigh on the other side of that equation the fact that casino gambling may be essential to the well being of Indian tribes as a source of income, whereas it doesn't have to weigh that and say that's very desirable that private casino owners have a similar source of income?"
1998.98-387,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,159.927,162.591,"I think not, Chief Justice Rehnquist, for two reasons."
1998.98-387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,200.205,201.324,Is there a more basic--
1998.98-387,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,210.332,225.45,"Well, Justice Scalia, if the private casinos are not in those States, those States are not going to be that concerned about them, but if they are there, they could be taxed by the Federal Government and the proceeds distributed, so the social benefits argument here, as in discovery, isn't sufficient."
1998.98-387,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,241.312,256.56,"Is there a more basic First Amendment argument, and that is that Congress cannot grant or withhold the ability to speak based on the identity of the speaker, or are you foreclosed from making that argument because this is a commercial speech case?"
1998.98-387,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,256.56,257.601,--Justice Kennedy--
1998.98-387,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,257.601,258.402,That's what I wanted to explore.
1998.98-387,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,258.402,273.312,"--Justice Kennedy, I don't' think we're foreclosed from making that argument because it's a commercial speech case, but I think this case can be decided on much easier and more straightforward grounds, the basic prong three and prong four of Central Hudson."
1998.98-387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,274.073,277.045,"Well, it's not really the identity of the speaker involved here anyway."
1998.98-387,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,289.831,300.149,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia, the ban is a ban on broadcasters, not on the private casinos themselves, but I took Justice Kennedy's question to be that effectively they're banning the private casinos themselves."
1998.98-387,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,300.149,303.722,"Mr. Ennis, could... I didn't mean to interrupt you, if you're going on with him."
1998.98-387,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,303.722,304.731,Well--
1998.98-387,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,304.731,306.143,I've a question when you're done.
1998.98-387,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,306.143,307.015,--Justice Souter.
1998.98-387,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,307.015,308.665,It's a nuts and bolts question.
1998.98-387,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,338.944,347.292,"Justice Souter, the answer to that is, is that the statute itself does not prohibit all broadcast advertising even of gambling activities."
1998.98-387,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,388.939,390.648,It's only if they have the name casino.
1998.98-387,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,390.648,393.09,"--Only if they have the name casino, Justice Stevens."
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1566.227,1573.541,"Private... Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-387,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1591.702,1593.595,"Well, Mr. Ennis says that's not so."
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1604.392,1608.596,I'm not sure whether the dispute is about the facts or about the way of characterizing those facts.
1998.98-387,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1649.192,1649.833,"Well, but it isn't even trying, is it?"
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1658.398,1664.502,"--Well, it can't actually advertise that it's a casino, although it can avoid that problem by putting the word casino into its name."
1998.98-387,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1664.502,1665.861,Which most of them do.
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1665.861,1667.283,"Which many of them do, yes."
1998.98-387,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1697.511,1720.819,"Couldn't one argue that it's somewhat perverse to give free reign to the Las Vegas casinos to advertise the fact that they are casinos, with the implied message that it's gambling, but to prohibit them from giving truthful information about what games are played, what the odds are in their slot machines and all that sort of stuff, which might actually be totally consistent with the Government interest at stake here?"
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1720.819,1740.52,"Well, I think this is quite unlike the Liquormart and Coors problem, which is I think the analogy that you are drawing, when advertising is generally allowed and particular items are taken out in order... and the result is to make the market in advertising less accurate, or less honest."
1998.98-387,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1762.935,1767.489,There is one analogy with 44 Liquormart even on your description.
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1809.657,1818.764,"The anomaly only arises, as I said, because there is the ability to connote, to evade the prohibition on advertising, the existence of the gambling enterprise."
1998.98-387,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1818.764,1840.608,"Yes, but that's a fact, and we have to deal with it and, I suppose, if the Government were going to be consistent in its own theory the Government would take the position, the FCC would have taken the position that an establishment that has the word casino in its name may not advertise, because it can't advertise without advertising casinos and everything that connotes, but the Government doesn't take that position."
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1840.608,1843.821,That would be an even more effective way of serving the Government's interest.
1998.98-387,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1853.728,1876.792,"Would you respond to one other point that was raised by Justice Scalia, actually, in the question that he put to Mr. Ennis, and he said there's another feature of 44 Liquormart that's not present here, and that is, there was quite clearly there an advertising ban which put the mom and pop shops and so on at a disadvantage."
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1917.949,1920.27,No.
1998.98-387,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1938.373,1942.864,Why is the problem in private casinos different from the problem in Indian casinos?
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1975.095,1977.917,"A more important distinction, Justice Souter, is that the--"
1998.98-387,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1977.917,1981.721,"Well, is that... before you get to the more important distinction, how about the one that I was--"
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1985.794,1993.499,--I don't know that there's any evidence about the different incidence of compulsive gambling at the different casinos.
1998.98-387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2008.437,2018.765,"Do you know how many of the 12 States there are Indian casinos, say, either in the State or near the State so it might attract a lot of customers?"
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2022.478,2028.264,"No, it is not fair to assume that most of them... it's very variable."
1998.98-387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2031.745,2038.97,"--Well, there are 240 across the country, or something, so I've been assuming that probably a lot of these are in these States, and if you say it's not so, you'd better--"
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2038.97,2046.464,"--It's not so to the best of my... it's not so in New Jersey, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri--"
1998.98-387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2046.464,2052.427,--In how many States do we find Indian gambling casinos today?
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2052.427,2056.782,--A large number of States have Indian gambling.
1998.98-387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2056.782,2058.462,"Well, anyway, the point would be, I guess--"
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2058.462,2059.364,21.
1998.98-387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2059.364,2060.335,--21.
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2094.866,2111.787,"There is also with respect to Indians not just that they are a worthy recipient of economic... of charity, but... or of economic development, but that they are... they have a special relationship to the Federal Government, like the States themselves--"
1998.98-387,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2111.787,2112.167,But the--
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2112.167,2114.959,"--as sovereigns, whose choices are... yes."
1998.98-387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2114.959,2133.481,"--Yes, of course, that's true, but my point would be, is it a justification to stop the advertising of a lawful activity where in fact the people in the State will get the message, go gamble, so your only justification is, you'd like the money to go to a group that's a very worthy group."
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2133.481,2136.253,"Well, it's not the only justification, Justice Breyer."
1998.98-387,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2155.655,2155.845,Well--
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2196.263,2201.366,"--Well, that would be one of the things he's arguing here, and I wouldn't want to assent to that proposition as a general matter."
1998.98-387,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2224.02,2224.52,May I ask--
1998.98-387,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2251.499,2254.46,"--Well, there would be a... I'm not sure that it would."
1998.98-387,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3351.532,3355.516,"Mr. Chief Justice, I hope I have time to make three brief points."
1998.98-387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3379.021,3385.675,"Yes, but Mr. Ennis, you're not going to convince me that you'd like the statute better if it did not allow the use of the word casino."
1998.98-387,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3385.675,3388.555,"--Not that I'd like it better, Justice Stevens, but that--"
1998.98-387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3388.555,3388.986,Would it be okay?
1998.98-387,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3391.848,3393.801,"--No, for other reasons, but because--"
1998.98-387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3393.801,3395.06,--There's no way out of this box.
1998.98-387,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3395.06,3395.59,--But because this--
1998.98-387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3483.608,3485.841,"Mr. Ennis, how many States have Government casinos?"
1998.98-387,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3485.841,3493.165,"Four, as of this moment, Justice Scalia, but that's a very recent trend, just in the last year or so, and that's growing as well."
1998.98-387,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3531.99,3532.771,"Thank you, Mr. Ennis."
