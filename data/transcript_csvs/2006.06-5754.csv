2006.06-5754,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.127,"We'll hear argument first this morning in case 06-5754, Rita versus United States."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,9.116,12.209,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-5754,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,94.244,111.184,"How can you say that, given that at the sentencing hearing, that military record was brought out, his physical ailments were brought out, his activity in law enforcement, all that was brought out?"
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,121.109,133.128,"In the district court, Mr. Rita did put forward evidence of his military records, health concerns, he... the district court received that information."
2006.06-5754,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,146.056,149.319,"Well, you know, you don't get a summary judgment case all the time."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,172.677,178.862,"Justice Breyer, the district judge didn't say that we're going to weigh all of the stuff, and I--"
2006.06-5754,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,178.862,181.083,"No, he doesn't in a summary judgment case either."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,185.185,199.173,"--Well, in the instance of a summary judgment matter, we don't have 3553(c), that requires the district court to state in open court in front of the defendant the reasons for the imposition of sentence."
2006.06-5754,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,199.173,200.834,"Now, he says the reasons are these."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,205.348,206.229,"It would not, Your Honor."
2006.06-5754,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,206.229,206.579,Why not?
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,229.864,239.051,"With regard to the first question Your Honor posed, it's not sufficient for the district court to simply state conclusions, which is what happened in this case, that--"
2006.06-5754,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,239.051,241.582,Where in the law does it say that?
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,241.582,248.776,"--Well, in 3553(c), it requires that the judge give the reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence."
2006.06-5754,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,248.776,250.538,Where... I'm looking at that.
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,253.95,256.401,The preamble states--
2006.06-5754,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,256.401,260.043,Can you give me your page cite?
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,260.043,267.007,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, on page 3-A of Petitioner's brief in the appendix."
2006.06-5754,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,287.163,300.891,"So it isn't sufficient, in your view, that the judge just says, the reason I imposed this sentence is that's the guideline sentence, and I think in this circumstance it's reasonable?"
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,300.891,302.103,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-5754,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,316.652,328.538,"I think these other factors that have been brought out, while they're serious factors, I don't think they're enough to warrant a different sentence."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,330.14,331.75,"Your Honor, I think the--"
2006.06-5754,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,331.75,343.688,"What I'm worried about basically is, I don't think in the law there's a special category that requires a judge to give special reasons in a guideline case."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,358.978,361.302,"--I don't think that this is unusual, Your Honor."
2006.06-5754,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,374.639,375.871,"Well, I get where you're going."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,390.87,396.824,--I think it would have to be specific to the issues raised by the parties.
2006.06-5754,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.299,449.099,"How do you reconcile the language in the prologue of (c) which says, the court shall state the reasons, with (c)(2), which says that if the sentence is not of the kind or is outside the range described in (a)(4) of the guidelines, the court shall state the specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from the guidelines?"
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,463.516,471.681,"Well, I think foremost, Your Honor, is that that provision came about prior to the Booker decision when the guidelines were mandatory."
2006.06-5754,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,508.517,510.227,You haven't answered my question.
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,519.374,529.051,"--The specific reason I think, Your Honor, is so that the sentencing commission can take that information into account in later revisions of the guidelines."
2006.06-5754,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,533.172,536.334,But are you saying now that that distinction should be ignored?
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,536.334,551.234,"I don't know, Your Honor, if it's so much that it should be ignored inasmuch as the district court needs to give as many reasons, or as clear a reason for the imposition of the particular sentence."
2006.06-5754,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,552.366,555.848,But it sounds to me as though you want all the reasons to be specific.
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,567.566,568.835,"--It, it may, Your Honor."
2006.06-5754,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,579.304,594.904,"So your position would be, Mr. Cochran, that the obligation to be even-handed would have to... that the trial judge would also have to go through... now this defendant maintained his innocence."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,608.463,617.238,"Your Honor, I think that the Court certainly could consider all of that; and... and if pressed by the Government would need to consider that."
2006.06-5754,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,620.43,624.792,Isn't that what the Government pressed at the sentencing hearing?
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,624.792,638.692,"--It did, Your Honor, and again the district court never came out with any specifics regarding any of those issues other than the conclusion that it felt that the guideline range was not inappropriate."
2006.06-5754,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,638.692,645.765,Suppose the district court says I give these following... I've considered these following specific factors.
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,657.804,659.346,I don't--
2006.06-5754,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,659.346,661.918,Is that an inappropriate judgment for the district court to make?
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,661.918,673.586,"--I think it's inappropriate, Your Honor, because while there should be uniformity in an attempt to move in that direction, uniformity is not the end all and be all."
2006.06-5754,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,679.449,680.22,It's not the end all.
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,692.128,697.021,"I don't believe the Booker decision rejected that, Your Honor."
2006.06-5754,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,734.704,740.037,"Mr. Cochran, are you arguing the sentencing in this case violated the Sixth Amendment?"
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,740.037,743.41,Not as it was applied.
2006.06-5754,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,753.518,759.02,"If it didn't violate the Sixth Amendment, then your argument is based on the Sentencing Reform Act?"
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,759.02,763.873,"Well, it came... it may have violated the Sixth Amendment."
2006.06-5754,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,776.422,779.584,You can't say whether it did or did not violate the Sixth Amendment?
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,779.584,787.559,The district court held the guidelines to a greater quantum than simply advisory.
2006.06-5754,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,787.559,794.594,"Well, was your client's sentence enhanced by any fact that should have been submitted to the jury?"
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,794.594,822.193,"Well, under... under a pure advisory system... and I think Your Honor is addressing the cross-reference in this matter... in a purely advisory system, the guidelines were calculated correctly in Mr. Rita's case, because under a purely advisory system, the district court could look at that cross-reference, understand that it came about from uncharged and unproven conduct, and disregard it."
2006.06-5754,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,836.562,842.806,"Mr. Cochran, you do contend, do you not, that if the guidelines had been mandatory, there would have been a violation of the Sixth Amendment."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,842.806,843.455,"No question, Your Honor."
2006.06-5754,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.455,847.519,"Because of the, the accessory after the fact point."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,847.519,849.001,"That's right, Your Honor, absolutely."
2006.06-5754,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,849.001,859.457,"Then the question ultimately is, does it violate the Sixth Amendment to say that we have a presumption there, a sentence is in the guidelines as a reasonable... if you're an appellate court judge."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,861.738,866.811,Our position is that the presumption does violate the Sixth--
2006.06-5754,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,866.811,880.941,"Then I guess the argument of the other side, which I would like you to address, is that, in which there... we didn't think it violated the of Sixth Amendment if the district judge simple applied 3553... uh, 3553(a)."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,913.242,916.194,"--Your Honor, the guidelines should be consulted."
2006.06-5754,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,916.735,917.997,"No, no, not consulting them."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,944.733,954.101,"--I would contend, Your Honor, that the Court needs to very clearly explain that the guidelines are, are a reference."
2006.06-5754,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,954.999,955.921,The guidelines are what?
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,955.921,957.851,--Are a reference.
2006.06-5754,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,957.851,959.693,Can you say it is an initial benchmark?
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,959.693,966.927,"I don't... when we start establishing benchmarks and presumptions, I think that's where we, we--"
2006.06-5754,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,966.927,968.039,So benchmarks are bad.
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,969.829,971.061,"--That's bad, too."
2006.06-5754,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,973.903,976.324,Does it matter what judge did in other cases?
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,1001.682,1029.018,"And what that tells me, Mr. Chief Justice, is that, that the district court felt that the guidelines had a center of gravity, that the judge was bound... in other words, shifted the burden to the defendant to say, well, I... unless you can show that these are inappropriate, that it is a setting of a benchmark, it's a drawing of a line, and we contend that that is what the Sixth Amendment prohibits."
2006.06-5754,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1048.452,1063.482,How about the point that Justice Breyer made that these other factors have been taken into account by the sentencing commission because Congress told them to consider those same factors?
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,1063.482,1070.404,"Well, Your Honor, the sentencing commission by its own admission has not taken into account all of the factors."
2006.06-5754,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1082.503,1085.575,There are two separate things there.
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,1127.753,1128.815,"I'm not, Your Honor."
2006.06-5754,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1140.423,1156.181,"That's because when they looked at all of the literature, they explained it, the rehabilitative purpose was not that it wasn't taken into account, it was there was a consensus among experts that there isn't much you can do about it."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,1158.805,1181.299,"--The other point I think with regard to that, Your Honor, is in looking at 3553(a) that statute gives the district court the dual commands of first considering all of those factors and then imposing a sentence sufficient but not greater than necessary."
2006.06-5754,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1186.141,1213.299,"Mr. Cochran, I have this concern: If we accept your submission that the district court should just consider the guidelines together with everything else, give them a presumption of validity, anything else, just something to consider, that would presumably eliminate any Sixth Amendment problem with the district court's findings of fact."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,1281.694,1282.713,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-5754,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1283.505,1286.937,So you haven't shown us a way out of the problem.
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,1286.937,1294.573,"--In a purely advisory system, the district court is bound by the statutory minimum and maximum."
2006.06-5754,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1318.176,1329.884,"No, even if you don't... don't establish thresholds by reason of the guideline, you are establishing thresholds upon judicial review, guidelines or not."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,1362.378,1386.441,"Well, I think so long as the district court can evaluate and consider and potentially reject what the guidelines say, just as the Court can consider the effect of... of the person's military record, Mr. Rita was a combat veteran in two wars, which is separate and apart from someone who may have been an Army recruiter--"
2006.06-5754,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1386.441,1387.913,You're not focusing on my point.
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,1407.696,1408.267,--It is.
2006.06-5754,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1408.267,1409.558,And that's going to be a problem.
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,1409.558,1420.395,I think what the court would have... the appellate court would have to do is evaluate all of that through the prism of 3553(a).
2006.06-5754,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1435.214,1452.685,"Counsel, what if there weren't guidelines at all, and the district court said maybe, you know, it's new, I want to see what other judges have done; he presses a button on the computer, give me what the sentences were looking at these facts, and finds out in the last 100 cases, this is what the sentence was."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,1457.35,1458.632,There is.
2006.06-5754,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1464.646,1476.294,"Yes, well, he looks at all the individual factors and he says they seem not terribly different from these 100 other cases and the range in those 100 other cases was, you know, 5 to 7 years, and so I'm going to give him 5 years."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,1476.294,1489.581,"--If the district court considers all those facts and considers what may have been done and it is sufficient, if not greater than necessary given those facts, then the court can do that."
2006.06-5754,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1489.581,1502.531,"How is that different than the... how is that different than looking at the guidelines, which did that in a much more comprehensive way, and saying, I don't see anything different in this case from the normal guidelines case and so I'm going to impose that sentence?"
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,1502.531,1521.822,"Well, the guidelines didn't take everything into account, and the sentencing courts were coming from 18 years of mandatory guidelines, of being required to follow this book that necessarily didn't incorporate all of the human factors in sentencing."
2006.06-5754,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1524.874,1541.576,"Well, it did incorporate them in that district judges were free to depart from the guidelines if indeed they found there was some one of these human factors not considered by the guidelines which existed in the particular case."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,1541.576,1544.018,"In theory, yes, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-5754,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.544,1595.662,"Well, if they were systematically removed then all of these other human factors that you're complaining about were considered by the guideline commission and were simply rejected."
2006.06-5754,0,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,1595.662,1602.427,"They weren't considered, Your Honor, and in the history of those amendments that's borne out."
2006.06-5754,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1606.108,1607.27,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1608.612,1625.833,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals appropriately applied a presumption of reasonableness in reviewing the sentence imposed pursuant to the advisory guidelines system that this Court announced in United States versus Booker."
2006.06-5754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1650.43,1659.506,"Isn't it true, just to get one thought out on the table, that there are factors that the guidelines don't... did not consider, such as military service?"
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1659.506,1667.2,"--Justice Stevens, the commission considered that factor and then determined that it was not generally appropriate to a sentence outside the guidelines."
2006.06-5754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1667.2,1671.764,But isn't it true that under the guideline no weight is given to military service?
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1671.764,1675.785,The guidelines specifically do not give weight to it.
2006.06-5754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1676.997,1680.809,What should a judge do if he thought some weight should be given to military service?
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1680.809,1683.852,--Under Booker the judge should do that.
2006.06-5754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1698.321,1702.673,And presumably cannot give weight to factors that the commission decided should have weight.
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1702.673,1704.854,"--He can do that, too, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-5754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1704.854,1709.258,"Are we back to the original version, which I'll read what it says."
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1747.646,1764.635,"I think we're back, Justice Breyer, to a further point even than the first set of guidelines, because even under the first set of guidelines application of the guidelines was mandatory unless the court found an aggravating or mitigating circumstance that wasn't taken into account."
2006.06-5754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1764.635,1774.883,We said we took nothing into account and therefore any circumstance that makes the case unusual would be in principle a ground for an exception.
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1774.883,1776.734,"I understand that, Justice Breyer."
2006.06-5754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1776.734,1778.287,You're saying more than that is necessary.
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1778.287,1795.197,I think that the reconciliation of this Court's merits opinion in Booker and its remedial opinion in Booker does dictate that the judge has additional freedom to impose a sentence that's different from what's described in the guidelines.
2006.06-5754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1795.197,1805.933,"He could do this: He could set aside the guideline on the theory that the guideline itself is unreasonable, that is it doesn't properly take account of sentencing."
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1825.936,1838.444,"Justice Breyer, I think we have to distinguish between what the job of the district court is and what the job of the appellate court is; and in this case, the Government is arguing for a presumption of reasonableness on appeal."
2006.06-5754,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1862.25,1871.116,"But unless there is a way to calibrate the strength of the presumption, there's no clear way to distinguish the presumption from the mandate."
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1889.788,1901.616,"Justice Souter, I'm not sure that that would be true even if what we were talking about was a direction to the district judge to presume that he would impose a guidelines sentence."
2006.06-5754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.216,1922.36,He doesn't have to do it unless he wants to be sure of being affirmed.
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1922.36,1930.785,--I would think that what the judge wants to do is be sure that he's complied with his statutory obligations.
2006.06-5754,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1930.785,1938.211,"Well, perhaps I misunderstood Justice Souter's question, but I have this concern, and I thought it was his concern as well."
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1951.869,1952.83,"Well, we are."
2006.06-5754,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1952.83,1957.945,"And when we talk about presumptions at the appellate level, that's actually a little strange in any event."
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1961.936,1964.249,"That's true, Justice Kennedy."
2006.06-5754,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1977.336,1979.878,So we write that this is an additive thing?
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1979.878,1994.197,"--Yes, I think that it's not so different from the court of appeals saying we can enter this case feeling pretty confident that we can affirm a guidelines sentence unless the person who challenges that shows us a good reason otherwise."
2006.06-5754,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1994.197,2009.648,"Well, is your view... on your view, is the appellate court engaging in some kind of de novo review or is the appellate court supposed to engage in a review that it will disturb the sentence only if it is shown to be unreasonable?"
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2009.648,2011.181,"The latter, Justice Souter."
2006.06-5754,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2018.453,2037.096,"Well, if you... if you have that, two criminals, criminal defendants, with the same identical background and everything else, one judge says, I think military service should be taken into account, so I'm going to depart from the guidelines by 3 years."
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2048.804,2055.399,The court of appeals can uphold both of them if it concludes that the actual sentence that's imposed is reasonable.
2006.06-5754,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2065.163,2072.139,What is reasonable is... is not merely a sort of number within a spectrum.
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2102.451,2110.426,"You're right, Justice Souter, and I can't say that that would be the first choice of the Congress that enacted the Sentencing Reform Act."
2006.06-5754,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2110.426,2113.308,Isn't it clear that it would have been the last choice of the Congress?
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2113.308,2116.36,"It is, and it's not the first choice of the Government, either."
2006.06-5754,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2127.588,2134.353,What does the Sixth Amendment have to do with the selection of the sentencing philosophy that is to be imposed?
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2148.64,2150.601,"--It probably does not, Justice Alito."
2006.06-5754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2161.39,2169.976,"I know, but Booker says what we're trying to do is to come close to what Congress wanted but not violate the Sixth Amendment."
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2220.138,2234.096,Let me try to address that and try to address Justice Alito's point about the question of how much sentencing philosophy can be decreed by the sentencing commission or Congress before a Sixth Amendment problem arises.
2006.06-5754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2259.532,2262.556,"Or some fact, not necessarily a particular fact."
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2262.556,2273.753,"Any fact at all, as a matter of fact is what the Court has said, although I understand that to mean facts pertaining to the offense and the offender, not facts about the world such as the prevalence of crime."
2006.06-5754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2378.481,2387.907,"May I ask you, this is the hypothetical: Supposing a judge thinks military service is relevant, and he decides to impose a sentence a little below the guidelines."
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2416.245,2424.552,"I think the court of appeals should correct the judge on a mistaken apprehension of law, which is that the judge--"
2006.06-5754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2424.552,2429.584,"Should reverse the judge then, within a... a within guidelines sentence?"
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2429.584,2435.438,"--In the circumstance, Justice Stevens, I think that you put your finger on two different types of review."
2006.06-5754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2444.955,2445.356,No.
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2449.33,2460.507,"--I'm hoping that it's a misunderstanding of what the court of appeals has said, because the court of appeals should not have told the judge you're obligated to impose a guideline sentence."
2006.06-5754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2460.507,2466.661,"Well, they didn't say you're obligated, but you can be pretty sure you'll be affirmed if you do impose within guidelines sentences."
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2466.661,2473.105,"Judges are still obligated to comply with 3553(a), which requires them to exercise discretion."
2006.06-5754,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2520.586,2522.126,What if the court of appeals does that?
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2542.149,2552.226,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I think there's a difference between a sentence that varies from what other judges would do and a sentence that is unreasonable."
2006.06-5754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2619.45,2621.673,It's not that complicated.
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2654.322,2661.057,That to me sounds identical to the system that pre-existed Booker's holding.
2006.06-5754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2661.057,2661.377,It did.
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2663.198,2667.171,This Court hasn't specifically addressed--
2006.06-5754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2667.171,2668.002,"Well, what do you think?"
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2679.429,2688.017,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I would like to be able to answer the question yes and say that courts of appeals can establish their own sub-legal rules as--"
2006.06-5754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2688.017,2689.607,It's not sub-legal rules.
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2703.856,2709.819,"--Justice Breyer, if do you that, what you have is each court of appeals functioning as a sentencing commission."
2006.06-5754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2709.819,2710.49,Exactly.
2006.06-5754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2721.307,2721.947,Exactly.
2006.06-5754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2721.947,2733.595,"--If the guidelines are unconstitutional because they make facts automatically determinative, I assume that would be unconstitutional because it makes facts automatically determinative."
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2733.595,2735.058,I assume too under the rationale--
2006.06-5754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2735.058,2752.038,"Well then, in other words, the Constitution of the United States prevents the courts themselves from trying to assure that sentences who are... that individuals who are in similar positions, commit similar crimes, will be treated in similar ways."
2006.06-5754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2758.362,2762.696,So long as the jury determines the facts that make them similar.
2006.06-5754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2762.696,2763.538,--We're back--
2006.06-5754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2763.538,2765.728,The problem here is what makes them similar.
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2765.728,2767.218,--I understand this dialogue.
2006.06-5754,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2794.747,2798.951,I don't know how terribly different it is than the normal review for abuse of discretion.
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2831.542,2837.964,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not arguing for any proposition that I think would raise concern."
2006.06-5754,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2849.664,2854.957,"Mr. Dreeben, may I ask you, please, to address a point that Mr. Cochran raised?"
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2911.713,2917.769,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't think there was anything problematic with what this district judge did."
2006.06-5754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3034.104,3035.195,May I ask this question?
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3048.884,3058.31,"Well, Justice Stevens, our position is more complicated than that, because within a guidelines range if a sentence is imposed, the Government--"
2006.06-5754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3058.31,3062.534,Why shouldn't there be also the same presumption when it is outside the guidelines range?
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3062.534,3073.56,--Because sentences that are outside the guidelines range are more likely to be the cause of or a source of unwarranted disparity than a sentence within the range.
2006.06-5754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3084.527,3095.135,"Well, do you think the interest in uniformity, in same sentences across the board is stronger than the interest in getting the correct sentence for the particular defendant who's in court at the time?"
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3095.135,3098.829,"--Well, there isn't any one correct sentence usually."
2006.06-5754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3098.829,3099.406,"No, there isn't."
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3110.523,3118.29,"Because there are more legal elements that go into sentencing and sentencing review than just those that you've named, Justice Stevens."
2006.06-5754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3129.357,3131.21,"Yes, but it's sort of like findings of fact."
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3144.567,3165.711,"--What happens when a sentence is imposed outside the range is that there is a greater risk of infringing the main purpose of the Sentencing Reform Act, which was to avoid unwarranted disparities; and in contrast to a sentence within the range which does not merely run that risk to the same degree, a sentence outside the range may well."
2006.06-5754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3174.256,3177.078,"Well, you're... I mean, this is a self fulfilling prophecy."
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3190.455,3196.93,"I wouldn't put it as strongly as that, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-5754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3224.959,3248.496,"But that's just inconsistent with the notion which I think is correct, that the district judge can simply disagree with the basic... basic reasons of the commission, can simply disagree with the fact that the commission considers white collar crime, for example, something that should justify incarceration."
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3248.496,3258.842,"--But Justice Scalia, reasonableness review connotes that the court of appeals will review the reasons that the district court gave for that disagreement."
2006.06-5754,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3258.842,3276.043,"So doesn't your presumption argument come down to an argument for a sufficiently comprehensive statement of reasons, with a more extensive statement required the further the court gets from the guidelines?"
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3278.154,3280.327,"It does for an out of range sentence, Justice Souter."
2006.06-5754,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3297.077,3298.369,Is there... may I interrupt you?
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3319.611,3331.488,"--There is a distinction between them but I think they are complementary rules and in the next case the Government will argue for a presumption that is precisely what you have articulated, Justice Souter."
2006.06-5754,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3338.484,3344.929,Or presumably the further the facts suggest that you ought to depart from the guidelines range?
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3359.959,3373.006,"It wouldn't be identical but I agree with you, Mr. Chief Justice, that a sentence within the guidelines can be unreasonable if there is a compelling case for a sentence outside the range because the guidelines simply don't fit in that circumstance."
2006.06-5754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3389.308,3403.947,"Is the system that you're describing any different for mandatory guidelines that are subject to departure when the district judge finds a significant reason, which was what mandatory guidelines had?"
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3403.947,3405.107,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-5754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3405.748,3406.609,Wherein is it different?
2006.06-5754,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3406.609,3411.14,"--It is different precisely on the area that, that you yourself articulated."
2006.06-5754,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3426.201,3428.424,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2006.06-5754,2,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,3430.057,3431.539,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.06-5754,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3523.133,3538.352,"The, the judge also pointed out that the jury made certain findings and he thought he was bound by them; that is, the defendant protested his innocence, and the jury had found him guilty of false statements."
2006.06-5754,2,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,3538.352,3540.024,That's correct.
2006.06-5754,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3540.375,3541.647,The judge was bound by those.
2006.06-5754,2,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,3541.647,3551.465,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but interestingly the court found very dubious the additional information regarding the cross-reference."
2006.06-5754,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3574.358,3580.222,"Mr. Cochran, you've started out by saying there were two places in the record that you thought showed the judge was bound by the guidelines."
2006.06-5754,2,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,3581.932,3584.764,"Your Honor, the other one was page 87."
2006.06-5754,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3584.764,3585.745,"Of the one... oh, that point?"
2006.06-5754,2,42550,thomas_n_cochran,,3586.126,3603.076,"And that would be in the second paragraph, Mr. Chief Justice, where the court found it was unable to stray or found the guidelines were inappropriate; and I suggest that that is a, a giving of greater weight and too much so in this case."
2006.06-5754,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3617.298,3618.119,"Thank you, Mr. Cochran."
