1983.82-2113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.988,We'll hear arguments next in Richardson against United States.
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,103.758,107.481,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-2113,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,248.032,252.106,"Now Abney came up in a somewhat different posture than this case, didn't it?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,252.106,253.408,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-2113,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,273.33,278.953,But why do you have to assume the validity of your claim in order to determine its appealability?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,278.953,283.207,"--Well, because if it's not a double jeopardy violation, we're out of court."
1983.82-2113,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,284.817,293.883,"Yes, but presumably you'll never know whether there is a double jeopardy violation until you get a determination on the merits on appeal."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,293.883,294.514,Well--
1983.82-2113,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.514,297.246,"I mean, there's a circularity about it, I suppose, from both sides."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,297.246,300.228,"--Well, as we indicated, it's a self-determining claim."
1983.82-2113,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,329.326,337.041,But that assumes a view of the law of double jeopardy that is certainly not necessarily represented by any of this Court's opinions.
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,345.597,356.394,"Well, that gets us to the next question, whether it is double jeopardy or not, whether there is jeopardy, and that's why I assumed for the first argument that it was, because the government now makes the claim that it isn't."
1983.82-2113,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,389.115,400.302,"When you say a Mr. Palmer, do you mean one that will... ultimately ought to be validated or one that you just cite the right cases for?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,400.302,406.998,--A true double jeopardy claim in the sense that it raises a double jeopardy issue.
1983.82-2113,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,432.313,438.317,"But now that's a view of double jeopardy law, but it certainly is not nailed down by any cases of this Court."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,439.997,445.043,"Well, I think Burks supplies us with an underpinning to make that argument."
1983.82-2113,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,462.624,470.567,"Well, the Courts of Appeals may agree on that, but I don't think that this Court has certainly resolved the thing one way or the other."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,480.526,482.246,"Of course not, Your Honor."
1983.82-2113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,482.246,485.508,That's almost what I gathered from what you just said.
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,488.7,490.411,I have tried many cases.
1983.82-2113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,530.158,540.474,"Well, then, doesn't that add up to just what I described as your position that in every case where a jury does not agree unanimously--"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,540.474,544.126,"No, because in many cases they may have trouble with a witness."
1983.82-2113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,556.634,563.39,--What other grounds do you suggest that produce a hung jury?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,563.39,566.97,In which someone could not be retried?
1983.82-2113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,566.97,573.435,"Just in the abstract, when a jury does not agree either on some counts or on all counts?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,573.435,576.628,When you can't get twelve jurors to say guilty or not guilty.
1983.82-2113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,576.628,580.521,Then you say that's the end of the road for the prosecution?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,580.521,581.53,"Oh, no, not at all, Your Honor."
1983.82-2113,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,590.008,591.736,"Mr. Palmer, I thought I heard you say--"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,591.736,592.528,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-2113,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,592.528,604.777,--You're limiting your argument to situations in which the trial judge has made an error in submitting the case to the jury because there was insufficient proof by the prosecution.
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,604.777,605.645,Yes.
1983.82-2113,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,605.645,608.327,To get the prosecution to the jury; is that what you're saying?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,608.327,609.849,"Yes, it should never get to the jury."
1983.82-2113,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,609.849,617.844,And it's in that situation where he makes the error and there's a hung jury that you say you make your argument for double jeopardy?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,617.844,620.065,Solely in that limited context.
1983.82-2113,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,621.798,635.245,"But, Mr. Palmer, have you ever seen a criminal case where the defense attorney didn't make a motion at the conclusion of the state's case to dismiss for insufficient evidence?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,635.245,635.996,--Yes.
1983.82-2113,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,635.996,659.021,"Well, I haven't, and I have sat on many, and what you're really talking about here is setting up the possibility, at least, of making Federal habeas claims in every state prosecution that might end in a hung jury based on the insufficiency of the evidence claimed."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,672.901,679.373,"Well, it may be in the habeas corpus context that if the government has failed in its proof it has no right to retry somebody."
1983.82-2113,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,679.373,699.119,"Well, even if you're right, the point is I guess we have to be a little bit concerned with the administration of the system and with seeing to it that maybe state prosecutions can go on and finish their course before we start the Federal habeas review."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,722.484,732.02,"Well, insofar as the states are concerned, we're just talking here about a Federal statute and the appealability thereunder."
1983.82-2113,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,744.297,754.463,"Well, but I suppose what we decide here will certainly be governing what happens on Federal habeas from state prosecutions."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,763.85,765.44,"Oh, I don't believe it can, Your Honor."
1983.82-2113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,765.44,793.661,"Well, then in every case, in every case in a state court, even though here we have a Federal case, in every case where there is a hung jury in a state case automatically that would be a habeas corpus case, and the habeas Federal District Court would be performing the function of the state appellate process to determine the issues you raised."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,793.661,795.651,"Well, I don't know the context of the rise."
1983.82-2113,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,813.653,821.397,"Well, anyway under the habeas statute doesn't the habeas petitioner have to exhaust all of his--"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,821.397,821.877,--State remedies.
1983.82-2113,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,821.877,824.219,--state remedies before he's allowed into habeas?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,824.219,826.172,I understand that to be the rule.
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,842.06,846.914,"Well, how do you get the right to appeal on a hung jury?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,846.914,857.07,"--Well, we filed a motion in bar of prosecution based on double jeopardy, and then when that was denied we appealed that denial."
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,857.07,860.122,What was the basis of the double jeopardy?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,860.122,872.301,"Well, we alleged and indeed show at length in our brief, that the evidence in support of the prosecution was insufficient as a matter of law, under Glasser."
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,872.301,874.151,It was a normal appeal?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,881.146,883.317,If he had been convicted--
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,883.317,885.668,Wouldn't that be the appeal you would have made?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,885.668,887.16,"--Of course, if he had been convicted."
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,887.16,891.204,"Well, how can you make that... what judgment did you appeal from?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,891.204,892.524,The failure to--
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,892.524,894.654,"What judgment, judgment?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,895.585,896.076,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,901.91,909.284,"Well, what was your double jeopardy claim at the stage of where the jury came in on?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,917.471,919.801,When they were hung and a mistrial declared.
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,919.801,923.645,What else was done in deciding this trial?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,923.645,924.794,That was it.
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,926.935,928.598,And you can appeal that?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,928.598,932.44,"You cannot directly appeal that, as such."
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,932.44,933.109,Okay.
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,935.663,937.223,"Well, because--"
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,937.223,939.765,So you're now admitting you did appeal.
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,939.765,946.399,"--Well, we appealed it because everything... you may view evidence... let me put it this way."
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,955.496,958.567,Can you put that in without a judgment?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,963.76,968.803,"--As such, you cannot raise it, as such."
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,968.803,969.474,Right.
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,969.474,971.224,It has to be geared to a double jeopardy claim.
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,971.224,972.856,My point is you cannot raise it.
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,972.856,973.888,Correct.
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,973.888,976.47,"Well, how did you happen to raise it now?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,976.47,977.909,"Well, I'll show you."
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1036.368,1039.699,Am I correct the evidence did not convict him?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1039.699,1047.466,"That is correct, and we don't think the government should have the right on its failure of proof to attempt to convict him again."
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1049.747,1052.147,"You said ""convict him again""."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1057.822,1058.833,Should not have the right to--
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1058.833,1059.704,Isn't that right?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1061.275,1063.214,"--A hundred percent correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1065.147,1066.287,But he does have a right to appeal?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1066.287,1076.044,--The government does not have the right to retry and reprosecute a man if it failed to muster evidence at the first trial sufficient to convict.
1983.82-2113,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1076.044,1094.266,"Isn't it true, Mr. Palmer, as I think Justice Rehnquist may have made the point earlier, that all of the double jeopardy cases, from this Court, at least... and you correct me if I'm wrong... have not allowed a double jeopardy claim as a bar to a second trial unless there has been a judgment terminating the first trial."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1111.878,1115.871,"Well, we're relying on the right to obtain that judgment."
1983.82-2113,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1115.871,1126.407,"Correct, and there is no case, is there, in which a double jeopardy, a successful double jeopardy, plea has been sustained on the basis of a right to obtain a judgment that you didn't get?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1126.407,1136.534,"In Sneed, which we referred to in our supplemental brief for certiorari, there was an appeal of a conviction."
1983.82-2113,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1136.534,1138.314,I'm not familiar with Sneed.
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1139.616,1141.367,"It's in our supplemental brief, Your Honor."
1983.82-2113,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1142.358,1143.458,--Oh.
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1143.458,1145.982,"There are other cases like it... Bodey, et cetera."
1983.82-2113,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1233.838,1235.689,"Well, then maybe their analysis is unsound there."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1235.689,1237.9,"--Well, it may be, but it's one of the cases I'm relying on."
1983.82-2113,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1247.407,1249.039,This was after the second trial?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1249.039,1251.569,Before the second trial.
1983.82-2113,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1251.569,1253.79,I am puzzled.
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1253.79,1259.234,"It was strictly an interlocutory double jeopardy appeal, the very thing we have in this case, Your Honor."
1983.82-2113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1261.615,1263.087,Mr. Palmer?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1263.087,1264.377,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-2113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1264.377,1293.967,"I suppose it is not unknown at the conclusion of a trial in which there has been a hung jury so that there is no verdict, trial judges have been known to make an analysis and decide that the case... the judge should not have submitted the case to the jury, that there was not enough evidence, and he can then correct the error that you seek to correct here; is that not so?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1293.967,1294.387,Yes.
1983.82-2113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1294.387,1320.203,"And now suppose the judge, who has heard all the evidence, thinks it's an overwhelming case, but for reasons which no one has ever been able to explain about how juries function, including their right of compassionate verdict, they have decided to reach no verdict."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1336.765,1338.866,The trial court?
1983.82-2113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1338.866,1339.887,Yes.
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1339.887,1341.417,Well--
1983.82-2113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1341.417,1346.502,"A motion to dismiss at that time, after the hung jury."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1347.692,1348.312,--But we did make such a motion.
1983.82-2113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1348.312,1348.723,--Beg your pardon?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1348.723,1349.374,We did.
1983.82-2113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1349.374,1351.775,"Oh, I know, but there's nothing to prevent him from granting that relief."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1362.131,1362.832,Right.
1983.82-2113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1362.832,1369.928,Nevertheless you would say that there's an absolute right to a review of the kind you are seeking now?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1369.928,1372.499,In this limited context.
1983.82-2113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1409.582,1418.217,"But the District Judge was in a position to make that appraisal, was he not, whether he had adequate help from the prosecution or not?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1418.217,1420.798,"Well, in this case it was Judge Johnson."
1983.82-2113,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1488.024,1492.116,"Mr. Palmer, suppose... let me ask you this."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1523.518,1524.657,The Court of Appeals said--
1983.82-2113,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1524.657,1526.039,"Well, now let's just suppose that--"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1526.039,1526.868,--All right.
1983.82-2113,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1526.868,1530.151,--five Justices thought that.
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1532.284,1535.105,"Well, then I'm in a great deal of difficulty."
1983.82-2113,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1535.105,1539.326,"You are in great difficulty, but what should we do with it?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1548.042,1551.474,You will never reach it; that is correct.
1983.82-2113,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1553.405,1569.417,"But if it were appealable, it would only be appealable once, if there were five Justices who thought that it was not a substantial double jeopardy issue because it would never do you any good to appeal on this ground, on the double jeopardy case."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1569.417,1570.398,That is correct.
1983.82-2113,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1603.31,1616.517,"Well, you may call that an anomaly, but that's the way the railroad's been run for a long time, and the only possible ground that you've got is that Burks came along."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1616.517,1620.601,"Well, Burks admittedly overruled other precedent."
1983.82-2113,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1630.947,1637.682,"Well, we don't always follow this remousely the logic of some prior case."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1637.682,1640.984,"Well, we know that logic may not be the life of the law."
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1672.043,1676.056,When did the government reprosecute this man?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1676.056,1679.239,--It has not reprosecuted this man.
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1682.181,1685.083,"Well, have they alleged that right?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1685.083,1686.673,"Well, the trial date has been set."
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1686.673,1704.063,"What you did, you filed a motion for acquittal and a motion in bar of double jeopardy, and they were both considered together, and both denied together, and now you're trying to bootstrap one on top of the other."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1704.063,1712.401,"Well, I think, Your Honor, that it depends on the conceptual framework in which you look at it."
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1712.401,1713.23,I'm not depending on that.
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1719.164,1721.716,"Well, the mere fact--"
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1721.716,1723.618,You can't go back on this.
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1723.618,1728.58,"--Of course not, but the mere fact that the insufficient evidence--"
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1728.58,1731.442,"Well, can you give me one case where that was done?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1731.442,1736.615,--Where there was an appeal in this context?
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1736.615,1750.856,Where there was a motion for acquittal and a motion to bar trial of the man considered at the same time?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1754.096,1760.561,"Well, the case that we refer to, the Sneed case, Justice Stevens--"
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1760.561,1761.792,"That man was convicted, wasn't he?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1761.792,1762.463,--Well--
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1762.463,1764.233,Wasn't he?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1767.126,1775.181,"--But, Your Honor, the conceptual framework of the conviction was it was overturned, but the Court never considered the insufficiency of the evidence."
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1775.181,1777.841,"Well, is the answer to my question you don't have any case?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1777.841,1779.524,"No, I disagree with that entirely."
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1779.524,1781.845,"Well, give me the case."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1781.845,1783.207,The Sneed case supports--
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1783.207,1783.968,Which one?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1783.968,1787.068,--The one I just referred to supports us 100 percent.
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1787.068,1788.26,Was the man convicted?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1788.26,1789.191,Yes.
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1789.191,1792.263,"Well, isn't that a little different from this one?"
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1792.263,1794.314,"Not really, for the reason that--"
1983.82-2113,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1794.314,1795.473,Not really?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1795.473,1798.698,--The conviction was overturned for trial error.
1983.82-2113,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1857.777,1861.609,Except that the jury in this instance didn't reach a verdict.
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1861.609,1862.05,Right.
1983.82-2113,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1862.05,1870.195,"So perhaps the first trial was never actually completed in that sense, and maybe jeopardy doesn't attach in those circumstances."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1870.195,1871.387,Well--
1983.82-2113,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1871.387,1874.058,Or it attaches but doesn't mature.
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1874.058,1889.319,"--Well, Justice O'Conner, the notion that the jury failed to reach a verdict, the trial lawyer or trial judge at first blush, you know, should be another trial if you have a mistrial."
1983.82-2113,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1995.878,1997.358,"Mr. Palmer, it hinges on what the judge did, not what the jury did."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1997.358,1997.698,Excuse me?
1983.82-2113,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1997.698,1999.509,"It hinges on what the judge did, not what the jury did."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,2003.342,2005.413,"Well, the judge erred in not--"
1983.82-2113,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2005.413,2010.969,"Well, you say so, but as Justice O'Conner points out there are an awful lot of cases that will be appealed if you prevail."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,2010.969,2012.408,--Not really.
1983.82-2113,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2012.408,2013.951,"Well, you say there won't be."
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,2013.951,2023.665,In the Federal context there were 58 retrials after mistrials in the entire year for which statistics were reported... 58 cases.
1983.82-2113,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2048.433,2053.025,You think that in very few of those cases there was a motion to dismiss at the end of the government's case?
1983.82-2113,0,16700,allan_m_palmer,,2053.025,2063.613,"--Usually there's a motion for judgment of acquittal, and, as Your Honor pointed out in concurring in Jackson v. Virginia, there are very few insufficient... true insufficient evidence cases."
1983.82-2113,1,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,2085.117,2100.165,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-2113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2171.274,2186.903,"Mr. Palmer, if the insufficiency of the evidence at the first trial can be raised at the second trial, as the majority below found, how is that affected by the merits of the second trial?"
1983.82-2113,1,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,2186.903,2189.824,"Well, Justice O'Conner--"
1983.82-2113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2189.824,2194.379,I just don't understand your position on why it isn't collateral.
1983.82-2113,1,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,2194.379,2208.248,"--First of all, it's not a collateral issue because the question of the sufficiency goes directly to the heart of the... of the question to be determined at trial, namely guilt or innocence."
1983.82-2113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2211.971,2221.608,But I just don't see how an order denying a claim of insufficiency of the evidence at the first trial can be anything but collateral to everything that goes on at an entirely new trial.
1983.82-2113,1,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,2221.608,2229.621,"--Justice O'Conner, it is not a collateral because a decision is a decision on the merits, as this Court determined in Burks."
1983.82-2113,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2304.86,2319.959,"But sufficiency of the evidence at a trial that's already taken place, isn't there something to what Justice O'Conner says, that anything that happened at the first trial is almost by definition collateral to the second trial?"
1983.82-2113,1,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,2319.959,2328.956,"Justice Rehnquist, what was sought to be appealed from here had nothing to do with the second trial."
1983.82-2113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2359.907,2362.839,"Well, that was what the Court of Appeals majority found, Judge Wilke's opinion--"
1983.82-2113,1,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,2362.839,2363.24,--That's right.
1983.82-2113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2363.24,2370.914,"--And you thought that was fine all the way until footnote 25 of your brief up here, and seem to have changed your position--"
1983.82-2113,1,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,2370.914,2375.887,"Indeed, Justice O'Conner, we still think that that may... we still believe that that may--"
1983.82-2113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.887,2383.724,--But your second position I thought that you were going to voice today was that there is no double jeopardy issue at all in this case.
1983.82-2113,1,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,2383.724,2384.502,--That's correct.
1983.82-2113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2391.237,2392.759,"Well, they needn't be, need they?"
1983.82-2113,1,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,2392.759,2393.81,--I'm sorry.
