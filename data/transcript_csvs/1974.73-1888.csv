1974.73-1888,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,68.544,77.092,"Mr. Randolph, at that point, does your office does have any knowledge of why they chose that route rather than an original action here?"
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,77.092,80.682,I inquired about that Mr. Justice Blackmun because I was not there at that time.
1974.73-1888,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,189.632,191.378,Have you printed this Mr. Randolph?
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,191.378,194.333,"It's the map, Mr. Justice Brennan in the back of the brief."
1974.73-1888,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,194.333,199.574,Thank you.
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,199.574,206.072,"I can't emphasize enough that this is a vast area, incredibly vast."
1974.73-1888,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,249.339,256.72,"So, did this record give any square mile figures for the area that you're talking about?"
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,256.72,263.965,I have the square mile areas that the geographer of the state department gave me after using maps in the overlays.
1974.73-1888,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,265.467,266.716,Are they in the record?
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,266.716,271.375,They're not in the record and other than by the maps and these are material developed in the maps.
1974.73-1888,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,296.588,298.334,How big is Lake Michigan?
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,298.334,303.122,I have absolutely no idea sir.
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,303.122,309.564,"The north of Kalgin, north and east of Kalgin Island, that's a juridical bay, isn't it concededly?"
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,309.564,310.117,Yes.
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,310.117,313.08,And I suppose there are some juridical bays?
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,313.08,314.995,There are juridical bays within --
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,314.995,316.31,Kachemak Bay for example --
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,316.31,319.653,Yes and Kamishak Bay.
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,319.653,320.021,Kamishak Bay.
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,320.021,322.362,To the west are juridical bays.
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,322.362,326.516,Over the headlands are maybe more than Kamishak.
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,326.516,339.149,There's a map in the second volume of the appendix that is bound up in the volume that clearly indicates that is the map that the United States scripted at the foreign countries in 1971.
1974.73-1888,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,469.77,471.267,Beginning where?
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,471.267,473.85,Beginning at the three-mile line.
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,487.146,490.752,"Shore, as you say might include the --"
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,490.752,492.159,Inland waters.
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,492.159,492.898,-- inland waters.
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,494.084,495.112,"Well, yes sir."
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,496.466,496.962,Right.
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,496.962,497.58,From the coastline.
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,497.58,499.131,"Shore doesn't mean land, that's what I gather?"
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,499.131,503.716,"Yes, from the coastline."
1974.73-1888,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,503.716,512.741,What part of this -- what on this map shows what the United States says comprise inland waters --
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,512.741,513.028,From --
1974.73-1888,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,513.028,514.571,In Cook Inlet.
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,514.571,517.893,From Kalgin Island north.
1974.73-1888,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,523.659,526.053,That's three miles sea ward of that.
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,526.053,529.713,"Three miles, well that would be territorial, that's what it is."
1974.73-1888,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,534.554,540.68,What's the distance between that line and this lower line from Cape Douglas above?
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,540.68,551.419,"Well, the line, there's somewhat -- the line from Cape Douglas through Barren Island across the Point Gore is approximately 75 miles long."
1974.73-1888,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,551.419,558.662,"What I was wondering is, what's the distance from the Kalgin line to that line?"
1974.73-1888,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,558.662,560.129,The Cape Douglas line.
1974.73-1888,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,560.129,568.437,The Cape Douglas line.
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,568.437,574.784,Very approximately 102 miles.
1974.73-1888,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,574.784,575.425,102 miles.
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,581.532,584.694,"No, it's all outside of the three-mile."
1974.73-1888,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,584.694,585.235,Outside.
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,585.235,587.485,Yes.
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,792.019,800.111,"It's been pretty aggressive and claims to the Outer Continental Shelf, have we not?"
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,800.111,807.121,"Yes, but the Outer Continental Shelf is not an exercise of territorial jurisdiction so that it excludes ships for example."
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,807.121,808.155,"Well, but --"
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,808.155,815.141,We may mine there and we're in the process Mr. Justice Stewart of course in the law of the sea conference is now going on and negotiating.
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,815.141,820.711,I know that and our claims were quite extreme.
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,820.711,836.396,"The -- we think that the definition of international boundaries that the United States has traditionally asserted where it's heavily against Alaska's assertion that in the past, certain actions or inactions of the United States gave rise to historic title."
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,897.756,906.758,The party gives much weight to the era when Russia was in control of --
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,906.758,908.998,Neither party nor the Court.
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,908.998,911.663,"Did they destroy, although, there is some history."
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,911.663,912.491,There is some history.
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,915.608,917.915,Extravagantly a claims by the czar.
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,917.915,923.317,"Yes, which were quickly retracted upon protest by the United States and Great Britain."
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,923.317,925.585,"So, you're not going to deal with that at all."
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,925.585,931.612,"I'm not, the District Court, I don't belief relied upon it, and I don't believe that the counsel for the opposite side has either."
1974.73-1888,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,932.401,938.013,"Well, why do you stress the fact that they were only disputes about fishing?"
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,938.013,940.13,"I -- well, I'd like to get to that."
1974.73-1888,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1044.746,1048.31,"Without now -- find, where the --"
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1048.31,1049.41,The Barren Islands --
1974.73-1888,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1049.41,1049.889,No.
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1049.889,1055.49,The Barren Islands lie right in the middle of Cook Inlet of the line passing --
1974.73-1888,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1055.49,1057.465,"Oh yes, I have them."
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1057.465,1059.141,They went around the Barren Islands.
1974.73-1888,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1229.654,1235.72,In international law recognize the doctrine of hot pursuit?
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1235.72,1243.42,These ships were tracked from the time that they entered Alaskan waters until the time that they left.
1974.73-1888,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1258.592,1272.003,"The statement that you made of putting this aside, do you suggest that refers to what the Governor did in bringing the suit or in dismissing the suit?"
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1272.003,1273.755,The record is totally unclear on that.
1974.73-1888,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1276.274,1279.63,Did the district judge undertake to sort that out?
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1279.63,1282.093,He made a finding of fact.
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1376.069,1378.803,"Shelikof Strait is not an issue here, is it?"
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1378.803,1380.137,No it's not.
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1381.922,1397.438,"I just thought it was rather clear at least for purposes of this case that three miles out of Kodiak Island and from the mainland of Alaska, of course, there's territorial sea and the Shelikof Strait, but otherwise, the waters of the Shelikof Strait are international waters."
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1397.438,1400.001,Alaska asserts sovereignty over them.
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1404.174,1408.373,But that's not -- the waters of the Shelikof Strait are not at all an issue in this case.
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1408.373,1410.788,That's precisely my point Mr. Justice Stewart.
1974.73-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1410.788,1412.933,It's not my point and my question to.
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1412.933,1418.201,"The point is that the District Court said, this was the clearest in the entire record."
1974.73-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1786.775,1788.907,You're going to get to the Gharrett-Scudder maps.
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1788.907,1789.728,Right now.
1974.73-1888,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1846.007,1846.684,Where Mr. Randolph again?
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1846.684,1848.569,"8502, there are two maps."
1974.73-1888,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1848.569,1849.574,8502.
1974.73-1888,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1849.574,1850.812,8502.
1974.73-1888,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1918.735,1920.452,Mr. Phillips.
1974.73-1888,1,43186,thomas_m_phillips,,1920.452,1926.069,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1888,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2369.165,2371.99,But you say this argument was Mr. Phillips?
1974.73-1888,1,43186,thomas_m_phillips,,2371.99,2404.007,"This -- this Mr. Justice Brennan is the regulations put out each year for 33 years by first the Department of Commerce, Secretary of Commerce and later years, the Secretary of Interior, defining as the Act required him to do to set apart certain areas."
1974.73-1888,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2592.328,2619.668,"So, what you're telling us about the effect of White Act is certainly a strongly controverted by the secretary entrusted with its enforcement that is and the Secretary Udall back in April of 1962 who says these regulations were not intended to enlarge or extend the territorial waters of Alaska in a legal or jurisdictional sense."
1974.73-1888,1,43186,thomas_m_phillips,,2627.625,2633.085,"Well, I noticed, you're looking page 831 of the record and that's the letter of April 20 --"
1974.73-1888,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2633.085,2634.093,April 22 --
1974.73-1888,1,43186,thomas_m_phillips,,2634.093,2636.634,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1888,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2683.252,2695.403,"It is true, is it not that the way that they Act was not ever enforced against non-Americans?"
1974.73-1888,1,43186,thomas_m_phillips,,2695.403,2707.47,Enforced in this sense and we claim this is enforcement that there were -- it was distributed throughout the world.
1974.73-1888,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2724.71,2726.726,"Not netting salmon, didn't it?"
1974.73-1888,1,43186,thomas_m_phillips,,2726.726,2727.275,Sir?
1974.73-1888,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2727.275,2730.329,It didn't have primarily to do with netting of salmon?
1974.73-1888,1,43186,thomas_m_phillips,,2730.329,2734.033,"Yes, salmon was the important fishery."
1974.73-1888,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2877.859,2882.214,Your paper covers up the signal but you're now on your colleague's time.
1974.73-1888,1,43186,thomas_m_phillips,,2882.214,2888.101,"I'll be very quick, Your Honor."
1974.73-1888,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3025.681,3027.526,Mr. Cranston.
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,3027.526,3031.267,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1888,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3447.507,3450.371,What was that the appendix reference?
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,3450.371,3456.57,"Mr. Justice, that appendix reference is page 3 (a) on the brief of the United States."
1974.73-1888,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3456.57,3458.259,3 (a)?
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,3458.259,3464.634,"Yes, it's the last -- it's the page right before the map at the very end of the book, Your Honor."
1974.73-1888,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3464.634,3468.297,It's on paragraph 4 of Japan's protest.
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,3468.297,3472.671,The arrest of the ships is important.
1974.73-1888,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3556.653,3569.342,What's the problem with this Japanese seizure in 1962 was that it was not in Cook Inlet but it was in Shelikof Strait and that has -- that's all spelled out in Japan's protest.
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,3587.401,3621.825,"Mr. Justice, I fully agree that the arrest had to do with Shelikof Strait but what is important is the agreement entered into after Shelikof Strait to which the Japanese note -- upon which the Japanese has note commented and the actions of Japan in face of that agreement, after the agreement was entered into and after its note of protest complaining about the agreement's application to Cook Inlet."
1974.73-1888,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3621.825,3630.422,Are you referring to the agreement that the captain or the crew made after they had -- their ship had been seized?
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,3630.422,3640.809,That is correct Mr. Chief Justice and that is the agreement which was referred to and complained about in the Japanese note.
1974.73-1888,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3640.809,3657.925,Don't you think there might be some question about the status of notes secured under an agreement if you call it from the crew of the small fishing vessel under those circumstances?

1974.73-1888,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3658.292,3663.603,Might you not have some Miranda problems and few others like it?
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,3663.603,3672.0,"Aside from the fact that we are dealing in what is essentially a civil case Mr. Chief Justice, we do not rely on the agreement as acquiescence by the Japanese."
1974.73-1888,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3743.427,3747.018,But they roamed into Cook Inlet before that?
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,3747.018,3766.285,"The only recorded incident of their entering Cook Inlet is Mr. Ishi Mori's testimony at the trial where for approximately six hours, the Japanese fleet was in an area north of the Barren Islands on route to Shelikof Strait."
1974.73-1888,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3790.085,3797.314,Does this Japanese fishing fleet ever come in to Chesapeake Bay?
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,3797.314,3798.719,"Mr. Justice, I --"
1974.73-1888,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3798.719,3803.542,"I draw that, I'm trying to interrupt but it's never been in this inlet."
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,3813.61,3835.261,"The fact, Mr. Justice is that the Japanese protested the application of the agreement to Cook Inlet and they expressed concern over that apparently and in face of their protest, they have abstained from fishing in Cook Inlet."
1974.73-1888,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3840.019,3842.225,They haven't stopped.
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,3842.225,3843.131,"Yes, they have."
1974.73-1888,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3843.59,3848.02,They can't stop what they never started.
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,3848.02,3858.252,They felt apparently Mr. Justice that they had a right to do so or else they would not have protested.
1974.73-1888,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3873.514,3883.563,"Mr. Cranston, I want to be sure, has Alaska now abandoned its claim that sovereignty at one time was exercised by the Russians?"
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,3886.675,3896.058,We feel Mr. Justice that that is not crucial to the disposition of this cause.
1974.73-1888,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3924.203,3945.805,"Now on the Japanese situation, you're taking the position, I take it that the absence of Japanese shipping in Cook Inlet equates with a positive acquiescence in the claim of sovereignty."
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,3945.805,3947.167,"That is our position, Your Honor."
1974.73-1888,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3950.504,3955.979,Do you have any other instance of any other foreign nation's acquiescence?
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,3955.979,3962.061,"Yes, we do, although I would be very glad to answer that question if I may."
1974.73-1888,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4092.331,4099.962,"But in fact is that Canadian fishermen, mullet fishermen have been in there since."
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,4099.962,4114.14,The record Mr. Justice and the finding of the Court is that this was done in 1957 subsequent to statehood.
1974.73-1888,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4122.06,4124.408,How does anybody know they were there?
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,4124.408,4126.149,"That's correct, they --"
1974.73-1888,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4126.149,4128.09,"How do we know they were there, if they were undetected?"
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,4128.09,4148.834,"The records of the Pacific Halibut Commission when a vessel enters any waters under the jurisdiction of the halibut commission, it must file records with that commission as to where this fish and some of those records, exhibit 78 and 80 indicated --"
1974.73-1888,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4148.834,4150.354,Show that they were in Cook Inlet.
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,4150.354,4161.136,"Yes, but more important Mr. Justice is that some of the records also indicated fairly that the Canadian vessels were within the three-mile limit of Cook Inlet."
1974.73-1888,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4194.176,4202.825,"Back in his 1962 Japanese seizure incident, there seems to be some -- nobody seems to have known where the Otori Maru was seized."
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,4208.618,4220.125,"Mr. Justice, there were three vessels involved, the Banshu Maru and I believe two mother ships or two other sister ships."
1974.73-1888,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4242.527,4243.11,Very well.
1974.73-1888,2,18600,charles_k_cranston,,4243.499,4244.188,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1974.73-1888,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4244.188,4247.322,The case is submitted.
