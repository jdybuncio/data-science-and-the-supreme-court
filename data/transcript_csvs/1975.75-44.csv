1975.75-44,0,23588,francis_b_burch,,41.951,46.07,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-44,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,189.451,192.084,Do you have penitential in Baltimore?
1975.75-44,0,23588,francis_b_burch,,192.084,192.63,Pardon me sir?
1975.75-44,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,192.63,194.828,"Penitential in Baltimore, where he was?"
1975.75-44,0,23588,francis_b_burch,,194.828,197.108,"Penitential, Maryland state Penitentiary, in Baltimore City, yes."
1975.75-44,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,197.108,200.469,Oh! Is that solitary is still down underground?
1975.75-44,0,23588,francis_b_burch,,200.469,202.757,"Well, I do not really do not know Mr. Justice Marshall."
1975.75-44,1,21598,donald_r_stutman,,208.195,213.101,(Inaudible)
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,213.101,218.344,"It is the south wing segregation division which I understand is not underground, is that correct?"
1975.75-44,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,339.474,348.778,"General Burch, what would the Maryland Commission have done in this case if the allegations of the petition were true?"
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,352.79,364.476,"If the allegations were true, the commission could have changed the system with respect to, they could have taken disciplinary actions against the guards who were involved in question."
1975.75-44,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,395.359,400.933,"If the allegations were true, they were not following rules which are already in effect, is that not correct?"
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,403.976,414.934,It was difficult to state exactly what Mr. McCray alleged because the allegations in the complaint were prepared by him in his own hand and they are not particularly articulate.
1975.75-44,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,414.934,421.999,"Well, at least the Court of Appeals thought he had alleged that there was a violation by the Prison Officials of the Prison's own rules?"
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,421.999,436.725,"Well, it may well be that he could have claimed that there were violations of the Prison's own rules, but at least the Grievance Commission as approved by the action of the Secretary would have been able then to take remedial action within the Institution itself."
1975.75-44,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,436.725,436.943,And what (Voice Overlap)
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,436.943,443.71,To see that it did not occur again and that would be the nature of the relief that was requested which was both declaratory and injunctive.
1975.75-44,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,444.963,460.203,"Mr. General, I think there is a statement in the majority opinion of the Court of Appeals to the effect that a state is required to follow its own procedural rules and of course that is certainly true in the Federal Government."
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,465.707,477.625,"Well I would not say that it is necessarily a constitutional requirement, unless it involves a Constitutional Right, but certainly it would be the most desirable thing that a state be required to follow its own rules or an institution --"
1975.75-44,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,477.625,484.414,Where it is not a Constitutional Right then presumably the Federal Court has no business imposing it on a state?
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,484.414,496.27,"It certainly would not have the right to impose that burden on the state unless it involved the impingement of a Constitutional Right, it would seem to me."
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1223.91,1230.654,"Mr. Attorney General, is the practice under which this man had been complaining still in existence?"
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1230.654,1231.572,It is still what Mr. Justice?
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1231.572,1234.805,In existence in this penitentiary?
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1234.805,1239.639,As far as I know the practice of putting him in the solitary confinement?
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1239.639,1243.564,"Put him in solitary, is that still being practiced?"
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1243.564,1249.338,Solitary confinement is being practiced in the -- what are considered to be the appropriate cases.
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1249.338,1250.999,It would be in (Inaudible)
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1250.999,1252.031,Where there is an appropriate case.
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1253.237,1256.84,"Oh! I mean you have known about this case, have you not?"
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1256.84,1257.211,That is right.
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1257.693,1259.802,And you made no effort to change the practice --?
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1259.802,1261.796,The practice has been changed.
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1261.796,1263.309,I thought you said you did not.
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1263.309,1265.8,Let me say this first of all Mr. Justice Marshall.
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1308.281,1312.475,I respectfully ask your answer to my question.
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1317.087,1322.063,"Are you asking me, is there solitary confinement under certain extreme cases?"
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1322.063,1323.02,Like this one.
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1323.02,1324.098,No.
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1333.472,1340.222,I thought you are asking this Court to give Maryland a chance to take care of its own problem?
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1340.222,1341.312,That is correct.
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1341.312,1345.085,You have had that chance and you have not done anything about it.
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1345.085,1347.854,"Well, the case has not finally been disposed of on its merits, Your Honor."
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1347.854,1350.774,But practice is still there?
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1350.774,1357.419,"We say that in the proper case, a solitary confinement is still used, in the proper case."
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1357.419,1361.863,"(Inaudible) and stay there until somebody goes to the state route, so far as you are concerned?"
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1361.863,1362.607,Well --
1975.75-44,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1362.607,1369.225,"And you would say, well, stay there till the Federal Courts get through it and approve it in appropriate cases too?"
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1369.225,1382.74,"There is a question about that, Your Honor and I am just saying if we are not -- the state has not abolished the practice where it is necessary for the protection of the inmate as it was in this case, where it is necessary for the protection of the other population of the prisons."
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1382.74,1388.242,"This is I think proved, did you he stripped?"
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1388.242,1395.277,He was put in isolation for the purpose of protecting him because he had acted in a very strange manner.
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1416.17,1419.1,The state of Maryland have any psychiatric treatment?
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1419.1,1421.475,"Yes, they have psychiatric provisions."
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1421.475,1423.608,Did they treat him?
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1423.608,1425.141,They tried to obtain --
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1425.141,1426.723,Did they treat him?
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1426.723,1432.203,"Within a matter of two or three days, they were able to get the psychiatrist to come in and to interview him and to get him the treatment."
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1432.203,1434.349,After you had his clothes taken away from him and he is thrown in the cell?
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1434.349,1438.611,"They made an effort, over the weekends which was in this particular instance, three days weekend --"
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1438.611,1440.167,It is perfectly alright?
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1440.167,1441.633,I am not saying it is perfectly alright.
1975.75-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1457.046,1460.708,"But General I asked you had it been corrected, you said it had not."
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1461.776,1472.284,"Well, If Your Honor please, I understood your question to suggest as that maybe the whole question of solitary confinement was eliminated from the prisoner system."
1975.75-44,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1506.783,1517.373,"Mr. Attorney General on that very question, am I correct in understanding that the Court of Appeals did not disagree with the findings of fact, but rather drew different inferences for those findings?"
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1517.373,1518.266,They did.
1975.75-44,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1527.694,1532.263,"48 hours without clothing in a cell, without heat and so forth was cruel and unusual?"
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1532.263,1533.7,Which we respectfully disagree with.
1975.75-44,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1533.7,1540.215,"Yes, but the Court of Appeals will not be bound on that kind of question by the judgment of the District Court, would it?"
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1540.215,1543.45,The Court of Appeals obviously would have the right to make whatever determination it saw fit (Voice Overlap) the law.
1975.75-44,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1543.45,1546.377,But it is not like setting aside of finding of fact as clearly erroneous?
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1546.377,1557.685,But we think that it was clearly erroneous on the part of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to make such a finding of law on the basis of the facts as established in the record.
1975.75-44,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1557.685,1560.814,"Mr. Attorney General, may I ask you a question?"
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1560.814,1561.654,"Yes sir, Mr. Justice Powell."
1975.75-44,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1561.654,1566.189,Just come back to the adequacy of the administrative remedy.
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1585.925,1587.977,The Commission cannot award damages.
1975.75-44,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1587.977,1592.88,"I understand that, but does it make any finding with respect to the entitlement to damage?"
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1592.88,1623.261,"I do not believe that it makes any finding of fact with respect to damages, but I do believe that what it does, it develops a record which the Federal District Court where a claimed for damages has been made at the appropriate time, may then have the benefit of that record, a determination on the face of the record is to whether there has been a substantive denial which would on the face of it seemed to entitlement to damage, it was the right for the Federal Court then to take such a additional action as it deemed necessary such as this testimony as it deemed necessary in order to get full and final relief."
1975.75-44,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1623.261,1633.449,Are there any decisions of a Federal District Court in Baltimore that indicate whether that record is admissible in evidence?
1975.75-44,2,23588,francis_b_burch,,1633.449,1634.5,I know of none.
1975.75-44,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1670.27,1674.216,Mr. Morgan.
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,1674.216,1678.002,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-44,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1817.35,1822.382,How many actions has Mr. McCray brought?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,1822.382,1823.636,The records reflects that Your Honor.
1975.75-44,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1830.778,1835.216,All in District Court or are some of them just to Internal Grievances?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,1835.216,1838.43,"Well, I believe some of them were in the state court system as well."
1975.75-44,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1839.045,1842.387,But you think some 37 Court actions?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,1842.387,1845.417,That is reflected somewhere in the record in Chief Judge Norton's opinion.
1975.75-44,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1847.507,1851.141,"I thought he said 55, it does not make any difference but --"
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,1851.141,1852.364,I am not sure about that sir.
1975.75-44,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1852.364,1859.188,(Inaudible) name is a familiar one here.
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,1859.188,1876.438,"As the state concedes the Maryland Inmate Grievance Commission does not have the authority to award either compensatory or punitive money damages and when an administrative agency is not empowered to grant relief, effective relief or as in this case any relief, it must be deemed to be inadequate remedy and exhaustion should not be required."
1975.75-44,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1893.097,1895.871,Mr. Morgan may I back of a minute?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,1901.369,1905.907,"Where, are the Commission under the statute has no enforcement authority whatsoever."
1975.75-44,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1905.907,1908.134,"They could issue an injunction, could they not?"
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,1908.134,1908.612,"No, Your Honor."
1975.75-44,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1919.284,1921.312,What if they wanted to?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,1921.312,1923.778,Well he has the authority under the statute to review all.
1975.75-44,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1923.778,1925.232,There is no compulsion?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,1925.232,1925.35,There is no compulsion.
1975.75-44,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1925.35,1931.153,I mean you could not -- the commission could not change what was going on in the penitentiary.
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,1931.153,1932.775,"No, Your Honor, not the Commission directly."
1975.75-44,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1936.713,1940.712,"What is the fact, what is the history of it?"
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,1945.931,1948.221,To the Prison System?
1975.75-44,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2017.937,2035.917,"Mr. Morgan did we not have that sort of bifurcation in Preiser to where it was clear that damage ream or the damage claim of a prisoner could be retained on the docket of the District Court, but that his claim for other relief might have to go through state exhaustion?"
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2035.917,2036.122,Yes sir.
1975.75-44,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2062.574,2072.231,Involved I take it as a predicate to the damage award a declaration of some breach of Federal law?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2072.231,2073.956,It would require a finding of fact by the District Court.
1975.75-44,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2073.956,2075.228,Determination at least.
1975.75-44,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2075.228,2079.607,Determination that they was a violation of Federal constitutional right?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2079.607,2083.306,"That would be required in the District Court, yes sir."
1975.75-44,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2186.169,2190.634,What if on the state's appeal that was reversed?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2190.634,2203.185,"Well, Your Honor, we are not saying that the decision in the Hopkins case which is the case I was referring to will necessary rule in Stokes' favor, but it will resolve Stokes' issue one way or another."
1975.75-44,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2217.714,2234.223,"So you say that, however, the Court of Appeals rules on it, it will either does -- a decision in favor of the appellant there will be unfavorable to your client, a decision in favor of the appellee will be favorable to him and he will be bound and either then?"
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2234.223,2249.19,He will be bound by that except with regard in his damage claim which applies only to his specific instance of being denied specific literature several years ago.
1975.75-44,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2289.113,2290.257,Mr. Morgan.
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2290.257,2291.779,"Yes, Your honor."
1975.75-44,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2291.779,2298.929,Why do you say that only Congress could make some interpretation of Section 1983?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2298.929,2302.512,"Well, Your Honor that was exactly the point I was about to develop if I can carry through with it."
1975.75-44,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2302.512,2303.855,Why?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2303.855,2304.754,Why is Congress --?
1975.75-44,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2304.754,2315.805,"Why do you say that we lack power to reinterpret if we decided to do it, 1983 prior to 1963 in Monroe against Pape."
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2319.706,2322.628,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-44,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2379.357,2379.852,(Inaudible)Mr. Morgan.
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2379.852,2381.638,More directly answering your question.
1975.75-44,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2381.638,2385.743,"Well, may I interrupt you because it might show in your answer."
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2399.271,2401.775,"I am not suggesting that the Court has no authority, Your Honor."
1975.75-44,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2401.775,2402.883,What are you arguing then?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2402.883,2407.363,What we are arguing is that this would be an improper role for the Court to take.
1975.75-44,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2407.363,2408.048,An improper?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2408.048,2420.701,"An improper role for the Court to take, particularly with regard to prisoner grievance mechanism for some of the reasons that I would like to express if I may."
1975.75-44,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2453.678,2461.758,What is your authority for saying that same Congress made a determination in 1871 that there should be no exhaustion of administrative remedy?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2464.378,2474.016,"Your Honor, I think that comes from a long line of decisions of from this Court beginning with Monroe versus Pape in extending through Damaco in Bicknese (ph) and District of Columbia versus Carter and all the cases that I have cited."
1975.75-44,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2474.016,2484.34,"You can argue on two different grounds here and if it strikes may that perhaps, at least I do not understand it to being firmly committed to one or the other or to perhaps both."
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2512.493,2517.958,"Well, we assert that the question of what legislative intent was behind 1871, is no longer open."
1975.75-44,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2523.71,2529.007,Even though in Monroe versus Pape where the Court was confronted only with judicial remedy?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2529.007,2531.882,"Well, that is true, only judicial remedies in that case, Your Honor, but --"
1975.75-44,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2531.882,2533.826,"We are not bound by dicta, are we?"
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2533.826,2575.931,"No sir, but past Monroe versus Pape there was a serious of decisions that decided that the intent of the 1871 Act applied not only to judicial, but also to administrative remedies and also that it applied to remedies which where available inadequate that the fact of adequate available remedies made no difference in what the Congressional intent was and having established that as the Congressional intent, it would be improper for in the absence of some evidence that there was different Congressional intent before anyone, besides Congress to reevaluate the policies that underly Section 1871 Act."
1975.75-44,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2584.372,2591.231,"(Inaudible) appropriate to Mr. Justice Powell, you suggested lack of power."
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2592.911,2595.412,"Well, Your Honor I think it is really the proper term is inappropriate."
1975.75-44,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2684.226,2686.386,"At present where are they, both in the Committee?"
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2686.386,2686.607,MYes sir.
1975.75-44,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2688.299,2691.56,"Supposed to be introduced in the House, one by the Chairman of the Committee?"
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2691.56,2694.663,A one by Mr. Rodino and one by Mr. Railsback.
1975.75-44,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2694.663,2696.387,Any hearings on them?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2696.387,2697.087,I do not know sir.
1975.75-44,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2714.474,2720.958,Mr. Morgan do those Bills merely provide for exhaustion in prisoner cases or in cases generally?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2720.958,2723.443,I can speak to the Railsback bill specifically.
1975.75-44,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2733.123,2749.907,"What do you suppose the underlying -- what do you understand the underlying argument for exhaustion to be, what is the rationale that is been suggested as it to avoid the decision of the constitutional issues, is that it or what is it?"
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2749.907,2753.848,"I am sorry sir, do you mean the rationale for exhaustion --"
1975.75-44,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2753.848,2759.403,What is the rationale as you understand that is being offered for a requirement of exhaustion?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2759.403,2772.321,"I think what the state is saying in this case, Your Honor, is that because the state of Maryland has developed what they say is an adequate state administrative remedy that this Court should then require state prisoners to exhaust that remedy."
1975.75-44,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2772.321,2785.929,Although concededly there is no damage remedy and concededly I suppose the administrative processes in Maryland prison is not going to decide a constitutional question?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2785.929,2797.975,I think that in the way in which the Inmate Grievance Commission is setup definitely it is far from any guarantee that the Inmate Grievance Commission is going to be adequately able to solve constitutional questions.
1975.75-44,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2797.975,2804.969,The administrative procedures usually do not declare some prison regulation unconstitutional for example?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2804.969,2817.876,"Well, I think at most what the Grievance Commission could do, would be to declare that a prison regulation is no longer meet sound correctional standards, but I do not think it is qualified to declare something unconstitutional."
1975.75-44,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2817.876,2824.875,Is it not the most that exhaustion would produce is a remedy that would perhaps obviate a result to the Federal Court?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2824.875,2834.163,I think that is one of the primary policies that underly an exhaustion requirement in any circumstances in a sense --
1975.75-44,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2834.163,2840.764,First of all that the whole about these potential losses would disappear through?
1975.75-44,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2840.764,2841.752,Just go away.
1975.75-44,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2841.752,2868.997,"(Voice Overlap) combination in the administrative remedy state that they never, therefore get to Court and secondly that those who did get to Court would perhaps have saved the judge time because the some of the issues might have been eliminated or at least and other is refined and the position of the state would be better known and the administrative procedure would have served to separate some of the weak from the champ."
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2875.991,2886.752,It would seem to me Your Honor that -- it would seem to me that the fundamental purposes of exhaustion should be to create a record for the District Court and also to allow the agency an opportunity to correct its own errors.
1975.75-44,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2886.752,2888.575,Solve the problem before they got to Court?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2888.575,2889.857,And I think that those two --
1975.75-44,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2889.857,2897.774,Are you suggesting that in the Federal Court that there would not be a de novo determination based on a hearing?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2897.774,2897.934,No sir.
1975.75-44,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2897.934,2900.045,You would not think you would be bound by the record?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2900.045,2903.067,"No sir, we have suggested just the opposite in our brief."
1975.75-44,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2903.067,2909.374,"(Inaudible) in Federal District Court would be aided by whatever record was made, not limited to it?"
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2909.374,2909.641,Yes sir.
1975.75-44,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2925.269,2935.895,"Now, that if he decide objected to the use of the any part of the record, there might be some trouble if the judge nevertheless used it?"
1975.75-44,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2935.895,2939.278,"(Inaudible) some might be admissible, some might not?"
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,2939.278,2974.767,"We take the position under the Grievance Commission statute as it presently exists without enabling legislation from Congress, the District Court simply cannot use the record of the administrative agency proceeding as anymore than a matter of interest to read the facts of what perhaps happened, but as far using it in the decision making process, we would say that would be inappropriate in the absence of the legislation and more particularly we believe that legislation is particularly -- that kind of a requirement should not be imposed without legislation because really it is only congress who is able to evaluate all the interests that are involved."
1975.75-44,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2986.657,3001.671,"Do you think the Court directed the Federal Bureau prison showing that in one year after they inaugurated internal grievance procedures, prisoner’s complaints to the Federal District Courts dropped by approximately one-third?"
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,3001.671,3004.64,"I have not seen that report, Your Honor."
1975.75-44,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3004.64,3010.697,They have the statement of the Director of the prisons in the appendix to your brief.
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,3010.697,3011.641,"Well, Your Honor that --"
1975.75-44,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3011.641,3012.583,(Inaudible)
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,3012.583,3013.674,That was a dissenting opinion.
1975.75-44,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3036.122,3038.907,When did the Commission commenced the function?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,3038.907,3045.324,I think it was 1971 legislation that set up the commission and I think they began to function about a year later or less.
1975.75-44,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3045.324,3051.121,Does the record show how many cases that the Commission has processed to final decision?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,3051.121,3057.529,"In our supplemental brief, I think that we brought those statistics up to date, Your Honor."
1975.75-44,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3057.529,3060.049,You recall generally what they are?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,3060.049,3073.859,I think that they are referred to -- certainly that the record of the case at the time there was an evidentiary hearing in the Court contained that information and I think it is been updated through our supplemental brief and also through some of the materials filed by the state in the case.
1975.75-44,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3073.859,3082.763,Is there any indication as to what percentage of the final decisions of the Commission in fact are taken into the Federal Court?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,3082.763,3083.535,"No, Your Honor."
1975.75-44,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3089.089,3090.203,I heard him state that --
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,3090.203,3094.481,I do not believe that figure is in the record and I have not heard it from any other source.
1975.75-44,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3178.137,3182.125,What do you mean by satisfaction of the inmate?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,3182.125,3201.224,"Your Honor, that term was used by the Executive Director in his deposition and I think again that indicates a difficulty in trying to impose an exhaustion requirement to 1983 because it is difficult to say what it means to the satisfaction of the inmate."
1975.75-44,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3221.065,3230.06,"Mr. Morgan, do you know if those statistics are very different from the percentage of cases that resolve satisfactorily to the inmate that are filed in Federal Court?"
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,3230.06,3231.797,"No sir, I do not know what the statistics are on that?"
1975.75-44,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3231.797,3233.81,"It is clearly low percentage there are to, I believe?"
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,3233.81,3240.941,"I imagine that it is low, Your Honor and I was not suggesting the figure to show that a lot of prisoner complaints are meritorious and the Grievance Commission is turning them down."
1975.75-44,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3252.616,3258.559,"Well, it is finding that the original action need not be corrected."
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,3263.008,3265.397,"Perhaps, yes sir."
1975.75-44,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3438.769,3447.136,"I assume you can argue too since the state has been willing to adopt it, it does not unreasonably frustrate the goals of Prison Administration?"
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,3447.136,3464.182,"That certainly is our position, Your Honor and in the brief we cite to a number of other state and federal prison regulations which are similar or even more restrictive of prison officials, certainly what Maryland has imposed on its own Prison Officials is the bare minimum under these circumstances, McCray did not get it."
1975.75-44,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3464.182,3481.689,"(Inaudible) understand that I think you would be here even if you agree that the prison procedure, the grievance procedure was as adequate as a grievance procedure could be, you would still say that there is no need to exhaust it?"
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,3481.689,3485.745,"Yes sir, we take the position of the adequacy of the remedy is not the controlling factor."
1975.75-44,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3492.473,3511.36,"And that even though a good inadequate grievance procedure might screen out or obviate the necessity of considering 75% of the cases, nevertheless the plaintiff should be able to directly to file under 1983?"
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,3511.36,3522.974,"We believe that, that kind of an exhaustion requirement cannot at this point be grafted onto the Civil Rights Act without Congressional Amendment."
1975.75-44,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3522.974,3526.885,Mr. Morgan you also rely on the Eighth Amendment in your Constitutional claim?
1975.75-44,3,19693,charles_f_morgan,,3526.885,3531.472,"Yes sir, we do and the only reason I did not direct myself to it is because the red light was on."
1975.75-44,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3536.514,3539.558,Mr. Attorney General.
1975.75-44,4,23588,francis_b_burch,,3539.558,3540.891,May it please the Court.
1975.75-44,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3580.278,3584.595,What do you think the basis for the requiring exhaustion is Mr. Attorney General?
1975.75-44,4,23588,francis_b_burch,,3584.595,3595.492,"The basis for requiring exhaustion is to give the opportunity to the Court, first of all it is federal comity -- Federalism in comity as between national system and the state system."
1975.75-44,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3595.492,3595.713,Yes.
1975.75-44,4,23588,francis_b_burch,,3606.437,3614.268,I would say that the same situation would prevail with respect to the 1983 cases as prevail with respect to the habeas corpus cases.
1975.75-44,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3619.97,3624.069,Certainly your state the courts are bound by the federal constitution and I --
1975.75-44,4,23588,francis_b_burch,,3624.069,3626.14,That is exactly right and so our administrative agencies.
1975.75-44,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3626.14,3632.131,"Well I know, but you do not usually act -- you do not usually see administrative agencies entertaining claims of constitutional violation?"
1975.75-44,4,23588,francis_b_burch,,3632.131,3633.495,"Oh! Yes they do, Your Honor."
1975.75-44,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3639.085,3644.195,"So they are going to be adjudicating, you can present claims of Eighth Amendment claims for example?M"
1975.75-44,4,23588,francis_b_burch,,3644.195,3644.88,They certainly could.
1975.75-44,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3652.207,3658.009,"Well, the administrative agency for example could not declare one of the regulations that have been issued unconstitutional at all?"
1975.75-44,4,23588,francis_b_burch,,3658.009,3664.046,They may hold that release should be granted because it would appear that the particular regulation is unconstitutional.
1975.75-44,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3665.579,3666.204,In the administrative --
1975.75-44,4,23588,francis_b_burch,,3666.204,3676.517,"But there is also a right of appeal to the state courts and in the last analysis after there has been the sifting out, there is the opportunity to go into the Federal Court under 1983."
1975.75-44,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3676.517,3681.974,General -- Mr Attorney General you consider this an adequate remedy
1975.75-44,4,23588,francis_b_burch,,3714.735,3716.255,"Well yes, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1975.75-44,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3717.465,3724.567,I am reading from no less in James B. Bennett whom we all know.
1975.75-44,4,23588,francis_b_burch,,3724.567,3725.284,"Right, Mr. Bennett."
1975.75-44,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3727.035,3729.003,"Well, do you think I said I could?"
1975.75-44,4,23588,francis_b_burch,,3729.003,3730.625,I have no knowledge of the particular that is left.
1975.75-44,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3730.625,3735.493,"Well, it is I the brief of respondents."
1975.75-44,4,23588,francis_b_burch,,3736.34,3738.01,Is this with respect to the McCray case?
1975.75-44,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3738.01,3739.209,It is in there.
1975.75-44,4,23588,francis_b_burch,,3739.209,3741.088,With respect to the McCray case?
1975.75-44,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3741.088,3750.041,"Robert Burrell et all versus Milk McCray et all, number 75-44."
1975.75-44,4,23588,francis_b_burch,,3750.041,3757.903,"Well, I can only say that that certainly his opinion and I am not into position to comment upon that Your Honor."
1975.75-44,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3827.432,3828.065,Thank you Gentlemen.
