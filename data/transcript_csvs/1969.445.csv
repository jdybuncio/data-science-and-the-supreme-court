1969.445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,16.587,"The first case on for argument in Number 445, Standard Industries Incorporated against Tigrett Industries."
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,19.615,24.092,"Thank Your Honor, may it please the Court."
1969.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,307.246,309.192,So what is the position?
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,309.192,312.942,I support the position of the Attorney General Mr. Justice Stewart.
1969.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,312.942,315.738,Well the Attorney General is not a party to this case?
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,315.738,317.572,No but he failed an amicus brief.
1969.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,317.572,319.601,Well how about you?
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,322.015,332.807,I adopt the position taken by the Attorney General in the amicus brief Mr. Justice Stewart and I also wish to address some other remarks in connection with this.
1969.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,391.511,399.706,But do you think the courts are really free to reject the doctrine and the equivalence?
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,399.706,403.019,I think so Mr. Justice Stewart for this reason.
1969.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,403.881,409.634,"Well you might ask Mr. Justice White down there, but -- I'm Mr. Justice White."
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,409.634,411.207,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
1969.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,411.207,411.904,That's all right.
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,419.055,419.882,Yes Mr. Justice White.
1969.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,419.882,424.005,Just a couple years after the decision in this Court on equivalence?
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,424.005,425.868,Yes Mr. Justice White.
1969.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,505.309,509.876,Well it certainly never mentioned at all.
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,514.544,515.686,No Mr. Justice White they didn't.
1969.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,515.686,522.071,They didn't even mention -- they didn't even mention the Graver case and any of the commentary or anything out?
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,522.071,524.222,No they did not.
1969.445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,538.043,553.391,"Well isn't it -- wouldn't be extraordinary if Congress intended to change something as recent as that, that something in the legislative history would not indicate that where addressing themselves to that end?"
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,553.391,564.881,"Well in -- Mr. Justice Burger in Halliburton versus Walker, the Supreme Court specifically rejected claims drawn to means plus a function."
1969.445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,620.455,628.589,"But that issue has never been raised or litigated or even mentioned until an amicus brief in this Court, am I wrong about that?"
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,628.589,630.409,That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1969.445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,630.409,633.595,Thank you.
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,633.595,643.017,The petitioner does submit that the doctrine of equivalence in this case was misapplied.
1969.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,905.917,909.563,Did this come out in the pretrial proceedings?
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,909.563,911.063,No Mr. Justice White because --
1969.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,911.063,915.684,Did the District Court ever say anything about the estoppel doctrine?
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,915.684,925.381,"Yes, yes it's set forth specifically in the appendix Mr. Justice White, perhaps I can find it."
1969.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,925.381,930.571,"We reaffirmed -- he reaffirmed, did he not that it would have done you know good to raise the validity point?"
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,930.571,932.901,"Yes, yes."
1969.445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,970.699,976.215,Why do you find that ruling or holding or colloquy by the district judge?
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,976.215,982.822,Let me see if I can find it in the appendix.
1969.445,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1054.984,1057.452,Did you say 129 of your appendix?
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,1057.452,1064.479,129.3 Mr. Justice Douglas.
1969.445,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1080.172,1085.672,I'm not sure that Justice Black heard your designation.
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,1085.672,1087.186,Pardon me Mr. Justice Douglas.
1969.445,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1087.186,1097.809,I'm sure that Justice Black heard your -- the new name you've given me.
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,1097.809,1100.987,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
1969.445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1100.987,1102.348,Let me take your time.
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,1105.924,1120.45,Thank you.
1969.445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1120.45,1123.648,"Now, it's this center paragraph on 129 A-3 that you were relying?"
1969.445,0,44055,walton_bader,,1123.648,1129.926,Yes Mr. Justice Burger.
1969.445,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1341.127,1356.129,The United States believes that this case does present the Court within an appropriate opportunity to correct a harmful basic incongruity in decisions under the patent law.
1969.445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1439.105,1453.99,Might not -- principles of due process of law perhaps indicate that the case in which to consider your argument is a case in which it's at least been brought up somewhere along the line in the course of a litigation?
1969.445,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1453.99,1467.728,"Well at every stage of this litigation, the petitioner contended that because of the limitation in the claims, his play it could not be considered an infringement."
1969.445,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1475.445,1478.386,That's not your point overall wasn't it?
1969.445,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1478.386,1492.684,But that it really is a different articulation of the question whether or the doctrine of equivalence can appropriately be applied by the Courts to expand patent of appellees beyond the terms of their claims.
1969.445,1,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1499.059,1505.717,Have you -- the Government can mean or come in 2502 United States in this proceeding --
1969.445,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1505.717,1509.111,We did not sir nor did we support the petition.
1969.445,2,44055,walton_bader,,2569.503,2595.505,"Page 118 A of the appendix, may it please the Court, has got two pictures right against that page number and I think that the first picture shows a view looking at the play pen from the front then there are two details of allege mechanisms are figures two and three which are not particularly significant."
1969.445,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2612.152,2614.235,"Thank you, I can see it."
1969.445,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2614.235,2627.695,And as to a nonfunctional aspect such as if the claim specified the color of the base plate for example and a context which this is obviously nonfunctional.
1969.445,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2733.604,2744.417,"Thank you Mr. Wallace, Mr. Kalish."
1969.445,4,39667,ralph_w_kalish,,2744.417,2747.377,May it please the Court.
1969.445,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2851.561,2854.175,This was a furniture manufacturing business?
1969.445,4,39667,ralph_w_kalish,,2854.175,2855.666,Children's furniture Your Honor.
1969.445,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2855.666,2858.2,Children's furniture manufacturing business.
1969.445,4,39667,ralph_w_kalish,,2860.021,2862.107,Seller was a Jackson Tennessee Company.
1969.445,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2862.107,2863.902,But I thought the buyer was subject to the Tennessee.
1969.445,4,39667,ralph_w_kalish,,2863.902,2872.247,What the buyer did with the buyers New York firm is established a subsidy and Jackson Tennessee to take over the operations at this file.
1969.445,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2876.705,2877.529,Of the buyer?
1969.445,4,39667,ralph_w_kalish,,2877.529,2878.485,Yes sir.
1969.445,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2878.485,2880.313,And the seller was also a Jackson Tennessee?
1969.445,4,39667,ralph_w_kalish,,2880.313,2880.8,Yes sir.
1969.445,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2880.8,2883.827,I see.
1969.445,4,39667,ralph_w_kalish,,2883.827,2885.624,So wrapping an environment of a business --
1969.445,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2885.624,2888.872,And then how much inventory for example?
1969.445,4,39667,ralph_w_kalish,,2888.872,2897.842,"I believe Your Honor the contract reports of assets 42 (a) of the appendix call for $105,000.00 down payment in the balance fee and the royalties."
1969.445,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2901.73,2912.36,"And of that quarter million, how much was attributable to the patent or patent applications?"
1969.445,4,39667,ralph_w_kalish,,2912.36,2912.992,This I do not know.
1969.445,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2915.127,2916.108,Wasn't atomized?
1969.445,4,39667,ralph_w_kalish,,2916.108,2916.949,Wasn't atomized.
1969.445,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2916.949,2918.925,What was that page in the appendix by the way?
1969.445,4,39667,ralph_w_kalish,,2918.925,2936.766,54 (a) is the page for the purchaser of assets in your basic agreement between the buyer and the seller and clause 16 (c) relates to the particular patent before this Court's day.
1969.445,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2936.766,2944.093,Is there any evidence in this record that segregates the -- or allocates the purchase price to the various phases that --
1969.445,4,39667,ralph_w_kalish,,2944.093,2964.603,No sir there was no -- I think what happened simply was that the negotiating party for the seller had estimated what their income indemnities various items in which they're granting a license and figure they get the same thing for the next five years.
1969.445,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3041.93,3048.148,"Well of course that is what Lear says that the prior licensee is entitled to do, isn't it?"
1969.445,4,39667,ralph_w_kalish,,3048.148,3052.999,"Yes sir, this -- if Lear relates to a license agreement Your Honor, not an assignment."
1969.445,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3117.935,3130.654,Before you go on with to if I may interrupt to Mr. Kalish at least for me who have distinguished the Lear case rather so swiftly that I'm not sure I followed you.
1969.445,4,39667,ralph_w_kalish,,3130.654,3132.436,Sorry Your Honor certainly.
1969.445,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3167.435,3177.638,Well is that doctrine related to the old common law doctrine tenant to come out challenge to Landlords' title?
1969.445,4,39667,ralph_w_kalish,,3177.638,3180.539,It may 5258 beginnings Your Honor.
1969.445,5,41821,sidney_neuman,,4820.785,4843.527,"-- Of the American Patent Law Association or the opportunity, which has been given to us to brief the questions, which are raised by this assault, which the Government has made upon the equivalence of the rule, which is now at least a 120 years old."
1969.445,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5179.666,5182.819,I think we'll suspend at this time and go for lunch.
1969.445,5,41821,sidney_neuman,,5182.819,5188.719,Thank you sir.
1969.445,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5188.719,5189.483,Continue --
1969.445,5,41821,sidney_neuman,,5189.483,5191.686,May it please the Court.
1969.445,6,44055,walton_bader,,6151.676,6154.882,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.445,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6257.249,6261.468,What was the last page?
1969.445,6,44055,walton_bader,,6261.468,6268.908,"That is the appendix, page 53 A-11."
