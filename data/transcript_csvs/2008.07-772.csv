2008.07-772,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.737,"We'll hear argument first today in Case 07-772, Waddington v. Sarausad."
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,7.954,17.493,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case comes before the Court under the deferential standard of review of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act."
2008.07-772,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,57.935,59.903,But you think it was right?
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,59.903,67.04,"I do think it was right, Your Honor, but I also believe that it was not objectively unreasonable, which is the standard before this Court."
2008.07-772,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,70.86,75.246,"First, is there some constitutional minimum?"
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,85.787,88.072,"--I believe there is, Your Honor."
2008.07-772,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,88.072,88.789,What is it?
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,88.789,98.512,"You have to have knowledge that you're facilitating -- you have to act and you have to have knowledge, both those two points."
2008.07-772,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,98.512,101.63,Is that the same -- is that the same as purpose?
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,101.63,103.331,"I think it is, Your Honor."
2008.07-772,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,109.985,116.723,"Well, but you don't take the position, do you, or do you, that Washington law conforms to the Model Penal Code?"
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,122.043,123.995,"--I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-772,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,123.995,140.839,So you're -- would -- would you say that the trial court in Washington states law correctly if it says that being accomplice you have to have a purpose to facilitate the commission of the crime?
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,140.839,147.46,"I believe that you would have to have -- you have to knowingly facilitate the crime, Your Honor."
2008.07-772,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,148.36,152.062,"But you agree there is a difference in ""knowing"" and ""purpose""?"
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,152.062,153.931,"--I'm not sure there is much of a difference, Your Honor."
2008.07-772,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,164.739,167.456,But the question is knowledge of what.
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,186.485,187.535,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,192.889,194.841,Why just a homicide?
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,200.329,202.429,"First degree -- a number of counts, Your Honor."
2008.07-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,215.522,225.044,"Why wouldn't assault with a deadly weapon suffice or, alternatively, why would you have to know that it was first degree murder or second degree murder?"
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,234.8,242.287,"--Because the statute refers to ""the crime"", so you have to have knowledge that you're facilitating a homicide, but you don't have to have shared--"
2008.07-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,242.287,247.858,But -- but he wasn't prosecuted for homicide.
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,250.393,250.993,--Well--
2008.07-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,250.993,253.095,"--first degree murder, second degree murder."
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,253.095,263.8,"--In Washington, you have to have knowledge of the general crime that is homicide, but you don't have to have the same knowledge as to principle; therefore, you don't have to have knowledge of premediation."
2008.07-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,268.687,271.073,How does that appear from the statute?
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,280.329,286.249,You could be convicted of manslaughter as an accomplice if you had knowledge of a homicide.
2008.07-772,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,350.258,364.566,"This is -- the prosecutor's charge -- the prosecutor's charge was just filled with the suggestion that as long as it was a crime, that was sufficient."
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,372.255,373.439,Your Honor--
2008.07-772,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,373.439,377.242,--of the prosecutor's summation.
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,377.242,384.479,"--Your Honor, the prosecutor continually talked about the fact that they were going there for a shooting."
2008.07-772,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,406.226,410.011,"Yes, but isn't the problem on your side of the case that there was another"
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,448.136,449.422,"I disagree, Your Honor."
2008.07-772,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,468.466,469.799,"Sure, in that case."
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,473.37,473.803,--I'm sorry.
2008.07-772,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,477.005,479.941,I did -- maybe I dreamed this.
2008.07-772,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,515.447,517.816,It's toward the bottom of page 123.
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,529.29,533.826,"The court, the PRP Court of Appeals said that that hypothetical is problematic."
2008.07-772,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,533.826,550.287,"What about the instruction that follows the hypothetical, first the statement that the person gets assaulted, gets killed, in for a dime, in for a dollar?"
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,580.972,586.376,"Justice Ginsburg, the hypothetical may be problematic, but you have to consider--"
2008.07-772,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,586.376,596.066,"But what about the statement I just read, that the law of the State is you don't even have to be there if you're helping in some fashion."
2008.07-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,596.066,597.316,Where is that?
2008.07-772,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,600.018,600.318,Yes.
2008.07-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.707,608.507,It's not in the court's charges.
2008.07-772,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,608.507,609.492,--No.
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,610.959,623.85,"--Justice Ginsburg, the prosecutor's argument responds to the argument made by Sarausad's counsel that you had to have shared intent, that Mr. Sarausad had to have the same intent as the principal."
2008.07-772,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,645.346,649.834,"Well, if you take the argument as a whole you've got at best an ambiguous argument."
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,670.997,675.965,"Well, of course, Your Honor, in this case my argument doesn't have to turn on that."
2008.07-772,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,691.161,701.35,"Maybe I'm beating a dead horse, but it seems to me that what we've brought in our questions from the bench is that that is not correct."
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,714.09,721.846,"--Your Honor, I believe the prosecutor always tied it to shooting, and moreover that's the way the defense counsel argued the case."
2008.07-772,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,721.846,723.146,Can you help me with this?
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,765.959,774.648,"Well, Your Honor, Brown v. Payton, which involved the Factor K in how you consider mitigating evidence in the--"
2008.07-772,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,774.648,779.719,"In Brown, in that case did they find that he did get them too mixed up or he didn't?"
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,779.719,781.702,--He didn't get them too mixed up so.
2008.07-772,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,781.702,782.135,He did not.
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,791.526,792.026,Exactly.
2008.07-772,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,792.409,794.292,What about the appellate court?
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,801.382,802.082,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2008.07-772,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,802.082,827.116,"Because the appellate court the first time got it wrong and it thought it was enough that the defendant knew that a crime was likely to be committed, not the crime, crime specified in the indictment, not -- not murder one, attempted murder, et cetera, just a crime."
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,855.6,858.802,"--Your Honor, the intermediate appellate court did get it wrong the first time around."
2008.07-772,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,872.707,875.559,"They say, the court itself said: We got it wrong."
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,885.248,889.2,"--Your Honor, I think you have to consider the context of the case."
2008.07-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.088,931.027,Did -- hadn't other Washington State courts made a similar error in their interpretation of the Washington statutes?
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,931.027,935.348,"A few, a few court of appeals decisions did misstate the standard, Justice Scalia, that's correct."
2008.07-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,935.348,944.636,And the same -- and hadn't the prosecutors in Washington in misstating the standard the same way and using
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,955.677,958.213,"Some prosecutors made that argument, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,958.213,960.646,Including this one in an earlier case.
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,960.646,961.248,That's right.
2008.07-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,976.008,986.213,"The only reason I raise it is, is to show that this jury was obviously perplexed on the point."
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1023.988,1029.142,"Justice Scalia, with respect, I disagree that the same question was asked three times."
2008.07-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1040.598,1042.45,Let's look at -- where is that?
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1042.45,1047.704,That would be at JA 131 and 132.
2008.07-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1047.704,1050.723,In the white?
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1050.723,1051.473,I'm sorry.
2008.07-772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1081.908,1082.325,Excuse me.
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1087.729,1090.262,The trial court directed the--
2008.07-772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1090.262,1096.501,That's a question specifically applied to the defendant only for the defendant or his accomplice.
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1096.501,1103.988,"--They asked about ""accomplice"", but the -- this was not a question about the meaning of ""accomplice liability""."
2008.07-772,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1106.69,1111.427,"It doesn't -- your point is that it doesn't go to the ""aiding"" issue."
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1111.427,1112.511,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2008.07-772,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1112.511,1114.044,"Well, excuse me."
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1120.95,1123.569,This question really goes to if you look--
2008.07-772,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1123.569,1126.021,What's the answer to my question?
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1137.676,1140.661,"--Your Honor -- it is an intent question, Your Honor."
2008.07-772,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1178.25,1179.452,Maybe so.
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1199.164,1200.883,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-772,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1200.883,1205.335,How could the jury better express its puzzlement?
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1223.379,1228.966,"And that, Justice Ginsburg -- and that's the first time that the jury asked that question."
2008.07-772,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1236.02,1243.543,"And the -- the counsel for the defense says, tell them no."
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1243.543,1245.043,"--And that would have been wrong, Your Honor."
2008.07-772,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1262.469,1264.171,"It says ""a group activity""."
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1276.728,1281.132,"--With respect, Your Honor, I think you have to know what the group activity is."
2008.07-772,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1286.87,1288.636,They didn't get an answer.
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1295.457,1302.463,"--Your Honor, I think in the Weeks case this Court has held that it's proper to tell a jury to reread instructions."
2008.07-772,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1303.78,1314.103,"But we already know that many people, prosecutors, justices, misunderstood this ""a crime""."
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1337.117,1347.408,"Your Honor, we are not arguing that there couldn't be some ambiguity, but what we are saying is that the adjudication by the PRP court was not objectively unreasonable."
2008.07-772,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1357.78,1364.453,"Well, isn't -- isn't the argument for objective unreasonableness, number one, to begin with, what you just stated."
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1439.168,1440.251,"I would say no, Your Honor."
2008.07-772,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1440.251,1441.87,Then -- then what would it take?
2008.07-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1441.87,1446.155,"You -- you know, you are taking on more of a burden than you have to."
2008.07-772,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1446.155,1452.326,"And you could say, yes, it would be reasonable to say that, but it would also be reasonable to say -- to say otherwise, right?"
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1452.326,1454.161,It's not objectively unreasonable.
2008.07-772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1454.161,1457.563,It's not objectively unreasonable to say the opposite.
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1457.563,1458.415,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2008.07-772,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1458.415,1468.788,"The -- the ""opposite"" in this case would mean that the jury was properly instructed and was in a position adequately to understand Washington law correctly?"
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1470.572,1471.905,There is no question that in a number of--
2008.07-772,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1471.905,1473.091,I want to know what you mean.
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1475.174,1478.559,"--I mean the ""opposite position"" is it's possible that if you are--"
2008.07-772,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1478.559,1483.53,Would you -- you are saying you want -- why don't you answer my question?
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1499.742,1501.592,"--And I would say I think that's correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-772,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1501.592,1505.027,"But even, again, I think you are taking on too high a burden."
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1525.707,1527.226,"That's exactly right, Chief Justice Roberts."
2008.07-772,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1527.226,1548.806,"And that way would be the way we just set out, wasn't it: That the jury, if -- if -- if, in fact, it's objectively reasonable to conclude that the jury did understand Washington law correctly on those circumstances, then -- then the -- the Respondent here cannot win in -- in his collateral attack?"
2008.07-772,0,44202,william_b_collins,,1548.806,1552.758,We would say he cannot win because the decision of the Washington court was not objectively unreasonable.
2008.07-772,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1554.96,1556.826,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1565.316,1572.069,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State is here today making what we think is a rather extraordinary argument."
2008.07-772,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1591.447,1592.816,Well -- but is that the standard?
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1607.493,1608.193,"That's right, Your Honor."
2008.07-772,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1624.335,1643.166,"When I read the opinion of the Washington Court of Appeals, it does not seem to me that what they are doing is providing a literal interpretation of the jury instruction, as I think we have to presume the jury did when they got that instruction."
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1678.755,1688.027,"Well, Justice Alito, we think it is fair to say that, because in the Washington Court of Appeals decision, they start by laying out the statutory language of Washington accomplice liability."
2008.07-772,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1707.488,1722.914,"The gloss that the Washington Supreme Court ended up with was exactly the same as the instruction that was, that the judge gave in this case -- to be as a -- the trial judge, whatever the state of the law was, got it right."
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1722.914,1727.835,Got it right insofar as regurgitated the language of the statute.
2008.07-772,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1740.425,1742.927,That's exactly what the instruction said.
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1792.01,1796.046,"--The problem, Your Honor, is it starts with this Court recognized him void."
2008.07-772,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1800.014,1800.966,That's a different argument.
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1855.835,1858.703,"Let me take your question in two steps, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-772,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1858.703,1860.738,All my questions from the whole case.
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1860.738,1861.888,Thank you.
2008.07-772,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1867.575,1867.958,No.
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1878.466,1878.95,--Right.
2008.07-772,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1878.95,1883.187,"--more mixed up than they did in Brown, where I thought it was pretty bad."
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1883.187,1883.52,That's right.
2008.07-772,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1922.679,1923.579,In my -- it it doesn't mean either.
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1952.931,1973.761,"--Well, maybe the best that I can do, Justice Breyer, is refer you to empirical evidence from the State itself, from the State of Washington, and if you need one further thing to look at, I commend to you the Supreme Court decision of the Supreme Court of Colorado that cited in the actual brief -- there was language exactly like this that comes to a textual analysis and comes to the conclusion."
2008.07-772,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1973.761,1977.297,You're convincing me that different people can reach different conclusions.
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1991.187,1997.174,"Because the articles ""a"" and ""the"" are simply not definite enough."
2008.07-772,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2002.843,2010.065,"You might be able to and you might -- as I understood you to say earlier, you could read it one way or you could say it another way."
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2016.636,2019.671,"I think if that's all we had, Mr. Chief Justice, you would be exactly right."
2008.07-772,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2020.387,2029.36,So it is not objectively unreasonable for the State to instruct jurors as they did?
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2031.979,2032.295,--Right.
2008.07-772,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2078.876,2080.093,Was there an objection?
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2080.093,2083.677,There were objections both before and after.
2008.07-772,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2083.677,2099.187,"The objection was based on the defense proffer of an instruction which was, namely, close to the model penal code that says you have to have the same -- is anterior principle, and that's not necessarily the law in every state."
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2107.627,2114.133,"There were times where Mr. Sarausad's counsel, you're right, did ask for a little more than he was entitled to."
2008.07-772,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2142.033,2146.687,I don't think that your reading of question three is definitive.
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2165.232,2168.268,"Well, we think it's pretty clear, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-772,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2185.979,2186.745,That's not the question.
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2220.382,2234.726,"--Well, I think the best we can do, because we have to make reasonable inferences from the record and he we can't go back and ask the jurors what we thought, is we have to make, as the court has done many times, reasonable inferences as to what they are doing."
2008.07-772,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2244.082,2254.89,"So, then, what I take is authoritative on that are two sentences from the Washington Supreme Court opinion, though people -- other judges have been all over the lot."
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2348.982,2359.938,"Your Honor, we are not challenging -- or this Court does not have authorities the sufficiency of the evidence in this case, so there might be enough evidence in the record for the jury to have found that."
2008.07-772,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2406.948,2409.984,No objection from defense counsel.
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2409.984,2412.686,"Both before and after, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-772,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2423.808,2439.586,"Could I ask you this question about the jury's question where they say we are having difficulty agreeing on a legal definition and concept of accomplice; when a person willingly participates in a group activity, is that person an accomplice to any crime committed by anyone in the group?"
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2461.333,2464.885,"I don't think so, Justice Alito That would have cleared up the ambiguity in the case--"
2008.07-772,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2464.885,2469.153,That's almost a direct quote from the instruction that was given.
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2469.153,2474.557,"--No, it's not because what you did is you inserted the name of the crime in there."
2008.07-772,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2474.557,2477.843,I put in crime of second degree murder rather than the crime.
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2477.843,2482.746,That's exactly what defendants even still in the State of Washington are asking courts to do in the--
2008.07-772,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2482.746,2496.47,"That poses a difference enough to make A, a constitutional violation and B, make it unreasonable for the Washington Court of Appeals to say that there was no constitutional violation?"
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2496.47,2502.172,"--Yes, under the particular circumstances in this case, because the jury expressed confusion."
2008.07-772,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2526.172,2546.3,"The prosecutor, I mean I thought, though I'm not -- this really is ambiguous, I think, but if you do hold somebody's arms behind his back and punch him in the stomach, that does perhaps -- at least might run -- I can see a person saying that that runs a substantial risk of death."
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2555.989,2556.739,"--I'm sorry, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-772,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2561.226,2566.012,"They intentionally hit somebody in the stomach, you say, knowing all about--"
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2566.012,2567.796,--Intentionally killing is what the State says.
2008.07-772,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2567.796,2570.498,--I realize that but what the State supreme court holds.
2008.07-772,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2593.162,2608.505,"And your answer to Justice Breyer incorporated the -- the principle that the defense counsel had been arguing for from the outset of this case, that you must have the same scienter as the principal, and that's not necessarily the law."
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2608.505,2609.055,I think that--
2008.07-772,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2609.055,2613.374,It can go on in some States but not -- it doesn't have to be the law as I understand it.
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2613.374,2617.943,"--The defendant didn't have to have premedication, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-772,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2674.696,2694.242,"Washington -- in the State of Washington you think the law is that if Joe Jones helps Dead Eye Dick shoot his gun right at somebody's leg and then accidental -- then, you know, he doesn't aim quite right, the guy dies; then it's a good defense to say well, I knew he was Dead Eye Dick."
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2704.299,2705.049,--That's right.
2008.07-772,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2705.549,2708.917,What's the difference between that and punching him in the stomach?
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2708.917,2716.79,--Because when somebody is punched in the stomach there is no reasonable belief that the person is going to be put in grave risk of death.
2008.07-772,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2756.915,2765.187,"With the jury -- was the jury told that the arguments of counsel are not the law, that I, the judge, will tell you what the law is?"
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2765.187,2767.853,I think a standard statement to that effect was made.
2008.07-772,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2925.139,2932.709,"But the only difference between that case, which I know very well, and this case is that in that case there was no issue about jury instructions."
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2932.709,2934.245,"Well, not directly."
2008.07-772,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2934.245,2936.095,So what's the relevance of it?
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2936.095,2936.445,Right.
2008.07-772,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2937.28,2951.087,"Has to do with the retroactivity whether a State can -- whether Pennsylvania had changed the interpretation of its statute, or whether what they said it meant was what it always had meant."
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2951.087,2953.806,"--That's right, Justice Alito and I know that you know that case."
2008.07-772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3009.255,3010.89,"Mr. Fisher, can I just ask you a question?"
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3020.328,3021.995,There's two ways to think about it.
2008.07-772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3030.315,3033.934,Assume proof of the gun in the car was enough to prove--
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3033.934,3035.803,That's the way the case was presented to the jury.
2008.07-772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3035.803,3042.79,--It wouldn't -- and that's what presumably may have taken a lot of time deliberating whether or not he knew there was a gun.
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3042.79,3044.423,"That's right, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3045.974,3047.943,And in one theory it makes a difference; in another theory it doesn't.
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3047.943,3048.443,--Precisely.
2008.07-772,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3073.225,3080.063,"Counsel, AEDPA of course requires that this be an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law."
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3084.616,3097.59,"It's the rule that is stated -- again, at page 32 of the State's brief with which we agree -- that if there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied instructions so as to violate the Constitution, then that violates due process."
2008.07-772,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3097.59,3100.709,So that's articulated at a fairly general level.
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3100.709,3101.911,That's right.
2008.07-772,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3101.911,3110.85,"In Yarborough, we've said that the more general the rule, the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in a case-by-case determination."
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3150.875,3163.901,"The State would have a better argument if nothing else had happened in this trial other than simply the jury had been given that instruction, but our point is, and then this Court recognizes as much, I think, in Brown against Payton, that the prosecutor's arguments do matter."
2008.07-772,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3281.46,3284.561,You've already said that the instruction doesn't get you there.
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3308.176,3311.628,"Well, we have all three, but I don't want to give away too much."
2008.07-772,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3339.445,3341.247,This argument -- I'm beginning to get your argument.
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3368.68,3370.28,"--That's a fair characterization, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-772,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3380.302,3381.819,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-772,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3381.819,3385.123,Thank you very much.
2008.07-772,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3385.123,3387.873,"Mr. Collins, you have four minutes."
2008.07-772,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3387.873,3389.392,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-772,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3483.148,3485.783,They didn't say anything at all about Mr. Reyes.
2008.07-772,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3490.718,3496.055,"--Exactly right, Justice Ginsburg, but Mr. Sarausad assumes that that's a question about him."
2008.07-772,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3499.859,3524.475,"But what he's saying, I think now, is if there was no gun in the car -- suppose the jury thinks there's no gun in the car, then he didn't even know there was going to be a shooting, but that the prosecutor in the context of the trial had given the jury the impression that they could convict this person even if the person did not know there was going to be a drive-by shooting."
2008.07-772,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3548.44,3552.376,"My response, Your Honor, is you will not find that when you look through the record."
2008.07-772,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3608.309,3609.825,"Thank you, counsel."
