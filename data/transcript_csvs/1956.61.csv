1956.61,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.753,"Number 61, David S. Alberts, Appellant, versus the State of California."
1956.61,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,10.261,12.13,"Ready for the appellant, Your Honor."
1956.61,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,12.13,30.506,You may proceed.
1956.61,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,30.506,33.919,If the Court please.
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,1576.636,1581.252,Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices.
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1829.644,1830.914,Would you mind stating --
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,1830.914,1831.601,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1831.601,1838.633,"-- what construction, the highest court, as far as this has gone in your State have given to the statute?"
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,1838.633,1841.913,"None other than by dictum in the Wepplo case, if Your Honor please, and that is correctly --"
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1841.913,1845.99,I mean it's never been before an appellant try to do them in your -- in California?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,1845.99,1848.592,"Not on the definition of the word obscene, Your Honor, no."
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1853.295,1855.353,Where did the statute appear on your statutory?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,1855.353,1856.644,"1870, I believe."
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1857.37,1860.023,So they're not before an appellate court?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,1860.023,1862.192,"On the question, Your Honor, of definition, no."
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1862.192,1866.53,"By -- well, didn't they have to -- what were the appeals about?"
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,1866.53,1870.425,"Well, the -- the Wepplo appeal as this matter of the word ""lewdly."""
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1881.06,1890.567,"I'll have to read that opinion but I suppose if the conviction is brought up to an appellate court and the appellate court sustains the conviction, it must have said something about what the statute covered."
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,1890.567,1891.536,"Well, in -- in Wepplo --"
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1891.536,1891.888,Or maybe not -- maybe not --
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,1891.888,1893.049,-- they did make that statement.
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1903.824,1905.399,I found it on the very first page.
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,1914.064,1917.687,"Your Honor, there's a definition there but it was -- by way of dictum."
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1917.687,1918.602,Why was it dictum?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,1918.602,1928.08,"Because they reversed the case for lack of admission of evidence that the defendant was not acting lewdly and there was not an attack on the question of -- of the definition of the word ""obscenity"" in any sense."
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1935.172,1948.89,"Well, it does -- it said something in the second paragraph, which is from my point of view, very important since Section 311 Penal Code condemned the sale of a book rather than a part of a book."
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,1954.852,1955.275,"Yes, I think that's --"
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1955.275,1965.228,"In that sentence, it already reached it one of the most important aspects of this problem and the source of all mischief due to (Inaudible) definition --"
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,1965.228,1965.581,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1965.622,1966.882,-- because they have no definition.
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,1970.465,1975.852,"Yes, I think we're all agreed that these works must be construed on a whole, Your Honor, and not on an isolated passage, yes."
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1975.852,1979.678,"Maybe agreed on the fact but its significance becomes relevant, doesn't it?"
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,1979.678,1981.949,"Yes, it does, Your Honor."
1956.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2102.629,2107.169,You're talking about either one of the exhibits or either one of the books.
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2107.169,2107.612,Anyone.
1956.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2108.691,2110.133,Anyone of the books?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2110.133,2111.0,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2111.0,2111.382,As a whole?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2111.382,2112.775,There are also pictures --
1956.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2112.775,2112.855,The --
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2112.855,2114.014,-- as it's mentioned in the brief.
1956.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2114.014,2115.962,I -- I didn't quite understand what you meant.
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2122.328,2123.529,"Considered on the whole, yes."
1956.61,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2134.643,2135.994,We have to read them all then.
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2135.994,2136.559,"No, Your Honor."
1956.61,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2170.35,2171.822,What conclusion is that?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2172.125,2176.231,"The prosecutor who, of course, points out wherein he thinks his evidence sustained in this case, Your Honor."
1956.61,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2176.231,2181.992,"And the trouble with all that is that for all it appears in this record, the Court may have disagreed with you."
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2181.992,2194.025,"Well, if Your Honor please, I think with the presumption of regularity, which always prevails on appeal that we would have to presume that the Court found whatever this Court finds to be obscene to have been obscene."
1956.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2195.368,2199.444,"That would be a pretty broad presumption, wouldn't it, in connection with the (Inaudible) case?"
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2199.444,2203.409,"Well, would -- would -- surely, Your Honor, it wouldn't feel that we should presume the Court made a mistake."
1956.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2203.409,2212.243,"No, but I understood you to say that the Court should be presume to find any part of this obscene that we should lay this and find it obscene."
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2212.243,2213.373,"Very definitely, Your Honor."
1956.61,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2216.409,2219.527,"Well, you got to have something that approaches a decision."
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2219.527,2220.082,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2250.919,2255.339,Would each one of these -- would each one of these items offered in evidence?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2255.339,2256.267,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2256.267,2256.944,Separately?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2256.944,2258.124,"No, they are grouped."
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2265.327,2269.202,And as the offer was made whether objection for each separate offers?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2269.202,2279.271,"No, there were -- the only objection was to one letter which is Exhibit 17 and that was admitted for a limited purpose only, and bear in mind there was no jury."
1956.61,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2282.751,2286.001,You have nine copies of all these books here or just one?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2286.001,2286.626,"No, Your Honor."
1956.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2293.667,2295.867,How many pages are there in the aggregate?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2295.867,2296.62,"I beg, Your Honor, pardon?"
1956.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2296.62,2300.031,How many pages are there in the aggregate that we have to look at?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2300.031,2301.796,"Well, I -- I might suggest this, Your Honor."
1956.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2306.517,2306.729,(Voice Overlap) --
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2306.729,2308.576,-- but on the -- the version of -- of considering --
1956.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2308.576,2308.626,(Voice Overlap)
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2313.941,2316.332,"Under the appraisal on the whole, well, that's all one can do."
1956.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2318.489,2319.962,"Well, I don't know if I understand it."
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2326.077,2326.894,"Well, of course, they -- they vary in pages."
1956.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2326.894,2328.77,How many pages are there in a whole?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2328.77,2332.493,"Maybe a couple of hundred in some instances, something like that."
1956.61,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2332.493,2336.71,Sometimes we'd had to see a whole movie.
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2336.71,2338.071,"Yes, I -- I can understand that."
1956.61,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2346.606,2349.099,"You only object to Exhibit 5, don't you?"
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2349.099,2350.773,"Oh, no, Your Honor, no indeed."
1956.61,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2356.586,2360.996,"Let's say, you object to only the ones in -- within Exhibit 5."
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2360.996,2361.43,"No, Your Honor."
1956.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2367.03,2367.03,What's the distinction between moderately and very obscene?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2369.905,2370.136,[Laughter]
1956.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2421.403,2422.371,How do we find (Voice Overlap) --
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2422.371,2424.227,Exactly.
1956.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2445.413,2447.632,"Well, does this tell me now the answer to my question?"
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2447.632,2448.368,I beg your pardon.
1956.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2448.851,2450.516,Does that answer my question or was it --
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2450.516,2450.557,I thought it did.
1956.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2450.557,2451.121,-- or is it --
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2451.121,2451.928,I maybe wrong.
1956.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2451.928,2453.351,All right.
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2454.471,2456.58,I'm very sorry if I did.
1956.61,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2492.557,2493.657,Where are you reading from?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2493.657,2503.718,"I -- I am reading at the moment from page 87 of the transcript of the record which is a summary by the trial court of Exhibit 3, if Your Honor please."
1956.61,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2503.718,2503.718,"Here's -- here's a line that apparently somebody thought was obscenely, ""leave the light on is just more cozy."""
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2510.67,2512.546,"I think that would be debatable, Your Honor, in that case."
1956.61,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2512.546,2516.238,That's in the prosecution's summary to the -- the case.
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2516.238,2525.155,"Another reads, note, we make every possible effort to prevent these books from reaching young people or persons who had used them for fulfillment of indecent desires."
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2558.088,2558.713,May I --
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2558.713,2558.752,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2558.752,2564.716,"As we move back, I read something that you make any endeavor not to reach beyond what --"
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2564.716,2566.461,"Yes, that part of the advertising, if Your Honor please."
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2566.461,2566.914,Is it?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2566.914,2570.738,"Yes, included with these other sentences and construed on the whole."
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2571.162,2571.626,"Well, I'll just read it."
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2571.626,2572.958,-- an attempt to be inviting.
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2572.958,2574.048,"Just read that, would you?"
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2574.048,2582.559,"Yes, Your Honor, ""No, we make every possible effort to prevent these books from reaching young people or persons who would use them for the fulfillment of indecent desire."""
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2582.559,2584.142,"Now, where -- where do you read this from?"
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2587.361,2594.343,That is -- that is a -- an advertising letter that the Court is referring to which I think is a part of peoples Exhibit 3 --
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2594.343,2594.705,And to whom was --
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2594.705,2595.704,-- and it's certainly an evidence.
1956.61,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2595.704,2598.177,-- to whom was the advertisement sent?
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2598.177,2604.604,"The -- the mailing list picked out were -- were simply names and addresses all over the country, if Your Honor please."

1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2612.635,2620.862,"I -- nothing said as to the age, if Your Honor please, on the mailing list and -- and what that effort is, of course, I don't think it existed."
1956.61,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2626.882,2628.668,You had to be -- you had to be savant.
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2628.668,2629.354,I beg your pardon?
1956.61,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2629.354,2631.261,You had to be savant to get a common question.
1956.61,1,24801,fred_n_whichello,,2631.261,2632.553,"Yes, exactly."
1956.61,2,19475,clarence_a_linn,,2790.518,2793.615,Thank you.
1956.61,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3152.188,3161.392,"Do I -- am I right in thinking that you read from -- an opinion of mine, which could not commend itself to the Court?"
1956.61,2,19475,clarence_a_linn,,3161.392,3165.984,I -- I don't think that that language did not commend itself to the Court.
1956.61,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3177.679,3180.635,Do you think I could cooperate occasionally to make him adjust?
