1982.81-2337,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.212,We will hear arguments first this morning in Secretary Block against the State of North Dakota.
1982.81-2337,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,11.836,15.291,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.81-2337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,205.883,210.617,"How could they have made such a claim, Mr. Claiborne, before the enactment of the Quiet Title Act?"
1982.81-2337,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,210.617,228.952,"I am saying they never asserted ownership, Justice Rehnquist, by leasing or by granting patents with respect to portions of the bed, or easements, or taking any other action which indicates their assertion of dominion with respect to that bed."
1982.81-2337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,315.977,320.352,"Mr. Claiborne, you said the State should have been aware of the federal claim at that time."
1982.81-2337,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,333.081,343.141,"--According to the State's argument, it could have filed suit, regardless of the Quiet Title Act."
1982.81-2337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,345.672,347.106,"Well, under your view, what could it have done?"
1982.81-2337,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,347.106,349.232,--But the State could have granted leases.
1982.81-2337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,357.37,360.493,I suppose it could have dispossessed the United States' lessees.
1982.81-2337,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,360.493,361.57,--Indeed.
1982.81-2337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,374.895,382.889,My own experience in private practice was that invitations to the United States to file a suit to Quiet Title were not often accepted.
1982.81-2337,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,383.638,405.475,"Justice Rehnquist, our record in this respect may be uneven, but my impression is that the United States has been rather receptive to overcoming the power of sovereign immunity by itself instituting an action to determine judicially a disputed land claim with states."
1982.81-2337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,581.714,583.121,"When was that enacted, Mr. Claiborne?"
1982.81-2337,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,583.121,585.059,"In 1972, Your Honor."
1982.81-2337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,585.059,598.442,"What would be the effect as of the date the thing came into effect in 1972 of a claim, say, by a state or by anybody else against the government, which had, say, accrued in 1952?"
1982.81-2337,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,598.442,611.33,Such a claim would be barred because while as originally proposed there was a grandfather clause allowing stale claims to be filed within a short period.
1982.81-2337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,870.956,877.549,What if Congress had enacted no Quiet Title Act here that authorized suit at all?
1982.81-2337,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,885.699,905.162,"We say, Justice Rehnquist, first that so far as that claim was alleged against the United States... and, of course, I put aside such a claim against private individuals as to which there is no bar... the sovereign immunity of the United States would have prevented the bringing of such an action."
1982.81-2337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,927.341,937.727,"So, there might have been an eminent domain type of... Jacobs type of cause of action before 1972, but not afterwards, or Congress would have specified the procedure?"
1982.81-2337,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,937.727,940.179,I think that is so.
1982.81-2337,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1279.589,1284.807,Mr. Attorney General.
1982.81-2337,1,40691,robert_o_wefald,,1284.807,1287.353,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-2337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1361.038,1364.275,Is there any issue of navigability before us?
1982.81-2337,1,40691,robert_o_wefald,,1364.275,1368.193,Only insofar as it relates to the threshold question--
1982.81-2337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1368.193,1371.13,Well how does it relate... what is the threshold question?
1982.81-2337,1,40691,robert_o_wefald,,1371.13,1374.534,--The threshold question is navigability and sovereignty.
1982.81-2337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1376.284,1376.893,How?
1982.81-2337,1,40691,robert_o_wefald,,1376.893,1377.876,Because--
1982.81-2337,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1377.876,1379.751,Does the government challenge that--
1982.81-2337,1,40691,robert_o_wefald,,1379.751,1380.703,--Navigability?
1982.81-2337,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1380.703,1381.783,--Yes.
1982.81-2337,1,40691,robert_o_wefald,,1381.783,1387.683,"They assert that the river is not navigable, but they have offered no evidence whatsoever with respect to non-navigability."
1982.81-2337,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1394.87,1397.822,"Wholly to challenge it without any evidence, isn't it?"
1982.81-2337,1,40691,robert_o_wefald,,1397.822,1398.914,--That is correct.
1982.81-2337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1431.12,1442.288,"You mean you have to decide whether a stream is, in fact, navigable before you can decide whether the statute of limitations runs against the state?"
1982.81-2337,1,40691,robert_o_wefald,,1442.288,1443.758,Indeed.
1982.81-2337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1471.433,1475.102,The Court of Appeals affirmed the finding as to navigability.
1982.81-2337,1,40691,robert_o_wefald,,1475.102,1475.57,That is correct.
1982.81-2337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1475.57,1477.82,And the government has not challenged that?
1982.81-2337,1,40691,robert_o_wefald,,1477.82,1478.772,That is correct.
1982.81-2337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1478.772,1483.022,"So, I would think you would be safe in assuming that we would all assume it was navigable."
1982.81-2337,1,40691,robert_o_wefald,,1483.022,1483.974,I would hope so.
1982.81-2337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1487.019,1487.628,May I ask a question--
1982.81-2337,1,40691,robert_o_wefald,,1487.628,1488.427,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-2337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1488.427,1501.513,"--May I ask this question if this is what in effect you are arguing that if the State had acquired title not through its sovereign status and the navigability of the river and so forth, but rather by purchase from a private person and so forth, would you concede the statute of limitations would bar the claim then?"
1982.81-2337,1,40691,robert_o_wefald,,1501.513,1508.791,We would have a much more difficult argument with respect to that because our claim would not be under sovereignty... retained sovereignty--
1982.81-2337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1508.791,1509.215,I see.
1982.81-2337,1,40691,robert_o_wefald,,1514.698,1515.197,--That is correct.
1982.81-2337,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2405.894,2408.113,"Mr. Chief Justice, briefly."
