1977.77-142,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.782,We will hear arguments next in United States v. Culbert.
1977.77-142,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,14.657,17.807,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.77-142,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,67.795,71.361,You say there is no dispute except that the Court did not seem to follow that?
1977.77-142,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,71.361,73.84,"Well, there is no dispute that it falls within that language."
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1539.839,1543.073,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.77-142,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1662.177,1668.365,"When you say it was aimed at racketeering Mr. Hewitt, what do you mean by “racketeering”?"
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1668.365,1689.903,"I think the working definition adopted by the committee pretty well expresses what “racketeering” meant in the 30s and I suppose what it means to most people at the present time, an organized criminal conspiracy, perhaps an ongoing criminal conspiracy not certainly an isolated event."
1977.77-142,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1689.903,1694.115,Do you think anyone could be punished under this statute then?
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1694.115,1695.401,As the statute is presently written?
1977.77-142,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1695.401,1696.771,Yes.
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1696.771,1704.024,I think an isolated robbery of a corner liquor store is a violation of the Hobbs Act if we give it the interpretation as by the Government.
1977.77-142,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1709.106,1713.096,"But you are saying neither of those can be punished under the statute, are you not?"
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1714.984,1715.887,Yes.
1977.77-142,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1715.887,1724.924,"Well, what I am asking you is if you take Yokley as the law and the decision of the Ninth Circuit, in this case as the law."
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1736.814,1750.433,"Yes, I think that they could be indicted and prosecuted and convicted if they were found to be engaged in “racketeering” and I see no reason why the definition could not be the definition offered by the Copeland Committee as the working definition."
1977.77-142,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1750.433,1752.194,Even though it does not appear in the statute?
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1752.194,1753.949,Even though it does not appear in the statute.
1977.77-142,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1770.24,1780.727,"Mr. Hewitt, what is in the statute that where a criminal has to go to the legislative history?"
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1780.727,1781.273,Well...
1977.77-142,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1781.273,1783.804,What hold that phrase?
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1783.804,1788.985,I think it is the obvious breadth of the statute.
1977.77-142,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1788.985,1790.566,The in terrorem effect?
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1790.566,1791.606,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.77-142,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1792.279,1794.032,Are we allowed to do that?
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1794.032,1800.852,"I think the Court must, because — I think what’s happened is that the evolution of the interstate commerce."
1977.77-142,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1800.852,1802.921,"Well, you say this is unconstitutional?"
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1802.921,1804.074,"No, I am not saying that, Your Honor."
1977.77-142,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1804.074,1806.684,"Well, then why do we have to do this?"
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1806.684,1815.995,Because I think it is the duty upon this Court to make sure that there is no unwarranted intrusion or incursion into traditional state police power matters.
1977.77-142,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1816.973,1820.489,Where do we find that limitation?
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1820.489,1823.518,This Court made the suggestion in a number of cases —
1977.77-142,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1823.518,1827.383,"Where do we find it, in the Constitution somewhere?"
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1827.383,1832.121,"Just the Tenth Amendment, reserving the powers to the states, will certainly be a constitutional."
1977.77-142,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1832.121,1837.503,And you think the protection of National Banks was reserved exclusively to the States then?
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1837.503,1841.847,"Well, no Your Honor, National Banks is a different problem here."
1977.77-142,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1841.847,1843.665,Is it not what we have got here?
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1843.665,1850.997,"Well, we have a National Bank, but we do not have a National Bank that is protected by the national banking provisions."
1977.77-142,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1880.002,1889.27,"Well, how about the Fair Labor Standards Act, which was passed in 1938, would you say that was an example of Congressional sensitivity?"
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1889.27,1905.3,"I think that was, right, there was certainly recognition and discussion on it of whether or not this would be an intrusion in the vested powers of the states and the resolution I think was made that this is an area where the Federal Government does have an interest."
1977.77-142,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1919.263,1926.044,Do we need to worry about the corner grocery store in a case where we are dealing with a National Bank?
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1926.044,1927.622,"Well, I bet Your Honor."
1977.77-142,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1931.223,1933.377,Or the corner liquor store?
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1933.377,1945.25,"Yes, well if the statute itself could be so broadly interpreted, and if the only limitation upon its application where there is a threat of intrusion and upsetting of the balance of Federalism."
1977.77-142,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1967.836,1979.713,"Mr. Hewitt, I have another problem with your reading in this exception for “racketeering”, if “racketeering” is a conspiracy to use intimidation to extort money or whatever the language was."
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,1990.87,1994.127,"Well, it was never prosecuted on that theory, nor was it —"
1977.77-142,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1994.127,2002.369,"Well, if (Inaudible) had violated the statute and you say no it does not violate the statute because it is not “racketeering” and then you describe “racketeering” in a way that I think fits these facts."
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,2005.86,2021.128,"Well, I think the concept of “racketeering,” if were to give it the meaning of the Congress obviously intended in the 30s, must be an ongoing operation more than an isolated transaction, kind of an organized criminal conspiracy as they define it."
1977.77-142,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2021.128,2028.969,(Inaudible)
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,2028.969,2039.922,"It may well be, it may well be that if these were evidence of the series of bank robberies by these same individuals, we might have some organized crime or racketeering that fits with that."
1977.77-142,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2039.922,2048.391,"Your observation would put a rather severe crimp on the federal kidnapping statute, would they not?"
1977.77-142,1,30764,james_f_hewitt,,2062.215,2070.719,"Well, I think the legislative history behind the kidnapping act has certainly pointed that the isolated transaction rather than any ongoing enterprise."
1977.77-142,2,41027,sara_sun_beale,,2916.851,2935.69,"Just a few brief points, the first is that, despite respondent’s arguments there is not one shred of legislative history that indicates intent to place an unstated limitation on this broad language to limit it only to some activities called “racketeering.”"
1977.77-142,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3138.116,3149.099,"Thank you counsel, the case is submitted."
