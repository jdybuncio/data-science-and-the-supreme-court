2018.18-281,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.76,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-281, the Virginia House of Delegates versus Bethune-Hill. Mr. Clement."
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,8.76,86.84,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2011, the Virginia House of Delegates formulated a redistricting plan that garnered overwhelming bipartisan support and swift preclearance by the Justice Department. That plan has governed the first four election cycles of the decade and delivered on its promise to provide African American voters with the ability to elect their candidates of choice in 12 districts that everybody agreed should be majority-minority districts. The basic choice for this Court will be whether that plan, duly enacted by the people of Virginia, will govern this last election of the decade or if, instead, there will be a court-imposed plan formulated by a special master from out of state. Now the Virginia attorney general, for his part, would impose the court-ordered plan on the people of Virginia on the theory that the House of Delegates lacks appellate standing to appeal. That argument is deeply flawed and has enormous consequences that go well beyond this case but would be a particularly problematic feature in the all-too-often context where there is an impasse between the legislative branch and the executive branch and there has to be a court-ordered plan and the legislative branch and the executive branch are often adverse in that litigation over the court-ordered plan."
2018.18-281,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,86.84,96.52,"Mr. Clement, here, it isn't even the legislative branch; it's one house of the legislature."
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,96.52,113.48,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg, but I think particularly when you understand that the law at issue here has its object, one branch of the legislature, one house of the legislature, the House of Delegates, that that's exactly the right party to bring this particular case or to vindicate --"
2018.18-281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,113.48,117.04,But it's not -- it's not a law that belongs to the one branch.
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,117.04,117.24,It's not a --
2018.18-281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,117.24,130.96,It has to be approved by the Senate and signed by the governor and survive a -- a -- a veto by the governor if he or she chooses. So it's really a law that doesn't belong to the House.
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,136.88,144.56,"Justice Sotomayor, it doesn't belong to the House alone, but it does, in -- in -- in the parts that are challenged here, affect the House and the House alone."
2018.18-281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,144.56,145.88,Please tell me why.
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,170.32,179.44,"So I -- I beg to differ, which is to say I think that when you have the legislative districts, those are not just about elections."
2018.18-281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,201.12,206.52,There still will be a gentlelady from Norfolk and a gentleman from wherever.
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,226.24,249.2,"Well, I don't think it is guaranteed that there will be a gentleman from Norfolk because, if you redistrict in a way that essentially splits Norfolk four ways, there may be no gentleperson from Norfolk. And I think, more fundamentally, this is the basic decision as to whether they're going to be a representative government in terms of compact districts, whether they're going to be elongated."
2018.18-281,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,249.2,249.52,But Mr. --
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,249.52,250.2,I think that if --
2018.18-281,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,250.2,258.24,"-- Mr. Clement, the -- the change from the current representative to another, that's a frequent occurrence."
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,269.6,271.0,I -- I think that's true.
2018.18-281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,290.72,291.84,"Mr. Clement, what are the --"
2018.18-281,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,291.84,297.2,"Mr. Clement, there are two -- as I understand it, you're -- you're claiming standing on two theories."
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,322.76,325.64,I -- I don't think that it is correct.
2018.18-281,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,368.0,377.12,And -- and that's based on what? On the arguments that were made? The arguments that were made were arguments that represented -- that went to the represent -- the interests of the Commonwealth?
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,377.12,384.72,"Yes, and the fact that most pointedly and sort of, I think, impressively in front of this Court, there was no separate briefing at all."
2018.18-281,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,429.96,458.04,"Well, I would be very uncomfortable trying to decide whether, as a matter of Virginia law, anybody other than the attorney general can ever represent the Commonwealth or whether the House, under some circumstances, can also represent the Commonwealth. That's a question of Virginia law. And if that issue were -- is before us, there would be an argument for certifying that question to the Supreme Court of Virginia for a determination, because I -- I think it's a hard one for us to make."
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,465.84,466.56,That -- that's true.
2018.18-281,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,479.8,481.52,Before you go to the alternative argument --
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,481.52,482.0,Sure.
2018.18-281,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,482.0,518.48,"-- on the -- on the representing the state, even supposing that you're right, actually, it seems that you're right, that throughout some part of this litigation, the Attorney General's Office was very happy to have the legislature do most of the work, are you saying that that affects a kind of permanent delegation to the legislature to continue in that capacity, even if and when the Attorney General's Office decides, you know, actually, it -- something has changed, there now comes a point where we want to resume the head representative role?"
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,518.48,520.36,The answer is yes.
2018.18-281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,530.96,538.16,"Mr. Clement, that -- that's -- that's a pretty extreme statement on your part."
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,568.04,568.76,"Well, I -- I mean --"
2018.18-281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,568.76,575.16,Where we're -- we're taking away from the people of Virginia the right to say who's going to speak on their behalf?
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,575.16,591.2,"No, I -- I -- I think what you're doing is you're recognizing as a matter of federal law that at a certain point, if, in the federal courts, the executive branch has allowed the House of Delegates and its counsel to represent the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole, there are consequences to that choice."
2018.18-281,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,596.88,600.64,"Mr. Clement, I -- I'd like to move to the merits at this point if that's all right."
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,644.68,687.56,"Well, I -- I -- I think that's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and I'd say a couple of things. First of all, I think, in reviewing this case, I don't think you have to ignore the fact that there were contrary findings in the first go-around. I also think that, in a way, you can sidestep the elephant in the room if you find a legal error in the way that the district court committed its or conducted its credibility findings. And, here, I think you do have that with the double standard that they applied in terms of, well, if you testified for the second time on behalf of the plan, you are not credible because you should have been here the first time, but if you testified for the first time in the second trial against the plan, then it's perfectly excusable and we'll use your testimony."
2018.18-281,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,742.32,743.88,What's the clarification?
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,743.88,744.16,The -- the --
2018.18-281,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,744.16,782.44,"I'm not so worried about this case, but, I mean, there -- there are hundreds of thousands of trials, if not millions, and a certain percentage of them are reversed on appeal and they go back for a second trial. And what happens if the fact-finder in the second trial is declared credible or all of them, the witnesses and a different judge maybe or maybe the same, and the first one said no, it's the opposite, all right. Now there are appellate courts all over the world and this country who want to know what to do."
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,789.76,790.28,Well -- sure.
2018.18-281,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,790.28,792.32,That is a concern anyway that I have.
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,792.32,795.08,"So I -- so I would say two things, Justice Breyer."
2018.18-281,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,795.08,799.28,"I can think of one thing to do, which is you forget about the first trial."
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,808.56,853.32,"So I -- I would say two things, both of which are different from what you said, Justice Breyer. I mean, one is I do think in this kind of second trial context -- I mean, I think there's room for sort of a State Farm fox principle that if you're coming out diametrically opposed, you should at least avert to the fact that you're doing that and have to come up with some slightly-better- than-normal reason to at least explain the change. But the second thing that I think would be more limited to these redistricting cases, and I think it's very important, is when you have a context where the court has gone out of its way to say that it's particularly important to credit the good faith of the legislatures engaged in a very difficult task, I think you need a heightened standard before you dismiss their testimony across the board. And what you have in this case, I think, is a perfect illustration of it."
2018.18-281,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,876.44,877.68,I see -- I see where you're going.
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,932.04,936.56,So I -- I -- I want to be very responsive to what I take to be sort of a strict scrutiny question.
2018.18-281,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1099.88,1108.84,"Well, I'm not sure I understand your answer, Mr. Clement, because, if there's one thing that we've made clear again and again, it's that the analysis ought to be district by district."
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1161.08,1164.0,"Well, Justice Kagan, I don't think it was quite that cursory."
2018.18-281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1197.4,1205.76,"Well, it is odd, Mr. Clement, that you say they didn't have voting records because 95 is next to 92."
2018.18-281,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1274.36,1315.16,"So I -- I -- I think that if -- even if you have a concern with the way voting districts were split at the top of 95, far removed from the border with 92, that doesn't give you a basis for invalidating HD 92. And just to finish my answer to Justice Kagan's question, I think if you look at Joint Appendix page 451, you will see Delegate Dance, the delegate from District 63, and she's testifying on the House floor contemporaneously that the 55 percent number are the right numbers for the Richmond districts. So it's not like they didn't have testimony at the time from members of the African American caucus that said they were right to apply these numbers across districts. I will reserve my time."
2018.18-281,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1315.16,1315.64,Thank you --
2018.18-281,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1315.64,1316.56,Mr. Clement --
2018.18-281,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1316.56,1325.12,"I'm sorry -- thank you, counsel. Ms. Ratner."
2018.18-281,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1325.12,1343.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I have two points on standing and two on the merits. On standing, the House as an institution isn't harmed by changes to individual district lines, and while states can authorize legislatures to represent them in court, Virginia hasn't done so."
2018.18-281,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1343.32,1351.16,"Well, on that first point, injury in fact must be concrete, but it doesn't have to be big."
2018.18-281,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1351.16,1351.56,That's correct.
2018.18-281,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1351.56,1370.32,"If something causes me the loss of $5 or causes me to expend an hour that I would rather do -- use for some other purpose, that's injury in fact. Is it -- is it conceivable that this does not have even that kind of an administrative impact on the House of Delegates?"
2018.18-281,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1370.32,1385.44,"I think so, Your Honor, because what we're talking about here is potentially an effect for current incumbents in their capacity as candidates for -- for reelection prospects. And so we're not talking about the current House having any injury."
2018.18-281,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1389.36,1399.36,"I mean, it's hard for me to believe that doesn't cost them one dime. I mean, maybe they -- they publish a map showing the current districts, and they'd have to publish a different map."
2018.18-281,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1416.92,1421.12,"At a minimum, though, Justice Alito, it requires evidence of that injury."
2018.18-281,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1436.12,1436.68,But suppose --
2018.18-281,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1436.68,1444.6,"Well, when were they supposed to do that? At what -- at what point was the -- was their standing challenged so that they would have an obligation to come forward with evidence?"
2018.18-281,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1444.6,1449.92,"You know, it's a little bit unusual given that this standing issue first arises with respect to this appeal."
2018.18-281,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1463.4,1464.44,Ms. Ratner --
2018.18-281,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1464.44,1464.72,See --
2018.18-281,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1464.72,1474.76,-- suppose that you're right that the legislature has no interest in who is going to represent each district.
2018.18-281,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1522.24,1530.12,"So let me give you two responses, Justice Kagan. The -- the first is that I don't think it's true that there are current blurred lines of accountability."
2018.18-281,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1590.12,1594.92,"How do you distinguish Beens, which seemed to deal with a lot of these same issues?"
2018.18-281,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1594.92,1603.52,"Well, Beens, it's hard to know exactly what to read into it because that decision just talks about standing as equivalent to intervention."
2018.18-281,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1614.2,1618.04,"Why -- why do you say ""in kind""? Just because of reduction in the size?"
2018.18-281,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1618.04,1648.16,"Because I think when you change the size of an institution, particularly when you slash it in half from 67 senators to 35 senators, there are going to be more of these intuitive types of harms of the sort that Justice Alito mentioned before. There may be changes to committee structures, to rules for voting, rules for a quorum, and at least we can imagine some institutional-specific harms there, whereas, here, what we're really talking about are changes in the 100 members who may sit in the House's seats."
2018.18-281,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1654.0,1675.16,"Well, what about the proposition that it does change the nature of the entity if you are moving away from compactness and contiguousness, for example -- I guess the example is you may not have representatives who really are -- this is Richmond, that's what I represent, but they're going to have part of Richmond, they're going to have part of somebody else, and that changes the nature of the dynamic in the -- in the House?"
2018.18-281,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1675.16,1689.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would give the same response that I gave to Justice Alito before, which is, to the extent that that's really what we're talking about, there has to be some sort of evidentiary showing for those types of standing allegations. There's never been an affidavit put in or any evidence --"
2018.18-281,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1689.96,1691.16,I don't think it's in --
2018.18-281,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1691.16,1702.0,It -- it doesn't seem intuitive at all that the new plan is necessarily going to be less compact and there's necessarily going to be some sort of real-world change in the day-to-day operation of the bodies.
2018.18-281,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1702.96,1710.72,"One could speculate that, and I'm trying to get back to that. Justice Alito spoke about the cost of changing maps."
2018.18-281,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1770.44,1771.52,So -- so a couple things.
2018.18-281,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1771.52,1775.36,"Ms. Ratner, why don't -- why don't you answer and then move to the merits after that."
2018.18-281,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1775.36,1775.48,Okay.
2018.18-281,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1819.84,1823.6,"You know, this is being said in a very generalized way."
2018.18-281,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1850.36,1851.08,I understand that.
2018.18-281,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1851.08,1858.04,"-- and with facts that they -- I shouldn't say he, it was a panel -- that they found convincing."
2018.18-281,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1858.04,1859.08,I understand that.
2018.18-281,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1859.08,1861.48,How do we get past clear error?
2018.18-281,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1861.48,1868.08,"So, Justice Sotomayor, we think there's a legal error here, not -- we haven't gone on to discuss the clear error question."
2018.18-281,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1882.72,1883.0,But they do --
2018.18-281,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1883.0,1890.4,"-- at page 34, that's where the court relegates the House's expert on traditional districting criteria."
2018.18-281,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1930.12,1933.16,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Heytens."
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1933.16,1952.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is only one sovereign whose law was declared unconstitutional by the federal district court."
2018.18-281,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1972.52,1977.8,"Well, here, in the beginning, the State's Attorney General was happy to have the House take over the litigation."
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1977.8,1987.0,"I -- the State's Attorney General did not oppose intervention, I agree, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think that the disposing of that is the trial brief that was filed by the State's Attorney General."
2018.18-281,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2025.0,2026.44,"Well, you -- you might be right."
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2063.28,2067.04,"Justice Alito, I -- I understand that concern, and I don't think the Court has to get into it."
2018.18-281,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2146.88,2157.08,"What do you suggest? I mean, the way you want to with no standing, you have a Democratic House, a Democratic governor, and they don't like the plan."
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2192.12,2196.28,"Well, Justice Breyer, my fundamental submission is that this is a ""who decides"" question."
2018.18-281,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2203.16,2214.76,"But am I right in saying where the government is divided between the parties, then, in circumstances like this, nobody will challenge it?"
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2214.76,2215.4,I -- I don't --
2018.18-281,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2215.4,2227.76,"But nobody can, because we will have held nobody can, but where the elections turn out that it's the same governor party and the House party, it's all different."
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2238.56,2239.8,Sure.
2018.18-281,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2266.84,2268.36,"Well, maybe you don't need an allegation."
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2285.88,2290.52,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think there could be a lot of finger-pointing on every side in this case."
2018.18-281,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2290.6,2292.64,We're not alleging anything.
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2303.88,2304.32,So --
2018.18-281,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2304.32,2307.44,"Whether it's an allegation, not an allegation, or not."
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2312.36,2314.28,I don't think the Court needs to decide in this case.
2018.18-281,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2314.28,2314.36,Yeah.
2018.18-281,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2314.84,2315.8,Mr. Heytens -- (Laughter.)
2018.18-281,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2315.8,2317.92,So tell me who you think -- who you think can challenge.
2018.18-281,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2317.92,2322.92,-- isn't one of -- isn't one of the points here is that it's a matter of state law really.
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2330.04,2331.12,North Carolina.
2018.18-281,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2331.12,2334.0,"-- and other states, like Virginia, that have not."
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2346.76,2347.52,Yes.
2018.18-281,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2349.32,2351.16,"I was looking for an answer, honestly."
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2351.16,2352.16,"And -- and, Justice Breyer, to return to your --"
2018.18-281,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2352.16,2353.24,"And I now have one, okay, thank you."
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2353.24,2360.48,"Well, I also don't think this Court needs to decide in this case whether an individual legislator or candidate would have standing."
2018.18-281,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2381.96,2391.64,Suppose there -- there was an affidavit by some administrative officer of the House that said this is going to cost us $26 in administrative expenses.
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2393.28,2394.56,No.
2018.18-281,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2394.56,2396.24,Why not? That's not injury in fact?
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2396.24,2402.92,"It is an -- it is an economic injury, but this Court has been clear that what you need is a judicially cognizable injury."
2018.18-281,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2431.24,2438.44,So you're talk -- then you're really not talking about injury in fact; you're talking about some other limitation on -- and I can understand it.
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2442.24,2455.0,"Well, Justice Alito, I've understood the judicially cognizable injury to be part of the injury-in-fact inquiry, that this Court has said it's not just enough to have something that could be described as an injury in general; it has to be a judicially cognizable injury."
2018.18-281,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2461.64,2465.48,"What do we -- what do we do with Beens? If I were a lower court judge, I would think Beens is controlling."
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2469.44,2471.64,"Justice Kavanaugh, we are not asking you to overrule Beens."
2018.18-281,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2529.24,2547.32,"But I -- I would have thought that the response would be that the members of the House have -- or Senate in that case have no more interest in -- in that than they would in this, that the people get to decide how big their House is and what lines are drawn."
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2547.32,2547.44,May I?
2018.18-281,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2547.44,2549.12,Sure.
2018.18-281,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2549.12,2564.96,"Again, Justice Gorsuch, I think Beens is, at best, the outermost limit of this Court's standing jurisprudence, and our fundamental submission is you should not extend it from the very specific situation presented there to the much more common situation presented here. Thank you."
2018.18-281,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2564.96,2571.12,"Thank you, Mr. Heytens. Mr. Elias."
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,2571.12,2592.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It is not in dispute in this case that the Commonwealth of Virginia adopted a one-size-fits-all, 55 percent racial rule that had a direct and significant input -- impact on the drawing of district lines in each of the -- the 11 challenged districts."
2018.18-281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2599.44,2625.16,"Well, what the solicitor general -- the federal government's solicitor general says is that you're -- you're right, but it's -- it was too extreme, that they didn't look at other factors that had to do with the redistricting but sort of the -- the flip side of the prior error, that -- that they just looked at -- the court was wrong in reviewing it to simply look at that same statistical figure."
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,2625.16,2632.52,"Well, I don't think you can fairly read the district court's lengthy decision and say that it didn't look on a district-by-district basis."
2018.18-281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2648.48,2650.8,"Well, I actually had a different elephant in mind -- (Laughter.)"
2018.18-281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2650.8,2687.24,"-- which is the fact that the prior judicial panel found, you know, A, B, and C credible and D, E, and F incredible, and then a different panel found the exact opposite for the exact witnesses. And that, I understand, is a basic element, if you're looking at a case, the clearly erroneous standard applies, but it seems an awkward position for us to be in in saying, well, these directly 180 degree findings are clearly or not clearly erroneous, when we would have found the exact same thing the other way if that panel had been before us."
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,2687.24,2694.2,"So I'd offer two answers to that, Mr. Chief Justice. The first is a factual matter in this case."
2018.18-281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2742.8,2743.16,Right.
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,2754.28,2754.4,Well --
2018.18-281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2754.4,2767.8,"And it just seems to me that -- that -- you know, it strikes me as a little awkward to apply the very deferential, clearly erroneous standard when you've got this other -- other findings that are the exact opposite."
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,2767.8,2817.44,"So that brings me to the second point, which is this Court in Cooper faced a more extreme version of that, as you recall, where you had the state court had found one set of factual determinations with respect to why the North Carolina map had been drawn a certain way, and you had the federal court using essentially the same -- in the same basic set of facts, weigh the evidence the other. And this Court had to decide what to do in that instance and applied what was the appropriate rule there and the appropriate rule here, which is that the case before it is the -- is the case for which -- that deferential, clear error review is appropriate. These three judges had the benefit not just of the evidence in the second trial but the evidence in the first trial."
2018.18-281,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2840.44,2846.4,"Everyone agrees here that there needed to be 12 majority-minority districts, right?"
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,2846.4,2854.08,We agree that there were 12 majority-minority districts under the benchmark plan and under Section 5.
2018.18-281,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2854.36,2856.0,So I'll take that as a yes?
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,2856.0,2863.72,"Well, they had to do a functional analysis, Your Honor, and -- and what that meant is that they needed to prove that there was not retrogression."
2018.18-281,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2863.72,2864.16,Right.
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,2864.16,2872.28,Whether retrogression would leave them at 50.1 or 49.9 is part of the inquiry that would have been done.
2018.18-281,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2872.28,2918.32,"If you have to have a majority-minority district, and I thought it was also widely agreed that a bare majority would not be good enough for any of these districts, and then you consult and you consult with the Black Caucus and you consult with others and everyone agrees it has to be more than a bare majority, I'm wondering why 55 is such -- so problematic here, given that the states have to have some flexibility -- I don't -- pinpointing 53.5 versus 54.2 versus 55 when they've done the kind of outreach and consulting, everyone approves, the attorney general -- the U.S. attorney general preclears. I'd just like your response to all of that."
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,2918.32,2938.28,"Sure, Justice Kavanaugh. I'd offer three responses. The first is that I don't think it's -- I don't think the trial record is, fairly read, and the district court certainly did not find, that Delegate Jones consulted the entire Black Caucus. His original testimony was he consulted everyone."
2018.18-281,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2940.0,2943.96,Is it -- is it correct that the Black Caucus was supportive of the plan?
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,2943.96,2978.56,"I think that members of the Black Caucus testified in the second trial that they were told that the -- and this is their words -- the gospel according to Jones was that every district had to be 55 percent. And they -- for VRA compliance and they assumed that was correct. But, if you look at the testimony of the African American members in the second trial, they will say that they did not believe that, in fact, their -- in order to have an ability to elect district, it needed to be that high. The -- the second answer I'd give you is I think it would be very instructive for this Court to look at two things."
2018.18-281,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3107.12,3131.24,"But -- but, again, if -- if a state faced with these facts said, we're going to do 52 percent or 53 percent, they would be hammered from the other side, saying you are discriminating against African American voters because you're not giving the voters a sufficient opportunity to elect the candidate of their choice. And so they -- they do more here by going with 55."
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,3148.76,3149.32,Sure.
2018.18-281,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3199.4,3226.44,"Could I make sure I understand what you're saying, Mr. Elias, because what I've -- what -- what I've understood is that the flexibility that Justice Kavanaugh is talking about is critical, and Alabama talked about this and Cooper talked about this, but it's critical at the -- it's -- it's not -- it's critical at the point where you ask whether the Voting Rights Act has provided a sufficient justification --"
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,3226.44,3226.92,Right.
2018.18-281,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3226.92,3229.6,-- for the state to get over strict scrutiny.
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,3241.4,3242.12,"No, Your Honor."
2018.18-281,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3242.32,3244.12,I've been assuming predominance.
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,3244.12,3244.76,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2018.18-281,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3244.76,3244.88,Yeah.
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,3244.88,3255.08,"Then I misunderstood. So, in strict scrutiny, look, the truth is that all the State of Virginia had to do was come in with a good reason, and in this case, they came in with no reason, and it's really that -- it's really honestly that simple."
2018.18-281,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3255.08,3262.08,A good reason is complying with the Voting Rights Act to ensure that African American voters have the opportunity to -- to elect the candidate of their choice.
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,3262.08,3263.56,But they -- but they weren't --
2018.18-281,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3263.56,3265.28,And it's precleared by the U.S. Justice Department.
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,3265.28,3270.48,"Well, first of all, there is nothing in the record that suggests that they drew this plan to comply with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act."
2018.18-281,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3313.24,3315.04,"Well, DOJ precleared it, though."
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,3315.04,3321.36,"DOJ precleared it, but DOJ was not charged with looking at whether it was a racial gerrymander or not."
2018.18-281,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3328.92,3369.96,"Mr. Elias, if I could go back to the predominance inquiry, one of Mr. Clement's arguments, I think, is something like, well, if you have this 55 percent non-negotiable target, you know, that -- that might be evidence for all districts, but it doesn't get you over the bar for all districts because there might be some districts that are way over 55 percent, so that you can move people in and move people out and never really think about the 55 percent target in anything that you're doing, and that what the Court got wrong here was not recognizing that fact. So why isn't that right?"
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,3369.96,3394.0,"Well, for two reasons. First of all, I think the Court addressed district by district that there were, in fact, black voters moved based on race on a district-by-district basis. And that's part of the reason why, Justice Kagan, I pointed you to the facts of HD 75, where predominance was found and BVAP went from 55.3 to 55.4. The -- the test is not whether BVAP stayed the same."
2018.18-281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3426.24,3432.32,"Well, this is in a context where you are required to consider race to comply with Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act."
2018.18-281,3,62677,marc_e_elias,,3432.32,3432.8,Correct.
2018.18-281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3478.48,3482.24,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement, you have three minutes remaining."
2018.18-281,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3482.24,3501.36,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a couple quick points on standing and on the merits. First on standing, I don't think you can underestimate the impact of this case and the decision below and the remedial order that follows on the House and the way it operates day to day. The remedial order reconfigured 25 of the 100 seats."
2018.18-281,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3516.96,3536.64,"Mr. Clement, what -- Mr. Clement, what do we do now? If we rule in your favor and say that every House that has -- creates a plan has standing, we invite complete discord in a state over who represents the interests of that law."
2018.18-281,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3536.64,3538.24,I don't think there's any discord here.
2018.18-281,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3538.24,3538.68,So every --
2018.18-281,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3538.68,3539.8,As my friends on the other --
2018.18-281,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3539.8,3551.2,"-- every House body can come in, so can their attorney general, presumably, and possibly some individual members."
2018.18-281,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3554.72,3558.24,I -- I don't think it has anything -- this case has anything to do with whether the members are going to come here.
2018.18-281,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3574.88,3575.88,It hasn't been cited --
2018.18-281,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3575.88,3576.72,-- it's the same --
2018.18-281,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3576.72,3579.68,"-- Mr. Clement, in 30 years."
2018.18-281,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3586.96,3591.0,I -- I -- I don't think that -- that decisions come with expiration dates.
2018.18-281,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3684.16,3684.76,"Thank you, counsel."
