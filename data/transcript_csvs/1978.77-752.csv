1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,91.703,We'll arguments next in 752 National Labor Relations Board against the Catholic Bishop of Chicago.
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,96.494,100.634,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-752,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,181.437,183.513,Was it dealt with by the court?
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,183.513,184.182,"It was not, Your Honor."
1978.77-752,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,184.182,185.647,"No, was it."
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,185.647,187.204,That is our understanding sir.
1978.77-752,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,187.204,198.289,So if we decided in your favor on the constitutional issue it might be appropriate to remand that to the Court of Appeals for decision in the first instance.
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,198.289,226.102,"We believe that that issue is not a substantial issue and as we have endeavored to show in our reply brief, the Congress in amending the Act in 1974 to eliminate the exemption in Section 2 (2) for nonprofit hospitals, expressly approved the Board's policy of asserting jurisdiction over private, nonprofit organizations."
1978.77-752,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,576.825,581.753,"Mr. Solicitor I take it, the Board adheres to that dichotomy still?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,581.753,584.286,"The Board adheres to that dichotomy, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1978.77-752,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,584.286,588.486,As a matter of its discretion rather than it's a matter of -- its understanding of constitutional compulsion.
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,588.486,599.614,"As a matter of its discretion Mr. Justice Stewart, it believes that it has jurisdiction to consider all that come within that affect commerce."
1978.77-752,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,602.508,604.492,And do you support it?
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,604.492,605.38,Do I support it Mr. Justice Brennan?
1978.77-752,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,605.38,612.897,"Yes, that was my next question, because I gathered a lukewarmness in your brief."
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,612.897,622.628,"Well, the Board is not required, as I understand it, to exercise its full jurisdiction."
1978.77-752,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,631.096,640.963,But does this not involve the Board in the determination what is completely religious versus what is merely religiously associated?
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,640.963,641.113,It might --
1978.77-752,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,641.113,647.269,"And if it does, doesn't that get beyond the limit constitutionally over?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,647.269,655.096,"Mr. Justice Brennan it might from the phraseology employed, but that is not the way it has applied this test."
1978.77-752,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,655.805,663.878,"There is or not, whether is or not it has applied it, it may involve the Board in examining in the religious principles that --"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,663.878,671.311,It might accept the Board looks solely to secular aspects of the schools in making this dichotomy.
1978.77-752,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,683.828,692.158,"But that would not qualify the -- if it did, that would not qualify the school, would it for eight parochial schools, constitutionally?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,692.158,694.721,"No, that certainly would not."
1978.77-752,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,694.721,705.222,"Well then why, and yet you say if that distinction would be enough to bring it within the Board's jurisdiction, not withstanding the examination of --"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,705.222,712.597,"No, I suggest that the Board has statutory jurisdiction into consider --"
1978.77-752,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,712.597,720.806,I don't understand why at least the Solicitor General doesn't take the position that even a completely religious schools would be subject to the Board's jurisdiction.
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,720.806,722.501,"Well, we do."
1978.77-752,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,727.259,729.919,"Well, then why defend this dichotomy?"
1978.77-752,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,729.919,731.524,This dichotomy is not an issue here.
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,731.524,733.508,I don't feel that I have to defend the dichotomy.
1978.77-752,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,733.508,734.825,It's not an issue in this case --
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,734.825,747.123,"Except to suggest that I think that the Board has the discretion to decide whether it will exercise this jurisdiction, but we contend that it has jurisdiction over both --"
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,747.123,759.641,But do you not agree that this dichotomy shed some light upon the problem of whether there is an interference or an impact on religion?
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,759.641,762.725,"But that is not the reason the Board has adopted it, because --"
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,762.725,771.304,"It's not, perhaps not, but do you -- my question is would you agree that it shed some light on the problem?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,771.304,786.952,"Well, I think probably not, the Board apparently is looking to see whether what is its impact on commerce, and it is determined that the completely religious schools which have been schools in its experience --"
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,786.952,787.589,By that you mean --
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,787.589,796.979,"-- that afforded after school religious instruction and were not the functional equivalent of the public schools, didn't have the requisite impact."
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,796.979,802.636,"Or rather completely religious, do you mean the seminary that trains priests among other things?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,802.636,804.63,They have not applied it in that fashion.
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,811.205,811.961,Or a grade school?
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,811.961,814.686,"Or grade school, they have applied it."
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,822.187,845.198,"Well, has it not been a tenet of the catholic faith and of some others faiths that operates schools, that if the children are inculcated with the principles of the faith and of religion and morals in the first dozen years of their lives, then they are adherence to that faith."
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,845.198,847.132,I've heard that expressed.
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,847.132,849.747,doesn't that permeate the literature on the subject?
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,849.747,852.36,I believe it does Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,852.36,867.632,"But the contrary of that is -- some of the antireligious countries, communist for example, who make it a felony to teach religion to a child under 12 or under 15, there's some relationship there, is there not?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,867.632,871.243,"There is, but fortunately we do not think that's involved here in this case."
1978.77-752,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,897.719,911.917,"General McCree, you apparently feel that the statutory issue is clear, simply because of the general language and yet, an exception was found in McCulloch versus Sociedad, where the general language was equally clear."
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,911.917,927.922,"Well the -- Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we concede that the general language was equally clear, but the McCulloch case, if memory serves, is a case involving seaman on foreign vessels."
1978.77-752,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,927.922,928.718,Right.
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,928.718,934.894,Whether they would be within the ambit of -- whether they would be within the jurisdiction of the Labor Board.
1978.77-752,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,963.944,981.509,"But isn't it just as permissible in inference in the light of the reasoning in McCulloch to say that assertion of congressional jurisdiction over a parochial school and the Bishop of Chicago, where they require an expressed statement because of a possible First Amendment implication?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,981.509,1004.659,"We submit that it is not, because of other regulatory measures have been held applicable to religiously affiliated schools, fire regulations, attendance laws, health and safety provisions."
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1004.659,1009.477,"But none of those affect the kind of teaching, do they?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1010.336,1011.611,Nor does the --
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1011.611,1012.46,"-- their own neutral, are they?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1012.46,1017.238,Nor does the ordering question here affect the kind of teaching.
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1040.551,1055.03,"Then I -- from that I take it that it's your position that the bargaining process, the total bargaining process would have new impact whatever upon methods of teaching or --"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1055.03,1068.463,"Now, we submit that it would have no impact at all on methods of teaching or content of teaching if limited to these aspects that I've mentioned, wages, hours, conditions at that point."
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1068.463,1084.66,"Would you suggest that that's true with the public schools that the process has not had any impact on how teaching has been conducted, even though there it is limited to wages, hours, and working conditions?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1084.66,1099.897,"I don't believe -- I'm not aware, I am not aware that any curriculum content or pedagogical techniques have been made mandatory subjects of bargaining in the public school area."
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1099.897,1101.961,Neither directly nor indirectly?
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1101.961,1111.18,"Well, there may be some indirect impact, but that's not before us today."
1978.77-752,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1233.248,1237.178,In the sense of a burden on Free Exercise?
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1237.178,1238.903,"If the Court please, yes."
1978.77-752,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1240.478,1242.472,"But, what kind of burden Mr. Solicitor?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1242.472,1260.572,"Well, the Court of Appeals below suggested that somehow it would inhibit the exercise a freedom of religion, and we suggest in this respect that the Free Exercise Clause is absolute insofar as it applies to belief."
1978.77-752,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1300.863,1327.921,"Now, that leaves me to ask you Mr. Solicitor General about the hypothetical case and according to one of the amicus briefs here, it's not a hypothetical case, it might be a real case of a religious group, who's religious tenets taught that organization of labor unions were wrong, I'm talking about the Seventh Day Adventist brief."
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1327.921,1328.159,"Yes, and --"
1978.77-752,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1328.159,1330.143,And that's what it says as I understand it.
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1330.143,1346.796,"I understand it to say that too, but I suggest here that to bargain collectively with labor unions is not inconsistent with the religious beliefs of these respondents, and they don't say so either."
1978.77-752,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1346.796,1348.141,"Well, what if it were?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1350.594,1354.017,"Well, I think we might have a different problem then."
1978.77-752,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1361.911,1362.887,Just didn't believe in education to be (Voice Overlap).
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1362.887,1368.166,Didn't believe in pursing education beyond the ninth grade or the eighth grade.
1978.77-752,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1437.5,1458.098,"General, in any event, despite those encyclicals that you or I might read to say that and perhaps they do, we know that in this case that these respondents say that to be ordered a bargain with the other ends would violate their rights under the First Amendment whatever those encyclicals might say."
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1458.098,1469.185,"We understand them not to say that to have to bargain does that, they are supposing consequences subsequent to --"
1978.77-752,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1469.185,1476.987,Which they say would inevitably follow from their duty if they were -- there was imposed upon them a duty to bargain with these labor unions.
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1476.987,1483.268,"But this is the same approach, the same argument that was made in Associated Press."
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1496.781,1507.236,"Would you concede that there is perhaps some difference between free press, free expression on the one hand and the two religion clauses on the other?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1507.236,1519.696,"I certainly would and I find, as this Court has found a difficult at times to reconcile the Establishment Clause with a Free Exercise Clause."
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1519.696,1522.401,"We've said in some opinions, there's a tension between the two."
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1522.401,1554.987,"In Walz, I believe this Court said that there has to be some giving in the joints, where they come together, and as a matter of fact, the Free Exercise Clause philosophically has some -- creates some problems under the Establishment Clause, because it allows a person who professes religion as motivating his behavior to raise -- I present arguments that a person who does not profess religion to present."
1978.77-752,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1591.663,1595.344,"General McCree, may I ask a factual question that perhaps you know."
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1606.847,1608.971,They are not.
1978.77-752,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1618.063,1631.735,"Would it be an unfair labor practice for the Bishop to prefer in hiring and discharge and the like clerics, overlay persons?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1631.735,1640.404,"That's a difficult question to answer, I would think probably not, unless it had anti-union animus."
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1668.655,1680.038,"Would your answer be the same, if the hiring authority preferred members of the faith over members of other faiths or persons who have none?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1680.038,1687.711,"My answer would be the same Mr. Chief Justice, because there you would focus whether there was an anti-union animus."
1978.77-752,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1733.38,1756.299,"I was going to follow through, what do we do with this situation where an individual is discharge for two reasons, one heresy and the other, in the eyes of the employer over aggressive unionism?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1756.299,1770.953,"I think in that case the Board would have a problem that's not dissimilar from problems that it entertains everyday, when an employee is discharge from being a poor worker, but for being a union activist."
1978.77-752,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1790.09,1795.188,Would the Board be bound by the Bishop's determination as to the issue of heresy in Mr. Justice Blackmun's question?
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1795.188,1795.354,Oh!
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1814.751,1832.392,"What if a teacher, a lay teacher, of some either a member of the same faith or not assigned the reading of books which were condemned by the hiring authority, so these books are not on the reading list."
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1840.065,1847.269,"Well, I suppose a reference of reading list would be a secular reference and this is was -- if there was in fact a (Voice Overlap)."
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1847.269,1855.698,"Well I'm assuming that it was declared by the authority of the church, that it impinged on the faith."
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1855.698,1872.337,"Well, I would think if a teacher went beyond, even a lay teacher, went beyond a prescribed reading list, this would give a ground for disciplinary action that wouldn't at all constitute an unfair labor practice."
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1880.249,1889.384,Do you suggest that bargaining agents have never both suggested and supported the power of a teacher in a public school to do just that?
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1889.384,1889.453,Oh!
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1891.677,1896.186,"And maintained it was strikes and threats of strikes, have they not?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1896.186,1902.99,"Well, I wouldn't be surprise if they hadn't do, but I will suggest to you what should the law be on the subject."
1978.77-752,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1902.99,1912.697,"Mr. Solicitor General this case only involves layman, and only problems involved are working conditions, this case?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1912.697,1938.055,"This is what we've endeavored to say Mr. Justice Marshall, if I might just conclude by suggesting that when a religiously affiliated organization chooses to enter into an enterprise that affects commerce, it must accept the same obligations to respect laws enacted for the protection for societal interest that is imposed on similar enterprises, not having a religious organization."
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1938.055,1959.667,"Would that not also be true if the operations of a church itself, does not every church purchase something that is moving in interstate commerce and the pastors are moved from one place to another in some faiths.Isn't that possible, if that would -- the church itself (Voice Overlap)."
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1959.667,1966.585,"In some church act, if the church functions as an employer, it would present a very difficult question."
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1984.71,1987.145,A book publishing company might be an example of that.
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1987.145,1988.72,It might very well be.
1978.77-752,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1990.255,1998.347,"General McCree, doesn't every church function as an employer in a sense when they hire a pastor?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1998.347,1999.702,A church might and --
1978.77-752,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1999.702,2003.016,"But they have a hard time getting one with one, wouldn't they?"
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2003.016,2012.423,"Well, I don't know, I'm advised if the Court please that there are religions that have no clergy whatsoever and that any person is eligible."
1978.77-752,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2012.423,2013.521,They're all clergy.
1978.77-752,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2013.521,2019.198,"All clergy, we used to encounter that during the war if you recall."
1978.77-752,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2019.198,2023.497,Very well.
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2026.132,2029.985,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2119.09,2121.962,(Voice Overlap) to the state regulations.
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2121.962,2144.553,"Only the neutral state regulations of compulsory attendance and minimum subjects that are necessary to obtain accreditation, but if the Bishop wants for example, in a mathematics class to have religion taught as examples have been given in the Court's opinion, he may do so."
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2147.118,2151.19,And the state can also take away their accreditation?
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2151.19,2152.366,"Yes, the state can --"
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2152.366,2154.23,And the school cannot operate.
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2154.23,2156.087,Or the school may operate --
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2156.087,2157.372,Without accreditation?
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2157.372,2158.428,That's correct.
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2158.428,2161.171,Do you have a compulsory attendance law in Illinois?
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2161.171,2162.177,"We do, but as a (Voice Overlap)."
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2162.177,2165.179,(Voice Overlap) to be subject to that law?
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2165.179,2179.836,"They would indeed, except that Your Honor, in Yoder, Your Honors decided that after eighth grade the state's interest didn't compulsory attendance was not as great as the religious principles involved."
1978.77-752,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2316.589,2324.152,"How about state safety regulations, fire regulations, and that sort of thing, I take it that you concede the state may apply those."
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2324.152,2325.238,Absolutely.
1978.77-752,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2325.238,2328.42,"Well, to that extent, the Bishop isn't the absolute authority over the school?"
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2328.42,2347.721,"That Mr. Justice Rehnquist does not involve teaching, and my remarks really addressed to the millieu of the teaching within the school, and there's no question that the state can subject the school to zoning regulations and health regulations and what have you."
1978.77-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.404,2354.135,"What about minimum wage regulations, Fair Labor Standards Act?"
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2354.135,2363.432,"Well, Your Honors held -- the Court is held the usury case that the states have that power reserve."
1978.77-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2385.181,2396.217,"Yes, but don't you have the problem that some of the Catholic schools, they pay a lesser wage scale, I suppose for lay teachers, who are perhaps dedicated persons willing to donate their services or something like that."
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2402.672,2414.116,"That's correct, that's correct, if pushed to it, I would say that the minimum wage law should not apply to the lay school teacher in the religious school."
1978.77-752,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2414.116,2418.286,How about the janitors and the people who run the building?
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2418.286,2424.721,I have no problem and think the janitors have every right to have the NLRB intrude.
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2429.303,2433.235,You mean the Bishop doesn't have anything to do with the labor?
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2433.235,2434.413,"I didn't hear you, Your Honor."
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2434.413,2438.323,You mean the Bishop doesn't have any jurisdiction over the labor?
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2438.323,2438.553,Yes.
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2438.553,2441.395,The whole point was that the Bishop was the boss.
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2441.395,2443.292,The Bishop and the labor --
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2443.292,2445.336,Isn't that your whole point?
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2445.336,2451.083,"No sir, I'm saying the Bishop is the supreme arbiter when it comes to the teaching function."
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2457.129,2462.736,"I know that, but why is he subject to the NLRB and the teacher is not?"
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2462.736,2484.547,"Because in connection with the janitor, you do not have an encouragement to religious beliefs, you will not have as I perceive it an unfair labor practice, where there is challenging the Bishop as to whether or not his discharged with cause for religious grounds or because of an anti-union animus."
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2495.106,2503.934,"If you could, and I know you can, name me one non-Catholic janitor in Chicago Public Catholic School."
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2503.934,2504.193,Oh!
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2504.763,2507.466,I don't think we need to get the janitors (Voice Overlap).
1978.77-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2507.466,2514.6,"They hire non-Catholic attorneys, I think. [Laughter]"
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2514.6,2519.628,I think that that's a perfect answer to the question and I'll stop when I may had.
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2519.628,2523.738,"If you want to put it to any, it is all right with me, but don't count me in."
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2523.738,2528.437,Many have Your Honor.
1978.77-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2862.53,2869.391,"Well I suppose that can be said too of the private secular school, can it?"
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2869.391,2881.913,"That's correct, the difference is that in the private sector, you do not have the First Amendment consideration, so it's simply and it's an entirely different question."
1978.77-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2882.949,2893.988,"You are not talking about competition, and I'm merely saying that the private school has the competition angled who to buck."
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2893.988,2896.381,I concede that.
1978.77-752,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2945.621,2957.037,"Why is there constant litigation over the NLRB's assumption of jurisdiction here when there is an over, say zoning of churches or is there a constant litigation over zoning of churches?"
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,2957.037,2963.527,Because Mr. Justice Rehnquist as I guess said Walz it's a matter of degree.
1978.77-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3029.763,3041.559,"Mr. Rueben, what about certification of schools in the state law, how about getting them certificated as kinds of places that will be acceptable for public education?"
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,3041.559,3046.152,"I think there again, it's a matter of degree."
1978.77-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3069.309,3073.149,"That's almost a contradiction in these terms, isn't it what you just said?"
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,3082.744,3084.441,"No, I think the Court has set."
1978.77-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3084.441,3089.356,"No, let's assume Mathematics class teaches nothing but religion."
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,3089.356,3090.232,"Well, I think the Court --"
1978.77-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3090.232,3092.737,"They're not going to get certificate, is it?"
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,3092.737,3095.781,It depends whether after the mathematics class --
1978.77-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3095.781,3101.018,"Well, just accept what I said, it doesn't teach anything, but religion in the mathematics class."
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,3101.018,3103.441,Then it's really not a mathematics class.
1978.77-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3103.441,3104.818,"Well, exactly."
1978.77-752,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3104.818,3109.271,Then they have not met the qualifications required (Voice Overlap)?
1978.77-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3109.271,3114.229,"So, how about half, half the class, half everyday in mathematics?"
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,3114.229,3134.297,"Well, I take it that in the subject like mathematics, and I think it was Justice Douglas gave the example that in a mathematics class you can inject religion and have 40,000 nuns and does it equal 40,000 priests and what have you, I take it that the test, when one is through is whether they take --"
1978.77-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3134.297,3135.966,Whether they come into ground.
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,3135.966,3147.808,"More than that whether the student by an objective test can divide, understands his fractions, knows the multiplication tables, there's no inquiry as to as religious beliefs."
1978.77-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3159.308,3164.047,"What about teacher qualifications, in that process of certification?"
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,3164.047,3178.714,"Well, the certification, as I understand it, the state certifies teachers regardless of race, religion or what have you, and there isn't really an incursion into the ability --"
1978.77-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3178.714,3191.09,"Yes, I'm just curious, I don't know what the answer is, in Illinois, must the Catholic schools employ certified teachers as they want to be a certified school?"
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,3191.09,3192.527,"I don't know the answer, but I do know --"
1978.77-752,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3192.527,3195.691,But what if they did?
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,3195.691,3203.712,"Well, I think that I would have no trouble with that, because that would be in effect the licensing before the person began to teach."
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3229.142,3239.164,"Mr. Rueben isn't it true as the fact that most law in cities that they don't write or heard on the parochial school, they've been running a year, they just let them go?"
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,3242.316,3243.911,I wish it were so.
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3243.911,3245.915,"Well, they do supervise?"
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,3245.915,3255.787,"I wish it were so, the parochial school must comply with all of the fire regulations, all of the certification regulations."
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3257.923,3263.218,"I know they do, but I mean did the Fire Commission walk in there?"
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,3263.218,3263.358,Oh!
1978.77-752,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3273.077,3278.498,"That's what I want, now where does the parent go, they go to the Bishop?"
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,3278.498,3280.761,That is correct.
1978.77-752,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3357.166,3359.621,One more question before you sit down.
1978.77-752,1,21452,don_h_rueben,,3377.68,3388.497,"That's correct and the state -- the states only concern is secular, the state does not entangle itself by that kind of inquiry."
1978.77-752,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3388.497,3390.46,We'll resume at 1 o'clock.
