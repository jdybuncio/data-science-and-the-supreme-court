1971.70-5012,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.794,"First this morning in Number 70-5012, Milton against Wainwright."
1971.70-5012,0,37267,neil_p_rutledge,,13.703,17.133,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,1762.437,1765.612,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5012,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1861.342,1865.589,"Well, is there any question that he drove the car in the river?"
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,1865.589,1870.974,"Mr. Justice, there is no question except the meaning of what he said."
1971.70-5012,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1877.583,1881.82,"The confession that he drove the car in the river has nothing to do with murder, do you?"
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,1881.82,1886.106,"Mr. Justice, the State’s contention at the trial was he did not drive the car in the river."
1971.70-5012,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1889.035,1892.45,So how does this confession help you on that point?
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,1892.45,1904.457,"Well, in this case, he is saying in effect that he did drive it into river whereas at the trial I think it goes more of the question of credibility."
1971.70-5012,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2128.215,2132.028,"Was that the matter that the Court of Appeals never reached, is that not correct?"
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2132.028,2133.373,That is correct Your Honor.
1971.70-5012,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2145.379,2147.472,"No, no, you are not a petitioner."
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2147.472,2148.142,"No, I am --"
1971.70-5012,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2148.142,2149.951,You could do whatever you want to support the judgment.
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2149.951,2150.186,Right.
1971.70-5012,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2151.852,2154.681,"Well, he is not going to bring up the point to this harmless error, would he?"
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2154.681,2156.635,"No, I was not referring to that point, Your Honor."
1971.70-5012,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2159.347,2168.15,"Well, I am talking about what you are just beginning to address yourself to the proposition that this was harmless error, the admission of this confession even if the error was harmless, is that what you are going to say?"
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2168.15,2170.678,Yes.
1971.70-5012,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2170.678,2177.229,"That is the question, that is an issue that the Court of Appeal and the District Court did not reach, is that not correct?"
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2177.229,2182.667,Yes.
1971.70-5012,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2316.551,2324.552,"I take it, what you are arguing in effect is that this conviction might have been obtained without the use of the confession?"
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2324.552,2324.735,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-5012,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2324.735,2329.276,"In other words, it is harmless error in that sense?"
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2329.276,2330.494,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-5012,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2382.835,2389.425,"In your view, how many of these confessions were put in?"
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2396.38,2397.302,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-5012,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2397.302,2400.541,You began with the last one.
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2400.541,2407.592,Your Honor the Holmes and McClure was put in and put in detail and the Langford testimony was put in and put in detail.
1971.70-5012,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2455.685,2461.037,Are there any suggestions particularly as to the police in his testimony?
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2461.037,2461.071,Specifically --
1971.70-5012,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2461.071,2464.858,Or is just general as to all?
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2464.858,2473.665,"Your Honor, I think he did not separate the two confessions as he talked about confessions and their voluntariness."
1971.70-5012,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2473.665,2481.473,"What I mean, as he as a layman, would he not think that his talk with the policeman was voluntary?"
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2481.473,2485.055,"Well, I do not think that -- yes inherently he would think so."
1971.70-5012,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2493.66,2497.892,Why did the state kept it less then?
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2499.715,2501.704,Mr. Justice I had --
1971.70-5012,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2501.704,2503.0,(Voice Overlap) I have this in few parts.
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2506.599,2508.142,Mr. Justice I have no idea.
1971.70-5012,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2533.741,2553.074,"Mr. Olian, did you call our attention to any cases here in this Court where admitting an inadmissible confession had been held to be a harmless error?"
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2553.074,2560.04,"Your Honor, I cited Harrington and Chapman and I think that they talked about the proposition here that (Voice Overlap)."
1971.70-5012,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2560.04,2571.093,"No, what Chapman -- do you think either one of them held that an involuntary confession could be admitted then be held to be harmless error?"
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2571.093,2575.304,"Your Honor, first of all I am not saying it is involuntary."
1971.70-5012,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2575.304,2582.685,"I know but your proposition is that even if it were, these confessions were inadmissible, it was harmless error, do you admit them?"
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2582.685,2584.676,"Your Honor, I would make a distinction."
1971.70-5012,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2584.676,2587.875,"I mean, you would not have to be arguing harmless error, if they were voluntary?"
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2587.875,2599.049,"Well, I would make a distinction it seems to me in terms of the case law between a coerced confession and a confession which violates his right."
1971.70-5012,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2599.049,2599.532,I see.
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2599.532,2601.719,And I think it has to be one or the other.
1971.70-5012,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2601.719,2607.355,"I see, now would you say, let us assume the confession was involuntary --"
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2607.355,2608.595,In the sense of the coercion?
1971.70-5012,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2608.595,2609.335,Yes.
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2609.335,2611.426,Then I would not be arguing harmless error in that kind.
1971.70-5012,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.426,2611.843,I see.
1971.70-5012,1,32233,j_robert_olian,,2617.257,2620.434,"Yes, I think harmless error applies in that context."
1971.70-5012,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2620.434,2621.978,Would you know any –-
1971.70-5012,2,37267,neil_p_rutledge,,3741.694,3743.098,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-5012,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3743.098,3754.082,"Mr. Rutledge, you acted at the request of the Court and by appointment of the Court and we wish to thank you for your assistance to us and of course assistance to the client you represented."
1971.70-5012,2,37267,neil_p_rutledge,,3754.082,3757.116,"Thank You, Your Honor."
1971.70-5012,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3757.116,3759.076,The case is submitted.
