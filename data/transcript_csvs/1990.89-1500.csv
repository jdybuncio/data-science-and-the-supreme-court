1990.89-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.398,"We'll hear now in No. 89-1500, Business Guides, Inc. v. Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc.--"
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,51.395,55.118,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,126.475,129.577,"What does the term chief magistrate mean, Mr. Bomse?"
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,133.66,134.68,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,134.68,136.333,Pretty impressive title.
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,136.513,139.545,I'm sure he appreciates it.
1990.89-1500,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,226.521,252.319,"Well, Mr. Bomse, why isn't it consistent with the rule and with the deterrent purpose of the Rule 11 to impose a reasonable inquiry standard on parties when they have occasion to file with the court, for example, factual affidavits or declarations in support of a motion for a preliminary restraining order or an injunction?"
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,258.233,262.274,"Well, I think there are several reasons that we would suggest, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-1500,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.066,268.218,"The rule itself doesn't draw a distinction, does it?"
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,268.218,272.782,"--No, I think the rule itself is actually silent on this particular point."
1990.89-1500,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,290.904,305.424,"Well, I... you know, it's possible I think to conclude that what's reasonable for a party to make an inquiry might be somewhat different for what's reasonable for an attorney."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,309.284,316.641,"Well, I'm not sure, Justice O'Connor, whether you're speaking now to the text of the rule or to how this Court as a matter policy ought to interpret it."
1990.89-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,345.088,355.026,"Well, Mr. Bomse, when you get to the part that says the signature of any attorney or party constitutes a certificate by the signer."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,366.423,374.016,"I believe it refers to a party, Mr. Chief Justice, only in the context of a pro se party."
1990.89-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,374.016,376.889,How do you... certainly that's not clear from the language I just read.
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,376.889,387.056,"No, but I believe that if you look at the rule in its total context you will see that the reference above to a signer is only to a pro se party."
1990.89-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.247,393.13,xxx that you left out in your quotation in your brief unfortunately.
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,393.13,395.081,--I'm sorry.
1990.89-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.792,400.673,"No, no, but that... it would have made it clearer had you put it in there."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,408.37,408.721,--Yes.
1990.89-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,408.721,415.063,"And then it said a signing by an attorney or party, and what you're saying that reference to party refers back to the sentence that you left out."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,415.063,419.757,"You're surely right, both as to what the rule says and that it would have been better if we had put that sentence in."
1990.89-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.757,420.328,Right.
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,420.328,436.929,"But I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that in fact if you think about the way in which the process operates in the Federal courts, pleadings, motions, and other papers are not signed by parties at all, with the single exception of affidavits."
1990.89-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,458.443,462.898,"Well, but you concede that affidavits are filed by parties."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,462.898,463.496,--Yes.
1990.89-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,463.496,464.568,--represented parties.
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,464.568,465.639,I do concede that.
1990.89-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,473.163,475.594,"Yes, but this wasn't a summary judgment motion."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,475.594,488.013,"No, although I must say I cannot understand why the policy would be any different for an affidavit in support of an injunction on the one hand or an affidavit in support of a motion for summary judgment."
1990.89-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,488.013,494.758,"Well, the Rule 56 was in existence at the time that Rule 11 was modified to its present form."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,499.801,519.602,"Yes, although again, if one looks to the advisory committee note, you will find a reference to the fact... I think it's the very conclusion of those notes... that Rule 11 literally read would apply as well to discovery motions, although the advisory committee suggested that it was not intended to and rather that one should look to a different rule."
1990.89-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,555.707,563.862,Why isn't it possible to interpret Rule 11 as covering... it says pleading motion or other paper.
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,582.425,583.496,I think that is correct.
1990.89-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.496,587.079,And not with respect to general affidavits about any factual matters.
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,587.079,588.498,I would think that is correct.
1990.89-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.319,591.51,Have you argued that here?
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,591.51,594.943,"I'm not... no, I don't think we have argued that here."
1990.89-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,601.338,615.637,"Well, on that point, it seems to me that your argument concedes the proposition that there can be a Rule 11 violation by the client and not by the attorney."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,615.637,622.051,I believe there can be a Rule 11 violation by the client and not by the attorney.
1990.89-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,622.051,640.233,It would seem to me that based on your reading of the rule you could take the argument a step further and say that a predicate to a Rule 11 violation is a violation by the attorney when the party's represented.
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,649.64,654.543,"We don't, Justice Kennedy, and I'm not sure why that would necessarily follow."
1990.89-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,656.214,666.26,"Well, it seems to me it would necessary follow if you say that the purpose of Rule 11 is to control the conduct of attorneys as they control litigation."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,666.26,680.239,"--Well, it is certainly the purpose of Rule 11, as the first sentence of the advisory committee notes say, to control abuses in the signing of pleadings, which ordinarily will be by counsel."
1990.89-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,721.736,726.729,"Oh, I think it might be quite usual that clients might often mislead attorneys deliberately."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,726.729,728.902,I think... I hope not.
1990.89-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,728.902,739.087,But it seems to me that there are sanctions in 28 U.S.C. and in the law of malicious prosecution that cover that base without extending Rule 11 to do so.
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,740.549,750.755,"Well, I'm not... I'm not sure that we have to... in Rule 11 surely covers situations in which malicious prosecution or abuse of process actions could be brought."
1990.89-1500,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,952.497,957.75,"Well, in this... $13,000 worth of counsel fees on the other side to reveal it."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,959.781,969.568,"--Well, first of all, Justice Souter, of the 13,000, although I don't have a specific breakdown, most of it was expended actually in pursuing the sanctions."
1990.89-1500,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,986.147,991.092,"Well, isn't that only because they were all inextricably bound up with the request for temporary orders?"
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,991.092,999.407,"Well, if the temporary restraining order had been heard on its merits, there would have been an opportunity for counsel to appear and oppose."
1990.89-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1036.931,1039.413,"Mr. Bomse, it isn't just expenses."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1152.948,1153.278,You are.
1990.89-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.278,1168.468,"You might have a different rule for a person appearing as a witness than you have for a person who manages the litigation before the court, who is the attorney or acting as the attorney on his own behalf."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1180.496,1182.298,I quite agree.
1990.89-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1221.784,1228.307,"To say that there's a policy that witnesses may lie, I think misconceives it."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1240.824,1242.915,"--Yes, that's correct."
1990.89-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1242.915,1248.091,So I don't think it's correct to say that we have a policy that tolerates witnesses lying on the--
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1248.091,1253.603,"No, we... in fact we would have a policy that would be very strongly against that."
1990.89-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1264.401,1272.645,"--To say we are willing to tolerate it suggests that prosecutions are not available against witnesses who perjure themselves, and that simply isn't the case."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1282.753,1289.497,"--No, there is a remedy in the form of criminal sanctions, albeit there for intentional misconduct."
1990.89-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1291.348,1293.509,That lying is intentional misconduct.
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1293.509,1294.49,--So do I.
1990.89-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1381.608,1390.044,"Yes, by of course, this rule deals with written submissions where presumably the person has time to check the facts and so forth, so it's a special... specially limitative context."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1397.797,1398.669,"--Yes, there are two."
1990.89-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1404.292,1407.475,--Which was signed of course by the attorney and not by the client?
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1407.475,1414.348,"Which was signed by the attorney, although as, as it turned out there was a signature never referred to in any of the proceedings below."
1990.89-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1419.941,1421.623,So it's the motion to TRO is one.
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1421.623,1428.869,"And then second was the supplemental declaration and papers accompanying it, signed by Mr. Lamb, who was an employee of--"
1990.89-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1428.869,1430.28,And that's the... that's the affidavit.
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1430.28,1433.752,--That's the affidavit that we're concerned with here.
1990.89-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1433.752,1447.479,"Excuse me, with respect to both of these was the signature the company by somebody or... the verification on the complaint, was that verification by an individual or was it by literally a party?"
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1448.581,1465.171,"A verification is always an individual, but the form of verification that is used in Federal court where you have a corporate party does not state and is not required to state that I know the facts to be true, because that would be very difficult in many cases."
1990.89-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1469.565,1475.488,But I want to know was it signed Business Guides by somebody... it was signed... the individual's name?
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1475.488,1480.982,--It's may recollection that it was signed... I'm wrong.
1990.89-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1492.071,1492.99,By--
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1492.99,1494.272,--By J. Roger--
1990.89-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1494.272,1495.972,--So it was signed... it was verified by the party--
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1495.972,1496.623,"--Yes, although that--"
1990.89-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1496.623,1501.318,"--which is what this rule refers to, the party, not an employee of the party, which is the party."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1501.318,1501.845,--That is... that is true.
1990.89-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1505.388,1506.85,"Now, this latter affidavit--"
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1506.85,1507.83,--Yes.
1990.89-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1507.83,1509.292,--was not signed by Business Guides.
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1509.292,1509.662,No.
1990.89-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1509.662,1510.521,It was just signed by the individual.
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1510.521,1510.892,Of course.
1990.89-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1510.892,1512.244,So it was not signed by the party.
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1512.244,1513.914,It could not be.
1990.89-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1513.914,1518.208,"But if a party is a corporate party, a corporate party can't verify."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1521.631,1522.549,Of course.
1990.89-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1530.296,1531.756,"May I just... I'm sorry, but--"
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1531.756,1532.006,--Of course.
1990.89-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1532.006,1542.865,"--The sanction against the corporation as opposed to the original sanction against the law firm, which I know is later, was for signing for both the motion and supporting papers or just the latter?"
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1542.865,1543.883,"No, it was for both."
1990.89-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1543.883,1545.616,"Both, yeah."
1990.89-1500,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1545.616,1546.185,It was for both.
1990.89-1500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.582,1574.214,"Very well, Mr. Bomse."
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1575.845,1582.619,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1679.352,1684.176,"Mr. Shapiro, can I raise with you the question that Justice Scalia has been raising?"
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1697.224,1697.655,Correct.
1990.89-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1697.655,1703.869,So does the rule encompass any other papers than those which a lawyer must sign?
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1703.869,1707.161,I believe by its very terms it must be read as incorporating other papers.
1990.89-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1707.161,1709.271,"It must be read as, but the plain language--"
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1709.271,1711.562,"Well, I believe the words of the rule when it speaks of"
1990.89-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1718.788,1721.58,--Even if they need not be signed by an attorney?
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1721.58,1722.742,"Correct, such as--"
1990.89-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1722.742,1726.263,Because the first sentence just refers to papers that shall be signed by an attorney?
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1726.263,1726.793,--Yes.
1990.89-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1726.793,1731.888,"So you're saying that the first sentence is, is not as broad as the rest of the rule?"
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1731.888,1733.568,"I am saying that, yes."
1990.89-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1748.788,1752.331,So that every affidavit must be signed by the attorney?
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1752.331,1753.721,"No, no."
1990.89-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1763.148,1766.079,"Well, why, if other paper means every document filed with the court?"
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1766.079,1781.25,"--Because I believe when drafting the rule the framers of the rule had in mind the fact that certain documents initiating a legal proceeding such as a complaint, certain other documents such as motions, must be signed by counsel or by a party appearing without counsel."
1990.89-1500,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1796.64,1808.959,"Well, in any event... in any event here I gather they... the documents in question were signed by the attorney as well as by the party?"
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1808.959,1811.21,--The complaint itself was signed by both.
1990.89-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1820.596,1827.799,And in your view the Rule 11 sanction could be sustained based simply on the complaint?
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1827.799,1847.704,I think it clear from some of the court's previous opinions that it is frequently loathe to hold a party responsible for misconduct of a lawyer with which it had no participation and that raises the possibility of a complaint being signed by a lawyer in violation of the rule but without any wrong on the part of the client.
1990.89-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1848.894,1855.8,"But in this... in this action what do you think constitute the gravamen of the Rule 11 violation, which papers?"
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1855.8,1869.346,"--The original complaint and the temporary restraining order package if you will including the moving papers and the affidavit, together with the supplemental affidavit of Michael Lamb, and as I will get to in a moment--"
1990.89-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1869.346,1876.312,If any one of those papers were admitted would they be... were excluded from our discussion would there still be a Rule 11 violation?
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1876.312,1889.92,"--I don't it would be possible to exclude the complaint itself from the discussion, and that was a document signed both by the party and by the attorney and it posited a case based on false, totally false evidence."
1990.89-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1894.665,1906.201,I thought that it was found below that the attorney was not... was not guilty of a Rule 11 violation with respect to the filing of the complaint.
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1906.201,1907.892,With respect to the initial filing of the complaint--
1990.89-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.892,1908.213,Right.
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1908.213,1909.074,--yes.
1990.89-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1909.074,1911.845,The attorney was not... was there a finding that the client was?
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1911.845,1912.857,"Yes, directly."
1990.89-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1967.872,1968.643,"Of course, that's separate opinion--"
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1968.643,1974.377,--is the worse that could happen is the economic death of the party against whom the temporary restraining order is sought based on that false declaration.
1990.89-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1974.377,1978.738,--That separate opinion was not exactly overwhelming indorsed by the rest of the Court.
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,1978.968,1984.181,But I think its words still have much wisdom to them--
1990.89-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1986.124,1989.186,"Please, just so I'm sure about it."
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2002.413,2008.959,The district court found and the Ninth Circuit affirmed two violations of Rule 11 on the part of the party.
1990.89-1500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2124.133,2134.472,"Mr. Shapiro, are you suggesting that the rule itself does not speak directly to whether or not it should be a negligence or objective standard or a subjective standard?"
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2134.472,2141.945,I believe that the fair of the rule and interpretation of the rule using standard methods of interpretation leads to that conclusion.
1990.89-1500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2160.538,2172.436,"So where the rule says if a pleading motion or other papers signed in violation of this rule, you don't think that says one way or the other whether it should be subjective or objective?"
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2172.436,2181.91,The inference I draw from the words the Court has just read and the words of the rule in toto is that the objective standard is the apt one for everyone.
1990.89-1500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2181.91,2184.744,"Well, I would think so, too, because the preceding sentence says"
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2191.216,2195.0,"I very definitely agree with Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2240.951,2263.285,"When a civil litigant files an action with the court is not an exercise of the right of petition under the First Amendment, and if so, do you know of any authority which holds a party monetarily liable based on an objective standard for the exercise of a right of petition?"
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2267.516,2268.958,"No, I don't, although I think I could posit one."
1990.89-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2310.636,2323.224,"Yes, yes, but what you're doing is you're saying that there's a liability based on an objective standard judged by the content of what is spoken."
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2323.224,2324.424,"--No, I think--"
1990.89-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2324.424,2326.226,And I think that's a far-reaching rule.
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2326.226,2335.581,"--In this... in this instance, based on the content, only if that content is characterized properly as false as having been subscribed to--"
1990.89-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2335.581,2336.502,Under an objective standard?
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2336.502,2337.143,--Yes.
1990.89-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2357.897,2362.399,You concede that filing a civil law suit constitutes petitioning the Government for redress of grievances?
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2362.399,2365.28,--I believe an argument to that effect could be made.
1990.89-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2371.915,2375.668,"You, you don't think grievances mean grievances against the Government?"
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2375.668,2377.197,I think that's the intent.
1990.89-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.858,2380.831,You think it could be first to petition of the Government for redress of your grievance against a third party?
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2380.831,2386.574,"--Normally, that's what I say, I don't know of a single case that applies it in that context, but I would concede that one could make that argument."
1990.89-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2640.883,2643.076,Excuse me.
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2673.625,2674.566,"I would agree, yes."
1990.89-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2674.566,2678.439,And would that apply for complaints?
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2683.773,2706.065,"No, there is not, but I do believe that the rule itself in its application, as articulated by various courts, has said that where the rule is violated because the attorney signed the complaint and the attorney did not make a reasonable inquiry... nor did his client... sanctions may be imposed on the attorney or the client or both."
1990.89-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2706.065,2706.486,Quite so.
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2709.237,2709.808,Yes.
1990.89-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2709.808,2715.863,"--but the client didn't, and thereby misled the attorney, there's no problem."
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2718.524,2724.819,"Assuming... yes, assuming an objective standard for the client and no subjective bad faith client to implicate the court's inherent power, yes."
1990.89-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2724.819,2727.53,And assuming the client didn't sign the paper?
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2727.53,2728.622,Correct.
1990.89-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2728.622,2740.621,"So, in this case if the court... district court, were wrong and we stipulate that there was no Rule 11 violation for filing the complaint and signing the complaint, then case has to fail?"
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2740.621,2742.631,"No, I don't agree that that's necessary."
1990.89-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2742.631,2747.214,"Well, why isn't that so, because what, what paper did the attorney sign other than the complaint?"
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2747.214,2754.858,"Well, the attorney signed the complaint and all the other moving papers in connection with the temporary restraining application, save and except the affidavit."
1990.89-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2786.248,2788.639,"Well, what were the papers, other than the complaint, that the attorney signed?"
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2788.639,2804.141,"Other than the complaint, the application for temporary restraining order of which the affidavit was a supporting piece, the legal memorandum, the application itself, the order for sealing of these records so that the defendant could not see them."
1990.89-1500,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2804.141,2804.511,All right.
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2821.221,2824.343,"I don't agree with that, Justice White, no."
1990.89-1500,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2824.343,2825.064,You don't suggest that?
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2825.064,2825.665,"No, I don't."
1990.89-1500,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2826.506,2833.299,Even if the... even if the... even if only the attorney is blameworthy?
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2833.299,2839.833,"If only the attorney is at all blameworthy, then I would suggest that it is only the attorney who should be sanctioned."
1990.89-1500,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2839.833,2852.613,"Well, it should be, but the rule seems to say that the court can impose a... whenever there is a violation by the attorney, can impose an appropriate sanction on the attorney or his client."
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2852.613,2854.504,"Well, I think that the court--"
1990.89-1500,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2854.504,2858.246,Maybe... maybe the sanctions could be different for the two.
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2858.246,2876.548,"--They certainly could be different for the two and I think the drafters also contemplated the circumstances in which the attorney's signature violates the rule because the complaint is frivolous, but the client provided the facts, and the court may determine that it is those facts which make it a frivolous complaint."
1990.89-1500,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2882.603,2893.039,"Well, Mr. Shapiro, the rule, though, speaks in terms of imposing sanctions only on people who have signed the relevant papers."
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2900.145,2907.638,"As I read the rule, Justice O'Connor, it is without doubt that the signer can be sanctioned."
1990.89-1500,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2924.13,2950.256,"Well, that's a curious interpretation of the language of the rule, isn't it, which speaks only in terms of if a paper is signed in violation of the rule, then the court may impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party or both... or both... an appropriate sanction?"
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2955.45,2959.503,I think that in that sense that the rule may be somewhat ambiguous.
1990.89-1500,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2993.864,2995.845,"In any event, both have signed."
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,2995.845,3004.491,"Yes, I was going to say, here, fortunately we do not have to resolve that apparent ambiguity or question in the rule, because here it was the party who signed some of the key documents."
1990.89-1500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3004.491,3008.173,Unless... excuse me.
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,3010.215,3010.816,Correct.
1990.89-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3019.972,3024.664,"Well, it really... it really was signed by the party technically, absolutely technically."
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,3026.346,3028.196,That is absolutely correct.
1990.89-1500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3028.196,3033.581,If you have a corporation everything is done by the party will be done by some employee of the corporation.
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,3033.581,3034.25,It has to be.
1990.89-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3037.182,3045.488,Where you say... you just said a moment ago that there's no problem since the party did sign the complaint.
1990.89-1500,1,37292,neil_l_shapiro,,3064.941,3080.091,"Well, one might view it that way, but I read that rule as saying that anyone who signs a document which is going to be filed with the Federal court must make the reasonable inquiry called for by the rule, even if that document needn't be signed by that party."
1990.89-1500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3181.138,3183.339,"Thank you, Mr. Shapiro."
1990.89-1500,2,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,3186.822,3186.982,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3256.589,3258.849,"How do you... how do you deal with the language,"
1990.89-1500,2,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,3267.375,3271.429,"It is precisely what I'm trying... trying to do, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-1500,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3392.258,3399.261,"And is that the case when client is representing himself as well, so that you have nobody to go against for simply no reasonable inquiry?"
1990.89-1500,2,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,3404.015,3405.144,Only when you're going behind the lawyer.
1990.89-1500,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3419.423,3420.785,"Thank you, Mr. Bomse."
