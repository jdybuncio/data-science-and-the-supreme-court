1973.72-1176,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,45.658,"We’ll hear arguments next in number 72-1176, North Dakota Board of Pharmacy against Snyder."
1973.72-1176,0,16464,a_william_lucas,,50.61,57.748,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, I am William Lucas representing the petitioner in this action."
1973.72-1176,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,167.054,174.873,"Mr. Lucas, before you go any further, my understanding of the procedural history of the case may be a little bit different to yours."
1973.72-1176,0,16464,a_william_lucas,,186.853,187.678,That’s correct.
1973.72-1176,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,187.678,205.759,And that was on the basis that the constitutional provision that the North Dakota Law violated the constitutional provision and that the Pharmacy Board’s conclusion that the drug store did not meet the space requirements was also invalid for the first summaries.
1973.72-1176,0,16464,a_william_lucas,,209.773,215.15,"Well, there is the ownership compliance problem and then the physical safeguard problem."
1973.72-1176,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,215.15,224.087,"And then, when that was appealed by you to the Supreme Court of North Dakota, the Supreme Court of North Dakota affirmed on the constitutional issue but reversed the District Court."
1973.72-1176,0,16464,a_william_lucas,,228.721,229.586,That’s correct Your Honor.
1973.72-1176,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,233.362,239.745,Do you think this is a final judgment then for purposes of our jurisdiction?
1973.72-1176,0,16464,a_william_lucas,,239.745,243.458,"Well, it was final in regard to the constitutional question."
1973.72-1176,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,249.103,261.118,"And I suppose the Pharmacy Board could fine against Snyder’s on that issue and they could lose -- they could be denied the license and there’d be no more case, would there?"
1973.72-1176,0,16464,a_william_lucas,,261.118,262.26,"Well, it would be appealed."
1973.72-1176,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,267.269,269.741,"But, very likely not on a constitutional basis?"
1973.72-1176,0,16464,a_william_lucas,,269.741,269.832,No.
1973.72-1176,1,36825,mart_r_vogel,,1886.138,1890.58,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1176,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1919.304,1922.137,That was in response to the Supreme Court’s order?
1973.72-1176,1,36825,mart_r_vogel,,1922.137,1926.071,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1176,2,16464,a_william_lucas,,3524.132,3525.652,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1176,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3571.812,3572.441,Thank you gentlemen.
