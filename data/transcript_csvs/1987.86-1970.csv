1987.86-1970,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.358,"We will hear argument first this morning in Number 86-1970, Mississippi Power & Light Company v. Mississippi Ex Rel."
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,13.841,17.772,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1970,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,188.287,197.232,"Mr. Lee, I am anxious to ask you a question or two about this case."
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,217.518,217.867,That is correct.
1987.86-1970,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,217.867,226.304,"And that application for a certificate of convenience and necessity was made to the State of Mississippi, which granted it."
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,226.304,227.824,Again correct.
1987.86-1970,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,227.824,250.959,"Now, what if a state refuses the permission to build and yet the plant is built elsewhere and under the system's agreement some allocation is made to a Mississippi utility company that is part of the system, and FERC says the rates are just and reasonable."
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,262.968,265.779,In the context of an integrated system such as this one is.
1987.86-1970,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.779,268.76,Even if they had denied the permission?
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,268.76,269.28,That is correct.
1987.86-1970,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,301.752,318.073,Is there any indication that FERC ever decided that this allocation was prudent and that the construction of the facility was prudent?
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,318.073,326.969,"We believe, for reasons stated in our brief, and for reasons stated in FERC's brief itself, that the answer to that question is yes."
1987.86-1970,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,326.969,331.851,"It didn't do it in so many words, did it?"
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,331.851,335.547,That is correct.
1987.86-1970,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,365.827,370.38,"I don't see that follows as the night the day, as you apparently think it does."
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,370.38,378.026,"Well, let me just give you two factors for your consideration, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-1970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,418.992,423.895,It isn't the allocation that is the source of the controversy here.
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,445.389,450.083,That brings us to the core legal question that is raised by this case.
1987.86-1970,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,544.567,561.027,"The thing that is so basically troublesome, though, is that under your view, admittedly the Federal Power Act does not let FERC decide in the first instance to review generating facilities if a new one is going to be built."
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,583.881,584.352,"Oh, no."
1987.86-1970,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,684.92,691.715,"Mr. Lee, you are really arguing for a very drastic departure from the traditional method of regulating utilities."
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,703.533,704.023,No.
1987.86-1970,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,704.023,705.253,I think you are.
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,712.819,735.623,"Well, prudence is simply not an issue in the one narrow instance in which you have an integrated system such as we have here, serving several different states in which you have several different power sources, and all of those have to be allocated among the separate states by some governmental entity."
1987.86-1970,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,765.433,770.718,"Mr. Lee, aren't all these nuclear plants serving more than one state?"
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,770.718,772.528,"In most instances, they are."
1987.86-1970,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,772.528,773.019,Sure.
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,790.932,799.838,And the way they can protect themselves is precisely by what Section 206 of the Federal Power Act says.
1987.86-1970,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.902,837.314,"Mr. Lee, can I interrupt you?"
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,837.314,837.494,Yes.
1987.86-1970,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,837.494,850.893,"It seems to me that the question of prudence breaks down into two or three different issues as to whether the percentage of the total power goes to the state is prudent, whether the wholesale rate is prudent, and there is also a third point that I wanted to focus on."
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,863.362,873.779,"Well, at the time that the original investment, that the original certificate is issued, then the state can take whatever factors into account it wants to in deciding whether or not to--"
1987.86-1970,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,873.779,876.453,"And in this particular case, the plant is in Mississippi?"
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,876.453,877.362,--That is correct.
1987.86-1970,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,877.362,881.195,And they did get a certificate from the Mississippi Commission?
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,881.195,881.335,That is correct.
1987.86-1970,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,881.335,889.869,So do you contend that that decided the portion of the prudence issue that relates to whether or not there shall be a plant of this kind at all?
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,889.869,895.473,"Well, it determines whether or not there would be an authorization for the building of the plant."
1987.86-1970,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,932.448,941.004,"Mr. Lee, you are proceeding along the line that the state has, you mentioned earlier that the state would be parochial and seek to defend its own interests."
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,960.609,971.007,That was exactly the issue that was before this Court two terms ago in Nantahala when North Carolina wanted to do just exactly that.
1987.86-1970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,982.918,983.796,I don't understand that.
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1028.563,1033.204,"If the State of Mississippi says that it doesn't want to go into it in the first place, it can of course turn down the plant."
1987.86-1970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1049.485,1051.027,What if the plant is being built in another state?
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1055.559,1056.791,That is correct.
1987.86-1970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1065.258,1067.901,But FERC's interest is in the whole four-state region.
1987.86-1970,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1078.346,1086.921,"Well, there is no more reason to assume that that issue can be decided any better by a court than it can by an administrative agency."
1987.86-1970,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1096.651,1098.461,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
1987.86-1970,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1100.224,1104.516,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1970,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1190.246,1199.641,"Mr. Cohen, I thought Mr. Lee, in response to Justice O'Connor's question, said it could be reasonably argued either way whether FERC had decided this question or not."
1987.86-1970,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1199.641,1224.178,--I think that FERC has decided it only in the sense that the issue was not raised and some parts of the issue have probably been decided by the failure of the state which participated in the FERC proceeding to raise the issue.
1987.86-1970,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1229.321,1240.93,"You say then that FERC may have quote, ""decided"" close quote, as you would use that term, it, simply by doing nothing when nothing was presented to it on the question?"
1987.86-1970,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1240.93,1250.014,We are talking about a potential challenge to a wholesale rate charged by a wholesaler for transactions in interstate commerce.
1987.86-1970,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1279.686,1281.927,"Is that presently open, in FERC's view?"
1987.86-1970,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1281.927,1292.763,--The question that I am explicitly declining to answer is the extent to which such challenges are precluded.
1987.86-1970,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1340.737,1361.073,"Mr. Cohen, explain to me how the Federal Power Act should be interpreted in this fashion to permit in effect an end run around the omission in the Power Act of authority in FERC to decide in the first instance whether a generating plant should be built."
1987.86-1970,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1361.073,1365.534,I don't think it is an end run.
1987.86-1970,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1365.534,1366.696,"Well, why isn't it?"
1987.86-1970,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1374.542,1383.168,"But it can... no, it cannot insist that the plant be built if the state wants to say no."
1987.86-1970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1405.121,1410.707,What about my prudence question?
1987.86-1970,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1416.23,1416.521,Yes.
1987.86-1970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1416.521,1416.932,Who decides that?
1987.86-1970,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1416.932,1423.456,And FERC explicitly decided at least part of that question.
1987.86-1970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1476.413,1482.788,But that could be based on the fact that MP&L threw itself in with the deal a number of years ago.
1987.86-1970,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1482.788,1482.968,--Yes.
1987.86-1970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1482.968,1484.991,And FERC is just saying a deal is a deal.
1987.86-1970,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1496.487,1511.217,"Talking about a decision in 19551 to create this system, a decision which I believe Mississippi would have had to approve the participation of its utility in."
1987.86-1970,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1706.857,1707.748,"Thank you, Mr. Cohen."
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,1709.57,1715.274,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1970,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.41,1829.611,Could Mississippi have stopped that?
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,1841.66,1842.32,"No, sir."
1987.86-1970,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1858.413,1859.432,But didn't?
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,1859.432,1860.894,But it did not.
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1861.304,1872.132,"Well, what if it rejected it but a neighboring state granted it, so the facility was purchased, and in fact, it's an integrated system?"
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,1872.132,1890.715,"Your Honor, the question raises the conflict between the FERC jurisdiction to rule on these kind of multi-state agreements with the state's rights to protect itself through prudence inquiries when those rates come to Mississippi as retail rates."
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1890.715,1895.089,"I suppose some systemwide review makes sense, though, doesn't it?"
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,1895.089,1898.392,"Well, I think it does, at a wholesale level, Your Honor."
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1898.392,1900.623,And that's what FERC does.
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,1900.623,1902.593,FERC did so in this case.
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1902.593,1902.793,Right.
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,1902.793,1904.095,Or claims to have done so.
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1904.095,1904.406,Right.
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,1904.406,1911.147,But it did not do anything with regard to the prudency of the retail rats which are those paid by the ultimate consumer.
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1926.788,1931.603,"Well, the effect might be to veto what FERC has done, in effect."
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,1931.603,1934.766,Mississippi cannot veto what FERC has done.
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1935.647,1939.269,But the practical result of what you are urging might be just that.
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,1939.269,1953.049,"Your Honor, we would disagree in that the practical result would be to establish whether Mississippi Power & Light was prudent in its undertakings as a retail seller of power to the ultimate consumer."
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1953.049,1963.344,"Well, FERC has required that Mississippi Power & Light pay for one third of the nuclear power that is generated."
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,1963.344,1964.826,That is correct.
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1964.826,1966.779,So they are going to have to do that no matter what.
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,1966.779,1967.54,That is correct.
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1967.54,1976.077,And you say Mississippi can now make a determination that they can pay for it but none of that cost can be recouped?
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,1976.077,1977.488,That is correct.
1987.86-1970,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2139.397,2147.101,"What action, if any, did the Mississippi Corporation Commission take in 1981 when it found out about this?"
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2147.101,2148.413,It took no action then.
1987.86-1970,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2373.088,2379.762,Did the State of Mississippi attempt to litigate these kind of questions before the FERC?
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2379.762,2380.864,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-1970,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2423.702,2425.194,"May I interrupt you, Mr. Maxey?"
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2425.194,2425.515,"--Yes, sir."
1987.86-1970,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2425.515,2447.681,"Supposing that it appeared during the FERC proceedings that they had spent $100 million on gold doorknobs, to use your opponent's example, and that was, although the whole project might be perfectly wise and prudent, that particular expenditure was imprudent and should not be incorporated into the rate base either for wholesale rates or retail rates."
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2454.797,2455.298,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1970,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2457.731,2458.31,Yes.
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2459.221,2459.712,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1970,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2459.712,2464.046,So you could have at least argued some kinds of prudence issues?
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2464.046,2465.107,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1970,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2465.107,2466.568,But you tell me you didn't.
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2468.948,2469.149,"No, sir."
1987.86-1970,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2478.398,2484.551,"Then why wouldn't Mississippi have an interest even at the wholesale level in saying look, half this plant is totally wasted money."
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2493.159,2494.89,--That just wasn't done.
1987.86-1970,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2494.89,2495.611,It just wasn't done.
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2497.774,2498.944,"Well, it could have been done."
1987.86-1970,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2507.812,2517.499,"But if a litigant raises the issue and says look, this is just a lot of water in this plant that we should take out of the capital costs, certainly the Commission would review that, I would think."
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2517.499,2518.731,"I would think so, too, Your Honor."
1987.86-1970,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2546.069,2557.116,"In rising above it it has to consider the arguments made by for example the Mississippi Commission which might say well, look at all this waste here and there you could make your arguments on this point."
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2558.428,2558.628,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2564.562,2577.761,"Mr. Maxey, and I guess you also clearly litigated before FERC how much, what quantity of power should be allocated to each state out of this plant?"
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2577.761,2579.454,"Yes, Ma'am, absolutely."
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2579.454,2582.436,"Clearly, the quantity issue was litigated."
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2582.436,2582.776,Yes.
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2582.776,2585.079,Along with price and costs.
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2585.079,2590.275,The principal issue was what allocation was coming to each state.
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2593.407,2600.312,"So the question is whether the state now has to take the quantity that FERC said it would have to take, and that was litigated?"
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2600.312,2620.124,"Well, it was litigated in the sense that each state was trying to get an allocation that was most suitable to them at the time or at least I think each state was trying to get the least amount it could take so as to avoid the high cost that would ultimately be passed on if all of it were passed on."
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2620.124,2643.652,"Now, if it were lower cost power being distributed, and that had been litigated before FERC, and this was the lowest cost power that was available, I guess you agree that Nantahala would preclude you from now saying the state can order a different quantity to be sold to it?"
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2643.652,2650.658,We don't read Nantahala with the same reading that the other side does.
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2650.658,2653.538,Did you understand my question?
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2653.538,2653.699,Yes.
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2654.26,2670.332,Suppose that this power that we're talking about turned out to be the lowest cost power rather than the highest and FERC had litigated the quantity and price question as it did here.
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2681.319,2681.949,"Oh, yes."
1987.86-1970,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2681.949,2683.131,"Oh, you do?"
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2685.405,2690.587,"Nantahala says, had before it a different set of facts."
1987.86-1970,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2874.592,2876.605,"Mr. Maxey, could I ask you another question?"
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2883.711,2884.432,"--No, sir."
1987.86-1970,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2891.948,2909.101,"Theoretically, then, I suppose you could find that failure to make a proper readjustment, after Three-Mile Island and so forth and so on, that there is a certain portion of the costs that is imprudent and therefore that the rate base for retail purposes would be different than the rate base for wholesale purposes."
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2909.909,2910.44,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1970,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2910.44,2911.151,I see.
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,2917.078,2920.127,"Well, there are a number of ways, yes, sir, that that could be accomplished."
1987.86-1970,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2985.65,3008.586,"Is it fair to say, Mr. Maxey, that all of the arguments that Mississippi wishes to present now with reference to prudence could have been made before FERC even though FERC is being asked to draw a different conclusion than the Mississippi Regulatory Commission would be?"
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,3008.586,3018.291,"Your Honor, I don't think that there is any rule of law that would have kept Mississippi from making these presentations to the FERC."
1987.86-1970,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3065.955,3074.272,Would you be bound by FERC's determination if you had raised those issues at the FERC level seeking to effect wholesale prices?
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,3080.038,3089.243,"Your Honor, I suspect that the opposing side would raise some defense like collateral estoppel if you had attempted to take both bites at the apple."
1987.86-1970,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3089.243,3090.024,I'm sure they would.
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,3092.357,3096.631,"I don't know the answer to that, Your Honor."
1987.86-1970,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3096.631,3103.586,"Your answer has to be no, because you are saying that you have a right to present those arguments to the State Commission regardless of what the Federal body does."
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,3107.19,3118.469,"Well, it is the position that the roles are dual and that they sometimes overlap or appear to overlap, but the same evidence presented with regard to the prudency at the wholesale level--"
1987.86-1970,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.469,3127.866,"You are arguing it could be prudent at the wholesale level but you can still say, Mississippi is still free to say it is imprudent at the retail level."
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,3127.866,3128.273,"--Yes, sir."
1987.86-1970,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3128.273,3129.255,I understand your position.
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,3129.255,3129.796,That's absolutely--
1987.86-1970,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3129.796,3134.05,So there would not be a res adjudicata bar if your view is correct?
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,3134.05,3135.73,"--No, sir, we would argue that it would not."
1987.86-1970,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3167.634,3178.981,"Do you know of any case, Mr. Maxey, in which FERC has denied an element of wholesale rates on the basis that the investment was imprudent?"
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,3181.002,3182.254,Not to my knowledge.
1987.86-1970,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3182.254,3190.571,Have they ever said in any of their opinions that they had the authority to do it?
1987.86-1970,2,31937,john_l_maxey_ii,,3193.493,3202.198,"I think I'm familiar with decisions where the FERC says it has the authority to consider prudence, yes, sir."
1987.86-1970,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3467.123,3469.805,"Thank you, Mr. Maxey."
1987.86-1970,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3471.688,3490.2,"First, I would like to just clarify that every single one of these prudence issues could be raised before FERC, and also, that FERC can and does reject increases in the wholesale rate base on the basis that the costs are imprudently acquired."
1987.86-1970,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3594.084,3597.065,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
