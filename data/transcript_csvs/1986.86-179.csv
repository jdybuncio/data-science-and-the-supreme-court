1986.86-179,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,19.045,"We will hear arguments this morning in No. 86-179, Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints against Christine J. Amos; and in No. 86-401, United States against Christine J. Amos."
1986.86-179,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,57.003,59.955,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-179,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,266.173,270.641,"Mr. Lee, if I may inquire about one matter."
1986.86-179,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,281.766,282.966,--That is correct.
1986.86-179,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,282.966,291.872,"Now, what about the application of the statute to profit-making businesses of churches?"
1986.86-179,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,304.965,307.333,"I do, Justice O'Connor, for this reason."
1986.86-179,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,374.693,380.613,"Well, I think it's a much more difficult choice, if applied to a profit-making business."
1986.86-179,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,380.613,383.751,There is no question; there is no question that it is a more difficult choice.
1986.86-179,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,634.562,635.58,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
1986.86-179,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,643.234,648.572,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1986.86-179,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.939,1018.645,"Mr. Reynolds, as I understand your argument, it would support a total exemption from Title 7, not just from the religious prohibition; would it not?"
1986.86-179,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1035.424,1040.077,I think that would certainly implicate different considerations.
1986.86-179,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1059.139,1071.447,"I understand that but what I'm saying is, as I understand the argument you're making, Congress could have granted religious organizations a complete exemption from Title 7's other prohibitions and accomplished all the purposes you are describing now--"
1986.86-179,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1071.447,1072.549,Congress could have done that.
1986.86-179,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1072.549,1076.767,"--And therefore, it would have been a perfectly permissible exemption."
1986.86-179,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1076.767,1080.302,Under the First Amendment.
1986.86-179,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.302,1080.985,Under the reasoning that you advanced.
1986.86-179,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1080.985,1088.558,"Right, under the religious clauses."
1986.86-179,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1161.939,1163.206,"Thank you, Mr. Reynolds."
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1167.593,1171.711,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1986.86-179,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1189.856,1192.791,This is the first time the facts have been mentioned.
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1192.791,1198.278,"It's quite true, the Government and the Church want nothing to do with the facts, Justice Blackmun."
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1217.09,1220.542,That would have been perfectly okay until what year?
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1220.542,1242.224,"That would have been perfectly okay... well, it would have been lawful under Federal law until 1964 and, Justice Scalia, what we did in 1964, what the Civil Rights Act of 1964 represents is a repudiation of a lot of the past."
1986.86-179,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1242.224,1251.83,"Do you say that once Congress has enacted a law such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it can never retreat?"
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1253.449,1257.067,"I don't make that broad a statement, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1278.164,1281.266,It wasn't Congress that fired this man; was it?
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1281.266,1285.401,"That, essentially, is the Government's argument."
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1345.959,1346.509,"Now, wait a minute."
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1378.196,1381.465,"Justice Scalia, I do not accept that view."
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1402.127,1407.115,Could discrimination on the basis of religion be eliminated from the Civil Rights Act?
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1409.315,1412.417,"I'm not sure at this day and age that it could, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1417.754,1425.16,"Congress cannot allow private individuals to discriminate on the basis of it at all, even if they do it uniformly for everybody."
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1425.16,1426.743,I think it's a much tougher case.
1986.86-179,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1427.46,1429.712,What would make it so difficult?
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1439.4,1448.858,--I think you have the sort of a problem this Court dealt with the Reitman versus Mulkey case and that the Minnesota Supreme Court recently dealt with in--
1986.86-179,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1448.858,1450.925,That's a ratchet.
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1450.925,1452.76,--It's not a ratchet.
1986.86-179,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1462.433,1468.487,"But then if Congress changes its mind, that's a far better judge of what the nation accepts than what a Court says."
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1471.406,1477.259,We are not dealing with whether Congress could eliminate Title 7 tomorrow.
1986.86-179,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1564.817,1569.269,I don't think the Catholic squash pro has tenure; does he?
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1569.269,1570.402,Beg your pardon?
1986.86-179,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1570.402,1576.791,"The Catholic squash pro does not have tenure, he could be fired tomorrow, as I understand it, if they found a good Mormon squash player."
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1578.575,1580.91,"Your Honor, I don't think he could."
1986.86-179,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1580.91,1582.427,"A good enough one, I should say."
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1582.427,1585.262,I honestly do not think he could and the notion or--
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.262,1586.38,Or even a bad one.
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1587.43,1588.932,"--No, no."
1986.86-179,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1607.144,1618.702,"No, but all I'm suggesting is, it seems to me the legal issue is precisely the same, whether you look at the Catholic and say he could be fired to be replaced by a Mormon, or look at the Mormon and say he could be fired because he doesn't tithe."
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1619.368,1620.702,"--I fully agree, Justice Stevens."
1986.86-179,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1631.142,1634.461,"--Mr. Watkiss, may I put it very simply?"
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1664.447,1668.634,I need to know what kind of activity we're talking about here.
1986.86-179,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1668.634,1672.002,We're talking about employees from the janitor to the--
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1672.002,1673.852,I know but in what sort of capacity?
1986.86-179,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1691.348,1693.166,--Could you just take a simple example?
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1694.766,1695.252,"--Yes, sir."
1986.86-179,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1695.252,1697.502,Somewhere here in Washington.
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1702.106,1702.789,Right.
1986.86-179,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1702.789,1706.491,Let's say it discovers a janitor who is not an Episcopalian.
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1712.477,1713.446,In the church?
1986.86-179,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1713.446,1713.829,In the church.
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1713.829,1715.329,I don't think it would.
1986.86-179,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1715.329,1716.898,"Well, what's the difference?"
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1716.898,1739.314,"The difference is that the activities of the house of worship itself and the activities of religious schools are both, in common understanding and in the precedents of this Court and, indeed, in Title 7, recognized for what they are."
1986.86-179,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1790.763,1803.054,"Well, now, Mr. Watkiss, you're dealing here, though, with a... the production of religious clothing for members of the LDS Church."
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1838.477,1841.346,"--I think marginally is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1986.86-179,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1925.202,1926.635,"Well, we have an as applied challenge here."
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1926.635,1927.152,--Absolutely.
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1929.254,1946.132,Don't you think it's reasonable to... or it's a reasonable judgment to make that whatever a religious organization is doing not for profit but gratis is somehow in furtherance of its reason for being?
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1957.756,1958.289,"--Well, it's not--"
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.289,1963.041,"However... you know... and that's their judgment rather than mine, isn't it?"
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,1963.041,1965.66,--It's not gratis.
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1996.564,1998.164,0 xxx.
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2015.776,2039.625,"There is no contention... the district court found as a matter of fact, and he was right... there's no contention that there's a sincerely held religious belief requiring the running of the gym; there's no sincerely held religious belief requiring that Mormons take exercise in a church run gym; and there's no sincerely held religious belief requiring that the employees of that gym be Mormons."
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2041.627,2043.01,Is that right or wrong?
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2043.01,2045.279,That is clearly compelled on this record.
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2046.397,2050.349,"Well, to figure that out, I have to study the Book of Mormon, I suppose, and--"
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2050.349,2051.315,"No, absolutely not."
1986.86-179,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2095.828,2099.966,--xxx motion for summary judgment that the case went off on?
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2099.966,2107.686,"--They filed a document, Mr. Chief Justice, that was styled, motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment."
1986.86-179,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2120.195,2123.397,"Well, where did the findings that he made come in, then?"
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2126.099,2126.883,Absolutely.
1986.86-179,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2137.824,2142.776,"Well, but then we don't have any clearly... clearly erroneous standard of review here."
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2145.228,2146.345,I think that's right.
1986.86-179,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2146.345,2150.982,--On a motion for summary judgment you don't ordinarily have fact finding that's reviewed on the clearly erroneous--
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2150.982,2155.785,"Well, to the extent... Justice Scalia was asking me whether those findings were correct."
1986.86-179,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2167.843,2172.878,--But those findings merely went to the proposition of whether the operation of the gym was a religious activity.
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2184.453,2191.29,"Justice Stevens, I think that everything the Mormon Church does is consistent with its beliefs."
1986.86-179,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2197.76,2202.83,"No, all I'm suggesting is, I think you're overstating the character of the judge's findings."
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2208.734,2211.27,"--Well, he made a number of subsidiary findings that back that up, yes."
1986.86-179,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2211.27,2213.138,"Right, but they're all for that ultimate proposition, as I read it."
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2213.138,2213.738,"Well, I think that's correct."
1986.86-179,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2223.078,2223.611,Right.
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2230.148,2230.515,No.
1986.86-179,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2238.337,2246.359,"It's different, in other words, from the case we often talk about, running a spaghetti factory or something like that where you get... claim tax exemption for it."
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2250.395,2258.184,"I think... well, the problem is, I think, that most religions would say that everything they engage in has some connection with their religion."
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2287.77,2299.411,"Well, you can draw a line very easily if the only connection to their religion asserted is that this activity enables us to make money which we can spend for the purposes of our religion."
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2302.13,2302.563,Well--
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2302.563,2315.854,"And you say that anything that's not engaged in for the purpose of making money must be immediately engaged in for some purpose that you think that... that the religion itself thinks, at least, is in furtherance of its religion."
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2315.854,2319.14,"--Justice Scalia, maybe that line can be drawn."
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2416.203,2419.857,What was the burden being imposed in Calder?
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2419.857,2453.578,"The burden I think was that the employer, when the employee invoked the power of that statute... and I think it's important to remember that under both of these statutes, it was an individual who invoked the power of them... but in the Calder case, when the employee told the employer that he wanted a day off for his religious reasons, then the employer had the duty to try to accommodate him taking that day off."
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2453.578,2460.015,"But that was a duty imposed... that was a duty imposed by the state, right?"
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2460.015,2460.748,That's correct.
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2462.684,2466.486,And what... what duty is imposed by the state here?
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2469.604,2483.697,Mayson's given... Mayson is told that his interest in not having his religious beliefs coerced after 16 years of employment has to be subordinated to the Mormon Church's right to do it.
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.697,2484.113,That's right.
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2500.492,2505.296,"The state is telling Mr. Mayson, you must accommodate your employer?"
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2505.296,2507.346,Telling him he must accommodate his employer?
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2507.346,2507.829,That's right.
1986.86-179,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2537.565,2545.938,"Well, no accommodation of the free exercise clause by government is ever neutral; it can't be."
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2548.04,2565.351,"Well, Justice O'Connor, people and particularly in your Wallace v. Jaffree and Wallace v. Jaffree concurrence, you were considering a type of accommodation that is very, very different than what we've got here."
1986.86-179,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2565.351,2577.142,The fact of the matter is that government cannot accommodate the free exercise of religion and be regarded as neutral in doing it.
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2578.659,2580.361,I think that's probably right.
1986.86-179,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2639.397,2645.883,"But Mr. Watkiss, your opponent says that the statute allows churches to promote religion."
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2647.966,2649.335,"I beg your pardon, Justice Stevens?"
1986.86-179,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2649.335,2651.751,The statute allows churches to promote religion.
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2661.809,2663.543,Right.
1986.86-179,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2665.945,2668.38,And the statute doesn't require that.
1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2669.463,2670.332,--The statute permits it.

1986.86-179,2,21710,david_b_watkiss,,2674.117,2677.319,"That's right, at the expense of individual religious liberty."
1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2677.319,2678.586,That's always true.

1986.86-179,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2978.663,2981.048,It just really shows the burden's not a one-way street.
