1974.73-1285,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,38.625,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1285, John P. Wood against Strickland and others."
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,45.08,48.434,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1285,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,299.754,303.755,"Right there, Mr. Smith, what is the balance of the semester?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,305.395,305.984,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1285,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,309.726,312.524,"So, that would be until June?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,312.524,320.388,"Your Honor, normally, the school year in Arkansas school districts last through May, yes sir."
1974.73-1285,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,320.388,325.577,I think your statements made in some of the briefs that the girls lost a full year.
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,328.021,336.764,"Your Honor, the Court of Appeals made that observation in its opinion and frankly there is no evidentiary support in the record to sustain that."
1974.73-1285,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,349.9,351.172,"Now, that I have you interrupted."
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,359.037,364.777,"Up until the age of 15, Your Honor and both of these students, one was 16, one was 17."
1974.73-1285,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,368.482,368.847,Now does the third girl --
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,368.847,372.725,This is contrary too in observation of the district judge I might add.
1974.73-1285,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,372.725,375.988,Has the third girl never been a party to this litigation?
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,375.988,376.78,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-1285,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,376.78,382.522,"But she apparently was the main force behind the enterprise, was she not?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,382.522,390.335,"According to the testimony of the other two girls, perhaps, that does an accurate characterization."
1974.73-1285,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,390.335,397.694,What age in Arkansas does a person have a right to attend the public school or is there no limit?
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,397.694,405.15,"Well, Your Honor, I don't know that there is a right to attend the public schools up to a certain age."
1974.73-1285,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,410.5,412.008,May or are they required to?
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,412.008,413.087,They are required to.
1974.73-1285,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,413.716,415.481,"Well, it is an obligation on one side."
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,417.121,418.008,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1285,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,424.929,427.63,"Well, if he's graduated from the 12th grade, I suppose."
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,427.63,429.103,Correct.
1974.73-1285,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,429.103,433.112,It's the end of it.
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,433.112,454.532,"After the girls and the parents were informed of the decision made at the special board meeting, they were later furnished at the request, at their request and the request of their counsel, a special board meeting to be held on March 2."
1974.73-1285,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,504.616,506.734,What was the nature of the defense?
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,506.734,507.745,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor."
1974.73-1285,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,507.745,510.83,What if anything was the nature of the defense?
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,510.83,512.991,"Your Honor, the only reference --"
1974.73-1285,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,512.991,516.158,"It hasn't anything to do with this case, I am just curious?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,516.158,530.941,"The district judge in his opinion stated that, there had never been any contention by the students or their parents that the rule had not in fact been violated."
1974.73-1285,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,555.438,557.164,You said 3.2?
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,557.164,559.333,"3.2%, yes sir."
1974.73-1285,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,560.224,562.982,Although the district judge simply put the name --
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,562.982,563.459,In solution --
1974.73-1285,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,563.459,564.591,Only a little bit of the 3.2 --
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,564.591,567.149,"That's correct, Your Honor, that's correct."
1974.73-1285,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,588.568,610.662,"You said, the Court of Appeals said that it based its opinion on substantive due process but I didn't read its opinion as saying that the school board couldn't as a matter of substantive regulation provide that you could expel a person for putting the beer in a punch."
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,614.439,615.872,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.73-1285,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,615.872,618.354,Just like Sand case.
1974.73-1285,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,618.354,620.807,"Thompson against Louisville, you're familiar with that case?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,620.807,622.192,I'm not sure that I am.
1974.73-1285,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,622.192,623.16,A no evidence case.
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,623.16,623.971,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1974.73-1285,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,664.75,667.058,"Well, this was 3.2, I think you said it."
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,667.058,667.915,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-1285,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,667.915,670.328,Is that intoxicating?
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,673.051,689.182,"Your Honor, in terms of the alcohol -- the Arkansas statute's definition of an intoxicating liquor from a criminal standpoint, it is in excess of 3.2, a defined beer as a malt beverage containing up to 3.2% alcohol."
1974.73-1285,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,689.182,694.692,"Well, what -- this was 3.2, whatever you call it?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,694.692,695.027,Not to exceed.
1974.73-1285,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,695.027,695.84,Not to exceed --
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,695.84,697.461,Not to exceed 3.2.
1974.73-1285,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,699.721,701.671,Is that beverage intoxicating?
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,701.671,705.476,"Your Honor, in terms of the Arkansas statute, it is not."
1974.73-1285,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,705.476,711.17,Are you old enough to remember when we used to be allowed to drink 3.2 beer?
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,711.17,712.069,I don't know how to answer that.
1974.73-1285,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,715.013,716.896,"Well, I can tell you from personal experience."
1974.73-1285,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,716.896,719.079,"Well, is it illegal in this county?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,719.079,730.453,"It is and the prosecuting attorney when inquired -- when the Board President inquired of him as to the nature of this beverage, he said, â€œIn his view, it was an intoxicating beverage."
1974.73-1285,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,736.313,739.891,"When was it mixed, in the school or out of the school?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,739.891,740.695,I beg your pardon?
1974.73-1285,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,740.695,745.521,When was it mixed with all of these other juices that are non-toxic?
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,745.521,748.957,It was mixed with the non-alcoholic beverage off of the school premises.
1974.73-1285,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,748.957,751.7,"So, when they got on the school premises, it was not intoxicating."
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,751.7,761.496,"It was 84 ounces of solution, 24 ounces of which was alcoholic and then of course 3.2% of that was the alcohol."
1974.73-1285,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,761.496,762.299,As I understand --
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,762.299,764.386,"But Your Honor, right, that's the point."
1974.73-1285,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,764.386,772.437,"But it was 3.2, diluted was made it less than 3.2?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,772.437,773.207,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1285,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,773.207,779.973,"What is -- I thought you said 3.2 made it intoxicated, below 3.2 was not?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,779.973,784.077,That's the definition provided in the criminal statutes of the State of Arkansas.
1974.73-1285,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,807.941,809.662,But it wasn't beer.
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,819.389,819.619,"That's true, Your Honor."
1974.73-1285,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,819.619,824.478,"Orange gluc--, strawberry soda, Coca-Cola.[Attempt to Laughter]"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,824.478,824.956,"Your Honor, the point --"
1974.73-1285,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,824.956,825.297,Lemon juice.
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,825.297,841.718,"The point we're trying to make is that this board, [Laughter] this Board of Education construed the conduct of these youngsters to be a violation of its regulation and they imposed a punishment."
1974.73-1285,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,841.718,842.691,I suppose now?
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,842.691,848.317,They had a remedy provided by the State of Arkansas by their state courts.
1974.73-1285,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,938.775,942.546,"Your immunity claim is we can prolong too, I take it?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,942.546,943.284,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1285,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,971.497,976.444,"Now, what then -- and you said that, there's something closer to absolute immunity?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,976.444,977.196,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1285,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,988.205,993.921,"That is objective of good faith standard, I think?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,993.921,1009.512,"Your Honor, if the Rhodes -- if the Rhodes standard of conduct is objective then fine because it does require an actual inquiry into what the man was thinking at the time he did it and whether he had reasonable cause --"
1974.73-1285,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1009.512,1012.389,I thought that was an order in the Rhodes?
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,1012.389,1014.201,"I'm sorry, sir."
1974.73-1285,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1014.201,1021.705,"Either a subject in bad faith or objective bad faith, I am sure your case --"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,1021.705,1030.929,"Your Honor, the Rhodes case states that the immunity depends on the existence of reasonable grounds for the belief formed at the time --"
1974.73-1285,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.929,1031.961,That's subjective.
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,1031.961,1036.98,-- in the light of the circumstances coupled with good faith belief.
1974.73-1285,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1036.98,1038.29,Coupled with good faith belief?
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,1038.29,1038.411,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1285,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1038.411,1039.544,It has to be that the 14 year-old --
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,1039.544,1041.311,That affords basis for immunity.
1974.73-1285,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1047.874,1051.921,Are you satisfied to show your standard or not with the Rhodes standards --
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,1051.921,1059.293,"Your Honor, we think actually that there are grounds for an absolute immunity here, but frankly there's very little authority to support that argument."
1974.73-1285,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1059.293,1067.73,"So you're -- so you're not satisfied with it but to show here is that Rhodes is the law, isn't it and the lower court instructed that?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,1067.73,1082.464,"Well, actually Your Honor, the district judge in his findings, its temporary restraining order hearing said, â€œI find that the school board members had reasonable grounds to believe that their regulation have been violated at the time they took their initial action in this case."
1974.73-1285,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1089.128,1091.268,"Well then, what did the Court of Appeals say?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,1091.268,1101.428,The Court of Appeals stated that they could say on the basis of this record that the defense of good faith had been established as a matter of law.
1974.73-1285,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1128.579,1135.791,"Well, how is the Court of Appeals able to review the District Court's action if there were -- if there wasn't a transcript of the evidence?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,1137.781,1159.935,"It reviewed evidence which had been compiled at the temporary restraining order here along with answers to interrogatories and some other factual material that was in the case, affidavits submitted in connection with both motions on."
1974.73-1285,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.935,1169.644,But you do -- you do maintain -- one your questions you want reviewed here is whether the Court of Appeals was correct in its immunity ruling?
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,1169.644,1170.228,Yes sir.
1974.73-1285,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1170.228,1171.897,"Or its standard ruling, whatever you want to call it?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,1171.897,1173.248,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1974.73-1285,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1191.738,1193.301,"Well, then happens --."
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,1206.223,1206.658,Yes sir.
1974.73-1285,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1277.902,1286.3,"Was the Scheuer against Rhodes' opinion down by the time the Court, I think not?"
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,1286.3,1287.285,"I believe not, Your Honor."
1974.73-1285,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1287.498,1289.393,It is not cited in the opinion?
1974.73-1285,0,26160,g_ross_smith,,1289.393,1298.434,Right and the Court of Appeals' decision was in August 1973.
1974.73-1285,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1395.336,1399.545,Very well.
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1401.781,1407.227,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1519.145,1522.779,"At that time, were you representing the Wall girl?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1522.779,1533.286,"No sir, the wall girl never came to me. Just Crain and Strickland and I wish Wall had because she was a full-blood Indian but --"
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1533.286,1534.179,She was a what?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1534.179,1536.424,"She was a full-blood Indian, but she didn't come."
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1536.424,1538.798,How was her name in the pleadings?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1538.798,1539.165,Sir.
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1539.165,1541.814,How is her name in the pleadings if she never --
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1541.814,1543.42,She's not in the pleading.
1974.73-1285,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1544.76,1547.642,"I'm curious, what difference would that have made?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1547.642,1555.663,"Well, I think the district judge would have ordered the school board to put these kids back in school."
1974.73-1285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1558.359,1561.719,You have been reading some of our Indian case.[Attempt to Laughter]
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1561.719,1565.108,"Well, again, I'm not familiar with those either."
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1565.108,1567.471,"Who was the district judge, Judge Williams?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1567.471,1567.877,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1568.632,1571.14,And you feel that this would have made a difference as well --
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1571.14,1575.284,"Well, judging from what he said that the first hearing Your Honor."
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1677.5,1683.993,"Well, do you agree with Mr. Smith that there isn't any dispute as to the facts here?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1683.993,1685.365,"No sir, I do not."
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1694.153,1699.685,"Well, apart from that one feature, is there any dispute about the facts?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1699.685,1704.826,"Well, they have left out many facts which we feel to be pertinent."
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1708.81,1715.982,Did you put on or try to these omitted facts?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1715.982,1717.207,"Yes sir, they're in evidence."
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1752.733,1755.637,"You mean, you couldn't afford the print it."
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1755.637,1756.529,Right.
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1756.529,1759.191,"But the record is here, is it in typewritten?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1759.191,1760.784,"Well no, the --"
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1760.784,1761.4,There was no --
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1761.4,1763.062,The evidence -- no sir.
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1769.82,1771.404,Is it here?
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1771.404,1772.753,Was it transcribed?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1772.753,1777.048,It had been since the board took this appeal to this Court.
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.048,1777.433,"Well, then --"
1974.73-1285,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1777.433,1778.953,I think the original record is here.
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1778.953,1780.912,I would assume the original record is here then?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1780.912,1782.295,I don't know Your Honor.
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1784.97,1786.15,Did it ever get to the Court?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1787.81,1788.874,"No, sir."
1974.73-1285,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1788.874,1790.356,Think it might not be here then?
1974.73-1285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1790.356,1802.968,"Before the school board, did your clients contest the basic factual claim that they had gotten the so-called malt beverage over in Oklahoma and put it in the punch bowl?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1802.968,1823.377,"Your Honor, of course, they were not at the February 18 hearing at all but at the March 2 meeting, the whole procedure was for the girls to tell the school board what they did and they did tell, when I say the girls here, I mean the plaintiffs, Ms. Strickland and Virginia Crain."
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1828.136,1831.176,That's a little cryptic to me.
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1839.426,1840.617,Yes sir.
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1841.128,1843.896,"No, dispute over that then?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1843.896,1849.209,That's again leaving out what we think is some important facts.
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1878.266,1881.199,"Mr. Core, is this all in the record here?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1883.7,1883.98,Yes.
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1888.08,1892.011,"Well, I'm curious as to what is still missing that you're complaining about?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1892.011,1896.1,"Well, all that is here Your Honor is the two hearings which held."
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1897.981,1901.175,These are the facts you've just recited.
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1903.367,1905.029,Right.
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1908.853,1911.534,"Well, then what in addition is still missing?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1911.534,1917.941,"Well, we had the -- we had the parents testified."
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1942.26,1958.979,"Well, it doesn't it all come down to what is the difference between intoxicated in alcoholic and here there's no argument, is there, about this being an alcoholic beverage and is there any argument that it was non-intoxicating even under Arkansas?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1958.979,1959.875,"Yes, definitely."
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1969.007,1973.631,"But they think, they think for their purposes of their rule, it is intoxicating, that's what they thought."
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1973.631,1980.701,That's the premise they proceeded under but the President of the School Board admitted on a cross-examination that the girls had not violated the rule.
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1980.701,1984.575,"Well, are you defending the Court of Appeals' decision?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1984.575,1985.007,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1985.007,1989.668,"And the grounds for it, the rationale for it?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,1989.668,1993.047,"Well, yes."
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.873,2009.248,"No, as to whether the reason for the Court of Appeals' decision in your favor that there was no evidence of the fact that there was an intoxicating beverage involved?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2009.248,2015.298,"Yes, I think that's true that there was none and as a matter of fact, the truth is that it was not intoxicating."
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2015.298,2017.794,Was this illegal conduct in that county?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2017.794,2029.633,"Only because -- first, it was not Your Honor because it did not violate any law concerning intoxicating beverage."
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2029.633,2031.331,"Well, did it violate any law?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2031.331,2039.778,"Yes, it violated a law against possessing beer that did not have the Arkansas tax paid on it."
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2054.547,2059.01,"So, that you do not question that the girls who were guilty of some illegal conduct?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2059.01,2060.228,"That's true, right."
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2060.228,2064.034,Just a question of how you define that illegal conduct?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2064.034,2065.402,Right.
1974.73-1285,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2065.886,2075.478,"There's question isn't it, as to whether or not the girls engaged in a conduct that was -- that is proscribed by the rule of the school board 3 (b)."
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2075.478,2075.887,That's correct.
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2075.887,2076.655,That's the question?
1974.73-1285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2076.655,2088.039,"Well, or more properly, to what extent should a federal court in a 1983 action second guess a school board's decision that that regulation was violated?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2088.039,2092.643,"Well, I believe it's the procedural problem --"
1974.73-1285,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2092.643,2093.109,Yes.
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2093.109,2103.545,"-- Your Honor, because if they had proceeded in a correct manner, then they would have determined that there was no violation."
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2103.545,2113.938,"But if the school board construed its own regulation, meaning, intoxicating is equivalent to alcoholic, what's the federal court got to do with that?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2113.938,2119.102,"Well, it's not really that point that I believe that there is federal jurisdiction."
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2166.992,2170.302,You're then pressing a procedural due process?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2170.302,2171.148,Yes sir.
1974.73-1285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2184.452,2186.371,Is that a federal claim?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2194.665,2196.022,"Yes sir, if it --"
1974.73-1285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2196.022,2198.756,What case of ours do you rely on for that?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2198.756,2203.86,I'm sorry I couldn't cite you a case.
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2221.645,2223.594,"Mr. Core, we approach it from this end."
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2232.646,2256.425,"Yes sir and I'm glad you made that point because yes we think the procedure in addition to the problem with the rule, we think the procedure which the board follow is really the reason that they pronounced such a severe judgment on a childish prank with girls that had never any trouble with them before."
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2289.221,2294.02,Are you defending on the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2294.02,2294.339,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2300.225,2317.105,"Suppose two students were found sitting in the classroom drinking beer right out of the original bottles, your theory of this case would be exactly the same that the school board could not do what it did here in the way that it did it?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2317.105,2319.852,"That's correct, yes sir."
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2319.852,2324.434,"So, they could drink beer with impunity even though it's illegal to possess it in that county?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2324.434,2328.278,"No, [Attempt to Laughter] I don't believe that follows Your Honor."
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2350.857,2358.337,"That brings us around Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question just precisely, how is that a federal question?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2358.337,2359.87,"Well, we feel that --"
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2359.87,2362.197,Federal constitutional question?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2362.197,2371.661,-- that the State of Arkansas has provided this right or this opportunity for education.
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2383.161,2386.442,Was it the procedure or the beer?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2386.442,2389.839,I think it's the procedure.
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2389.839,2400.853,If -- you do concede -- you do concede that the school board would have an inherent power to impose a punishment for drinking this same beer in the classroom?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2400.853,2402.584,"Well, I certainly do."
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2402.584,2408.104,But they could not impose such a severe punishment as was imposed here?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2408.104,2409.532,"I agree with that, yes sir."
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2409.532,2410.376,That's -- that's your point.
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2410.376,2423.999,"We could disagree on the Court of Appeals, I take it on the ground that they used here such as the due process and you could still win on the procedural question which the Court of Appeals didn't reach."
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2423.999,2425.986,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2428.251,2433.708,"Except for one meeting, they said that on March 2 and February 18 meeting where there was no procedural due process?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2433.708,2434.258,Right.
1974.73-1285,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2434.258,2436.827,And they didn't decide the question with the respect of second meeting?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2436.827,2438.151,"Right, correct."
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2438.151,2440.634,"Of course, you don't know why they bypassed it?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2440.634,2448.91,"No sir, except the defense -- satisfied on deprival of substantive due process and didn't feel it necessary to pass on."
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2448.91,2456.131,Do you think they called the substantive due process issue was easier than the procedural due process for the second meeting?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2456.131,2460.118,"I wouldn't hazard to guess on that, [Attempt to Laughter] Your Honor."
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2460.118,2469.2,"Would you explain to me too the injury that these girls, as I indicated in my question to Mr. Smith."
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2471.949,2472.848,Yes sir.
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2482.7,2486.337,Doesn't the system worked on a semesters --
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2486.337,2487.594,It is a semester basis.
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2487.594,2489.392,How come they lost the whole year?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2489.392,2491.297,"Well, no."
1974.73-1285,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2523.386,2532.969,"Well, the Court of Appeals, I notice in footnote 1, says the practical effect of the suspension was to cause the girls to fail that entire sophomore year?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2532.969,2533.766,That's right.
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2533.766,2536.904,That's what the Court of Appeals said but I want to know whether it's a correct statement?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2536.904,2537.726,It is indeed a correct statement.
1974.73-1285,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2537.726,2539.823,"Well, Mr. Smith told us it was an incorrect statement?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2539.823,2542.906,Right and I have to disagree with Mr. Smith on that.
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.906,2549.092,"Well, at least, to the girls miss three months of school and they have to make up the next three months of school?"
1974.73-1285,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2549.092,2550.036,"No, question to that."
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2550.036,2550.411,And it would have been --
1974.73-1285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2550.411,2552.268,"Six months, that's a long time."
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2552.268,2565.144,And it would have been the subject matter which wouldn't have been covered until the second semester which means that they'd have to lay out an entire year.
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2596.345,2600.519,"One thing that might happen is that they'd go into the state courts, isn't it?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2600.519,2603.918,"Well, that's true but --"
1974.73-1285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2603.918,2607.523,Wasn't that the custom until just a few years ago?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2607.523,2616.701,"Well, in my -- I've practicing a little over -- I am well over in the 24 year and I don't recall any suits like this before."
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2630.096,2639.41,"Well, isn't this just a new fashion kind of case that you and I were in elementary school, we got bumstead and we went home."
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2639.41,2639.659,That's right.
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2639.659,2641.146,And made a federal case out of it?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2641.146,2648.365,"That's true, that's back in the days of paternalism that our district judge referred to when he heard the case."
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2648.365,2653.086,"You have good courts in western Arkansas, don't you?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2653.086,2653.556,I beg your pardon?
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2653.556,2656.43,"I say, you have working courts in western Arkansas?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2656.43,2657.513,You mean state courts?
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2657.513,2658.002,Yes sir.
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2658.002,2660.667,Yes sir.
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2667.954,2669.825,Isn't that where Judge Williams came from?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2669.825,2674.464,"Yes sir, he came from Booneville by which is only 35 miles from Fort Smith."
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2674.464,2677.592,You mean he came from the state side on the judiciary?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2677.592,2677.758,Yes.
1974.73-1285,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2677.758,2678.56,He's a state judge --
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2678.56,2683.333,He served for over 20 years as a chancellery judge before he was a district judge.
1974.73-1285,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2683.333,2687.917,"You mean, in Pope County, where it what?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2687.917,2690.3,It's 85 miles south of Fort Smith.
1974.73-1285,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2693.579,2694.36,Of Pope County.
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2694.36,2695.237,Right.
1974.73-1285,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2695.237,2701.27,And the -- it's a basically small town.
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2701.27,2706.173,"It's some 4,500 population."
1974.73-1285,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2706.173,2710.044,"And the school board has a county-wide jurisdiction , does it?"
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2710.044,2716.76,"No sir, there are, I believe, two, three -- three other consolidated schools in the county."
1974.73-1285,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2722.668,2724.643,"Which is Mena, which is basically the town of Mena."
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2724.643,2725.439,Right.
1974.73-1285,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2725.439,2727.322,"And population of less than 5,000."
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2727.322,2729.007,Right.
1974.73-1285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2775.093,2776.632,But he didn't actually order them?
1974.73-1285,1,17507,ben_core,,2776.632,2778.723,"No sir, he never did."

1974.73-1285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2901.666,2902.378,When is it?
1974.73-1285,2,26160,g_ross_smith,,2902.378,2904.081,With their class.
1974.73-1285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2904.081,2908.116,"Their sophomore year ended June of 1972, didn't it?"
1974.73-1285,2,26160,g_ross_smith,,2908.116,2908.913,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-1285,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2911.776,2913.473,They made up the year then.
1974.73-1285,2,26160,g_ross_smith,,2913.473,2917.875,"Yes, sir, by taking a correspondence course and one other extra course."
1974.73-1285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2917.875,2944.858,"Now, let's assume for the moment -- let's assume just for the moment that the school board -- that the Court of Appeals was reversed but the case was remanded and the Court of Appeals held that there was a denial of procedure of due process, that the suspension had been imposed not in accordance with the Constitution but in violation of the Due Process Clause."
1974.73-1285,2,26160,g_ross_smith,,2957.221,2959.577,"I would assume that under those circumstances, there's --"
1974.73-1285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2959.577,2960.564,Would there be a remedy or would --
1974.73-1285,2,26160,g_ross_smith,,2960.564,2978.324,"-- distinct possibility that the students would pursue their damage claim against the individual school board members, since they have had at least take up two extra courses at that point."
1974.73-1285,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3010.626,3018.26,In other words Mr. Smith the federal question does not arise out of a mere mistake of judgment by school board?M
1974.73-1285,2,26160,g_ross_smith,,3018.26,3020.789,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1285,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3020.789,3022.983,Mr. Justice Blackmun has a question for you.
