1986.85-1226,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.272,"We will hear argument first this morning in No. 85-1226, Commissioner of Internal Revenue versus Robert P. Groetzinger."
1986.85-1226,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,12.058,33.554,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, the question here is whether a person who spends his full time gambling at racetracks for his own account is engaged in a trade or business for federal income tax purposes."
1986.85-1226,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,140.99,142.524,Do you have any idea how much is at stake?
1986.85-1226,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,142.524,151.512,"It is impossible to tell, Justice Brennan, because there are so many different numbers on the tax return that can go up or down depending on whether you are in business."
1986.85-1226,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.29,209.967,"Mr. Lauber, will the decision we make have any consequences under the new tax code to take effect next year or are the definitions changed enough for that that it doesn't have an impact?"
1986.85-1226,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,209.967,216.204,--The new tax code preserves the post-'82 treatment for gambling losses.
1986.85-1226,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,262.4,276.326,By virtue of Section 212 are there any consequences if this case were affirmed outside the context of full-time gambling?
1986.85-1226,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,283.682,295.038,"The greatest risk to affirmance would be if the Court did anything to impugn the rule of Higgins versus Commissioner, which held that investors are not in a trade or business."
1986.85-1226,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,295.038,301.442,"Well, it could be affirmed, I suppose, without doing that, depending upon what the elements were of the test to be employed."
1986.85-1226,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,301.442,301.808,That's right.
1986.85-1226,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,301.808,311.814,"Of course, to speak of the rule of Higgins against Commissioner is to give that case the benefit of a good deal of doubt since you tell me what rule it is other than that the government won it."
1986.85-1226,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,311.814,314.25,"Well, one might say that very well."
1986.85-1226,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,314.25,320.336,"Mr. Lauber, you argued the slot machine case last year, didn't you."
1986.85-1226,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,320.336,321.688,"Unfortunately, I did, yes."
1986.85-1226,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,321.688,324.89,You are getting to be an expert on gambling devices.
1986.85-1226,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,324.89,329.342,I have quite a bit of knowledge about the different subjects now.
1986.85-1226,1,18469,carroll_baymiller,,1837.421,1853.846,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I am a little surprised at the government when they likened the professional gambler to the investor."
1986.85-1226,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3034.403,3037.938,"I might make one point in response to your questions, Mr. Chief Justice."
