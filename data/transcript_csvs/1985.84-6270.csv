1985.84-6270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.091,We will hear arguments next in Green against the Michigan Department of Social Services.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,79.702,88.512,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to reserve five minutes of my time for rebuttal."
1985.84-6270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.249,202.574,"What remains of that first case now, the one that you have just described, after the chance?"
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,202.574,208.854,"--After the change, the defendants, we would submit, are currently in compliance with the new federal law."
1985.84-6270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,222.053,226.443,And are you seeking damages for the period before 1981?
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,226.443,227.988,We are not seeking any monetary relief at all.
1985.84-6270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,243.387,245.62,Why isn't the case moot or very close to it?
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,245.62,247.354,"Well, the case is not moot."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,270.126,272.282,You want the notice.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,272.282,274.812,"We want the notice, and there is an interest in--"
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,274.812,280.092,And you want the notice so that these people could apply for relief in state courts.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,280.092,282.793,"--Well, probably in the state administrative tribunal."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.793,292.554,"Yes, to get... to get what you think they are entitled to prior to the amendment of the federal law."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,292.554,302.286,"To state it more specifically, we believe that the interest is in being given the opportunity to do that."
1985.84-6270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,314.953,318.84,But it takes more than just a very tiny thing to keep a case alive.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,325.244,325.791,I understand.
1985.84-6270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,325.791,333.398,It strikes me that this is really awfully far down the line so far as any live controversy about federal issues is concerned.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,333.398,336.881,"Well, petitioners would respectfully disagree."
1985.84-6270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,396.106,398.683,There were no damage claims in Quern?
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,398.683,402.807,"There were no... well, Quern was Edelman versus Jordan revisited."
1985.84-6270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,456.364,462.315,"Mr. Burnham, as I understand it, you make no claim for prospective relief."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,462.315,468.344,"That depends on how one interprets the term ""prospective""."
1985.84-6270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,468.344,478.323,"Well, identify what you claim as possibly being prospective if the court below thought you had advanced any claim for prospective relief."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,478.323,493.209,"Well, Justice Powell, the understanding of prospective relief, if I understand the question correctly, prospective injunctive relief against future violations, there is no claim for that."
1985.84-6270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,493.615,494.287,And no claim for damages.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,494.287,494.802,And no claim for damages.
1985.84-6270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,494.802,502.017,"And I understand you want notice relief, but what would that relief lead to?"
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,509.328,521.93,"It may if the individual class member who received that notice decided that they wanted to take advantage of it and at that point to request an administrative hearing, and then to get judicial review of that administrative hearing decision."
1985.84-6270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,534.753,542.642,"In Quern, my recollection is that the notice relief was ancillary to some prospective relief."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,548.015,558.462,"I believe... Your Honor, I believe, is referring to the statement in Quern about the notice being ancillary to prospective relief already ordered."
1985.84-6270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,558.462,558.884,Yes.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,558.884,572.051,"The defendant's and the Sixth Circuit's interpretation of that is that that referred to the permanent injunction, which of course had in the intervening time become moot because of the abolition of the program to which it related."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,632.027,634.729,Why was a declaratory judgment proper?
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,634.729,638.086,Under the facts of Jordan?
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.086,638.601,This case.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,638.601,641.523,"In this case, the declaratory judgment is proper--"
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,641.523,648.411,The only purpose of it would be to effect... to declare whether the federal law had been violated in the past.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,648.411,650.691,"--Yes, that would be the purpose of the declaratory judgment."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,650.691,659.313,And the only purpose of it would be to give somebody a basis for making a claim in state administrative proceedings.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,659.313,662.843,"Well, the purpose would be to settle the rights of the parties."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,662.843,668.637,Certainly you wouldn't say that notice would have been properly ordered except for a declaratory judgment.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,668.637,670.448,"Well, no."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,676.883,677.227,Why?
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,677.227,678.461,"Well, in the same--"
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,678.461,680.976,--that there is--
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,680.976,688.583,"--Well, in the sense that any injunction is ordered based upon a determination that the law was violated, there was no need for separate declaratory relief."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,697.08,700.046,"--I know, but the injunction is moot, in this case."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,702.248,711.745,"That's correct, and consequently one has to at that point separate the determinative federal... substantive federal question determination from the issue of the injunction."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,711.745,718.399,So you have to say you are entitled to a declaratory judgment about whether the state had been violating the federal law.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,718.399,721.195,"At least in effect one would have to do that, yes."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.085,723.663,Why is that prospective?
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,726.27,739.435,"--Well, it is prospective in the sense that... in the sense that the federal determination, the federal question of determination determines how it is that in the future the state will have to deal with past claims."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,739.435,745.512,"Well, I know, on the basis... that would be the same if you ordered money be paid."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,750.417,750.777,Of course.
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,757.663,758.21,--What are you saying?
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,758.21,778.686,"What I am saying is that in order to be prospective, the relief must be based upon some ongoing federal duty, and if there is an ongoing federal duty to take action with respect to past claims, which there is in the federal statute and the federal regulations, then an order enforcing that ongoing duty can in fact be prospective."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,778.686,780.734,You could say the same thing about money.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,782.497,784.714,"That could be, but this case does not involve--"
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.714,785.449,"It could be, but it would still--"
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,788.558,792.602,"--That's correct, and we are not dealing with monetary relief, and for that reason--"
1985.84-6270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,792.602,795.538,But you are dealing with something that is just almost identical.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,798.304,816.53,"--Well, that was precisely the argument that was made to this Court in Quern, that in fact this, the Quern case, after it came back with notice relief, was no different than Edelman, and this Court made the distinction between an order which propels the state to pay money and an order which simply determines illegality and orders some nonmonetary relief."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,816.53,822.871,"I know, but whether the Court was right or wrong in Quern, it said that it was ancillary to prospective relief, didn't it?"
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,822.871,824.636,"Yes, it did."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,825.402,826.777,"Well, stop right there."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,829.134,829.415,--Okay.
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,845.549,846.846,It is hard to swallow that.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,880.849,896.342,"Well, this Court made clear in Quern that whatever the class members were going to do with the notice, and going to do with the substantive federal question determination necessary for it did not really affect the issue of whether or not the notice relief order should be entered."
1985.84-6270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,897.029,898.311,"Well, but that doesn't really answer my question."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,905.416,917.255,"--Yes, I believe it is, because otherwise what is going to happen in this case is that without that declaratory judgment, the state may treat any action that it took in the past as valid."
1985.84-6270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,917.255,921.363,But the state would have to defend the action in state courts.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,925.392,939.075,"That is, of course, possible, but in this case we have in fact, we would have a delay between the time that a state court will render a decision, and we have in fact persons who received benefits under preliminary injunction."
1985.84-6270,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,972.982,981.059,You want us to give you some relief that you might or might not use ancillary in the Michigan state court?
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,981.059,994.74,"I am asking the Court to give us relief, and that the relief is complete upon its being given, because the relief, the interest the class members have is an interest in the opportunity to apply for that hearing."
1985.84-6270,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,994.74,997.566,It only can be used in the Michigan state court.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,997.566,999.956,It may be used in the Michigan state court.
1985.84-6270,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,999.956,1000.987,That is the only place.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1004.236,1006.985,"No, it could be used in the Michigan administrative tribunal."
1985.84-6270,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1009.546,1011.779,And they don't have to follow it.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1011.779,1020.167,They would have to... I would think that the usual rules of collateral estoppel would apply to issues that are actually adjudicated.
1985.84-6270,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1057.152,1060.011,We are sort of pendent jurisdiction to Michigan.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1060.011,1073.363,"I don't believe it is pendent jurisdiction simply because that notice relief stands on its own... in other words, notice relief should be no different than any other kind of injunctive relief which is nonmonetary."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.957,1119.205,"You know, there are some federal statutes that restrict the power of the federal courts to issue injunctions."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1119.205,1119.799,--Yes.
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1119.799,1126.374,"And although the statutes don't say so, the courts have said the same rule applies to declaratory judgments."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1126.374,1134.574,"If Your Honor is referring to the Younger versus Harris, Samuels versus McKell sort of--"
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1134.574,1137.448,I am not talking about those.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1145.225,1145.476,--Yes.
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.476,1150.832,"Well, those have been interpreted to apply to declaratory judgments, too."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1150.832,1152.487,"Yes, in the McNary case."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1152.487,1155.861,"Yes, and that is the argument here."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1161.109,1167.092,"Well, I believe that there are distinctions between the anti-injunction statutes on the one hand and the Eleventh Amendment on the other."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1197.735,1201.0,Suppose the statute hadn't been amended at all.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1212.214,1212.682,Yes.
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1212.682,1217.056,The Eleventh Amendment would permit prospective relief.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1217.056,1219.243,"Prospective relief, even though it cost money."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.243,1230.003,Then I suppose... I would suppose the same objection could be raised in those circumstances to giving them notice that they are being here.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1230.003,1230.956,That is true.
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1230.956,1237.328,Because... on the grounds that it is really ancillary to retrospective relief.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1237.328,1240.078,Something along that line could be argued.
1985.84-6270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1272.033,1283.638,"But the determination of illegality in Quern was originally made in the context of the Edelman pleas, where the Court determined illegality and awarded damages, thinking that it could do that."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1283.638,1285.559,That's correct.
1985.84-6270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1290.072,1295.945,The determination of illegality served a purpose in the federal court.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1310.642,1316.999,"--Well, if that logic were applied, then there would be no situations that one could think of where notice relief would be appropriate."
1985.84-6270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1328.464,1329.495,In the past.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1329.495,1336.539,"Now, that... if a prospective injunction is entered, that is not a necessary basis for that prospective injunction."
1985.84-6270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1358.514,1364.074,"Perhaps it would apply if there were a finding of a continuing violation, which is not the case here."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1364.074,1373.493,"If there were a finding of a continuing violation, one could argue that that only determines that from that date of judgment forward the defendant is violating federal law."
1985.84-6270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1381.13,1390.063,"Well, the point being that perhaps there could be continuing violations and prospective relief as to those to which notice could properly be given."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1390.063,1404.823,"--That is correct, and this case presents a very unusual situation that way, because I just found out as of last Friday the state is in fact violating current federal law on stepparent asset assumption."
1985.84-6270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1405.526,1409.742,"Well, we don't take it on that record, of course, I assume, do we?"
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1409.742,1435.201,"--No, we don't, but I would... I believe that that... that indicates just how illogical it is to somehow tie notice relief, if in fact, if in fact we were able to show that, if we tie notice relief to an injunction that is based upon a violation of a totally different federal law or a totally different class of people and somehow say that just because we can say that is ancillary to that it is okay, that is not a very firm basis on which to base a belief."
1985.84-6270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1435.201,1441.402,"Well, conceivably, that could explain or distinguish the Quern decision in any event."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1441.402,1443.558,On the facts of this case?
1985.84-6270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1443.558,1449.836,That the finding there was with relation to a continuing violation--
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1449.836,1450.663,"Yes, the--"
1985.84-6270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1450.663,1451.132,--under the notice.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1451.132,1454.38,"--Yes, that would be one distinction."
1985.84-6270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1460.238,1479.465,"This case does cause one to wonder whether the declaratory judgment isn't being sought in effect to determine liability, and just leave enforceability to state courts to determine statutory time bars or that sort of thing."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1479.465,1480.619,"Well, that is an important point."
1985.84-6270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1497.036,1498.644,"Well, that is the point."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1525.977,1530.443,"--Yes, that's true, and that would be the situation on the Quern case as well."
1985.84-6270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1530.443,1544.86,"Well, if that is the case, then it does seem to be very close to Edelman, when you are really providing a form of financial relief, in effect retroactively."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1544.86,1564.586,"It would be petitioners' position that the same description of the effect of notice relief applied in Quern would apply in this case, and that would be that the chain of causation is clearly severed, and that it is in fact up to the state as to whether or not... what they do with this substantive federal question determination, that they may in fact not have to pay any benefits."
1985.84-6270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1564.586,1576.378,"Maybe this has already been covered, but did the Court of Appeals hold that both the notice relief and the request for a declaratory judgment were barred by the Eleventh Amendment?"
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1576.378,1581.344,I am not entirely clear about the declaratory relief.
1985.84-6270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1585.453,1586.172,Right.
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1586.172,1591.341,"And that to the extent that we sought declaratory relief, I think the clear implication of that is that declaratory relief is barred."
1985.84-6270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1593.401,1598.369,"In other words, their position was that I guess the declaratory judgment went to a question of federal law."
1985.84-6270,0,44084,william_burnham,,1603.852,1607.224,--In essence that would be the only place that the plaintiffs could go.
1985.84-6270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1840.819,1849.455,Mr. Caruso.
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1849.455,1868.465,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Court of Appeals decision in this case that is on review was compelled by law principles that were previously established by decisions of this Court, and the purpose of the Eleventh Amendment requires adherence to those principles."
1985.84-6270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2113.116,2115.676,"May I ask a question, Mr. Caruso?"
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2115.676,2115.973,Yes.
1985.84-6270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2115.973,2122.909,"This case is somewhat unusual because of the change in the law on October 1st, 1981, as I remember the facts."
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2122.909,2123.237,That's right.
1985.84-6270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2123.237,2140.307,"If there had been a judgment entered by the District Court, say, on September 15th, 1981, pursuant to a complaint which asked for injunctive relief and declaratory judgment, would you say that at that time the Court could have entered a declaratory judgment?"
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2140.307,2149.694,"No, the Court could not have entered a declaratory judgment unless a declaratory judgment was related to the prospective... the ongoing violation."
1985.84-6270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2149.694,2151.443,Supposing the judge--
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2151.443,2152.896,I did not ask for past violations.
1985.84-6270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2152.896,2158.487,--Supposing the judge... you don't think the finding as to past violations... say there was no change in the law at all.
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2171.124,2189.99,"It may take into consideration the nature of the past violations only for the purposes of stopping the ongoing violation insofar as the exception to the Eleventh Amendment is concerned, because the Eleventh Amendment is concerned, because the Eleventh Amendment prohibits equitable and legal relief in state courts against the state."
1985.84-6270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2189.99,2203.735,"My question is whether... if at the time the declaratory judgment is entered it is then legally permissible to enter an injunction, why isn't the declaratory judgment also legally permissible at that time, just as a predicate for the rest of the litigation?"
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2203.735,2209.873,Because a declaratory judgment is not a prospective compliance order.
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2211.654,2219.353,Wouldn't the District Court in an injunction action enter his conclusions of law?
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2219.353,2219.899,Yes.
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.899,2225.148,And the proper basis for an injunction is that there is a violation of law that has been going on.
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2225.148,2225.819,That is correct.
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2225.819,2234.191,"And you conclude that there is... that this is what the statute means, this is what the state is not doing, and therefore you need an injunction."
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2237.986,2239.893,It is not a declaratory judgment.
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.893,2240.782,"Well, what is it?"
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2242.829,2244.015,"Well, it requires... it requires--"
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2244.015,2247.905,"--that the state is violating the law, and therefore it is an injunction."
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2247.905,2256.151,"--If that is a declaration of the violation of the law that is occurring at that time, it would not be prohibited by the Eleventh Amendment."
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2264.522,2268.568,"And in Justice Stevens' example, suppose six months before this law was changed--"
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2268.568,2268.756,Yes.
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2268.756,2277.705,"--There was an injunction, there was an injunction entered based on a declaration or a conclusion that the law was being violated."
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2277.705,2284.906,Then a proper Quern notice could be entered as predicated on that injunction--
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.906,2284.436,Exactly.
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2284.436,2287.077,--that is based upon the declaratory judgment that was entered.
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2287.077,2287.607,Yes.
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2287.607,2289.31,And that injunction that would be entered--
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.31,2294.589,Isn't that exactly true of the stepparent case in this case?
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2294.589,2295.995,--No.
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2295.995,2298.182,"Well, there was a preliminary injunction entered."
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2298.182,2301.664,"There was a preliminary injunction, but a preliminary injunction--"
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2301.664,2302.038,And that injunction was on appeal.
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2305.349,2309.911,"--That preliminary injunction was against the state, but it was a preliminary injunction."
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2310.817,2315.627,"Wasn't it supposed to... wasn't it supposed to obey the preliminary injunction, or was it--"
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2315.627,2317.095,--And it did obey the preliminary injunction.
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2320.219,2322.842,"--I see, so they made the payments."
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2322.842,2323.202,That's right.
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2323.202,2325.311,So there wasn't any need for a notice for that period.
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2325.311,2327.013,There wasn't any need to have any notice.
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2331.932,2332.276,"Okay, that is all I wanted."
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2332.276,2334.808,--But... that's right.
1985.84-6270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2413.103,2414.134,May I pursue my other question just--
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2414.134,2414.369,--Pardon me.
1985.84-6270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2414.369,2417.023,--because I am not quite sure I follow everything you are saying.
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2424.536,2424.771,Yes.
1985.84-6270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2424.771,2438.748,"Then 30 days later Congress passed the new statute that says you don't have to follow this procedure any more, and so the state goes in or its officials go in and say we want the injunction vacated because the law has been changed."
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2440.467,2440.826,Yes.
1985.84-6270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2440.826,2445.183,"Would the Eleventh Amendment require that the declaratory judgment also be vacated, in your view?"
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2449.713,2468.128,I don't believe it would require the declaratory judgment to be vacated if the law was changed because there was a determination at that time that the state was in violation of federal law by virtue of the declaratory judgment and an injunction put in place.
1985.84-6270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2468.128,2469.175,And it had been violating federal law for the past two years.
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2469.175,2471.049,So then after that the law had changed.
1985.84-6270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2474.702,2478.826,"Well, it wouldn't be ineffectual as it might happen here."
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2490.588,2509.112,"--If there was an ongoing violation and a determination of that ongoing violation by a declaratory judgment upon which there was based an injunction, and notice on that injunction to the class concerning the violation, I would say that they could do that in the state administrative procedure."
1985.84-6270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2527.12,2527.697,"Well, is the ongoing violation--"
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2527.697,2533.242,--Except by going in the past and making a declaratory judgment as to past actions.
1985.84-6270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2533.242,2535.476,--Is the ongoing violation essential?
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2547.814,2554.609,"In that hypothet there would be no determination by a court as to ongoing violation, and that is necessary."
1985.84-6270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2557.075,2560.87,"Not an adjudication of liability, adjudication of ongoing violation."
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2560.87,2574.896,"An ongoing... an adjudication of liability concerning their present acts and the relief would be to stop that ongoing violation, in other words, to put a termination to that--"
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.896,2582.566,"Well, it can't be ongoing if they are going to evade the injunction, and as soon as the injunction entered, whatever the violation was--"
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2582.566,2582.848,--That ends it.
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2582.848,2583.252,--it stops.
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2583.252,2584.127,That ends it.
1985.84-6270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2585.393,2593.718,And so what would the possible purpose of a notice in that situation be except to be of an aid to past violations?
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2593.718,2598.496,I think that that is the way you have to read the Quern notice.
1985.84-6270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2674.014,2679.214,"But, Mr. Caruso, it is true that your position is that whatever federal question of law has to be decided ought to be decided by the state court."
1985.84-6270,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2679.214,2709.921,"Not every federal question of law, but in this situation, the type of relief that they are seeking here should be decided in state court because the type of relief that is available to them because of the Eleventh Amendment immunity is only a prospective injunction, and a prospective injunction is not available here simply because there is no violation of federal law, and there has never been a determination made by a federal court that there was at any time a violation of federal law."
1985.84-6270,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2709.921,2718.449,"You have one-half minute left, if you can do anything with that."
1985.84-6270,2,44084,william_burnham,,2718.449,2723.742,I would like to just briefly respond to something that Mr. Caruso said about the availability of hearings.
1985.84-6270,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2753.092,2754.935,"Thank you, gentlemen."
