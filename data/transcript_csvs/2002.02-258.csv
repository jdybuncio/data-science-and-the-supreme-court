2002.02-258,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.64,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-258, Susan Jinks v. Richland County."
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,57.37,60.39,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-258,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,195.141,198.791,"Well, the Anti-Injunction Act just applies to Federal courts, doesn't it?"
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,198.791,207.251,"The... it gives Federal courts the authority, though, to stay a State action when it interferes with the jurisdiction of the Federal court."
2002.02-258,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,207.251,211.411,It's an... that... that's an exception to the Anti-Injunction Act.
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,211.411,216.971,"That's an exception contained in the Anti-Injunction Act, and another exception is when an act of Congress so provides."
2002.02-258,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,300.433,306.493,"I didn't understand it that way, but South Carolina said, Federal court, you want to take this and deal with this stale claim?"
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,330.6,347.875,"That... that is correct, and even at this late date, rule 60(b) would enable a plaintiff like Susan Jinks to seek to reopen that Federal case, to... to reconsider its judgment and allow this case to still live if... if the tolling provision is ineffective."
2002.02-258,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,398.028,400.79,We... we know what Congress has... has... has defined.
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,408.987,413.484,"--Well, first of all, Congress wanted to provide this Federal forum."
2002.02-258,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,421.378,424.075,"The State says, we don't want this kind of comity."
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,424.928,433.511,"It's... it's very nice for the State to have that interest, but the federalist design of our Constitution provides that impetus that Congress was acting on."
2002.02-258,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,433.511,439.634,"No, but I... I want to get down to specifically what's important to the Federal courts and to Congress."
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,439.634,440.422,Well--
2002.02-258,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,440.422,443.49,Why would it hurt the Federal courts if you lose this case?
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,446.922,450.003,--I... I think there are... there are several things that might happen.
2002.02-258,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,476.462,489.166,"What difference does complexity make if the State Federal court's position is we don't want to clutter up Federal courts with a lot of State tort... garden variety, simple State tort claims?"
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,491.184,499.043,And I think it is perfectly legitimate in Congress' jurisdiction-setting authority for them to make that determination.
2002.02-258,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,502.319,508.301,The... the idea is that Federal courts should be occupied with Federal cases and not with State cases.
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,508.301,517.522,--And I... I think that is an appropriate... appropriate reason for Congress to adopt this kind of a statute to assure that that happens.
2002.02-258,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,539.392,541.52,And how is that going to hurt the Federal courts?
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,541.52,550.406,"--That does not necessarily hurt the Federal courts, but Congress certainly has a right to be concerned for those litigants and try to--"
2002.02-258,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,550.406,556.9,Why... why isn't the person to be concerned for those litigants the State courts under whose law the litigants want to sue?
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,556.9,565.555,"--Because... because, Justice Souter, here the State courts have... have... Congress has basically done one thing."
2002.02-258,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,605.083,612.128,But comity is traditionally a matter of consent rather than having one sovereign impress its... its law on the other.
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,614.745,624.526,"--It is consensual, but then again, the... the idea behind comity is tied up with our... our federalism and our idea that we have a dual court system."
2002.02-258,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,660.509,665.403,"Well, they're asking the South Carolina courts to grant relief in a case that is outside the statute of limitations."
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,669.265,681.171,"--South Carolina courts, as... as we cited in the... the Hilton Head and Moriarty decisions, has said that they will sometimes waive the statute of limitations in the interest of justice."
2002.02-258,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.562,702.942,"Well, would this case come out differently in the State?"
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,708.888,727.884,"I don't think so, and the reason I don't think so is because when all that is left in the Federal court is a matter that is otherwise a State-based claim, that Federal court sits as just another court of that jurisdiction, another court within that State's system."
2002.02-258,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,796.143,802.314,"I thought the South Carolina Supreme Court agreed that as far as the Federal courts are concerned, this is all fine."
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,822.634,825.59,That is indeed what they've said.
2002.02-258,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,827.96,834.195,That was a... that was a Civil War tolling of the statute of limitations.
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,834.195,834.611,That is correct.
2002.02-258,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,931.055,938.017,"Well... well, isn't it... if... suppose you should not prevail here."
2002.02-258,0,40209,robert_s_peck,,949.949,952.87,--But that... that's an unworkable solution.
2002.02-258,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,989.206,989.859,"Very well, Mr. Peck."
2002.02-258,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,991.334,1004.448,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-258,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1215.018,1216.525,"Thank you, Mr. Lamken."
2002.02-258,2,16396,andrew_f_lindemann,,1221.53,1231.226,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-258,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1263.222,1276.664,What about examples cited by the representative of the Solicitor General of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act and other Federal laws that have a similar effect on South Carolina and other States?
2002.02-258,2,16396,andrew_f_lindemann,,1276.664,1290.294,"Well, I would submit to the Court that, first of all, the issue has never come up, never been litigated in this Court, and as far as I'm aware, has never been litigated in any court whether or not the Soldiers' and Sailors' Act in any application is... is constitutional."
2002.02-258,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1290.294,1290.35,Okay.
2002.02-258,2,16396,andrew_f_lindemann,,1293.311,1296.567,"No, I do not necessarily believe it will be the same result."
2002.02-258,3,40209,robert_s_peck,,2938.656,2947.409,"If the Court has no further questions, I would ask that the Supreme Court of South Carolina be reversed and would waive rebuttal."
2002.02-258,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2947.409,2949.381,"Thank you, Mr. Peck."
