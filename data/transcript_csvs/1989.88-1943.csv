1989.88-1943,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.439,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-1943, Office of Personnel Management v. Charles Richmond."
1989.88-1943,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,51.933,56.837,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1943,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,286.282,290.686,May I ask a question about your theory?
1989.88-1943,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,335.215,344.321,--Under those circumstance I would quite agree that the Executive would be actively seeking to subvert the will of Congress.
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,1696.445,1697.678,Deford.
1989.88-1943,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1697.678,1698.314,Deford.
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,1699.564,1705.801,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1763.507,1773.028,"Mr. Deford, I must say, even if... even if the equitable doctrine of estoppel were applicable, I'm... it's not clear to me how the equities are in this case."
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,1814.039,1816.641,"Justice Scalia, I think--"
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.641,1818.041,--and equitable case for your client?
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,1818.041,1818.791,--Absolutely.
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1818.791,1826.445,That... that he mistakenly used the... the working capacity that he had instead of sitting at home and... and collecting his... his benefits?
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,1826.445,1836.169,"Justice Scalia, I don't think what Mr. Richmond was doing was anything different than what anybody else does when they try to find out what the rules are."
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.169,1840.704,You don't sue in court claiming the benefits of equity--
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,1840.704,1841.17,I think--
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1841.17,1841.822,--as your client--
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,1841.822,1842.389,--that something is missing.
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1842.389,1844.056,--They... they are adhering to the letter of the law.
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,1856.23,1861.218,"He had the one-time opportunity in that year, 1986, to earn a little extra money."
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1884.483,1893.339,"The only complaint is... is that had he known that the law was the way it was, he would have sat at home instead of earned as much money as he could have."
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,1894.939,1898.041,He would have not earned... he probably would not have earned as much as he did.
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1898.041,1898.641,That's right.
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,1898.641,1900.759,He was only three percent over the rule as it was.
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1900.759,1901.359,"Well, I don't--"
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,1901.359,1901.742,Congress--
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.742,1903.475,--just don't consider that a strong equitable--
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,1903.475,1905.044,"--Just one more point, Justice Scalia."
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1924.374,1930.611,--It's phrased in the terms of he will be deemed to have had his earning capacity restored.
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,1968.117,1972.355,"With all due respect, Your Honor, I think your interpretation of the law's purpose is inaccurate."
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2000.672,2002.291,How was he misled then?
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2010.813,2011.596,"No, Your Honor--"
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2011.596,2013.948,That he would voluntarily have refrained from earning money.
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2013.948,2023.621,"--He was misled because he was led to believe that the old law was in effect, and the old law allowed him to earn 80 percent for two years in a row."
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2035.179,2038.297,"Then, if I had known that, I would have sat at home and been idle--"
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2038.297,2039.314,"--No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2039.314,2040.916,--instead of getting off of this program.
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2040.916,2042.399,He would have earned money anyhow.
1989.88-1943,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2055.608,2058.877,Sounds like he had a bad lawyer.
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2058.877,2075.154,"Well, Justice White, I think that's not a bad point, because I think that's absolutely one of the practical consequences of the government's position, that no one, including a Social Security recipient, would take any action now, vis-a-vis the government, without contacting a lawyer."
1989.88-1943,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.447,2095.382,"The lawyer probably would have asked the Navy anyway, wouldn't he?"
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2096.983,2100.935,"--Maybe, but I hope the lawyer would have looked it up in the statute books."
1989.88-1943,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2100.935,2105.839,"Yeah, you don't need a lawyer just to call the same person that you would have called if you hadn't hired a lawyer."
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2116.628,2122.947,Only in the sense that it... it briefly details the facts.
1989.88-1943,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2142.825,2143.975,"Well, just out of... just out of date."
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2143.975,2162.738,"--It was, at the time Mr. Richmond received it, approximately four and a half years out of date, and I believe it remained out of date in that particular office until 1987 when finally Mr. Richmond, at their request, brought in the notice informing him that he had been taken off the disability annuity because he had violated the one-year rule."
1989.88-1943,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.844,2173.794,Maybe this should have been a class action.
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2174.713,2186.187,--which... which applied the traditional common law doctrine of equitable estoppel to require the government to apply the law as it was formerly in effect.
1989.88-1943,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2219.175,2225.229,"Well, has the court... has this Court ever held that the government is estopped in a situation like this?"
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2225.229,2232.233,"I think it's... it's held at least twice that the government should be estopped, although it did not use that language, Your Honor."
1989.88-1943,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2240.82,2242.921,"Well, it's... it's left the question open, has it not?"
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2242.921,2250.194,--I would say that it has left the question open but it has strongly hinted that estoppel might be appropriate if certain circumstances existed.
1989.88-1943,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2281.297,2282.581,By what case?
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2282.581,2286.783,"I think the Moser case in 1951, just four years later."
1989.88-1943,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2286.783,2289.251,Which didn't even use the word estoppel?
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2289.251,2295.155,"It declined to use the word estoppel, Your Honor, but all of the language in that case is estoppel-like language."
1989.88-1943,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2300.107,2303.91,But it didn't even... Moser doesn't even cite Federal Crop Insurance.
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2303.91,2311.998,"No, it doesn't, and I think that might be a hint that perhaps the Moser court had decided to reject the strict analysis in Merrill."
1989.88-1943,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2311.998,2314.216,Or didn't know about it perhaps.
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2314.632,2318.418,"Well, six members of the Merrill majority were still... were on the Moser court at that time."
1989.88-1943,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2323.655,2325.305,What about... what about PICCO?
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2325.305,2333.428,"--The PICCO case was a criminal case, but there's been no indication, other than the statement today in open Court, that that should make any difference."
1989.88-1943,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.568,2348.37,"Well, at least the agency had said it in a regulation."
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2348.37,2353.007,"I don't think that should make any difference, Justice White, based on the government's decision."
1989.88-1943,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2353.007,2353.741,"But... but that was the case, wasn't it?"
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2353.741,2357.959,"It was a regulation and the agency's regulation was wrong, as this Court determined."
1989.88-1943,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.664,2402.405,I guess the government has never claimed in this case that the person that gave the advise wasn't seemingly authorized to give such advise?
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2402.405,2404.357,"--Well, I don't think there's any doubt about authorization."
1989.88-1943,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2408.844,2409.428,And it was a written--
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2409.428,2411.078,A written document.
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2421.401,2426.889,"--Mr. Deford, how does... how does your theory work in a case such as this?"
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2462.645,2466.43,The veto... the President's of the law was overridden?
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2466.43,2471.251,The... the... the President tried to eliminate the earnings provision.
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2475.636,2484.559,I think in that instance you'd have some major separations of powers problems between Congress and the Executive.
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2484.559,2485.975,"Well, I'm... I'm asking what happens in a lawsuit."
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2490.06,2493.129,I think if they had vested rights to those benefits they should win.
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2497.497,2502.318,Doesn't it strike you as odd that he can achieve by estoppel what he couldn't achieve by veto?
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2502.318,2509.673,--I would not think that... that Congress would allow that kind of regulation to remain available for very long.
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2515.577,2525.933,"You're talking about the theory of... of what you're urging upon the Court, the theory that somehow the Executive can contradict what the Congress has said and make it stick."
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2525.933,2531.67,"Your Honor, you're talking about the Executive acting intentionally to violate the will of Congress."
1989.88-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2541.86,2545.18,I had always thought estoppel was even worse if it was intentional.
1989.88-1943,1,25222,gill_deford,,2547.514,2548.131,No.
1989.88-1943,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3554.483,3556.102,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-1943,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3637.204,3637.937,Where are you--
1989.88-1943,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3637.937,3651.195,"--Attachment 4, page 1(a) of our opening brief, does not, to my reading of it, apply to Mr. Richmond."
1989.88-1943,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3794.872,3796.122,"Thank you, General Starr."
