1982.81-1203,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,3.467,We'll hear arguments next in Cone Memorial Hospital against Mercury Construction.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,8.104,12.042,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,37.186,40.185,"You didn't put in the word ""federal"" before that ""issue""."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,41.373,42.949,It is a federal district court.
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,42.949,46.104,"I know, but federal issue pending before the courts."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,46.104,47.543,"It is not a federal issue, Your Honor."
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,47.543,49.727,I wouldn't think you would think it is.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,49.727,55.382,The issue is arbitration provided by both the federal act and the state act.
1982.81-1203,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,55.382,61.442,But your position would be that the consequence is the same in terms of enforcing arbitration or not enforcing it.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,61.442,62.677,"They are, Your Honor."
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,62.677,75.779,"If the question is whether under the contract between the parties arbitration is required, in this case is it a matter of state law or federal law?"
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,75.779,79.027,It is to be decided under the Federal Arbitration Act.
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,79.027,84.588,"I know, but what... that's the jurisdictional thing for the federal court."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,84.588,87.462,"Your Honor, that is both federal and state law."
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,88.746,97.566,You mean... the Federal Aribration Act converts a contract question normally controlled by state law into a federal question?
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,97.566,100.616,--It is not a federal question in terms of federal--
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,100.616,103.957,Suppose a hospital sued a contractor for breach of contract.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,105.096,107.08,--The state law of North Carolina.
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,107.08,108.047,Exactly.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,120.011,123.213,Unless the Federal Arbitration Act applies.
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,123.213,135.926,"I just said the only thing it said... my question was if they sued him in state court for an order to arbitrate, that's all, to enforce the contract, it would be a state law question."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,139.786,149.546,"I think my answer is yes, it would be a state law question, and the Federal Arbitration Act is a part of the law of the state of North Carolina."
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,149.546,159.244,"Okay, but if you sue under the Federal Arbitration Act, then whether or not the construction of the contract is to be decided by federal law or by state law?"
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,159.244,162.337,I have trouble answering the question.
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,162.337,163.167,You should.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,163.167,163.947,In that the construction--
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,163.947,166.01,"You should have trouble, and you shouldn't hurry."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,175.693,177.163,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1982.81-1203,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,177.163,182.876,So to that extent there is a federal statutory question involved.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,182.876,185.971,There is a federal statutory question involved.
1982.81-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,257.613,263.05,"That really is preliminary in any analytical sense to the Arbitration Act question, isn't it?"
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,267.764,274.65,"It is jurisdictional in the court of appeals, and that court, absent jurisdiction, could not proceed."
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,428.431,438.208,"Was the question involved in the state court suit that was removed, did that have any federal issue in it?"
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,438.208,441.861,"It had no federal issue in it, Your Honor."
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,441.861,446.408,"And it was going to be controlled wholly by state law; namely, whether the dispute was arbitrable?"
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,446.408,447.547,"No, sir."
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,447.547,448.421,What was it?
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,448.421,454.606,The question in the state court suit was... one of the questions was whether the dispute was arbitrable; you're right.
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,454.606,455.015,All right.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,472.773,473.584,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,479.628,487.517,"Suppose the removal to the federal court was all that had happened, and suppose the removal was justified."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,495.948,501.306,A matter of state law when you define it as I've already defined it for Your Honor.
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,501.306,502.167,Exactly.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,506.585,508.991,"State law, including the Federal Arbitration Act."
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,510.068,514.193,"How does the Federal Arbitration Act get into it, just because it's removed to federal court?"
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,514.193,526.203,"If the arbitration question arises in a contract which is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act; to-wit: one in commerce, in this context--"
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,526.203,537.809,"Well, it may be that federal courts can enforce promises to arbitrate under the Arbitration Act, but that doesn't mean that whether they're arbitrable or not is a matter of federal law."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,537.809,545.195,--They cannot enforce such contracts absent diversity and amount in controversy requirements of the diversity statute.
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.23,610.698,Yes.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,610.698,615.058,--And it makes no difference which court decides the question.
1982.81-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,615.058,620.041,But you say it could be either state law or federal.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,623.415,625.209,No federal law of contracts.
1982.81-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,637.581,642.811,And a federal court sitting in diversity would apply North Carolina law to a contract dispute.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,642.811,643.782,Absolutely.
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,643.782,649.136,Including whether or not a particular dispute is arbitrable under the contract.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,649.136,650.076,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,656.479,656.947,No.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,669.785,677.561,"Your Honor, that's the same kind of question that Justice Fortis wrestled with in the Prima Paint case."
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,693.119,695.881,"Well, I agree with that."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,695.881,700.427,You do apply the arbitration law to that question.
1982.81-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,713.218,724.713,"Mr. Floyd, supposing in a somewhat different situation the North Carolina law had a statute of frauds for arbitration agreements that required them to be in writing and signed by the party to be charged."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,743.111,747.986,I assume Your Honor is asking about a contract otherwise in commerce.
1982.81-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,747.986,748.703,Yes.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,748.703,752.377,"And therefore, the provisions of the act are invoked."
1982.81-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,762.682,765.634,How do you know whether it's compatible with the federal act or not?
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,765.634,777.504,"Well, if the federal act says go arbitrate and the state law says you don't have to for whatever reason in this case, then my answer is you go arbitrate because the federal law is supreme."
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,777.504,790.783,"Then, Mr. Floyd, are you saying that in this case,... under Section 4 of the federal statute, as I read it, there are only two issues; one, was there a contract containing an arbitration clause, and I guess that's not in dispute, is it?"
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,790.783,793.766,There is no dispute about the contract.
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,793.766,800.433,"And the second issue is did one of the parties refuse to arbitrate, and I guess that's not in dispute; you did refuse to arbitrate."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,802.917,804.633,"We are not in arbitration, obviously--"
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,804.633,805.714,So you have refused.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,812.74,819.502,"--The answer is yes, once he has conducted the hearing that the act requires."
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.502,822.267,Why do you need a hearing if there are no disputed issues?
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,822.267,825.531,The disputed issues are the making of the agreement.
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,825.531,829.139,"I thought you said you admitted that, and I think your pleadings do."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,829.139,830.078,"The agreement, Your Honor,--"
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,830.078,832.983,"In this case, neither of those issues is disputed."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,832.983,834.73,--The agreement is a book that long.
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,834.73,835.935,I understand.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,838.278,841.433,I do not deny it contains an arbitration clause--
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,841.433,843.242,"Therefore, the first condition of the statute is satisfied."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,850.912,851.926,--That's correct.
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,931.161,934.144,Isn't those... aren't those questions that the arbitrator will review?
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,934.144,935.692,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,972.035,991.919,"Suppose that the hospital had been engaged in a dispute with another contractor under the very same words of another contract and the state court had ruled that as a matter of state law, this particular kind of a dispute that you're talking about now was not subject to the arbitration clause in the contract."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1019.532,1021.828,I don't think a federal court--
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1021.828,1023.813,"You should say yes, but--"
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1023.813,1026.652,--I don't think a federal court would apply state law.
1982.81-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1030.356,1030.902,--You go ahead.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1034.666,1040.101,"--I think Prima requires that the court, regardless of state or federal,--"
1982.81-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1040.101,1041.914,"Well, that doesn't help your case, does it?"
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1046.66,1051.722,--Because I'm afraid that that's the way the law's developed.
1982.81-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1054.549,1058.671,"Well, it develops through cases and decisions of this Court such as the one before it right now."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1058.671,1060.64,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1328.108,1341.292,"If we were to agree with you on the appealability issue, then would the respondent still be entitled to seek mandamus in the court of appeals which they originally sought as an alternate to the appeal?"
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1341.292,1345.32,"Your Honor, I think the alternate was the appeal to mandamus."
1982.81-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1349.49,1350.974,"Well, they got appeal."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1350.974,1352.316,They got appeal.
1982.81-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1352.316,1357.877,"And if we say they shouldn't have gotten the appeal, would they be free to go back to the court of appeals and seek mandamus?"
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1357.877,1362.689,I think the court of appeals denied mandamus in this case.
1982.81-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1376.587,1380.619,"But of course, one of the reasons you deny mandamus is if you think an appeal is available."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1383.118,1384.069,That is the court's--
1982.81-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1384.069,1392.036,"If the court of appeals now saw that no appeal was available, might it not be at least more inclined than it was to grant mandamus?"
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1392.036,1393.502,"--It might be, Your Honor."
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1466.272,1470.222,"I have another question if I may, Mr. Floyd."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1509.517,1511.097,"I think not, Your Honor."
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.097,1512.048,You see the distinction I'm trying to draw?
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1512.048,1512.737,I do.
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1530.573,1531.213,Correct.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1531.213,1533.697,That the federal courts have largely overruled.
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.868,1537.663,Correct.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1537.663,1541.036,That is not what is intended by the language that you read.
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1569.541,1573.586,It was a condition precedent other than timeliness that they failed to comply with.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1580.398,1586.318,Because they did not submit the dispute to the arbitrator during the course of construction.
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1586.318,1588.096,"--Well, that's back to timeliness."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1588.096,1590.502,"No, sir."
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1614.429,1615.821,I understand.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1621.285,1622.958,During the process of construction.
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1622.958,1625.161,And there's a factual dispute as to whether or not they did that.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1625.161,1625.925,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1625.925,1626.752,And you're saying that's--
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1626.752,1627.563,"Well, there's no factual dispute."
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1629.158,1634.281,"--You're saying that's an issue that the judge must decide, not the arbitrator."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1634.281,1635.342,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1641.869,1643.886,Is the contract in the papers before us?
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1643.886,1646.12,The entire contract is not.
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.695,1650.725,Is the portion of the contract that describes this condition you've just discussed--
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1650.725,1651.883,"It is, Your Honor."
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1651.883,1652.944,--Can you tell me where?
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1652.944,1665.064,"It's in the Joint Appendix, JA28 begins the provisions of the contract."
1982.81-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1669.799,1672.876,Thank you.
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1672.876,1682.932,I feel like I shouldn't sit down without mentioning this Court's decision in Colorado River and in the Will case.
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1731.445,1741.487,"Well, your opponent says that the same issue of federal law was involved in both the state suit and the federal suit."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1765.944,1768.287,It's the only issue in the Section 4 of the petition.
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1768.287,1783.501,"Well, if the arbitrability is the central issue, and if that's a matter of state law, then this case might even have been subject to a motion to stay under Pullman."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1791.701,1793.842,I would certainly agree with that.
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1803.211,1806.304,"I know, but the... well, we don't need to argue."
1982.81-1203,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1806.304,1809.599,"If you want to save any time for rebuttal, you'd better save it."
1982.81-1203,0,30355,jack_w_floyd,,1809.599,1811.381,I do not care for rebuttal.
1982.81-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1813.191,1814.302,Good for you.
1982.81-1203,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1816.05,1822.908,Mr. Gaede.
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,1822.908,1827.374,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1890.066,1891.86,"Well, the question is the agreement to arbitrate."
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,1904.342,1906.121,"--Your Honor, I believe--"
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1906.121,1908.589,But... just bear with me a minute.
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,1928.532,1930.546,"--Your Honor, in our view that would be a matter of federal law."
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1930.546,1931.732,Why would that be?
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,1931.732,1943.494,"Because under the Federal Arbitration Act, the courts are charged to... if they find an agreement to arbitrate--"
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.494,1948.212,"They can find it, but the question is what law governs that determination."
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,1960.441,1972.887,"--Your Honor, as the Federal Arbitration Act has developed in the circuit courts, the circuit courts have developed a body of substantive federal law for the purpose of interpreting the Federal Arbitration Act."
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1972.887,1979.447,"Well, that may be so, but is it a body of federal law interpreting contracts that otherwise would be governed by state law?"
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,1979.447,1985.149,It is a body of law for interpreting the enforceability of arbitration agreements.
1982.81-1203,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1987.165,1988.431,But if it's an agreement.
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,1989.695,1999.783,"--I can agree with you very easily, Your Honor, that if it says disputes involving X are not subject to arbitration, then clearly, there's no agreement to arbitrate."
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2008.125,2018.855,"--But if the contract says X disputes are subject to arbitration and Y disputes are not, but then there's an argument about whether it's X or Y, what law governs?"
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2018.855,2034.27,"--I believe that the... I believe that properly interpreted, the federal substantive law should apply, but in most instances that would be, I suspect, the adoption of state law."
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2034.27,2036.739,I would think they would be governed by--
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2038.58,2040.221,That would be a contract question.
1982.81-1203,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2040.221,2044.612,"Then where did you get federal substantive law of contracts, which is the answer you just gave."
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2044.612,2051.186,"There are certain situations where federal courts have, in effect, adopted a federal substantive law of contracts."
1982.81-1203,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2051.186,2054.808,"Well, what cases from this Court support that in this particular situation?"
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2054.808,2058.649,In this particular situation I think the Prima Paint case--
1982.81-1203,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2058.649,2070.114,I thought Prima didn't address that question as to what law would govern if you were trying to determine whether or not the dispute between the parties was arbitrable.
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2073.332,2082.094,"--I have to... I will agree, Your Honor, that Prima Paint did not deal directly with that question, but I think the fair inference from Prima Paint is that that would be the result."
1982.81-1203,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2082.094,2088.513,"Well, if it was conceded that it was arbitrable, Prima Paint didn't have to decide that question."
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2090.919,2092.435,"That is certainly correct, yes, sir."
1982.81-1203,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2153.237,2167.637,Supposing if we were to follow that we would have to tell the district court of North Carolina to apply substantive state law in determining whether or not the particular agreement did render it arbitrable.
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2185.115,2188.161,"Your Honor, I think not for several reasons."
1982.81-1203,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2251.621,2258.679,The question here is not embraced in the proposition that there's an agreement to arbitrate.
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2274.94,2276.391,"Yes, Your Honor, I agree with that."
1982.81-1203,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2276.391,2281.905,And isn't the state court better able to do that than to have a federal court do it under a diversity route?
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2281.905,2283.403,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1982.81-1203,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2283.403,2285.871,"And that's what the district court did decide, didn't he?"
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2285.871,2291.244,"I think the district court in this case, in a sense, abdicated its responsibility."
1982.81-1203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2363.264,2372.292,"Well, only part of it I think, because one branch of his argument is that it's not ripe for arbitration until it's been submitted to the architect and passed on by the architect."
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2375.102,2394.577,"Your Honor, in the record, there's also an affidavit by the architect which says if he had made a decision and had advised the hospital of that decision, that may client was entitled to be paid between $600,000 and $1,200,000 prior to the time that the hospital went into state court in North Carolina."
1982.81-1203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2396.577,2401.417,Was that affidavit before the federal judge at the time you presented your petition for certiorari?
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2401.417,2402.044,"--Yes, it was."
1982.81-1203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2402.044,2403.23,What?
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2403.23,2405.963,"Excuse me, Your Honor, I misspoke."
1982.81-1203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2412.227,2413.085,I see.
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2414.945,2416.477,They did not.
1982.81-1203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2422.91,2424.626,"Just tell me, where is that in the record?"
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2426.222,2429.501,"--Yes, sir, it's in the Joint Appendix, at page 40, as I recall, Your Honor."
1982.81-1203,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2607.085,2629.48,"Are you saying that the district court, in entering that order, ruled out the possibility that if after three months you could show that there was simply no progress made in the state court and that your opponent was blocking normal process, that the district court might not entertain an application to lift the stay?"
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2629.48,2638.994,"Your Honor, I suppose that it is conceivable that the state court could have done nothing whatsoever and that we would have attempted to come back in and have the stay lifted."
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2762.866,2781.201,"Suppose under the state law of contracts matters of timeliness, waiver and latches are matters for a court to decide."
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2811.158,2812.596,"I believe not, Your Honor."
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.418,2823.792,Despite what the state law... how it would come out in a suit for damages in a state court.
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2823.792,2825.028,--Yes.
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2825.028,2831.072,The state law must decide it as a federal matter.
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2831.072,2831.945,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2842.24,2847.829,But is that an issue that's normally decided by the court or by the arbitrator--
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2847.829,2851.409,"That's an issue that's almost, without fail, decided by the arbitrators."
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2851.409,2854.422,--The court refers those issues to the arbitrator.
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2858.28,2859.184,"That is correct, sir."
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2859.184,2864.947,And that that prevails over any contrary state rule where there's a demand for arbitration.
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2864.947,2866.151,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2875.522,2876.411,"Yes, I understand that."
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,2883.91,2884.425,That is correct.
1982.81-1203,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3019.399,3041.532,"But the theory of the & Lybrand v. Livesay, was the same sort of practical analysis as yours, wasn't it; that as a practical matter, the case is over when they refused to certify the class because all the plaintiff has at stake is $30.00."
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,3041.532,3047.295,"Your Honor, but that underlying cause of action still exists."
1982.81-1203,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3062.024,3067.819,"But if the state court doesn't rule, you did say that you thought the judge might entertain a motion to--"
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,3067.819,3071.286,"If the state court sat on it for a long time, the district court might."
1982.81-1203,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3082.734,3086.762,"--Well, I suppose the state court could enforce the remedies, couldn't it?"
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,3086.762,3097.104,"The state court does not... under the Federal Arbitration Act, Justice O'Connor, only the federal court can issue an order compelling arbitration."
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3206.138,3223.254,"I don't mean to bring this up time and again, but suppose there is a real honest question as to whether under the language in a contract a particular dispute is arbitrable or not."
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,3268.425,3278.918,"Your Honor, I believe that that would be contrary to the intent and purpose of the Federal Arbitration Act, and I believe that Congress in its wisdom, having granted--"
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3278.918,3286.495,It just wanted the federal courts to just take charge of arbitration cases.
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,3286.495,3292.306,"--I think to the extent that the underlying jurisdiction was available, the answer to that is yes."
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3292.306,3298.084,Do you have to have a diversity case to get in federal court under the Arbitration Act?
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,3298.084,3306.426,"You don't have to have a diversity case, but you have to have a basis for jurisdiction other than a federal question of a basis of jurisdiction."
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3306.426,3309.487,"Well, the Federal Arbitration Act is not a jurisdictional statute."
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,3310.782,3311.078,That's correct.
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3311.656,3312.124,All right.
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,3312.124,3315.594,It does not set up its own independent jurisdiction--
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3315.594,3339.911,"So suppose all the parties are... well, if you think that... if the coverage question, the arbitrability question is a matter of federal law, why wouldn't any action to enforce a contract, promise to arbitrate under the Federal Arbitration Act, why wouldn't that necessarily be arising under federal law?"
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,3339.911,3345.815,"--Your Honor, we believe that it is an issue that is to be determined by federal substantive law--"
1982.81-1203,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3345.815,3346.642,"Well, if it is--"
1982.81-1203,1,16031,ah_gaede_jr,,3346.642,3352.561,"--but if it happens to be decided in the state court, the state court is obligated to apply that federal substantive law."
1982.81-1203,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3656.17,3656.673,"Thank you, gentlemen."
