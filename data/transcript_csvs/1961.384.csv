1961.384,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,17.432,"Number 384, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, versus Sally L. Bilder, etcetera."
1961.384,0,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,19.116,23.015,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1961.384,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,257.704,262.728,"-- don't question out the deductibility of the travel expenses, of the transportation expenses."
1961.384,0,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,262.728,266.164,There is no question of the deductibility of the transportation expense --
1961.384,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,266.164,266.57,Right.
1961.384,0,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,266.57,267.333,No.
1961.384,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,267.812,271.94,"And there's also -- well, I've interrupted you, there's no question here as to the apportionment of the rent."
1961.384,0,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,272.768,275.081,There is also no question of the apportionment of rent.
1961.384,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,276.003,276.229,"Surely, the --"
1961.384,0,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,276.229,279.613,-- whether the rent is deductible.
1961.384,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,508.404,515.421,Was there no comparable provision than the 1939 Code with Section 262 of the -- of the --
1961.384,0,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,515.421,543.389,"The provision which is similar to Section 262 was Section 24 (a) (1) which provided that no deduction shall be allowed for personal living or family expenses except for extraordinary medical expenses as defined in Section 23 (x), which was the medical deduction section, Justice Harlan."
1961.384,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,543.389,545.328,Thank you.
1961.384,0,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,545.328,567.614,"The taxpayer, we believe, has no reasonable explanation for the change in the 1954 Code.He asserts that Congress wanted to be positive that transportation expenses would be deductible, although also intending to permit meals and lodgings."
1961.384,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,852.669,853.595,"The what, line drawing?"
1961.384,0,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,853.595,858.535,That line drawing is the difficult issue presented by the claim.
1961.384,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,874.725,876.661,You may.
1961.384,1,35632,martin_d_cohen,,879.284,881.427,May it please the Court.
1961.384,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,950.348,951.623,Expressly provided.
1961.384,1,35632,martin_d_cohen,,951.623,952.845,"Expressly, as you say Your Honor."
1961.384,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,952.845,954.816,Yes.
1961.384,1,35632,martin_d_cohen,,954.816,963.767,The Government then goes on from there to say where in the Code is there any expressed provision for lodging in a case such as this.
1961.384,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,963.767,966.401,Does it say in the Code or in the Chapter?
1961.384,1,35632,martin_d_cohen,,966.401,969.881,"It says in the Chapter, but I think it refers to the income tax provisions of the Code."
1961.384,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,969.881,970.1,Yes.
1961.384,1,35632,martin_d_cohen,,970.1,970.468,-- Code.
1961.384,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,970.468,974.538,Yes.
1961.384,1,35632,martin_d_cohen,,974.538,1002.948,"Our answer to this contention is that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue service himself, has undermined that argument by providing in rulings and regulations which he has promulgated that at least four situations he will in fact allow lodging expense and, indeed, food, despite the absence of an expressed provision in the Chapter, referred to in 262."
1961.384,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1200.619,1203.398,What page is this please?
1961.384,1,35632,martin_d_cohen,,1203.398,1206.163,"It would be, if the Court please, in the cumulative bulletin."
1961.384,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1206.163,1206.788,You haven't got it --
1961.384,1,35632,martin_d_cohen,,1206.788,1211.921,"I just took some inserts for convenience, but the revenue ruling is cited in our brief."
1961.384,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1296.179,1299.608,"But that's covered by the statute, isn't it?"
1961.384,1,35632,martin_d_cohen,,1299.608,1300.929,"This is under the 1939 Code, Your Honor."
1961.384,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1300.929,1301.903,I beg your pardon.
1961.384,1,35632,martin_d_cohen,,1301.903,1302.779,And that had not been expressly covered.
1961.384,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1302.779,1304.225,I beg your pardon.
1961.384,1,35632,martin_d_cohen,,1304.225,1340.59,"So, I say that the Commissioner, himself, has furnished the answer to his own question, what would be the purpose for the addition of this subparagraph (b), and I say it is to clarify the difference between transportation of a physically handicapped person who is not, however, using the transportation to receive medical care and the transportation expense of one who is using the transportation in order to obtain medical care and I feel that is a far less strained interpreta -- explanation of the addition of subparagraph (b) than the one from which the Government contends."
1961.384,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1547.36,1556.088,"Your argument is very appealing but it does presuppose that the tax laws of particular allowances is a very logical system, doesn't it?"
1961.384,1,35632,martin_d_cohen,,1556.088,1561.802,"I wouldn't want to undertake to get into that one, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1961.384,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2143.341,2155.767,"If this man had gone into a hospital down in Florida, instead of a boarding house, would he get the deduction?"
1961.384,1,35632,martin_d_cohen,,2155.767,2161.443,"I think, Your Honor, before I can answer that question I would have to know on what basis the doctor suggested that he take that course of --"
1961.384,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2161.443,2178.168,"Suppose the doctor said “I want you to be where you can press a button and have medical advice, a moment's notice, and if you can't get lodgings either close enough to this kind of service, then you better go into a hospital.”"
1961.384,1,35632,martin_d_cohen,,2178.168,2185.828,"I would say that if a taxpayer receives such advice from the doctor in good faith on both sides, on the doctor's side, on the taxpayer's side --"
1961.384,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2185.828,2187.639,There's no question of good faith involved in --
1961.384,1,35632,martin_d_cohen,,2187.639,2188.118,No.
1961.384,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2188.118,2189.122,-- (Inaudible) record.
1961.384,1,35632,martin_d_cohen,,2189.122,2205.212,"I would say that, then, he must -- he must having incurred that expense because of obedience to a doctor's advice, be permitted the deduction."
1961.384,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2217.875,2220.489,Mr. Pollak.
1961.384,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2220.489,2224.388,"Mr. Pollak, how would you answer Mr. Justice Harlan's hypothetical?"
1961.384,2,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2224.388,2237.869,"I would state that if the taxpayer's medical advice was that he repaired a hospital in Florida, his meals and lodgings provided as part of the hospital bill will be deductible."
1961.384,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2245.002,2249.591,It's hard for me to make any sense by distinction between the two cases.
1961.384,2,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2258.079,2270.861,"Well, Congress has indicated the lines that it's drawn and that those -- it is that line which we're standing on in this Court."
1961.384,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2270.861,2277.598,"Well, I think you're entitled to it and I think you'd better walk that rope just as straight as you can."
1961.384,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2277.598,2294.023,"Mr. Pollak, suppose this varies from Mr. Justice Harlan's hypothetical, I gather from what Mr. Cohen has told us that not too many hospitals or something akin to a hospital the same rules apply."
1961.384,2,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2294.023,2294.415,The --
1961.384,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2294.415,2306.135,"Suppose that, if that's so, suppose this was some kind of a convalescent home in Florida rather than a hospital to which the doctor sent him."
1961.384,2,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2306.135,2322.857,"Well, Mr. Cohen's hypotheticals pose the question that there are always some problems that are close to the line."
1961.384,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2337.599,2338.75,I understand your position.
1961.384,2,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2339.031,2339.611,Yes.
1961.384,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2339.611,2346.668,"-- I'm just interested what would happen if, rather than to a hospital, the doctor told him to go to a convalescent home and he did."
1961.384,2,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2346.668,2353.553,The -- might I rely on the regulations which state the Commissioner's position.
1961.384,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2411.906,2434.382,"Well, I suppose it might be the condition that the doctor was satisfied required the climate of Florida but, also, the condition was such that he had to be right nearby some care, not necessarily a hospital care, but that kind of a professional care that a convalescent home or otherwise might provide."
1961.384,2,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2434.382,2438.152,"And, he would then be in a home for medical care?"
1961.384,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2438.152,2438.399,Yes.
1961.384,2,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2438.399,2439.133,In that home.
1961.384,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2439.133,2441.569,In that sense.
1961.384,2,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2441.569,2454.262,"Well, I believe if he is in an institution and, therefore, the medical care which he receives is institution bill, be it including lodgings and food is deductible."
1961.384,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2454.262,2458.93,"Of course Blue Cross draws this kind of distinction, too, doesn't it?"
1961.384,2,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2471.789,2473.495,I accept your characterization --
1961.384,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2473.495,2473.838,"Well, I'm just saying --"
1961.384,2,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2473.838,2476.739,-- of Blue Cross (Inaudible) insured me.
1961.384,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2480.89,2482.435,You never had to use it.
1961.384,2,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2482.435,2494.304,"And, I haven't been so I can't tell whether they draw the same line."
1961.384,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2568.705,2573.437,So that -- so far the Eisenhower statement is in your brief?
1961.384,2,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2573.437,2575.603,It is -- it is not in our brief.
1961.384,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2579.884,2588.4,But what's -- where can you find it?
1961.384,2,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2588.4,2596.66,It is at 1 U.S.C. Congressional and Administrative News 1565.
1961.384,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2596.66,2597.32,Thank you.
1961.384,2,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2597.32,2604.986,"It's the budget message of January 21, 1954."
1961.384,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2604.986,2610.503,Very well.
