1984.83-6607,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.317,We will hear arguments first this morning in Caldwell against Mississippi.
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,12.89,20.923,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, this case is here on certiorari to the Mississippi Supreme Court."
1984.83-6607,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,129.536,131.416,"He did a little more than that, didn't he?"
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,131.416,132.848,Yes.
1984.83-6607,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,132.848,141.174,"He said, in effect, if you render a verdict of guilty here and return that sentence, you will be the killers."
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,141.174,143.314,"Yes, he did."
1984.83-6607,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,272.508,288.609,"Mr. Boyle, in your view, would it be error or a violation of due process for a court to instruct a jury correctly and accurately concerning the existence and scope of appellate review?"
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,288.609,290.68,"It would not, Your Honor."
1984.83-6607,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,455.487,459.45,But isn't that a state law distinction in essence?
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,477.343,493.462,"If we are talking just about that element, that would be a matter for the state to determine and so advise the judges of the trial courts that this is a matter for particular instruction for the jury."
1984.83-6607,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,504.77,511.944,"But I thought your point that you were just making had nothing to do with the misleading character, but had something to do about articulated state policy."
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,511.944,540.354,"There is another reason with regard to the state policy why it would not be admissible, and that is, this Court made it clear that under California law in the Ramos case evidence was permitted on the factor which this Court equated with future dangerousness as being a question of fact, and evidence was admissible with regard to that element, and counsel could comment on it."
1984.83-6607,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,578.049,587.064,"Then you are saying, I guess, that a state supreme court is not to be given the same deference as a state legislature in speaking out on a matter of state policy."
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,587.064,590.815,I don't think we are saying that at all.
1984.83-6607,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,693.084,697.935,"Mr. Boyle, do you read Young as being a constitutional decision?"
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,697.935,705.021,I read it as... we were dealing with... the Court was dealing with a federal prosecutor in that case.
1984.83-6607,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,709.245,712.766,Does the opinion cite the due process clause.
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,712.766,717.65,"I haven't got it with me, Your Honor, but it dealt with--"
1984.83-6607,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,717.65,718.69,I didn't think it did.
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,718.69,721.113,--I stand corrected.
1984.83-6607,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,845.414,876.844,"Do you think there was any indication in Ebbits against Lucy, first of all, that it extends to other experts other than the psychiatric help, and secondly, do you think that there is any indication in it that a state can't have a rule that says the defense has to specify the cost in any event and make the other showing that the state thinks would be necessary?"
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,876.844,886.051,I don't see the applicability of Ebbits at all.
1984.83-6607,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1016.726,1019.478,Wasn't this a case where there was an eye witness?
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1019.478,1021.209,There was an eye witness.
1984.83-6607,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1154.057,1163.211,"Mr. Boyle, is there anything in the cases from this Court that you find that say a state cannot require as prerequisite the appointment of any expert--"
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1163.211,1164.333,"No, there is not."
1984.83-6607,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1164.333,1169.458,--witnesses that there be a threshold showing of need and cost and so forth?
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1169.458,1170.417,There is not.
1984.83-6607,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1182.416,1183.747,Why does it need to?
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1193.651,1201.288,"The problem here is that they are construing... let's say that there's a statutory right, and that is what the respondent says here."
1984.83-6607,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1281.538,1291.235,Aren't requests by indigent for counsel to represent them matters that are made with notice to the other side?
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1291.235,1294.288,--I don't know if I understand your question.
1984.83-6607,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1294.288,1306.595,"You said that the problem is that there can't be an ex parte proceeding, and requests by an indigent for counsel aren't done in an ex parte setting."
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1306.595,1318.093,"That doesn't have to do with secrets of the defense, or strategy of the defense is probably a better terminology."
1984.83-6607,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1361.981,1368.556,"Even if your contention were to be upheld, wouldn't you still have an equal protection claim?"
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1374.26,1377.052,That is exactly what my point was.
1984.83-6607,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1388.682,1422.062,"But your solution suggests that perhaps to me your definition of the constitutional right is overly broad, because if the defendant is going to have a claim that I have to petition the court to get experts, and the wealthy defendant doesn't have to fool around with a court at all, then the only answer is simply for the legislature to appropriate each year about $5 million or $10 million for whatever services criminal defendants may want, and I dare say there aren't many courts that would sustain that sort of a claim."
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1422.062,1450.86,"Well, call to the Court's attention, Justice Rehnquist, the federal legislation in this area, not that it is constitutionally mandated by virtue of the fact that it comes from Congress, obviously, but this has been interpreted, and I believe that there are serious problems which arise if you are going to make defense counsel in an indigent case tip his hand and put his adversary on notice, this is the very heart of our criminal justice system."
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1474.717,1475.167,Mr. Boyle--
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1475.167,1487.935,"--and I think that is exactly why Congress enacted 18 USC 3006 AE, which is the applicable statute, and expressly provided for ex parte application, and that is the rule in the federal courts."
1984.83-6607,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1487.935,1488.846,--Mr. Boyle--
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1488.846,1490.427,Justice Marshall.
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1490.427,1492.457,--I don't understand this tipping your hand.
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1510.8,1512.793,"No, I think there is more--"
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1512.793,1515.245,What else would you require?
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1515.245,1535.176,"--I think there is more to it, but I think in this case, Justice Marshall, that the statutory requirement is intertwined, inseparably intertwined with the constitutional issue, and I believe that the state--"
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1535.176,1538.319,What more would be required?
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1538.319,1546.764,--I believe that the state interprets that reimbursement statute without recognizing rights in this area.
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1548.645,1557.681,"Did I understand you to say that the Court really said, you aren't entitled to it, but anyhow the state keeps you from getting it?"
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1560.091,1563.414,It is solely a matter of statutory grace or discretion.
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1563.414,1567.458,"Well, would you have to get an expert on fingerprints, too?"
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1567.458,1569.939,In the event that--
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1569.939,1577.544,"Yes, in case his fingerprints are used, would defense counsel automatically get an expert on fingerprints?"
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1577.544,1579.706,--I don't think that it would be automatic.
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1581.275,1582.647,"Well, what other than automatic?"
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1584.928,1592.903,--I believe in this case that it was self-evident from the fact that the prosecution was using a fingerprint expert.
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1597.257,1603.391,Have you ever seen a case involving fingerprints where the government didn't put an expert on?
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1603.391,1604.42,Well--
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1604.42,1605.612,Ever?
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1605.612,1607.773,--They certainly did here.
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1607.773,1613.937,"The first thing the defendant would be up yelping that you can't put them on without an expert, wouldn't he?"
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1613.937,1625.187,"I think certainly in a case where they have relied on an expert, that it is a reasonable request, not only to call an expert on one's own behalf, but also to effectively cross examine."
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1625.187,1626.616,One final question.
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1644.227,1647.991,"Obviously, the answer to that is no, Justice--"
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1647.991,1649.971,"Well, where is your... I am trying to find out what--"
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1649.971,1655.785,"--Justice Marshall, we are talking about very, very fundamental concepts of justice here."
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1655.785,1659.808,--I assume that all constitutional claims are fundamental.
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1659.808,1675.858,"In the event that this Court were to acknowledge in this case that there is a constitutional right in this area, perhaps questions like that would arise, and undoubtedly they would, but we are dealing with a situation--"
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1675.858,1679.13,Would we need some help from defense counsel?
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1679.13,1681.043,--As far as--
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1681.043,1682.292,That is what I am asking.
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1682.292,1683.764,--I certainly think you do.
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1683.764,1685.103,Why don't you give it to me?
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1685.103,1703.827,"We are dealing here with an application which I submit to the Court it was obvious on its face that the prosecution was relying on experts, and for that reason the Court should have been aware of the value of experts in this area."
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1758.592,1763.056,"In this case, did the judge ask counsel to put the money up?"
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1763.056,1764.117,"--No, he did not."
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1764.117,1765.066,"Well, how is it here?"
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1765.066,1766.689,But the Mississippi--
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1766.689,1767.687,How is that point here?
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1767.687,1787.43,"--The Mississippi Supreme Court in Ruffin, in denying the authorization on appeal, indicated that if this was so important, then why didn't counsel go out and fund raise for $500 to bring in the expert, and they accused the defense counsel of sand bagging the court to try to get reversible error."
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1792.756,1795.097,"If we take that out of the opinion, will you be satisfied?"
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1795.097,1798.559,"No, the statute on its face--"
1984.83-6607,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1798.559,1800.2,You can't do it.
1984.83-6607,0,21845,e_thomas_boyle,,1803.721,1821.013,"--I am just pointing out, Justice Marshall, my point is, the bottom line, that the statute for implementing any statutory right is defective on its face and defective as applied here."
1984.83-6607,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1822.695,1827.338,"Your time has expired now, counsel."
1984.83-6607,1,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,1829.32,1848.512,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, initially I would like to briefly summarize the state's position on the three issues that have been raised in this matter."
1984.83-6607,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2037.816,2040.888,"Mr. Boyd, may I ask you one question that just occurred to me?"
1984.83-6607,1,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,2058.849,2063.371,"I am not sure that I understand your question, Your Honor."
1984.83-6607,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2063.371,2077.022,"Apparently the response was needed, as I understand kind of the preliminary comment you made, because it might have been harmful to the prosecutor's case if the jury thought they were going to take him right out immediately and implement the sentence."
1984.83-6607,1,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,2086.599,2090.439,"Your Honor, I am not so sure that it would have harmed the state's case."
1984.83-6607,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2193.217,2200.232,"But all of that just suggests to me that there was really no need to respond to what the defense counsel said, that basically it was a jury decision."
1984.83-6607,1,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,2200.232,2221.887,"From my reading of defense counsel's closing argument, I got the distinct impression, especially when they started talking about the poem that was written by the prisoner in Georgia prior to being executed, that in essence what defense counsel was saying, he was trying to put the blood of this man on the jury's hands, was in essence what they were doing."
1984.83-6607,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2240.647,2246.641,Suppose he argued that if you find him innocent nobody can kill him?
1984.83-6607,1,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,2246.641,2253.496,"Well, we had already passed the guilt-innocence phase at that particular time and were in sentencing."
1984.83-6607,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2253.496,2255.128,"But that would be all right, wouldn't it?"
1984.83-6607,1,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,2255.128,2304.741,"Yes, of course, that is true, that if a life sentence was returned, then of course no one could execute him, but what... our position in this matter is this, that there are a line of cases, particularly emanating from the state of Lousiana, cases such as State v. Berry, State v. Matheson, State v. Monroe, and this Court's decision is Maggio versus Williams, wherein it was discussed a dichotomy more or less or a dual system that they have developed in Lousiana, and that is where the closing argument is addressed to dispelling in the jury's minds the question of arbitrary imposition of death, then such an argument is appropriate under the circumstances."
1984.83-6607,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2304.741,2312.735,"Well, do you concede that the state in any event has no right to make an argument that is misleading on the law?"
1984.83-6607,1,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,2312.735,2317.808,"Oh, I think that's clearly what the law is, that the state cannot make a misleading argument."
1984.83-6607,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2317.808,2318.279,All right.
1984.83-6607,1,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,2323.562,2325.745,"Yes, ma'am, I think so, that--"
1984.83-6607,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2325.745,2342.575,And the question there is whether the prosecutor's remarks indicate that the jury's verdict if they impose death will be automatically reviewed in all its aspects?
1984.83-6607,1,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,2342.575,2352.62,"--Well, I think there is a greater question that we have to answer first, and that is whether this is a matter of state law or whether or not this is a matter of constitutional law."
1984.83-6607,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2387.055,2396.839,It is your position that it does not violate the federal Constitution for a prosecutor to make a misleading argument to the jury?
1984.83-6607,1,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,2398.281,2400.912,"No, ma'am, that is not my position."
1984.83-6607,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2460.071,2462.983,"Reviewed for what, I guess is the question."
1984.83-6607,1,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,2462.983,2463.774,For what.
1984.83-6607,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2508.964,2524.193,"Mr. Boyd, may I ask, what do you interpret the significance of the dissenting Justices' comment that even a novice attorney knows that appellate courts do not impose the death penalty, they merely review the jury sentence and that it reviews with a presumption of correctness?"
1984.83-6607,1,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,2532.2,2534.4,"--Your Honor, I think--"
1984.83-6607,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2534.4,2536.33,And I don't think the majority disagreed with them.
1984.83-6607,1,43878,william_s_boyd_iii,,2536.33,2553.111,"--That is a difficult thing to explain, in that that particular court in the case of Edwards v. State did exactly that, that we had a jury determination that Hezekiah Edwards should be sentenced to death."
1984.83-6607,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3004.441,3018.309,"But can't the defendant say that if a state has sufficient doubt about the other evidence that it is going to call a ballistics expert that the defendant is entitled to call one, too?"
