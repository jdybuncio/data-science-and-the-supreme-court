1973.72-948,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,18.265,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in number 72-948, National Cable Television against the United States and the Federal Communications Commission."
1973.72-948,0,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,23.196,27.414,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-948,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,268.597,287.008,"Somewhere in the briefs or perhaps in the appendix, I saw some figure as to the total cost to the Commission for the people engaged in the regulatory work relating to Cable Television."
1973.72-948,0,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,292.219,309.384,"Yes, the activity costs are on page 31 of the appendix, and it gives the cost as $1,145,400 or 4.6% of the FCC’s budget."
1973.72-948,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,332.799,345.406,Will it be fair to say that if Cable Television disappeared from the face of the earth for some reason or other that most of that million dollars plus would be out of their budget?
1973.72-948,0,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,345.406,351.728,"I would presume so, yes."
1973.72-948,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,464.002,474.197,"Mr. Feldstein, I take that the parties are agreed that the authority to assess these fees focuses in this particular statute, nowhere else, this is it?"
1973.72-948,0,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,474.197,475.822,That is correct.
1973.72-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,575.797,583.006,"Mr. Feldstein, do you think that the Bureau of the Budget Circular covers the Federal Communications Commission?"
1973.72-948,0,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,583.006,587.023,"I do, yes sir."
1973.72-948,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,617.671,633.607,"Let’s assume the Federal Communications Commission wrote back to the Budget Bureau and said that “Your construction of the Act is very interesting, but we have a different view and we prefer our own view.”"
1973.72-948,0,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,640.527,652.254,"No, but in the process of budgets, and the process of promulgating forms, in the process of many things that the Commission does, you must go through the Bureau of the Budget."
1973.72-948,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.11,656.935,"Well I understand that, how about my question?"
1973.72-948,0,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,670.276,688.105,"I think that the Act states that you must follow the criteria that are set down by the President, thus the Act states that subject to such policies as the President may prescribe."
1973.72-948,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,688.105,689.299,Where are you reading now?
1973.72-948,0,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,689.299,695.604,I’m reading in the middle of the Title V which is found on 155 of the appendix.
1973.72-948,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.984,714.691,"But, even so, I don’t suppose the Bureau of the Budget would itself -- I don’t believe to say it would have to be authorized by the Act inconsistently?"
1973.72-948,0,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,714.691,716.28,That’s correct.
1973.72-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,716.28,733.851,"Mr. Feldstein, that part you’re reading from there on page 151 as the policies as a President may prescribe is preceded by the language which in case of agencies in the Executive Branch shall be as uniform as practicable and subject to such policies as the President may subscribe."
1973.72-948,0,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,741.113,762.211,"The Government I believe, has suggested this in one paragraph in its brief, but I believe that the legislative history of the Act substantiates the view that it was intended that such guidelines would be set down for all agencies which were both Congressional and executive departments."
1973.72-948,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,779.87,818.198,"Going back to Mr. Justice White’s question about the posture of Bureau of the Budget Circular, I suppose it’s a fact that all of the agencies must put their budgets through the Bureau of the Budget, and that historically it has been a coordinating agency and because of its authority, shape, and frame the budgets of the agencies, it has considerable leverage, does it not?"
1973.72-948,0,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,818.198,820.261,"That is correct, yes."
1973.72-948,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,820.261,835.533,"Whether this Congress of course could increase a budget, but to the Budget Bureau has initially a great deal of authority in the way of enforcement here, do they not?"
1973.72-948,0,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,835.533,844.83,"Yes, thus when the Commission goes to the Bureau of the Budget with its budget, difficulties which OMB has are hammered out."
1973.72-948,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,852.537,863.507,"But the agency may not generally ask for something which the Bureau of the Budget and OMB has declined to approve, is this not that correct?"
1973.72-948,0,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,863.507,868.309,That is correct.
1973.72-948,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1255.865,1258.527,This is the Court of Appeals decision?
1973.72-948,0,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,1258.527,1261.009,"Yes, that is correct."
1973.72-948,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1383.454,1395.286,"Would you say that if it were some benefit to the Cable Television Industry when telephone companies were taken out of the play, out of the picture as competitors?"
1973.72-948,0,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,1395.286,1397.371,"Yes, to a certain extent it was true."
1973.72-948,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1591.519,1598.803,Very well Mr. Feldstein.
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1599.954,1604.19,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1892.816,1903.483,"Was this Circular A-25 in fact addressed to the Federal Communications Commission, was the Commission in other words, one of the addressees?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1903.483,1908.355,"Well, the address of the notice as it appears in the appendix --"
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1908.355,1911.144,"Is to the heads of executive departments and establishments, and I wonder if that --"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1911.144,1912.626,"It may very well have been, I’m not certain of that."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1912.626,1916.033,I wonder if that did or did not include the Federal Communications Commission?
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1916.033,1918.684,I’m not certain of whether they were actually on the mailing list.
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1947.779,1956.732,"Well, I thought that your point or a point that you made is that the Commission is not an executive department, and or establishment?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1956.732,1958.818,"That’s correct, but nevertheless --"
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1958.818,1971.206,"And further that the statute Title V, requires uniformity to the extent practicable only with respect to agencies in the Executive Branch?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1971.206,1976.122,"That’s correct, but nevertheless, as a matter of policy, I’m not suggesting that it would be undesirable."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1976.122,1977.106,Why?
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1977.106,1980.172,"Well, I think it’s generally it’s a good thing to have a uniform set of schedules."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1980.172,1982.396,Is symmetry just good for its own sake?
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1982.396,1983.963,Well --
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1983.963,1986.022,Should you treat things alike that are different?
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1988.154,2007.482,"No I mean, the Federal Communications Commission as far as the general public is concerned, and as far as the industry is subject to regulation, it’s a small matter to them whether technically the Federal Communications Commission is viewed as part of the Executive Branch, or whether it's viewed as a creature of Congress and an independent regulatory agency."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2263.823,2270.199,"How true if a franchise, it’s not a license in any sense of the word, is it?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2270.199,2271.097,"Well, in the sense --"
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2271.097,2275.813,"I mean it’s not equivalent in other words, to a radio or television broadcasting?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2275.813,2277.845,"Well, it couldn’t operate without it."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2278.48,2280.76,"Well, that doesn’t answer the question, does it?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2280.76,2284.497,"Well, the statute uses words which are not limited to license."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2285.888,2289.965,"Well, that doesn’t answer the question either."
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2289.965,2293.473,"Well, it certainly not the same as the broadcast license."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2293.473,2294.684,"Not a license, is it?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2294.684,2295.187,Well it’s not.
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2295.187,2300.262,It’s not called the license and it isn't a license and there’s no authority is there to license?
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2300.262,2305.802,"Well, it’s called the certificate of compliance without which they couldn’t engage in this activity."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2356.162,2357.129,You mean Title V?
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2357.129,2360.851,"Yes, that could possibly think of to indicate the breadth."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2360.851,2366.044,"Well, in any event the filing fees, the so-called filing fees as such are not an issue here, are they?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2366.044,2389.867,"No, but they’re not really begin to recover to the fullest extent possible the real costs of these proceedings and I think the filing fee for a certificate of compliance is $35 which really covers the mechanics of issuance, the real cost of the hearings, to maintaining staff, in carefully reviewing the certificates, and constantly monitoring the industry."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2389.867,2398.569,"What do you consider that the phrase to the full extent possible, does that mean the same thing as the fullest extent possible?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2398.569,2400.102,"Yes, and --"
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2400.102,2405.62,"You never heard the phrase “to the full extent possible” have you before, anywhere else?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2405.62,2409.885,I haven’t thought about whether I heard it before.
1973.72-948,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2412.563,2424.295,Are you suggesting that the certificate of compliance is to be equated with the certificate of public convenience and necessity for example?
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2424.295,2432.262,"Yes and there are substantial benefits let me say, that accrue as a result of the issuance of the certificates."
1973.72-948,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2432.262,2453.826,"Mr. Korman, would the Commission turn down an application from a proposed CATV applicant by reason of the fact that he duplicated the area covered by someone already having a certificate, or would it leave that up to the local franchiser decision?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2453.826,2457.008,I think it would leave that up to the local franchising authority.
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2525.498,2533.575,"Did the action of the Commission getting telephone companies out of the business occurred during this period that we’re talking about, this four-year period?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2533.575,2534.706,"Yes, it did."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2534.706,2541.783,And are you charging the telephone companies for that service putting them out of business?
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2541.783,2544.129,"No, we’re not charging them for putting them out of business."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2544.129,2554.617,"Well, does -- these charges would be levied against, wouldn’t they, the telephone companies for so long as they were in business during this period?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2554.617,2555.643,Well --
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2555.643,2557.616,For the service you gave on putting them out of business?
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2557.616,2564.289,"For an interim period, but these petitioners here purport not to represent those companies."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2564.496,2565.988,"Well they have to represent the industry, don’t they?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2565.988,2569.5,"Well no, they represent the independent CATV Industry."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2570.597,2574.185,"Well in any event, those fees are an issue here, aren’t they?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2579.464,2586.238,"Well, we haven’t raised any kind of standing issues, but of course they have standing to raise the claims of their members."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2593.133,2594.467,That these fees are charged to those companies?
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2594.467,2596.284,Yes.
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2596.284,2598.399,Whom you put out of business?
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2598.399,2606.619,"Who will be going out of business, but since they are in business for the years in which they are paying the fee, they’re still benefiting from Commission regulation."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2606.619,2609.509,Quite a benefit.
1973.72-948,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2609.509,2620.083,"Are you suggesting that it’s inherent in any regulatory agency that it giveth and it taketh away, but at either act as a part of the regulatory process, is it not?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2620.083,2620.934,"Well, that’s correct."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2731.834,2745.269,"Congress I suppose could’ve passed a legislation, specific legislation, requiring exactly the same thing, and that is imposing maximum fees on franchises?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2745.269,2746.558,"That’s true, Congress could have."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2746.558,2756.282,"Could Congress send the beneficiaries of that legislation a bill, do you suppose, for each service to them?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2756.282,2759.223,"Well, Congress sends all of us a bill for the services that --"
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2759.223,2760.266,"Well, specifically."
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2776.167,2784.216,I must say that standing up here I find it difficult to think of a provision of the Constitution that it would violate.
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2794.04,2796.422,There’s all sorts of special legislation in Congress.
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2802.198,2808.834,"Well that’s true, and of course every program undertaken pursuant to any act of Congress is intended to benefit the public generally."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2808.834,2810.275,And it’s all in the public interest by hypothesis.
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2810.275,2816.266,"That’s right, but if you accept that reasoning and now is the reasoning of the Court of Appeals and Title V means nothing."
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2816.266,2816.401,I know.
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2816.401,2820.935,Because there isn’t a single program that is enacted principally to serve the public --
1973.72-948,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2820.935,2822.528,"By hypothesis, by definition?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2822.528,2823.546,That’s right.
1973.72-948,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2844.722,2848.792,"Mr. Korman, how far do you carry your line of argument?"
1973.72-948,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2859.95,2873.693,"Well, I would think that to the extent that there is a substantial benefit that accrues to the farmer, and to the extent that there is a cost in administering the program that it probably could."
1973.72-948,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3175.164,3177.626,Thank you Mr. Korman.
1973.72-948,2,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,3184.365,3215.362,"First, I wanted to state that in terms of the Budget Bureau Circular A-25, not only do I feel that the legislative history, specifically Representative Yates’ remarks placed the FCC under it, but the FCC has assumed that it is under it because it named its reliance on Budget Bureau Circular A-25 in its notice of proposed Rulemaking in docket 18-802 which are the fees under consideration here, in the report and order, and in the 1972 notice in docket 19-658 which is the proposal to raise the fees, so I believe --"
1973.72-948,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3215.362,3236.569,"But you still have the question of whether or not the Commission must observe the Circular, or whether its regulation should be judged not under the Circular, but under the statute, exactly under the statute?"
1973.72-948,2,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,3236.569,3238.851,All right I --
1973.72-948,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3238.851,3243.046,Let’s assume for a moment that there never had been a Circular?
1973.72-948,2,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,3243.046,3251.239,"Alright, then we can go right then to the statute and allege that equally under the statute, the same is true."
1973.72-948,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3362.076,3380.754,"But you’ve already conceded quite a few benefits to the industry and to individual members of the industry in terms of being spared the competition of telephone companies who could’ve taken over the entire industry lock, stock, and barrel, and several other items?"
1973.72-948,2,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,3380.754,3389.115,What I’m stating in that regard is that let us assume that that is a benefit which the entire industry enjoys.
1973.72-948,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3416.565,3422.761,How much value would -- do the CATV to get the phone company out of business?
1973.72-948,2,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,3422.761,3423.057,Well the value --
1973.72-948,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3423.057,3424.955,In dollars and cents.
1973.72-948,2,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,3426.607,3429.046,"No, I do not."
1973.72-948,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3445.98,3450.115,"And they were increased in everyday, weren’t there?"
1973.72-948,2,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,3458.148,3460.728,"To an extent they were hurting, but certainly some people did not."
1973.72-948,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3460.728,3467.764,And this agency got rid of your hurt?
1973.72-948,2,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,3467.764,3476.077,"That’s right, but if we want to equate that, we can say that we can put on one side of the ledger those things which helped us with those things that hurt us."
1973.72-948,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3479.86,3484.462,"And I don’t think that apply to anything else, that in mind."
1973.72-948,2,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,3501.445,3511.993,"I disagree, and I do not feel that Title V enables a federal agency to collect its entire cost of regulation of an industry just because it feels that that regulation is needed."
1973.72-948,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3516.947,3520.231,"And whether or not the industry on that balance, benefits?"
1973.72-948,2,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,3520.231,3521.394,That is correct.
1973.72-948,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3521.394,3523.563,That’s not really essentially your argument either.
1973.72-948,2,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,3525.791,3526.539,Yes.
1973.72-948,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3526.539,3532.404,-- but your basic point is that the charge can’t be based upon industry wide benefit?
1973.72-948,2,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,3532.404,3533.23,Precisely.
1973.72-948,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3533.23,3539.558,It’s the question is whether this sets up kind of a Blue Cross system or not?
1973.72-948,2,41307,stuart_f_feldstein,,3550.878,3563.369,It is my feeling that this Title then only enables an agency to promulgate fees that relate to services which particular payer of fees receives in a given year.
1973.72-948,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3563.639,3564.645,Thank you Mr. Feldstein.
