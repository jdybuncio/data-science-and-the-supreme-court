1974.74-114,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,2.476,"Mr. Frey, you may proceed."
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2.476,5.791,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,80.24,83.679,"Mr. Frey, did they close these checkpoints who know the weathers about?"
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,83.679,86.81,They closed them for various reasons.
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,103.459,106.288,Wasn't interfered with traffic isn't it?
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,106.288,109.623,"Well, the board --"
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,109.623,110.896,-- just wait till Sunday?
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,110.896,130.739,"The board -- well, that that is a problem and in our reply brief in Ortiz, we have a footnote which indicates what happened when one Sunday quite unexpectedly, they kept the checkpoint open, and they caught exceptionally large numbers of illegal entrance on that occasion."
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,130.739,133.51,"Well, what is that (Inaudible)?"
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,133.51,149.109,"Well, it is a problem and the border patrol believes that it its responsibility to attempt to balance its interest in apprehending aliens with the interest of motorist on the highway to proceed without a two-hour traffic jam."
1974.74-114,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,175.623,182.878,"Well, in some prior casement to try, don't recall which one, not Almeida-Sanchez, I think before that."
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,196.71,198.499,I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that.
1974.74-114,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,198.499,202.563,Was that in the case -- you're not familiar with the case?
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,202.563,218.078,"I would say though that even at the border, the question of how closely they search people's bags, how many people, what proportion of the entrance arriving at the port of entry or search at the Dallas Airport of something will depend on the volume of people."
1974.74-114,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,262.739,264.807,The suppression of what?
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,264.807,273.803,"Well, there was a motion made by respondent to suppress testimony of the aliens as the fruit of an illegal search."
1974.74-114,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,407.555,409.211,Let's see if I follow you there Mr. Frey.
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,415.1,418.178,"Well, we would have to look at the circumstances."
1974.74-114,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,481.983,484.924,You say you relying primarily on 1 and/or 3?
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,484.924,487.876,"Primarily on 3, within the border area."
1974.74-114,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,506.9,524.852,"Well, I think I'm right on remembering that Terry against Ohio said in passing in that opinion that any policeman can interrogate anybody about anything at anytime constitutionally?"
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,524.852,531.992,"That's true, but we have here more than a simple interrogation in order to get to interrogate respondent, we have to stop his automobile."
1974.74-114,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,531.992,535.133,"Well, if he were a pedestrian --"
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,535.133,544.638,"If he were a pedestrian, I think there would be a basis for arguing that you could go up to him and simply say “I'm an officer of the immigration service and --"
1974.74-114,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,544.638,547.323,Did you see a man go by here in a white hat?
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,547.323,549.418,"Or indeed, are you a citizen of the United States?"
1974.74-114,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,549.418,551.917,Or are you a citizen of the United States?
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,551.917,553.192,"But you want to do more than that, do you?"
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,553.192,553.818,Yes.
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,553.818,566.319,"Terry in those cases would indicate that if a person says none of your business, go on -- it's just any citizen, then it’s without reasonable suspicion, they couldn’t hold the person."
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,570.24,573.393,That's correct.
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,576.516,585.174,"-- or reasonable suspicion, the officer supposedly could hold them until he finished his questions?"
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,585.174,585.721,That's true.
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.957,590.286,But just with any other citizen know?
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,590.286,595.892,If they were no -- I don't believe that a police officer could forcibly detain just any person.
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,595.892,604.488,"You're saying that because it wasn't a reasonable distance to the border, you do have a greater power to stop and then interrogate and just with any citizen on the street?"
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,604.488,605.269,Absolutely.
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,605.269,605.633,Yes.
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,605.633,606.898,Absolutely.
1974.74-114,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,635.352,638.53,And where is 3 give you the power to forcibly detain somebody?
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,638.53,642.697,"Well, 3 gives us the power to stop and search as we construe it."
1974.74-114,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,642.697,643.699,To board and search?
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,643.699,644.68,To board and search.
1974.74-114,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,644.68,646.416,Any vessel?
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,646.416,647.233,Well --
1974.74-114,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,647.233,650.781,"At any railway car, aircraft and vans or vehicle?"
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,650.781,652.0,"Well, vehicle."
1974.74-114,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,652.924,655.531,Board or search?
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,662.999,663.36,There is --
1974.74-114,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,663.36,669.399,"-- going out beyond Ambrose Winder -- up to Ambrose Winder, the custom’s official boarding the vessel out there, beyond our borders."
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,669.399,687.537,"Well, the statute is derived from authority at the border with respect to stop vehicles, but I think it’s entirely clear from an examination of the history of the statute that this was intended to confer the power to stop a moving automobile."
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,732.386,743.167,"-- within the border area that you think this special rule applies, are you urging that you must have the power randomly to stop?"
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,750.834,751.319,No.
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,763.19,766.612,"Randomly, as a deterrent?"
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,766.612,769.772,As both of deterrent and apprehension tools.
1974.74-114,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,769.772,776.448,-- which makes irrelevant from this case that they thought that these to look Mexicans they thought they’re Mexican or anything else?
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,776.448,777.94,I think it's completely irrelevant.
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,793.715,796.646,Or if you stop the moving vehicle.
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,796.646,799.408,"Well, I'm not talking about search authority."
1974.74-114,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,808.698,809.212,You might be know --
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,809.212,813.496,"It's unreasonable to stop me because she might be, that’s true."
1974.74-114,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,826.566,845.105,"What you say is that in this area within a reasonable distance of the border, there is the generalized justification to make the random searchers of anybody that is equivalent to the particularized justification that the court found in Terry?"
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,845.105,845.414,That's correct.
1974.74-114,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,845.414,846.117,Is that it?
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,846.117,846.929,That's correct.
1974.74-114,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,846.929,853.257,Because of its proximate remedy that border is now become a generalized to support a random search of anybody.
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,853.257,854.717,Because of the particular conditions that is existed --
1974.74-114,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,854.717,857.941,Where is the equivalent and particularized hunt your suspicion --
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,857.941,859.612,-- is the equivalent of --
1974.74-114,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,859.612,863.16,"With respect to Mr. Terry on the street of Cleveland, Ohio."
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,863.16,863.973,That's correct.
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,880.888,881.076,Yes.
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,890.808,913.668,"Oh, we think this is quite analogous to a driver's license check, although we think that the showing of the constitutional equivalent of probable cause that we can show here is far greater than any that can be shown to justify stopping people for a license check, because we think that what’s at stake here is literally -- the problem of --"
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.668,928.621,"You wouldn't say though that in some other city, Memphis, Tennessee -- that you could just stop anybody and forcibly detain him while he is required about his citizenship."
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,928.621,928.856,No.
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,935.123,937.076,-- who are in the Southern California.
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,937.076,937.625,We are in Southern California.
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,937.625,941.788,-- and detain them until you ascertain with their citizens or not.
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,941.788,942.491,We are asserting --
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,942.491,943.632,Only for a brief time.
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,943.632,951.225,"For a brief time, we consider -- I mean, to call it a forcible detention for most people who drive along the highway, it’s a question of stopping your car."
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,956.001,961.477,"If you're last in line of a hundred cars and you're in a hurry to get home one Sunday night, that's quite a while --"
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,961.477,971.607,"But that's one of the reasons why the border patrol are sensitive to those concerns, closes the checkpoint so it does -- it avoids the situation in which you have a hundred cars backed up."
1974.74-114,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1025.298,1025.97,Excuse me.
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1051.024,1052.586,Without any particular reason?
1974.74-114,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1052.586,1053.671,Without a particular reason.
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1053.671,1053.814,Yes.
1974.74-114,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1053.814,1055.297,Without probably cause.
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1055.297,1057.08,"Or even found it suspicion, right."
1974.74-114,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1057.08,1069.353,"Now then, when it develops at that point that the occupants of the car or some of them cannot speak English, are you suggesting that a probably cause then comes in to be in?"
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1069.353,1069.893,Yes.
1974.74-114,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1100.783,1106.613,"Well, taking that step-by-step, you would claim the same right in Des Moines, Iowa necessarily."
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1106.613,1112.838,"No we wouldn't, unless there were special conditions that I don't think exist in Des Moines, Iowa."
1974.74-114,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1112.838,1121.105,You're saying that probable cause arises from the inability of these people to speak English because they are in close proximity to the Mexican border?
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1121.105,1121.981,"Well, no."
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1211.334,1214.818,What basis was the man arrested?
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1214.818,1220.928,He was arrested for the offense of transporting -- knowingly transporting aliens who are illegally in the country.
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1220.928,1222.506,At what point was he arrested at?
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1222.506,1231.843,After it turned out that the aliens both couldn't speak English and when they were interrogated in Spanish had no papers whatsoever indicating their right to be in the country.
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1231.843,1235.827,But they weren't arrested until after that?
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1235.827,1236.241,They were not arrested.
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1236.241,1240.494,Not on the fact that they couldn't speak English.
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1240.494,1240.807,No.
1974.74-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1262.672,1264.779,-- that within an area near the border --
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1264.779,1267.406,We could stop a car.
1974.74-114,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1269.605,1277.057,"You said earlier, you thought there might be a distinction between the old lady driving the car and these people, and I swear I don't understand this."
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1278.26,1283.083,"If I were representing the old lady, I would say that while it's true that the Government may have a right --"
1974.74-114,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1283.083,1284.966,"No, it isn't."
1974.74-114,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1284.966,1287.677,"Well, I was responding to the question of Mr. Justice Brennan's."
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1618.461,1621.514,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1961.292,1965.914,"If your argument that at the border, there must be probable cause?"
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1965.914,1967.174,"No Your Honor, it is not."
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.121,1973.323,What was the authority to not the people or not people to border and interrogate?
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1973.323,1979.356,"The authority in my mind Your Honor would be Boyd versus the United States, 1886, Carroll versus the United States which indicated traditionally."
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1979.356,1980.997,"No, but the constitution."
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1982.362,1985.371,The statutory authority would exist under 1225 (a).
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1985.371,1988.59,How about 1357?
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,1988.59,1993.358,1357 is the exception to the warrant that makes no reference to at the border.
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1996.711,2010.903,"Oh, I've read it, but -- and on their face that on the face, the language of 1257 -- 1357 (3), it just said you may assert."
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2010.903,2013.964,I read 1357 (a) (1) says that a reasonable distance.
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2013.964,2014.479,Yes.
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2014.479,2015.535,You may conduct a search.
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2015.535,2017.384,But it certainly includes at the border.
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2017.384,2018.741,Because I think what there's --
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2018.741,2019.968,Include them all.
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2019.968,2034.269,"I would not -- I would think that it's covered already in 1225 (a), and if one trace is back, the legislative history back to 1891, you will see that the right to stop at the border was early recognized in our country, in fact with the original act in 1875."
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2057.534,2061.214,"You didn't -- at the border, all you need is 1225, I take it."
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2061.214,2062.304,That is correct Your Honor.
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2062.304,2064.429,To the best of either warrant are probable?
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2064.429,2065.023,That is correct.
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.475,2075.547,But 1225 doesn't say at the border here?
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2075.547,2076.851,Yes it does.
1974.74-114,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2228.882,2237.636,"The Ninth Circuit, it's now settled after this case I gather, requires what it calls a founded suspicion for a stop, is that it?"
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2237.636,2250.277,"That is in fact Your Honor, it requires a founded suspicion to believe that there's illegal aliens and what the court felt was that under Wilson versus Porter, it required for any interdiction of highway traffic, there must be founded suspicion."
1974.74-114,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2300.184,2306.055,I suppose that the -- you're just talking about words.
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2325.532,2349.416,"Well, I think there has to be a belief that a person is an alien, and then the question is can it be purely subjective, that is to say can the officer use anything whatsoever, and I would have to say that under eh Fourth Amendment analysis, there has to be some basis to a reviewing court that that was in a sense based upon something and not purely arbitrary that there has to be something more than a hunch."
1974.74-114,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2349.416,2351.331,The statute didn't say that.
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2351.331,2356.802,"The statute does not say that, but the point is that one who believed to be an alien would have to be construed."
1974.74-114,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2504.008,2513.651,You think that reasonable standard must taken to account the nature of the country in which the reasonable distance is to be measured?
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2520.215,2521.363,I certainly agree Your Honor.
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2569.951,2575.174,Do you think this officer could stop this car and ask the man for his driver's license?
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2575.174,2577.472,"Certainly, not a border patrol officer Your Honor."
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2580.685,2582.131,-- was a state patrol officer?
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2582.131,2587.719,"Then, we have to understand that in the federal system, we have as I'm told by this Court so often, a very limited jurisdiction."
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2590.121,2601.109,"-- they just don't ask you again, but how about a state patrol, highway patrol officer, what if he know suspicion at all, he was just making a license check, the driver’s license check, but didn't stop him and ask him for his driver's license."
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2601.109,2601.436,In that case --
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2601.436,2604.245,"Unless you didn't have, one he get arrested."
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2604.245,2608.995,"In that case Your Honor, I would point out that there would be inappropriate for several reasons in that analogy."
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.974,2613.576,-- let's just talk about the analogy.
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2616.451,2626.284,"His right to stop at random a person for a driver's license check, in my contention would not be appropriate if it went beyond the scope of that."
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2627.872,2640.2,"All right, and he stops him and ask him for his driver's license, he doesn't have it and he arrest him for driving without a license, and he objects to the -- the man claims that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated, is he right or not?"
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2640.2,2647.821,I think he has a right in California and the reason I would say is that a person arrested for none possession of a driver’s license is not necessarily take into the custody.
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2647.821,2652.696,"Oh, I know that, but I asked you about if I pose the facts and ask you the validity under the Fourth Amendment."
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2652.696,2653.99,And I'm trying to respond Your Honor.
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2674.926,2681.504,I think your answer would be that if California law authorizes the arrest on those facts that it would be all right under the Fourth Amendment?
1974.74-114,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2681.504,2682.64,Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment.
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2682.64,2683.686,Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment.
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2683.686,2684.62,The Fourth and Fourteenth?
1974.74-114,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2840.658,2852.769,"Mr. Cleary, I want to have benefit of your thinking as to the validity of a warrant procedure for fix checkpoint."
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2852.769,2865.038,"Your Honor, I think that the fix checkpoint could be subject under the Fourth Amendment concepts to a warrant."
1974.74-114,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2969.209,2971.159,-- there had to be an adversary hearing?
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,2973.3,2993.582,"Well Your Honor, I would say that there would be in a sense, an after effect that a motion to suppress, but that in the ease of criminal justice that if such notice could be given, I don't know how would we -- their renewed and using every 10 days because Rule 41 I think provides only now for 10-limit out of warrant so that there has to be a return on them."
1974.74-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3025.24,3032.535,"Was Congress made the effort to the statute, but if you're chewing on that right now."
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,3036.972,3037.46,No Your Honor.
1974.74-114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3239.455,3256.432,"Well Mr. Cleary, supposing an immigration officer is proceeding under 1357 (a) (1) to enter interrogate any alien or person believe to be an alien, what factors does he use in reaching his initial determination of believing a person to be an alien?"
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,3257.669,3260.812,My suggestion Your Honor would be a multiplicity.
1974.74-114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3261.64,3262.265,What particular factor?
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,3262.265,3262.68,Okay.
1974.74-114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3279.849,3286.911,"The ability to speak the language, I suppose you'd have a hard time determining it before you actually stop them."
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,3286.911,3291.478,"Before you stop them, I think the problem would be is that you'd have to have some other basis."
1974.74-114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3291.478,3296.025,What factors would you suggest taking into consideration and making the initial stop?
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,3296.025,3302.272,"My factors would be that the critical aspect is the source of his entry. i.e., --"
1974.74-114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3302.272,3305.382,I thought you're going to give me some factors on the way you begun that sentence.
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,3305.382,3310.685,"Your Honor, the only thing I can suggest is that factors would determine in a multiplicity circumstances."
1974.74-114,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3408.96,3414.946,"What you're really saying is you can't get there from here, aren't you?"
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,3419.425,3420.238,There's no basis --
1974.74-114,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3420.238,3424.432,"You said and you have a very, very broad experience as we know Mr. Cleary."
1974.74-114,1,29619,john_j_cleary,,3433.156,3441.22,"If I was at the San Clemente checkpoint and I sought car drive by with the Baja California license plate, I think I might a have a fact to stop a car."
1974.74-114,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3442.269,3443.239,Thank you Mr. Cleary.
1974.74-114,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3445.311,3447.218,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.74-114,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3650.784,3651.347,Thank you Mr. Frey.
1974.74-114,3,29619,john_j_cleary,,3657.092,3659.072,Thank you very much Your Honor.
