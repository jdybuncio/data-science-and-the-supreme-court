1985.85-5189,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,67.608,Mr. Cribari?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,67.608,71.862,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-5189,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,138.205,141.074,What do you suppose they thought about that gun?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,141.074,155.833,"Sir, I think they thought that that gun was probably loaded and I think there is no argument to be made that they were not in some degree frightened and there is no argument to be made that they had the duty to examine that gun."
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,173.712,179.632,"Would a club, a metal club be a dangerous weapon in such an incident?"
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,179.632,185.52,"Justice Marshall, I think that a club could be a dangerous weapon in such an instance."
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,188.321,189.673,That could be?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,189.673,191.289,--I think that almost anything--
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,191.289,195.01,"Well, could a gun be a club?"
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,195.01,196.093,"--Well, certainly--"
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,196.093,197.945,Could a gun be a club?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,197.945,201.647,"--Yes, certainly a gun could be a club and probably a metal club at that."
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,201.647,203.414,"Well, it is dangerous then, isn't it?"
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,203.414,212.42,"Well, I think it is only dangerous, and this is certainly the analysis used by some of the courts, it is only dangerous if there is a threat to use it as a club."
1985.85-5189,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,278.731,300.245,"Well, I think there you can say there is, in fact, no weapon or device, so that isn't covered, but certainly the legislative history of this particular language would indicate that the sponsor of it thought it would include fake guns, for example, does it not?"
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,300.245,308.083,"--Justice O'Connor, I think in one reading it does and I think in another reading, which is my reading, of course, that it does not."
1985.85-5189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,407.948,426.927,"Mr. Cribari, it punishes bank robbery with a dangerous weapon or device if the device or weapon is used in an assault on a person or puts in jeopardy the life of any person, doesn't it?"
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,426.927,427.644,"--Yes, sir."
1985.85-5189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,427.644,430.945,"So, it really doesn't punish bank robbery with a dangerous weapon."
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,430.945,434.897,It punishes an assault or placing in jeopardy during a bank robbery.
1985.85-5189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,434.897,435.33,Yes.
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,435.33,435.98,"Yes, sir."
1985.85-5189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,443.669,448.823,No one claims he put anyone's life in jeopardy with the starter pistol or whatever it was.
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,448.823,453.291,It was an unloaded handgun and the claim was not made that he put someone's life in jeopardy.
1985.85-5189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,453.291,460.028,"You don't deny that he technically assaulted someone, do you?"
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,460.028,461.547,"No, he plead guilty to the assault."
1985.85-5189,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,597.801,601.705,Would your position be the same if he had the gun loaded but with blanks?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,601.705,606.407,"No, sir, my position... Yes, sir, my position would be the same."
1985.85-5189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,640.163,642.713,May I interrupt?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,661.41,666.647,"Well, I am not sure that the... I think the burden is on the government to prove a dangerous weapon."
1985.85-5189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,666.647,676.269,"So, if the government cannot, in fact, prove by some evidence, by reasonable doubt, that the bullets were in the gun at the time of the bank robbery, the defendants would always win on that."
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,676.269,677.253,I don't think that is correct.
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,700.035,705.372,"On the other hand, is there any evidence to show that they knew that the gun was unloaded?"
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,705.372,706.605,In this case there is.
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,707.772,710.39,"No, I am talking about the people in the bank."
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,710.39,720.948,"--No, sir, there is no evidence to show that the people knew the gun was unloaded and there is no attempt to diminish the fear of the people and there is no attempt to say that people ought to know the gun was unloaded."
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,720.948,726.269,If they got fear... Can you get fear without fear of a deadly weapon?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,726.269,731.923,"Sir, I think there is as much fear in the case of an unloaded handgun as there is in a loaded one."
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,731.923,734.123,"Well, that is what a deadly weapon is."
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,734.123,734.958,I don't--
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,734.958,738.244,That is why a weapon is deadly because it can harm.
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,738.244,742.046,"--I agree, sir, that the weapon is deadly because it can harm."
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,742.046,744.129,What size gun was it?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,744.129,745.164,I don't know.
1985.85-5189,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,757.056,759.256,Supposing he had bullets in his pocket?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,759.256,763.125,--Then the weapon didn't work as a gun.
1985.85-5189,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,763.125,766.161,What if he has the safety device on?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,766.161,770.279,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I think at some point we have to draw a line."
1985.85-5189,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,799.299,805.302,"Well, can't you push a bullet into a six shooter chamber as easily as you can take off the safety device?"
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,805.302,806.052,"Well, I don't know."
1985.85-5189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,846.412,851.296,Do you say it is a charge to the jury upon a question of fact then in every case?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,851.296,859.469,"In every case the jury or the factfinder should have to make the finding that the weapon was dangerous beyond a reasonable doubt, yes."
1985.85-5189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,859.469,863.921,"You don't mean as a special verdict, but they just be charged to look to find that as a fact along with the--"
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,863.921,864.671,No.
1985.85-5189,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,893.206,902.146,--Your position is that a firearm is never dangerous until it is loaded.
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,902.146,907.033,"No, sir, because the firearm could certainly be used as a club."
1985.85-5189,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,914.37,919.008,"Well, what if it is loaded, but he doesn't find it necessary to pull the trigger."
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,919.008,923.559,"Well, then I think it is a dangerous weapon because it can immediately inflict the harm that it threatens."
1985.85-5189,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,923.559,934.017,That is contrary to your earlier definition used for the purpose intended; that is to kill or wound somebody that resists.
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,934.017,945.623,"Well, I have no trouble reaching the conclusion that a handgun that is loaded and operable is immediately a dangerous weapon and can be found that way by a jury simply on that evidence."
1985.85-5189,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,945.623,950.46,Why isn't it dangerous because it can be used as a club?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,950.46,956.697,"Because... Unless there is evidence that it was threatened to be used as a club, it wasn't used as a club."
1985.85-5189,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1014.117,1015.567,May I ask this question?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1036.128,1038.913,I think it would be loaded.
1985.85-5189,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1056.977,1066.915,"Or there is only one bullet in the cylinder that holds six in a revolver and that bullet was several cylinders away from the barrel, you would make the same answer?"
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1066.915,1067.965,The same answer.
1985.85-5189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1087.346,1092.4,Have the courts of appeals had occasion to construe the word (d)?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1101.071,1110.694,"Let me answer by saying yes, but I am going to say that the cases... the language in the cases is not as simply as a yes answer."
1985.85-5189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1148.033,1153.354,It is hard to imagine intimidation really without a technical common-law assault.
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1153.354,1157.156,"Well, it is, but it is not hard to imagine it without a gun."
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1162.81,1164.329,What about intent?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1171.583,1173.535,Certainly there is a violation--
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1173.535,1175.101,I mean outside him being shot.
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1176.387,1180.339,--If the man comes in and says his gun is unloaded and I am going to rob you--
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1180.339,1180.789,Yes.
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1180.789,1181.455,--he probably would be caught.
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1187.476,1190.028,Do you actually believe that?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1190.028,1191.647,--That he might get money?
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1191.647,1192.263,Yes.
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1192.263,1195.349,"Well, based on some of the people I have represented, yes, I do."
1985.85-5189,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1198.634,1199.684,We will resume here at 1:00.
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1199.684,1200.317,Thank you.
1985.85-5189,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1200.317,1209.423,"You may resume your argument, counsel--"
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1209.423,1213.375,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-5189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1250.314,1257.82,"That assumes, Mr. Cribari, that Congress intended it to be a question of fact in each case."
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1257.82,1259.104,It does indeed.
1985.85-5189,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1292.408,1304.066,"Suppose the gun were loaded, either a magazine or an automatic or a cylinder revolver, but there was no firing pin."
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1304.066,1312.571,"If there is no firing pin and the weapon cannot function as a weapon, then I don't think it is dangerous as a weapon."
1985.85-5189,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1312.571,1314.404,You mean if it can't function as a firearm.
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1314.404,1315.071,As a firearm.
1985.85-5189,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1327.931,1329.114,Let's take it one step further.
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1338.202,1347.641,"My position would be, first of all, that that weapon that could not operate as the handgun, without more, that is all it is used as, is not a dangerous weapon."
1985.85-5189,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1370.238,1382.481,"Well, your position would mean that before the government could present the case they would have to test the gun and see whether the firing pin was really working."
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1382.481,1386.933,It might mean that.
1985.85-5189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1407.763,1410.549,"Well, there could be worse cases than that for the government."
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1430.478,1442.167,"Well, Justice Rehnquist, the cases are clear, and once again we do not dispute the cases that say from circumstantial evidence the jury would be warranted in inferring the gun was loaded."
1985.85-5189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1452.325,1458.311,"But, the testimony of the bystanders, all they can testify is what happened, they were afraid because the guy had a gun."
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1460.413,1465.115,"That is true, but they can testify to what the person who perpetrated the robbery did with the gun."
1985.85-5189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1465.115,1466.901,"Well, he is going to tell them it is loaded."
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1466.901,1471.203,He is going to tell them... The bystander is going to say that I saw a gun.
1985.85-5189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1472.888,1478.209,"Yes, but the defendant, at the time of the bank robbery, isn't going to tell the bystanders it is not loaded."
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1478.209,1483.779,"Of course not, which is why at the very least we have a factual question for the factfinder."
1985.85-5189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1490.283,1498.087,"Well, supposing that you have a trial of this issue and the defendant either says nothing or takes the stand and says it wasn't loaded."
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1510.68,1518.75,"My position would be that if the evidence is conclusive that the weapon was not loaded, no."
1985.85-5189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1520.302,1522.171,Just the hypothesis I gave you.
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1533.444,1546.203,"--I think the matter could be submitted to the jury with the instruction that from the evidence you have heard, if you disbelieve the defendant and believe the other testimony, you would be allowed to infer that the weapon was loaded and operable."
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1549.971,1552.173,"This case was tried before a judge, wasn't it?"
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1552.173,1552.839,"Yes, sir, it was."
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1552.839,1554.623,It wasn't a jury?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1554.623,1555.125,It was not.
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1556.358,1561.779,"Well, what does that tell me that the judge didn't decide that it was a dangerous weapon?"
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1561.779,1567.433,"I think the Bennett decision, which is clear in its instructions that the weapon is dangerous, period."
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1567.433,1571.068,"But, did the judge decide that in order to convict him?"
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1571.068,1574.502,It does not appear from the record that the judge said--
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1574.502,1577.221,How else did the judge convict him other than that?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1577.221,1577.854,--I don't think any way.
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1591.428,1594.864,"But, you have been arguing that it is up to the trier of fact."
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1598.517,1599.5,"--But, in this case--"
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1599.5,1601.183,Wasn't he in this case?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1601.183,1607.171,"--He is the trier of fact in this case, but because of the Bennett decision there was no factual matter for him to decide."
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1609.373,1610.156,Did he say that?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1610.156,1612.075,He did not say that in those words.
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1612.075,1613.36,"Well, how do you know he did."
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1613.36,1619.931,We know he did that because it is explained in the record that the purpose of the proceeding was to test Bennett.
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1619.931,1621.097,Where in the record?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1621.097,1638.059,At the beginning... In the Joint Appendix at the beginning of the trial proceeding which is on page seven and eight and I think it is inferred again on page eleven at the top.
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1652.199,1654.484,"Well, then, I get to my next question."
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1673.982,1674.682,"--Well, I would prefer--"
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1674.682,1676.434,I know you would.
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1676.434,1680.401,"--Well, I would prefer that in that case there is a dangerous weapon."
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1693.526,1696.478,"Well, is that weapon any more dangerous than this one?"
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1696.478,1698.728,--The weapon that jams when used?
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1698.728,1699.43,Yes.
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1699.43,1703.482,I think there that that weapon is much more dangerous than the weapon that can't work at all.
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1703.482,1704.315,Why?
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1704.315,1716.106,"Because the weapon that jams when used is nevertheless a weapon which, when exhibited, was a weapon that could actually inflict the harm threatened until the fortuitous accident of jamming."
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1726.247,1732.067,I am looking at the manner... It was used for the purpose of frightening the people.
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1733.667,1734.167,I agree.
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1734.167,1736.103,And to scaring them.
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1736.103,1736.919,I agree.
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1736.919,1739.671,"But, you say it is not a dangerous weapon."
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1739.671,1742.523,"I say that that is a violation of Section (a), the assault."
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1745.375,1747.427,"Well, what was the purpose of the assault?"
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1747.427,1750.546,The purpose of the assault was to take money by intimidation.
1985.85-5189,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1750.546,1751.913,"Well, isn't that what happened?"
1985.85-5189,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1751.913,1757.017,That is exactly what happened which is why Mr. McLaughlin plead guilty to taking money by intimidation.
1985.85-5189,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1823.309,1827.279,Mr. Wright?
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1827.279,1831.165,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-5189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1894.34,1899.475,"Mr. Wright, you take the position then that a toy gun would also be a dangerous weapon?"
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1899.475,1901.427,Whether a toy gun is a dangerous--
1985.85-5189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1901.427,1903.113,One that looks exactly like a real gun.
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1903.113,1903.763,--That is right.
1985.85-5189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1929.93,1938.869,"What if all the bystanders were near-sighted so they thought that the gun really was threatening, when, in fact, if you had good eye sight you would have realized it was a toy gun."
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1938.869,1942.238,"I have not considered that possibility, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.85-5189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1943.154,1945.44,Perhaps you have devoted yourself to more important questions.
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1946.523,1956.145,I would contend that that would be a factual question for the jury and the nearsightedness of the bystanders would be relevant in such a case.
1985.85-5189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1956.145,1962.799,"What about a toothbrush in the pocket of a coat, sticking it out and making it look like--"
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1962.799,1970.888,We do not think that... The toothbrush is similar to the finger in the pocket or the appearance--
1985.85-5189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1970.888,1972.688,"--I have got a weapon now, with the finger I don't."
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1972.688,1977.208,"--I don't think a toothbrush is a weapon, although it certainly is a device."
1985.85-5189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1977.208,1980.16,"Well, a toy gun isn't a weapon, say it is made out of paper mache."
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1980.16,1989.35,"Well, it is certainly a device and we think that the display of a toy gun, assuming it looks somewhat real, would make it a dangerous device."
1985.85-5189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1989.35,1991.968,What if you had a toy gun but you didn't take it out of your pocket.
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1997.456,2016.25,We contend that if the gun is never brandished that that is not the use of a weapon to assault anyone within the meaning of the statute and we do not contend that it applies... that the additional punishment of Section 2113(d) would be warranted in such a case.
1985.85-5189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2022.487,2026.225,A toy gun is enough provided they see the toy gun.
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2026.225,2031.86,We think under our view... We believe that the brandishing of the weapon is quite important.
1985.85-5189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2054.125,2060.446,"Well, to qualify under (d) you have to show an assault, don't you, when you are talking about an unloaded--"
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2060.446,2062.129,You have to use the weapon to assault someone.
1985.85-5189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2062.129,2062.596,--Yes.
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2062.596,2063.262,That is right.
1985.85-5189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2294.021,2308.115,"It seems to me the legislative history cuts a little bit against that because if Congress thought that an unloaded gun would be a dangerous weapon, it presumably would have thought the Indiana six shooter would also be a dangerous weapon, don't you think?"
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2308.115,2309.231,I think that that is right.
1985.85-5189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2309.231,2312.667,"Then why did they feel it necessary to add the word ""device""?"
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2312.667,2319.589,"Representative Blanton explained... You appear to be looking at the reply brief, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.85-5189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2319.589,2320.823,That is the wrong source.
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2320.823,2322.374,No.
1985.85-5189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2370.852,2378.858,"Then is the government's basic argument here that although the unloaded gun is not a dangerous weapon, it is a dangerous device?"
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2378.858,2384.262,"Well, we would argue that an unloaded gun is a dangerous weapon as eight of the nine state courts--"
1985.85-5189,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2384.262,2386.881,"Then you don't need that legislative history, do you?"
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2386.881,2389.298,"--Well, no, that is right, we don't."
1985.85-5189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2427.273,2449.454,"May I ask you on your bludgeon theory, the second of your two principal submissions, I have seen in the movies at least some tiny things, hide them in their sock or something, a gun, but it will shoot and kill somebody with a bullet, would that be a bludgeon in your view no matter how small the firing--"
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2449.454,2453.423,It seems to us that that may well present a fact question.
1985.85-5189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2460.477,2463.595,"--If that is the case, what about the case in this case?"
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2466.381,2467.747,--That is correct.
1985.85-5189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2470.333,2472.885,We don't know whether it is big enough to be a bludgeon or not.
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2483.74,2488.877,"--Well, we don't know exactly why the judge ruled it was a dangerous weapon."
1985.85-5189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2488.877,2501.035,"Isn't it correct, as your opponent suggests in the colloquy, that they thought the Fourth Circuit law was a gun being capable of being fired is a dangerous weapon even if there are no bullets in it."
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2501.035,2502.137,That is correct.
1985.85-5189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2523.05,2530.887,There would be nothing in the record to show whether this gun is capable of being used as a bludgeon or not.
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2530.887,2534.006,"Well, I think that is correct."
1985.85-5189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2554.32,2558.574,"Yes, but he decided on the basis of precisely the same written material that is here in front of us."
1985.85-5189,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2567.946,2569.512,"--I think that is right, Justice."
1985.85-5189,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2918.373,2924.327,"You have one minute remaining, counsel."
1985.85-5189,2,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,2924.327,2925.096,"Thank you, sir."
1985.85-5189,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3008.081,3009.253,"Thank you, gentlemen."
