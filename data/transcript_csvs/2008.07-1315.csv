2008.07-1315,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.737,"We'll hear argument this afternoon in Case 07-1315, Knowles v. Mirzayance."
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,9.189,30.519,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under the deferential review required by the AEDPA, Mr. Mirzayance was not entitled to Federal habeas corpus relief on his ineffective counsel claim because the State court adjudication of that claim was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, the clearly established Strickland test."
2008.07-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,62.622,81.201,"At some point during the oral argument, and perhaps at the beginning because it is the beginning inquiry -- when there is an evidentiary hearing, how does the standard for the court of appeals differ than when there has been no evidentiary hearing?"
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,81.201,89.439,"--Well, I think it depends on whether the Federal habeas court is doing a section 2254(d) analysis."
2008.07-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,120.327,121.577,"Well, let me put it--"
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,121.577,122.043,--excuse me--
2008.07-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,122.043,122.777,--Let me put it this way.
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,138.955,140.389,"--Well, there shouldn't be a difference."
2008.07-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,140.389,143.656,We just pretend the hearing didn't happen?
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,143.656,156.166,"Well, I would say that in virtually every case it, in fact, is a meaningless distraction from what the State court did based on the record presented it, and here's why."
2008.07-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,171.86,180.882,Do we look to the Federal court evidentiary hearing as part of the analysis to determine whether what the State court did was reasonable?
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,192.289,209.301,"Well, I think, again, the only question that matters is the 2254(d) question that says that relief shall not be granted unless that State court adjudication, based on the State court record presented, was unreasonable, and here's why."
2008.07-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,209.301,219.507,"Well, I guess it could be -- it could be if -- if we have an opinion that makes it clear that you -- you must grant an evidentiary hearing in -- in certain cases."
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,228.929,233.666,"Perhaps, and -- and under extremely rare cases that may--"
2008.07-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,233.666,252.895,"But unless -- unless there is a Supreme Court requirement that there be an evidentiary hearing, I don't see how holding an evidentiary hearing could show that the State court decision, which was legitimately held without an evidentiary hearing, was contrary to our opinions."
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,253.847,260.918,"--Well, I agree, Justice Scalia, and this Court said in Holland v. Jackson that the pertinent question is what the State court had in front of it."
2008.07-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,274.577,287.318,"Did any -- did any point -- did the State at any point challenge the correctness, the propriety, of holding the Federal evidentiary hearing?"
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,287.318,288.837,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,290.42,291.872,"And if so, is that before us?"
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,291.872,293.305,--I don't think so.
2008.07-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,338.77,341.57,But -- so then -- so then we do look at the facts.
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,350.91,351.26,Yes.
2008.07-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,351.26,359.783,But I -- I just don't know how to fit that with the standard when I look at the -- the reasonableness of the -- of the State court decision.
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,359.783,367.42,"Well, I don't think it changed the standard because 2254 simply requires an adjudication on the merits, and we have that here."
2008.07-1315,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,367.42,384.981,"Well, would you -- would you agree just as a general rule that unless we find -- unless there is some rule under which we can conclude that the State court should have held a hearing, that there is no occasion to have a Federal evidentiary hearing?"
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,384.981,386.183,"Yes, I would agree with that."
2008.07-1315,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,386.183,387.466,That would be the general proposition.
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,387.466,387.766,Yes.
2008.07-1315,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,387.766,388.05,Okay.
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,388.05,389.035,And I think--
2008.07-1315,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,389.035,393.237,Would that -- would that principle have to be clearly established by one of our decisions?
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,393.237,410.949,"--I think that question is unclear, Mr. Chief Justice, because this Court did recently say in Landrigan that the decision to hold an evidentiary hearing remains with the sound discretion of the district court, but in the same sentence said that that discretion was circumscribed by the AEDPA."
2008.07-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.949,417.02,Why should we hold a hearing ourselves in the -- in the hypothetical situation that Justice Souter mentioned?
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,435.897,447.991,"Well, if a petitioner or a State prisoner was somehow precluded from developing facts in the State court and should have had an evidentiary hearing under this Court's clearly established law, then that would be the correct solution."
2008.07-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.026,453.326,"No, I understand that."
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,466.719,466.952,That's correct.
2008.07-1315,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,615.732,625.088,Was -- was -- is all of this factual material in the -- in the documents submitted with the habeas -- with the State habeas and the response to the State habeas?
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,625.088,628.824,"All of this was in the State trial transcript, so, yes, Justice Souter."
2008.07-1315,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,628.824,629.541,What -- what did they do?
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,637.747,642.901,It was a direct appeal to the California Court of Appeal with a concurrently filed habeas petition.
2008.07-1315,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,642.901,643.568,"Ah, okay, yes."
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,643.568,644.251,Okay.
2008.07-1315,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,671.468,673.27,How about getting another jury?
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,708.861,715.33,Mr. Wager did not believe that he had grounds to do so in this case.
2008.07-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,744.95,753.639,"Mr. -- Mr. Mercer, I guess we could resolve the case by saying if there was any error, it was harmless, but we didn't take the case for that."
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,771.834,774.636,"I agree with you, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,774.636,775.436,"So let's not do that, then."
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,777.255,777.738,Okay.
2008.07-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,777.738,778.388,Good.
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,778.388,786.861,"Well, I'm confident that, you know, as this Court addressed in Strickland itself, the claim fails for lack of--"
2008.07-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,786.861,812.411,"Well, if -- if the Profitt -- the Fifth Circuit -- Profitt, the Fifth Circuit case, applies in the Ninth, and I -- Circuit -- and I would think it would, just as the magistrate judge thought that it would -- then that would be -- present a very close case and it would probably require reversal of the State court, wouldn't you think, if the Profitt rule applied?"
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,815.113,815.913,--Nothing to lose.
2008.07-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,815.913,816.196,--Nothing to lose.
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,816.196,826.438,"Well, if -- we agree that nothing to lose, in fact, was what happened here, as in Profitt."
2008.07-1315,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,858.392,865.963,"Well, isn't that -- the fundamental question is what level of generality you look to determine what law has been clearly established?"
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,867.831,868.215,Certainly.
2008.07-1315,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,868.215,874.668,"But as far as I can tell, the ""nothing to lose"" issue has not been addressed by us and is not clearly established."
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,880.488,887.928,"Well, certainly this Court could, indeed, take a more narrow view of what is clearly established law."
2008.07-1315,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,941.796,951.235,"So you -- you think -- I guess it's not open to us to issue a decision on the ""nothing to lose"" question, or we don't have to."
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,961.774,963.642,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-1315,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,972.915,974.098,Let me ask you this question.
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1005.802,1012.806,"--Well, I think that because this Court has never even addressed conduct anything like this by an attorney--"
2008.07-1315,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1012.806,1019.71,But -- but isn't it true that there's a whole host of counsel errors that could violate Strickland?
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1027.4,1032.454,"--I don't think you need one on all fours, exact fact patterns."
2008.07-1315,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1040.707,1047.213,"Would it be -- wouldn't it be a clear answer in this case to say this was a terrible lawyer, and therefore Strickland -- Strickland applies?"
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1057.919,1061.271,--This Court could say you haven't adjudicated this--
2008.07-1315,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1061.271,1062.656,Is that what you're asking us to do?
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1062.656,1069.727,--We're not asking you to say that a decision like this could never be unreasonable.
2008.07-1315,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1069.727,1070.227,"Oh, okay."
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1070.227,1070.629,Okay?
2008.07-1315,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1095.544,1097.729,Why is it--
2008.07-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1097.729,1105.835,"And if we say that and if Profitt is inconsistent with that, do we then remand or do we say on this record clearly it was reasonable?"
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1107.935,1114.172,"--Well, I don't frankly think this case necessarily should be remanded back to the Ninth Circuit."
2008.07-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1122.194,1126.748,Don't we have to go -- don't we have to say that this was reasonable conduct?
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1126.748,1127.998,--No.
2008.07-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1133.319,1134.235,Of course.
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1134.235,1136.871,--for the California courts to come out the other way.
2008.07-1315,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1136.871,1139.989,--I -- I don't understand why you keep talking about Strickland.
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1176.162,1194.124,"Well, I did not make such an aggressive argument to this Court that a decision like this could never be unreasonable, but certainly there is no case from this Court that has announced such a standard."
2008.07-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1195.31,1196.26,Excuse me.
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1207.383,1209.319,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1209.319,1211.619,So the reasonableness or unreasonableness is out of the question.
2008.07-1315,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1231.833,1234.118,"That's his argument, not the one you've been making."
2008.07-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1234.118,1234.885,That's right.
2008.07-1315,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.886,1237.369,Because you say the standard is Strickland.
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1237.369,1245.242,"Well, what I say is that this Court has held that Strickland generally applies to almost all ineffective counsel cases."
2008.07-1315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1267.839,1268.608,"Well, they didn't."
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1373.007,1381.863,I think this Court needs to give full deference to the adjudication of the State courts.
2008.07-1315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1381.863,1383.78,What is that deference going to be?
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1403.21,1403.793,Correct.
2008.07-1315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1403.793,1412.549,"And then we would have to say, was it unreasonable of them on the facts as they might have taken them most favorable to the defendant?"
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1422.505,1423.038,Correct.
2008.07-1315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1423.038,1423.79,Is that what we should do?
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1423.79,1424.324,Yes.
2008.07-1315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1424.324,1424.574,Yes.
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1424.574,1434.596,"And that's the situation and the circumstance outlined by the California Supreme Court in People v. Duvall, and it's -- it's a case and a procedure designed for judicial economy."
2008.07-1315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1434.596,1451.907,"Then we have to reach this hearing issue because we have to say, insofar as the hearing reached a different result, we should ignore it for the reason that the statute tells us to consider the reasonableness of the State court's decision in light of the facts on the record before it."
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1451.907,1453.057,Correct.
2008.07-1315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1453.057,1456.443,So we have to reach a huge number of issues which we've never decided.
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1456.443,1461.33,I actually think that that issue is not really properly before this Court.
2008.07-1315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1461.33,1462.347,"Well, then how are we supposed to do it?"
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1463.199,1473.221,"Based on the State court adjudication, a straightforward analysis under 2254(d) of the California Supreme Court's legal resolution of this claim."
2008.07-1315,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1473.221,1480.994,We should treat the district court proceeding as though it had never happened on the ground that the Ninth Circuit never should have remanded it to the district court.
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1480.994,1482.044,Yes.
2008.07-1315,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1482.044,1490.932,And we just take it as though we had a 2254 petition from the State supreme court in the district court.
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1506.978,1508.928,"That is our primary contention, yes."
2008.07-1315,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1508.928,1509.294,Okay.
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1564.815,1565.598,Correct.
2008.07-1315,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1565.598,1581.776,"And if we get to the Musladin sort of level of generality, we do not have any determination from this Court, any clearly established law from this Court, that would indicate that the State court's adjudication or determination was unreasonable here."
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1581.776,1582.809,Absolutely.
2008.07-1315,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1582.809,1583.728,Is that your road map?
2008.07-1315,0,41767,steven_e_mercer,,1583.728,1584.811,"Yes, it is."
2008.07-1315,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1587.763,1589.03,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,1594.0,1609.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to begin by addressing the socalled v. Waldron, which -- it does not say that in Profitt v. Waldron."
2008.07-1315,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1635.577,1637.279,"And you reject it as well, I take it--"
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,1637.279,1637.546,Yes.
2008.07-1315,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1637.546,1648.753,"--and concede it is an improper -- it is not a basis for ineffective assistance that somebody did not pursue a ""nothing to lose"" case argument?"
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,1648.753,1660.042,"It -- essentially, because it's an irrelevant concern because the decision has to be made on whether counsel's decision, as he faced the trial facts, was objectively reasonable."
2008.07-1315,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1691.88,1692.949,--I'm sorry.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,1700.436,1702.638,--I'm saying that's one of the factors.
2008.07-1315,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1730.222,1744.982,"Will we have to look at this counsel's performance under Strickland, I guess, and determine whether it was objectively unreasonable in light of Strickland, filtered through Yarborough?"
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,1744.982,1746.084,Correct.
2008.07-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1750.786,1753.421,Is that precisely what we have to decide?
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,1765.479,1775.484,--It would be one step removed were it not for the fact that there was an evidentiary hearing which resolved facts that should have been resolved in the State court.
2008.07-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1797.533,1814.978,"So -- so the usual test that the State court has to be affirmed, unless it's an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law, is altered when the State court has not had an evidentiary hearing that the Federal habeas court believes should have been held?"
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,1814.978,1816.278,And holds it.
2008.07-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.811,1818.53,How do you get that out of the statute?
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,1819.746,1824.934,"--Well, there's a hole in the statute, there's no question about it, under 2254(d)(1)."
2008.07-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1824.934,1825.25,Right.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,1825.25,1835.642,When you have the -- the statute requiring the application of -- or nonapplication of law contrary to the United States Supreme Court--
2008.07-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1835.642,1836.208,Right.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,1836.208,1845.931,"--or an unreasonable application thereof, what happens when -- that issue really cannot be decided without an evidentiary hearing under Strickland."
2008.07-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1845.931,1850.652,"No, but your -- the need for the evidentiary hearing, as I understand it, was raised by you in the following way."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,1900.167,1928.318,"Well, we argued that because Mr. Wager, defense counsel, presented a declaration which was contradicted by other declarations as to the reason he gave up this defense -- we argued it was objectively unreasonable if the court -- the State court took all of the intendments in favor of our declaration, and Mr. Wager did not really address the reasons for giving up the defense, he just said, I felt it was hopeless."
2008.07-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1940.642,1945.463,But you're saying that you specified the evidentiary issues that you wanted to develop?
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,1945.463,1952.533,"--What we specified is why his rationale was unreasonable, and we--"
2008.07-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1952.533,1954.135,"Well, was that -- I mean, I'm just asking you."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,1956.087,1956.554,--Right.
2008.07-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1956.554,1968.995,"Are -- are you saying that that was, in effect, an adequate way to tell the California Supreme Court that these are the issues that we want to develop in an evidentiary hearing that aren't sufficiently developed in the documents?"
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,1970.012,1970.312,Yes.
2008.07-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1970.312,1970.764,Okay.
2008.07-1315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1970.764,1972.464,But there's no hole in the statute.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2015.209,2016.875,We argued yes.
2008.07-1315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2016.875,2018.077,And you said yes.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2021.213,2021.629,No.
2008.07-1315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2021.629,2022.313,All right.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2044.895,2047.597,Was that Bell v. Kelly?
2008.07-1315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2047.597,2048.364,That's right.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2048.364,2050.649,"I think it was, and the Court dismissed as improvidently granted, and--"
2008.07-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2050.649,2051.216,Excuse me.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2065.058,2066.358,--That's California law.
2008.07-1315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2066.358,2069.51,"That's the law of the Federal Government, I would have thought."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2069.51,2070.377,That is--
2008.07-1315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2070.377,2071.046,It's summary judgment law.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2071.046,2079.735,"--In order to deny relief, one has to -- the court has to presume the adequacy of the showing or the truth of the showing made by the--"
2008.07-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2079.735,2080.602,"No, but that can't be."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2098.779,2099.829,--No.
2008.07-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2110.171,2110.921,I wasn't addressing that.
2008.07-1315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2120.593,2121.812,That's my fault.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2136.071,2136.688,I--
2008.07-1315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2136.688,2140.94,That's my mistaken refusal -- I should have said rule 56.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2140.94,2169.126,"--Well, it's -- it also is California law, and I believe it is habeas corpus law, that when the petitioner files a petition and attaches declarations, in order to deny those, assuming that the truth of those declarations is presumed in order to evaluate the prima facie case -- for example, in this case, in Strickland -- that if that can't be resolved without a hearing, a hearing should be held."
2008.07-1315,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2180.533,2184.302,"Counsel, talking about -- in Strickland -- right here."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2228.498,2232.783,"--Well, there are a couple of problems with -- all of that is true."
2008.07-1315,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2290.739,2310.485,"So all the points that your -- your friend began with, which shows his conscious deliberation, his knowledge not only about how to go about killing somebody, but also guilt, the recognition of the wrongfulness of what he had done -- all that under California law doesn't enter into a consideration of insanity?"
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2310.485,2320.441,"--Surely it enters into the consideration, and every one of the experts considered precisely that evidence, which was for the most part after-the-fact evidence."
2008.07-1315,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2363.351,2370.874,"I understand that, but counsel here at the time retained eight expert doctors to evaluate his mental health."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2383.247,2384.783,--It was a thorough investigation.
2008.07-1315,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2394.572,2397.341,"So isn't that -- aren't you back to the ""nothing to lose"" argument?"
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2407.213,2414.468,He had an obligation to proffer it because he was operating on a fundamental misunderstanding of California law.
2008.07-1315,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2414.468,2440.268,"You say that repeatedly, but what is there to show that he misunderstood -- that he misunderstood California law, as opposed to making a practical calculation about how juries would look at this evidence, having found -- having heard the evidence of premeditation and having found premeditation, even though that doesn't decide the NGI issue, as a matter of law."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2448.84,2449.559,Yes.
2008.07-1315,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2449.559,2457.645,"Where in the record does it show that he misunderstood the law, as opposed to making a practical evaluation of what the jury was likely to do?"
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2457.645,2471.822,"Well, I -- I will -- I could rattle off page numbers from where he said that the jury finding of premeditation and deliberation was the functional equivalent of a finding of sanity."
2008.07-1315,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2474.657,2479.245,"He didn't use the word ""functional equivalent"" in the portions I read."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2480.945,2482.113,"He did not say ""the functional equivalent""."
2008.07-1315,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2482.997,2483.313,No.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2486.065,2487.232,--Yes.
2008.07-1315,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2487.232,2487.851,--almost perpendicular.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2531.428,2539.966,"Well, that -- that's a challenge that faces every criminal defense attorney in a case when you have a -- a credible defense like this."
2008.07-1315,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2544.853,2546.42,Isn't there something on the other side?
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2594.87,2605.844,"Well, if there had been a tactical purpose such as that, that would have been an interesting fact to add to the calculus here, but he absolutely denied there was any benefit to his client."
2008.07-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2605.844,2615.117,"Well, maybe -- maybe he did, but when we come to judge prejudice, don't we have to judge prejudice by considering exactly what Justice Ginsburg just said?"
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2647.771,2651.973,"Well, it -- it may well be if there was a--"
2008.07-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2651.973,2652.909,"Well, shouldn't that be?"
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2652.909,2656.36,--if there was a possibility that there could be any difference whatsoever at sentencing.
2008.07-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2666.299,2666.882,How did he know that?
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2666.882,2668.251,--How did he know that?
2008.07-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2672.47,2673.336,"Yes, but the judge hadn't sentenced yet."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2673.336,2684.178,"Correct, but under California law there -- it's a mandatory prison sentence for use of a gun, so -- and the sentence for first-degree murder is 25 to life."
2008.07-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2684.178,2687.313,So you're saying the judge had no discretion whatsoever?
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2687.313,2688.498,Correct.
2008.07-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2688.498,2689.282,"So, therefore--"
2008.07-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.282,2692.884,"--25 to life is 25, 26, 27, 28."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2695.502,2696.486,"No, no."
2008.07-1315,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2698.52,2698.92,No.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2702.855,2703.591,No.
2008.07-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2705.824,2709.495,--You're saying the terms of the sentence had to be 25 to life?
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2709.495,2709.895,--Correct.
2008.07-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2709.895,2712.613,So there was no discretion on the trial judge's part.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2712.613,2712.897,Correct.
2008.07-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2712.897,2713.347,I see.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2713.347,2713.647,Correct.
2008.07-1315,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2719.351,2721.053,So he's got nothing to lose?
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2721.053,2724.171,He's got nothing to lose and something to gain.
2008.07-1315,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2733.277,2749.203,"I guess that gets me back to what one -- what I thought the case was postured in, which is whether or not a case from this Court clearly establishes when you have nothing to lose, you've got to go ahead and present the defense, or it's a violation of Strickland."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2751.405,2755.624,--There is no case that this Court has so pronounced.
2008.07-1315,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2758.476,2764.713,"I -- I understood your responses to the various questions here to, in effect, be arguing for that standard."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2772.034,2775.586,"--Well, they're all part of the calculus of reasonable performance."
2008.07-1315,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2792.03,2799.803,"Well, he made a determination -- he made a determination after thorough investigation, the various points I went through with you earlier, that it was not a credible defense."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2812.877,2825.601,"--Well, the -- this Court has said that errors of misunderstanding -- well, the Court has said that failure to fact-investigate can be a basis for objectively unreasonable performance."
2008.07-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2851.652,2857.723,"Yes, but I didn't -- I didn't take that to mean under California law, since the jury found the one, it has to find the other."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2874.701,2880.421,"Well -- well, I -- that might be the case if he did not misunderstand California law."
2008.07-1315,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2880.421,2883.04,"Well, it's hard for me to believe that he didn't."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2902.435,2904.786,"Well, the circuit in--"
2008.07-1315,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2904.786,2906.988,"By the magistrate, there's no finding to that effect."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2906.988,2911.04,"--That's correct, because the magistrate did really not make a finding on prong one."
2008.07-1315,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3014.658,3017.727,But they didn't -- they didn't strike the expert's testimony.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3021.096,3022.081,--He did.
2008.07-1315,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3022.081,3027.267,"So that was relevant to premeditation and deliberation, and the jury did consider what the mental health expert said."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3027.267,3035.105,"They did consider what he said, but they were precluded from channeling that into a defense to premeditation and deliberation."
2008.07-1315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3035.105,3040.825,"Well, what about -- what do you do with the last sentence of the supreme -- of the California Court of Appeal's opinion?"
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3064.191,3066.976,And -- and you were reading from the California Court of--
2008.07-1315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3066.976,3069.178,I was just reading from the California Court of Appeal.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3102.583,3124.515,"--Well, the California Court of Appeal did not have before them the evidence that came in by way of petition, which was all of the psychiatric opinions of the forensic psychiatrists who gave declarations saying that Mr. Mirzayance was insane at the time of the homicide."
2008.07-1315,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3188.688,3195.361,"Well, please correct me if I'm wrong, but as a general rule psychiatrists don't -- don't testify as to the ultimate standard."
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3205.567,3220.727,"In California in 1982, there was a statutory amendment which prohibited forensic experts from testifying to opinions at the guilt phase, so that -- on legal issues like premeditation and deliberation."
2008.07-1315,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3232.884,3240.306,Had Wager ever represented a defendant who pled NGI?
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3240.306,3241.29,No.
2008.07-1315,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3369.339,3372.375,Has he served his time so far in a regular institution?
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3372.375,3373.043,"Yes, he has."
2008.07-1315,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3379.714,3385.968,Is that the special -- he made a request for a particular prison.
2008.07-1315,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3387.403,3388.353,--I don't think so.
2008.07-1315,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3425.51,3426.545,"Thank you, counsel."

2008.07-1315,2,41767,steven_e_mercer,,3429.314,3435.05,Just a couple of points I'd like to make briefly to clarify a couple things.
2008.07-1315,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3552.627,3555.177,What -- what discretion did the judge have?

2008.07-1315,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3578.41,3579.695,Wasn't there also something about the revocations?
2008.07-1315,2,41767,steven_e_mercer,,3588.634,3591.936,I don't believe that's correct.

2008.07-1315,2,41767,steven_e_mercer,,3661.945,3672.97,"That the decision, fairly read, states only that counsel has a duty to present substantial viable defense where there was an objective prospect for success and no strategic or other benefit in abandoning it."
2008.07-1315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3676.155,3677.191,"--Thank you, counsel."
