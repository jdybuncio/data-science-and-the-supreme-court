2019.18-1048,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.36,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1048, GE Energy Power Conversion France versus Outokumpu. Mr. Dvoretzky."
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,11.36,24.2,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If this case involved a domestic arbitration agreement, GE Energy could enforce it as long as it could satisfy domestic non-signatory enforcement doctrines like equitable estoppel."
2019.18-1048,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,139.32,169.2,"Mr. Dvoretzky, if -- if you and I have an agreement to arbitrate, and even if you tell me, you know, I -- I might have Mr. Hacker do most of the work under it, and I just want to make that clear to you, and then you do hire Mr. Hacker to do all the work in it. He can't be compelled to arbitrate with me if I don't like the quality of his work, right? He's not a signatory to our arbitration agreement."
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,180.4,186.6,I think whether he could arbitrate would depend on the domestic doctrine about non-signatory enforcement.
2019.18-1048,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,204.8,212.84,I thought it was one of the central propositions of our arbitration precedents that arbitration is based on agreement.
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,222.8,225.08,"Arbitration is, of course, a matter of consent."
2019.18-1048,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,260.28,260.8,"Well, what if the --"
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,260.8,261.6,The question --
2019.18-1048,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,261.6,276.52,"What if the law of the jurisdiction whose law would be chosen permits arbitration without any consent whatsoever? I guess you'd have to say that that's -- that's okay, right?"
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,276.52,280.56,That -- the Convention doesn't prevent that.
2019.18-1048,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,311.6,345.28,"So you're saying that when the United States entered into the Convention and when it then implemented the Convention through the FAA, Congress didn't understand arbitration to mean voluntary arbitration? The, you know -- my -- my question I guess is the same as Justice Alito's. It seems odd that Congress would have passed the implementing legislation on the view that another contracting state could compel arbitration without any consent whatsoever."
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,345.28,350.84,"Justice Kagan, I think this goes to the core question of what the Convention is trying to do."
2019.18-1048,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,404.56,405.04,But you don't --
2019.18-1048,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,405.04,422.4,"The fact is, you started out very broadly, and suddenly I get worried, are some people who -- the seller agrees that I'll go to arbitration, I agree with you, okay? Now, I don't want to go."
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,520.12,521.12,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1048,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,528.92,529.12,And --
2019.18-1048,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,529.12,531.88,Which is a fairly basic proposition of law.
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,566.4,567.2,"So, Mr. Chief Justice --"
2019.18-1048,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,567.2,569.88,Not to suggest I have a view either way. (Laughter.)
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,569.88,575.84,I -- I don't think this is contrary to all of this Court's precedents on arbitration.
2019.18-1048,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,586.88,587.2,Can you --
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,587.2,587.52,-- precisely --
2019.18-1048,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,587.52,613.2,"Can you -- can we -- can we understand why Respondent should be equitably estopped? This case is going in the brief, and so far in the oral argument on a level once -- once removed from the basic facts on the ground. So what is it in this case that makes the doctrine of equitable estoppel appropriate?"
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,613.2,615.16,Let me make two points on that.
2019.18-1048,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,648.72,667.2,"And -- and -- even though at the time the contract was made, the subcontractors hadn't been picked, so there were -- GE was on a list of potential subcontractors, but was not, in fact, a subcontractor at the time of the arbitration agreement?"
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,667.2,688.64,"I don't believe that it had been picked, but there were active and extensive discussions, including with the Respondents, about using GE as a subcontractor, so it was certainly contemplated. And if you -- if you follow the definitions of seller and -- and -- buyer and seller and parties in the contract that GE is actually a party to the agreement."
2019.18-1048,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,723.72,724.04,Counsel --
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,724.04,724.48,And this --
2019.18-1048,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,724.48,730.56,-- we're going well down this rabbit hole on whether equitable estoppel applies in this case.
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,755.12,756.88,"No, that -- that's correct, Justice Gorsuch."
2019.18-1048,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,769.32,772.8,"If it exists, without prejudging whether it exists."
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,772.8,773.52,Correct.
2019.18-1048,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,773.52,774.04,Okay.
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,774.04,784.44,"And that -- much the same as the posture in Arthur Andersen where the Court sent the case back for the lower courts to determine whether equitable estoppel exists under the applicable law and, if so, whether it could be satisfied."
2019.18-1048,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,784.44,787.28,"But Mr. Dvoretzky, that -- that is the question."
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,845.88,861.84,"Justice Kagan, I think the key point is that Article III does not say ""only the parties."" In other words, the bear minimum the contracting states agree to do is to refer a case to arbitration if the parties -- whether you think that's to be --"
2019.18-1048,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,861.84,879.36,"Well, let me read you a few sentences, Mr. Dvoretzky and you tell me whether you always have to say ""shall only"" if you say ""shall."" If I say federal courts shall have jurisdiction over federal questions, would this statute also permits those courts to exercise jurisdiction over state questions?"
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,879.36,881.28,"No, and Justice Kagan, I -- I --"
2019.18-1048,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,881.28,884.52,I'm going to give you one more just to prove the point. (Laughter.)
2019.18-1048,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,884.52,887.24,Shareholders shall appoint two directors to the board.
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,891.4,892.2,No.
2019.18-1048,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,892.2,895.84,"Because ""shall"" means ""shall only"" in many circumstances, right?"
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,895.84,897.36,It -- it depends on context.
2019.18-1048,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,897.36,897.8,It does.
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,897.8,928.12,"And the context here based on the purpose of the Convention, based on how this Convention has been nearly universally understood by contracting states, which is a key factor in this Court's treaty interpretation jurisprudence, is that this -- this provision, Article II(3), like the rest of the Convention, is just setting a floor on what contracting states agree to do. So at a minimum, they agree that they shall -- the courts shall refer cases to arbitration when requested by the parties, but not that they shall only do so."
2019.18-1048,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,934.24,934.48,Right.
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,976.68,979.44,And again I would take you back to Arthur Andersen.
2019.18-1048,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1016.16,1017.08,"Counsel, we often --"
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1017.08,1017.92,"But, moreover --"
2019.18-1048,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1017.92,1019.8,-- we often -- I'm sorry.
2019.18-1048,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1019.8,1053.72,"Is it -- is it necessary to go so far as to say that the Convention says nothing about what the relevant law of a particular jurisdiction says about who can enforce an arbitration agreement or could it say -- could it perhaps go beyond strictly the signatories to the agreement and encompass some other non-parties that have a sufficient -- that have a close connection, as would be the case with somebody who was equitably estopped?"
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1053.72,1054.48,If I may answer?
2019.18-1048,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1054.48,1055.08,Sure.
2019.18-1048,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1055.4,1058.4,I think that's right and it's not just equitable estoppel.
2019.18-1048,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1076.96,1078.44,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ellis."
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1078.44,1100.68,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The New York Convention place an important but limited role in the recognition of international arbitration agreements.
2019.18-1048,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1160.88,1161.48,Excuse me --
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1161.48,1164.36,-- compelling arbitration on estoppel grounds.
2019.18-1048,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1164.36,1166.4,-- there are two ways to reach your result.
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1190.24,1190.84,Yes.
2019.18-1048,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1190.84,1208.68,"That's odd, indeed, because as Justice -- as the Chief Justice noted and Justice Kagan noted, it seems always that a signed written agreement respecting consent is a minimum requirement."
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1274.0,1274.8,That's right.
2019.18-1048,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1274.8,1283.52,"So there's common ground, but I do think within that common ground, there has to be a limiting principle established somewhere."
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1310.36,1310.48,Sure.
2019.18-1048,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1310.48,1312.84,-- let them be sued.
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1312.84,1313.2,Sure.
2019.18-1048,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1313.2,1339.24,"So assuming we're on common ground or I am, that we have some, some basis to say that contracting states can pick who parties are, what's the limiting principle after that? What's the limiting principle of equitable estoppel? It can't be every single type of equitable estoppel is okay."
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1339.24,1339.52,Sure.
2019.18-1048,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1342.36,1345.8,"And, by the way, on this case, it's easy to win."
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1345.8,1346.12,Right.
2019.18-1048,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1347.56,1362.32,"And very -- on this case, no matter what the theory of equitable estoppel is, a seller who's defined within the contract to include suppliers that include GE, that seems like a fairly straightforward case to me."
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1362.32,1377.24,"So -- so we haven't taken a position on -- on the ultimate resolution, but we agree -- and it sounds like you agree -- that the Eleventh Circuit's rule is just wrong, that it's not categorically limited to signatories. That's enough to resolve this case. Now, as for limiting principles, I think there are limiting principles."
2019.18-1048,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1432.08,1432.64,But that's going --
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1432.64,1434.52,-- has not given up its right to enforce the --
2019.18-1048,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1434.52,1446.68,"-- much further afield than I think other contracting states have and it's reading Article VII into Article II, which to me is illogical."
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1446.68,1450.2,We don't think you have to read Article VII on its text to do that.
2019.18-1048,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1461.6,1469.64,That -- that seems contrary to the very strict requirements that you need a written agreement between the parties.
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1469.64,1470.24,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2019.18-1048,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1470.24,1480.24,I think that's a very different argument than saying you have some play in the joints with respect to who parties are and that domestic law can inform that.
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1480.24,1482.04,I -- I -- and -- and I want to be clear.
2019.18-1048,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1513.96,1514.4,Counsel --
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1514.4,1514.84,-- to conclude --
2019.18-1048,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1514.84,1515.68,Can -- can we go --
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1515.68,1518.24,-- to support the Eleventh Circuit's rule.
2019.18-1048,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1518.24,1536.84,"-- back to -- to a question Justice Kagan raised? There are these privity-like people and then there's this doctrine of equitable estoppel, which we're told that many of our treaty partners do not recognize."
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1590.48,1592.0,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1048,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1619.4,1633.64,"But that has been described as the -- the Latin phrase you just used, as akin to traditional estoppel as opposed to this equitable estoppel."
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1633.64,1641.36,"Sure, that's fair enough. I guess the -- the overarching point is that nothing in the Convention draws the sort of line that Respondent is trying to do."
2019.18-1048,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1675.44,1675.96,Counsel --
2019.18-1048,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1675.96,1689.12,"Before your time runs out, I'd like you to answer specifically, in the Public Citizens' brief, they cite a case called Todd v. Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association."
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1719.6,1721.48,So I -- I apologize.
2019.18-1048,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1742.64,1744.84,Justice Gorsuch has a question.
2019.18-1048,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1744.84,1765.4,"Counsel, I'm -- I understand that different countries may have different views about equitable estoppel or other kinds of non-signatory, non-strict consent arbitrations. Is there any disagreement among countries about how to read the Convention itself with respect to whether it creates a floor or a ceiling?"
2019.18-1048,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1765.4,1770.2,Not that I'm aware of. The only -- at least not of any -- any significance.
2019.18-1048,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1809.44,1812.32,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hacker."
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1812.32,1854.04,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: GE cannot compel Outokumpu to arbitrate its tort claim with GE because there is no written arbitration agreement between them. I agree that would generally not be an obstacle in a domestic arbitration case because, as this Court held in Arthur Andersen, Chapter 1's agreement enforcement provision, FAA Section 3, does not limit enforcement to ""parties to a written agreement."" But the lack of a written agreement is decisive here because the Convention's enforcement provision, Article II, Section 3, is limited to the parties to a written arbitration agreement."
2019.18-1048,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1942.12,1945.84,"Mr. Hacker, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I did want to spin back a little bit."
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1956.72,1959.16,I -- I hope you misheard me.
2019.18-1048,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1959.16,1959.56,Okay.
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1959.56,1963.68,I definitely did not -- did not believe this contract can be enforced by GE.
2019.18-1048,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1975.92,1983.28,"I thought you said at the first part Arthur Andersen and, yes, there would be a real question here but it's -- there's no real question here because of the Convention."
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1983.28,1989.84,That's -- in a domestic arbitration case Arthur Andersen would -- would control and you'd ask whether the controlling state law allowed for equitable estoppel.
2019.18-1048,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1989.84,1990.04,Okay.
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1990.04,1991.44,This is not a domestic arbitration.
2019.18-1048,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1991.44,1991.68,Okay.
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1995.56,2003.04,"You'd look to do -- applicable state law, there's no applicable state law here, it's German law and you would have to determine whether or not equitable estoppel applied here."
2019.18-1048,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2006.12,2019.48,"But -- but for the Convention, despite the international character of this agreement, we would have a choice of law problem undoubtedly but we'd find some choice of law, look and see whether equitable estoppel is a permissible argument to be made in an arbitration case like this?"
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2019.48,2021.16,"In a domestic case, that's correct."
2019.18-1048,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2022.68,2025.2,"If it weren't governed by the Convention, but for the Convention --"
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2025.2,2025.28,Right.
2019.18-1048,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2025.28,2027.04,-- it would be a choice of law problem?
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2027.04,2027.44,Yes.
2019.18-1048,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2027.44,2027.92,Okay.
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2027.92,2029.72,"That would be the first question, choice of law."
2019.18-1048,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2033.48,2039.2,Would this be a question under regular estoppel rules? Forget about equitable estoppel.
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2043.84,2044.44,No.
2019.18-1048,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2044.44,2045.2,Why not?
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2045.2,2046.64,Because traditional --
2019.18-1048,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2046.64,2051.2,They are defined as sellers in the contract.
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2060.32,2060.84,All right.
2019.18-1048,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2061.28,2062.64,You signed a contract.
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2079.76,2081.12,If I can separate that out.
2019.18-1048,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2088.84,2089.16,Why?
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2089.16,2096.0,"-- they're not a party to the arbitration clause, because as we know, under international law, arbitration clauses are separable from the rest of the contract."
2019.18-1048,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2123.8,2125.4,When seller -- I'm reading the contract.
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2140.68,2144.24,"They're not stated otherwise in the arbitration clause, except that the arbitration clause is separable."
2019.18-1048,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2146.88,2147.84,So what?
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2147.84,2148.16,Because --
2019.18-1048,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2148.16,2154.32,Who are the parties -- where does it say that subcontractors are not sellers for purposes of the arbitration clause?
2019.18-1048,2,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2154.32,2161.08,"It doesn't say it in the arbitration clause but we know, we know, Your Honor, that ""seller"" doesn't actually mean subcontractor everywhere in the contract."
2019.18-1048,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2174.72,2175.08,I know --
2019.18-1048,3,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2175.08,2176.16,-- subcontractors receive --
2019.18-1048,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2176.16,2176.6,I understand --
2019.18-1048,3,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2176.6,2176.84,-- all the payments.
2019.18-1048,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2176.84,2185.96,"-- these are good arguments, but it -- it seems to me that it's one thing to say we're going to force all these suppliers into arbitration, compel them without their consent."
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2211.08,2211.88,"I -- Well, I --"
2019.18-1048,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2211.88,2213.0,I think that's Justice Sotomayor's point.
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2213.0,2215.96,"-- let me -- first of all, domestic law -- domestic law is not at issue here."
2019.18-1048,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2226.28,2227.52,Here is where.
2019.18-1048,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2230.6,2247.88,"A. James Casner, who was my property professor, and a great man would also often use the word -- if we look at the sentence 3 of Article II, of course that word ""parties"" does not mean the parties in court."
2019.18-1048,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2274.84,2278.88,So the words that he used are not privity.
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2338.04,2339.76,Nodding only that I understand your question.
2019.18-1048,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2339.76,2340.84,"Oh, okay. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2340.84,2342.72,I don't think I'm going to agree with where you're heading.
2019.18-1048,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2342.72,2343.8,Then you can say -- all right.
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2377.64,2381.52,"So the answer is I don't think ""stand in the shoes"" is any more clear than --"
2019.18-1048,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2381.52,2385.36,"Oh, no, it isn't but it doesn't purport to be. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2385.36,2385.96,Right.
2019.18-1048,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2404.52,2404.72,What do we --
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2404.72,2406.4,And that is a very easy and clear line.
2019.18-1048,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2406.4,2412.88,"What do we have to decide? The -- the Eleventh Circuit said a non-signatory can never enforce, right?"
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2412.88,2414.12,"Not quite, no."
2019.18-1048,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2414.12,2416.52,It said a non-signatory cannot enforce.
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2416.52,2418.88,It -- it said non-signatories include their privities.
2019.18-1048,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2449.52,2450.36,"Well, How does this --"
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2450.36,2451.6,-- party to the agreement.
2019.18-1048,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2451.6,2465.88,"How does this concept of privity, which is, as far as I'm -- as far as I'm aware, is a feature of Anglo-American law, become the -- become the controlling standard under this international agreement?"
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2465.88,2468.24,"Well, I -- it's not limited to Anglo-American law."
2019.18-1048,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2471.04,2474.56,"Okay, well, what's the doctrine of privity under German law?"
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2474.56,2477.92,"I -- I don't know what the German word is, but I'm sure it's extremely long. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2477.92,2481.12,But it's going to mean some version of the same thing.
2019.18-1048,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2481.12,2482.08,What is it under Japanese law?
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2482.08,2529.28,"The question -- the question being asked under whatever, you know, privity rules you're invoking are, is this party the same party for some reason as a signatory? That's not the question that is raised by the equitable estoppel claim that GE is raising. It's a fundamentally different question about -- I agree, I am not a signatory, I am not in privity with a signatory; I just want to make them enforce -- make them arbitrate with me because... because it's more convenient to, it seems efficient, it seems fair, whatever rules, you know, the local jurisdiction might invoke. They want to say those local rules, the equitable, fairness, justice principles of a given state, can trump what the Convention says, at least in a Convention-governed arbitration, the Convention says it's supposed to be a written agreement between the parties."
2019.18-1048,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2529.28,2539.88,"I think -- I think the argument on the other side would be that -- that equitable estoppel or estoppel, whatever you want to -- however you want to describe it here, is -- is -- is that your client effectively did consent."
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2543.16,2544.2,I -- I understand.
2019.18-1048,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2544.2,2578.84,"So -- so what do you do about -- do about that, Number 1? And Number 2, in a completely different line -- and take them as you choose, okay -- normally when we interpret treaties to bind domestic law, we require a pretty clear statement when -- when we're staying Congress's hand in an area. And if the FAA, hypothetically -- and I'm not passing on it; we don't need to -- were to allow equitable estoppel doctrine and the Convention didn't allow domestic law to do that, wouldn't we require a clearer statement than what we have here?"
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2578.84,2582.72,"Let me answer the first question, which I think I'll actually answer by the Convention."
2019.18-1048,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2607.4,2610.32,Except for the fact -- except for -- I'm sorry to interrupt.
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2616.56,2617.44,Because they're --
2019.18-1048,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2617.44,2620.44,-- who may not have strictly consented.
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2626.2,2631.6,"I disagree, Your Honor, because what -- what you have is a consent -- a written agreement between parties."
2019.18-1048,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2691.88,2693.24,"Mr. Hacker, sorry --"
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2693.24,2693.36,Please.
2019.18-1048,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2693.36,2693.64,Did you --
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2693.64,2695.56,"No, go ahead."
2019.18-1048,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2695.56,2708.36,"Your argument here does rest on reading Article II and especially sentence 3 as not just a floor; as a -- as a -- as a ceiling -- as a floor and a ceiling, both."
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2708.36,2709.0,That's correct.
2019.18-1048,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2709.0,2725.08,"So where do you get that understanding from? Because Mr. Dvoretzky, the solicitor general, says the parties to the Convention were just concerned about people not enforcing arbitration agreements."
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2736.52,2737.4,So a couple points.
2019.18-1048,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2774.52,2778.84,What -- why is it so clear that the first one is a mandatory requirement?
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2778.84,2780.24,"Well, the United States concedes it."
2019.18-1048,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2795.08,2795.32,Right.
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2797.2,2798.2,Correct.
2019.18-1048,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2798.2,2803.48,And what in the context do you think indicates that this is a ceiling?
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2803.48,2809.2,Because it's what's required to trigger the protections of -- the requirements of Article IV and Article V for enforcement.
2019.18-1048,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2809.2,2809.56,But counsel --
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2809.56,2810.44,You have to have an agreement under Article --
2019.18-1048,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2810.44,2812.08,-- that -- that -- that's a non sequitur.
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2830.96,2831.56,Yes.
2019.18-1048,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2832.52,2835.48,"I think that's the question Justice Kagan is asking, and if you could address that."
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2835.48,2839.32,"I -- I meant to be answering within the confines of the Convention, because that's all it takes here."
2019.18-1048,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2839.32,2841.4,Forget about within the context of the Convention.
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2841.4,2841.96,Right.
2019.18-1048,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2841.96,2849.08,Is there a universe of arbitration agreements that a domestic law might enforce that might not be enforceable under the Convention?
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2849.08,2849.8,Yes.
2019.18-1048,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2853.56,2854.08,Here --
2019.18-1048,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2854.08,2857.16,"I'm sorry, I'm -- I'm sorry, and I apologize."
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2868.48,2872.24,Because they can't proceed under the Convention -- under domestic law under U.S. law.
2019.18-1048,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2911.8,2912.72,Can you tell us what is --
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2912.72,2913.8,There is no Chapter 1 here that --
2019.18-1048,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2913.8,2930.12,"Can you tell us what is going on in this -- in this very case? The party that you call Fives has to arbitrate, there is a written agreement, and there is an arbitration in Berlin; is that right, going on?"
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2930.12,2930.72,Dusseldorf.
2019.18-1048,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2930.72,2932.4,I see.
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2946.6,2946.92,Yes.
2019.18-1048,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2946.92,2972.0,"So you have two cases, which in the best of all possible worlds because they're linked would be heard in the same forum, one going to an arbitration panel in Berlin and the other going to the state court in Alabama, but that's the result of your view of what the Convention requires?"
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,2972.0,2978.92,"Well, if -- if -- if we had prevailed and didn't get before this Court, we would just be proceeding in Alabama as we should be."
2019.18-1048,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2990.08,3009.44,"What I mean is that the relationship between the subcontractor and the contractor, vis-a-vis the buyer, that -- that litigation ideally would be all one case; instead we have this split."
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,3009.44,3027.2,"Well, again, it might be. We had an action against Fives, decided not to pursue it because Fives from the very outset said it's not our problem, they supplied the motors, they were the problem, GE screwed up. GE will take care of it, don't talk to us, we pursued it for a while with Fives."
2019.18-1048,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3058.84,3065.08,I'm interested in -- you want to read that sentence 3 as the ceiling. You know what I am talking about?
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,3065.08,3065.8,The Article II --
2019.18-1048,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3065.8,3066.6,"Yeah, Article II --"
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,3066.6,3067.36,-- paragraph 3.
2019.18-1048,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3067.36,3069.2,-- sentence 3 as a ceiling.
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,3069.84,3070.6,Well -- the whole --
2019.18-1048,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3070.6,3074.04,"Yeah, but then the word ""privity"" doesn't appear there, you know, so you say almost a ceiling."
2019.18-1048,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3121.0,3122.04,Don't worry.
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,3171.24,3206.48,"I think the problem is what you -- what was described earlier as a choice-of-law problem, which I think your international commentators recognize that the law has to be governed by universally recognized international law principles because if you open up the door to domestic law on what seems like a, gee, that seems an eminently fair situation and say domestic law gets to decide who gets to enforce, that creates a huge problem under the Convention because then states can begin subjecting parties to arbitration, absent their consent, unwilling parties when the Convention clearly intends to be --"
2019.18-1048,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3206.48,3207.04,All right.
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,3207.04,3207.32,-- required to --
2019.18-1048,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3207.32,3232.04,"He had a list about a thousand miles long, it seemed to me, of authorities, cases, professors, and others who say all these other people have enforced that particular sentence in a way that it allows at least some, perhaps not all, of those who are hard to call privities to enforce under certain circumstances and this is one."
2019.18-1048,4,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,3233.08,3238.48,The circumstance in which it is widely and I would say essentially universally recognized is only one.
2019.18-1048,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3508.2,3512.72,"Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Dvoretzky."
2019.18-1048,5,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3512.72,3514.8,Thank you.
2019.18-1048,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3575.04,3576.44,What are they?
2019.18-1048,5,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3576.44,3585.64,"It would depend on the contours of state law, but presumably state law would not allow you to tag a random person on the street with no connection to the contract and say you're equitably estopped."
2019.18-1048,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3658.4,3659.08,The second?
2019.18-1048,5,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3659.08,3678.56,"The second way to resolve it, as Justice Sotomayor was suggesting, the term parties in Article II(3) is undefined. Domestic law fills that gap, as it does for many other things under the Convention, terms like ""null and void,"" ""incapable of being performed."" Those are not defined by the Convention but the Convention looks to domestic law, as it does for parties."
2019.18-1048,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3678.56,3679.56,"Thank you, counsel."
