1999.98-9349,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.505,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 98-9349, Steven Dewayne Bond v. The United States."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,10.728,15.467,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:--"
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.213,135.813,"But the difference... the difference, Ms. Fuentes, if there is one, I mean, the difference asserted, is whether there's a reasonable expectation of privacy, and you do have a reasonable expectation of privacy in your clothing."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,137.37,139.016,I think that's--
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.016,151.56,"But you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy, your opponents will say, in a soft bag that you chuck into a... you know, a carrier on the airplane."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,153.745,155.896,"--Well, of course, we dispute that, Your Honor."
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,167.434,168.377,"But... now, how can that be?"
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,175.551,184.962,"He reasonably expected that other passengers might push or move the luggage if they needed to make room for their own, but that is not what Agent Cantu did."
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,184.962,185.73,They couldn't have squeezed it?
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,185.73,191.742,"I think they could have squeezed it, but again that is not what Agent Cantu did."
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,205.678,207.387,But there are some nasty passengers who may go beyond that.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,225.193,226.739,In that--
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,226.739,229.075,"Now, it may be a nasty thing for people to look into your room."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,229.075,255.988,"--In that case, I think it's correct, Your Honor, but I think one of the major distinctions between Mr. Bond's case and the public exposure cases are that in fact those observa... the observations in those cases and in the example that you just gave took place from public thoroughfares, and this Court has found that people don't have a reasonable expectation to be free of visual observations made by those who are in a vantage point where they have a right to be."
1999.98-9349,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,256.617,264.719,We had a case that involved an apartment building and the police went right next to the particular apartment.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,268.327,271.862,--I believe you're talking about Minnesota v. Carver--
1999.98-9349,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,271.862,272.141,Yes.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,272.141,276.714,"--Justice Ginsburg, and I think in that case it was still from a public vantage point."
1999.98-9349,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,286.631,296.973,"Well, but you would have to contend... well, you don't contend that the aisle of an interstate bus is not a public place for this purpose?"
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,300.33,305.549,"He did, and if he had made his observations from the aisle, we might have a bad case, but he did not."
1999.98-9349,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,317.404,317.838,"Yes, but he was standing in the aisle."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,335.761,336.544,I don't think so.
1999.98-9349,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,336.544,337.098,Isn't--
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,337.098,337.941,I'm sorry.
1999.98-9349,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,337.941,338.49,--Go ahead.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,338.49,344.577,"I don't think that is the analogy, and I think the Court recognized as much in the Dickerson case."
1999.98-9349,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,348.605,352.208,"Okay, but it seems to me, and this was what I was going to ask you to comment--"
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,352.208,352.403,Certainly.
1999.98-9349,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,352.403,352.872,--on.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,357.591,358.16,Correct.
1999.98-9349,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,358.16,365.451,"Don't we draw a line between looking, which is basically free, and feeling, which is not basically free?"
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,365.451,371.699,"Yes, I would agree, and that is another point that distinguishes Mr. Bond's case from the public exposure cases."
1999.98-9349,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,371.699,382.129,"What do I do with the following problem for me, which is, I fly quite a lot up to Boston and so forth, and I put bags all the time in the upper thing, and people are always moving them around."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,413.788,417.056,I think that that experience is the reasonable expectation.
1999.98-9349,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,437.891,444.317,"Well, Ms. Fuentes, you know, we don't have a lot of evidence here about exactly what Agent Cantu did."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,463.035,464.302,"--I think... excuse me, Your Honor."
1999.98-9349,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,480.378,483.711,"I thought it turned out it was an oval, not a brick at all."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,483.711,488.61,--It was wrapped with duct tape until it became oval shaped.
1999.98-9349,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,496.161,498.741,"How large was the brick, Ms. Fuentes?"
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,499.903,505.401,The brick was approximately 4 to 5 inches wide by 6 to 7 inches long.
1999.98-9349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,507.672,515.47,There's a difference here in what the police officer did and what the fellow passenger does to Justice Breyer's luggage.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,542.662,543.935,We do--
1999.98-9349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,543.935,547.737,"--of the person that touches the bag, or do we?"
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,547.737,548.42,--I--
1999.98-9349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,548.42,558.988,"Or is there something like an objective purpose that we look... I think this is one of those differences to which the law is blind, or am I wrong about that?"
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,558.988,561.397,"--No, I don't think the law is blind to it."
1999.98-9349,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,576.953,589.587,"How do we distinguish the dog sniff cases, where we've upheld the use of police dogs to sniff luggage for narcotics?"
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,589.587,599.301,"There are multiple factors, but I think the most important one is that a dog sniff is incapable of revealing anything to the police except the presence of contraband."
1999.98-9349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,599.301,611.041,"Well, just to conclude my previous question, do you submit the case on the proposition that the purpose of the search, or, rather, the touching, is irrelevant?"
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,611.041,612.578,No.
1999.98-9349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,615.404,615.964,All right.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,616.188,619.616,"--Yes, I hope so."
1999.98-9349,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,636.052,641.226,"What he do that's different, because if you're... that's... Justice Kennedy had exactly the question that I was thinking."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,660.705,665.809,"--Let me go back first to the purpose, and I think the airplane example is a very good one."
1999.98-9349,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,695.631,699.144,"Well, did he have as much of a right as a fellow passenger would have--"
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,699.144,699.573,--I don't--
1999.98-9349,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,699.573,700.606,--to manipulate the luggage?
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,700.606,708.291,"--I don't think so, but I don't know the Court has to reach that issue for the second part of the question that Justice Breyer asked--"
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,708.291,712.397,What does the right make any... why does the right make any difference?
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,743.506,744.334,--Well--
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,744.334,744.973,Anybody could do it.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,752.702,753.651,--Well--
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,753.651,754.145,--and a passenger can do that.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,758.745,766.334,"--In deciding reasonable expectations of privacy I think this Court looks at myriad factors, not just one or two, and in the garbage--"
1999.98-9349,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,766.334,777.715,"Do you agree with Justice Scalia... I don't mean to interrupt you... that if you're a passenger... first of all, I take it your... a bus case isn't like an airplane because you don't have the... luggage doesn't go through any kind of a detector."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,788.18,788.744,--No.
1999.98-9349,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,788.744,789.313,--What?
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,789.313,790.116,"No, I don't agree."
1999.98-9349,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,790.116,792.371,"So you don't agree with the premise of Justice Scalia's question, then?"
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,792.371,792.76,Correct.
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.881,804.735,"You think a person has a right to say, don't paw through my garbage?"
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,804.735,806.687,--Yes.
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,806.687,810.525,"You think a person has a right to say, don't peek into my windows?"
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,810.525,811.222,"Yes, but--"
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,811.222,813.732,"I mean, indeed, there are some laws against Peeping Toms."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,813.732,815.089,"--I agree, but as to--"
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,815.089,820.399,"But there are Peeping Toms, and when you leave your blinds open, you know you're exposing yourself to them."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,820.399,836.366,"--As to the garbage first, the privacy interest in garbage is far different than the privacy interest... the expectations may be the same, they may be similar, but the privacy interest in garbage is far different from the privacy interest in luggage."
1999.98-9349,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,836.366,839.05,Did you make the analogy to abandoned property?
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,840.403,841.555,Correct.
1999.98-9349,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,841.555,849.179,"If somebody has a piece of luggage, and the police officer says, whose is this, and nobody answers, then it's abandoned."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,849.179,849.814,Then it's abandoned.
1999.98-9349,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,849.814,851.934,Is there... I beg your pardon.
1999.98-9349,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,851.934,864.193,"But here, I think your case is resting on the difference between ordinary pushing and shoving and taking a bag and feeling around like this, which, at least from my experience on airlines, doesn't happen."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,868.43,875.475,"That is one of the major points upon which Mr. Bond's argument rests, and what Mr. Bond did, Justice Breyer... excuse me."
1999.98-9349,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,902.706,905.545,"Well, I'm not sure that's right, Ms. Fuentes."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,921.431,922.354,--No.
1999.98-9349,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,956.336,957.893,You don't mean just with respect to purpose or intent--
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,957.893,958.352,--Correct.
1999.98-9349,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,958.352,960.374,--but you mean a lot more manipulation.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,960.374,965.305,"In the manner in which the bag was manipulated, that's correct."
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.305,981.984,"You want us to decide these cases on that basis, decide in each case what degree of manipulabil... manipulation would have had to occur to... if it was a bigger brick, it might have been... I'm very unlikely to come up with a rule like that, I'll tell you."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,982.418,983.301,That is--
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,983.301,990.506,"--you can either squeeze the bags or you can't squeeze the bags, but I don't think we're likely to make it depend upon how much you squeezed it."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,990.506,993.614,"--Well, I think that is a very hard question, and I think--"
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,993.614,994.028,It is.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,994.028,999.452,"--the issue in Mr. Bond's case could be decided by saying, officers cannot squeeze bags."
1999.98-9349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,999.452,1014.021,"On the degree of manipulation point and the questions put to you by Justice Stevens and Justice Scalia, it does seem to me that a passenger does not have the right to start manipulating my luggage to see what's in it."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1025.522,1028.451,I'm not certain that it rises to the level of a tort.
1999.98-9349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1028.451,1035.178,"I'm not sure it does, although it seems to me that it's... there's some level of wrong occurring there."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1035.178,1040.712,If the officer... if Agent... Agent Cantu took that bag and he converted it to his own purpose.
1999.98-9349,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1059.707,1060.874,Did he object?
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1060.874,1062.226,"No, he did not."
1999.98-9349,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1062.226,1077.734,"And how is it different physically from, say, what happens occasionally... one of the flight attendants, or maybe a passenger will take my canvas bag out, they'll be holding it, they'll move it to a different compartment, they'll push it around, and I guess they can feel something."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1080.618,1087.477,Because Agent Cantu was able to feel more than the actions you described--
1999.98-9349,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1087.477,1087.726,How do we know that?
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1087.726,1088.48,--By his testimony.
1999.98-9349,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1102.236,1102.925,All right.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1113.231,1123.528,"--I think so, Your Honor, and I think it goes back to expectations of privacy, and not to purpose, but to how... what means are used to achieve that purpose."
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1158.392,1168.882,"You know, I'd feel more sympathetic to your client, you know, from this terrible intrusion on his privacy if there were not some very easy way to avoid it, which is called hard luggage."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1177.413,1182.167,"Well, I think that's very demonstrative of what a reasonable expectation of privacy is."
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1198.167,1202.515,"Second after that is getting a hard bag, but if he gets a soft bag he knows people are going to be able to feel things through it."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1202.515,1210.215,"--I... he expects that if he doesn't like the way people are feeling it, he can stop them, and action by a police officer is different."
1999.98-9349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1226.441,1230.722,"Well, would you agree that the passenger had a right to tell the policeman, don't feel my bag?"
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1230.722,1231.78,I think he did.
1999.98-9349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1233.278,1233.807,But he didn't do that.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1233.807,1234.235,No.
1999.98-9349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1243.724,1260.525,"Well, we've been through that in Florida and Bostick, in which we said that the police officer with a show of authority... two of them in that case, in fact, with guns and so forth... said, may I search your bag, and we said the passenger, the citizen has to exercise his rights."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1260.525,1265.811,"--Agent Cantu did not say, may I squeeze your bag, and that is really the critical--"
1999.98-9349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1265.811,1268.096,"But the point is, the passenger was there and didn't try to stop him."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1272.223,1280.751,"--I think he did have the right to do it, but the difference is, Agent Cantu came on the bus and started questioning people about their citizenship or other right to be in the country."
1999.98-9349,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1298.903,1300.381,In Bostick it rested on consent.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1302.402,1303.316,He--
1999.98-9349,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1303.316,1305.522,--endeavor to obtain consent.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1305.522,1306.409,--Correct.
1999.98-9349,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1309.438,1316.565,Did the expectation of privacy change at the moment he saw the officer squeezing and he did not object?
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1319.033,1319.448,No.
1999.98-9349,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1341.373,1346.032,What if the officer has stood there squeezing the thing for 15 minutes and he had said nothing?
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1368.963,1374.107,"--I don't think so, because the longer he squeezes the more intrusive it is."
1999.98-9349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1398.949,1410.231,I suppose what we'd be saying... I'm not sure there's any authority for it... is that your expectation of privacy is reinforced by the fact that you have at hand the means to protect it.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1410.231,1412.192,"--Yes, I think that's correct."
1999.98-9349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1412.192,1413.483,And you haven't availed yourself of that means.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1413.483,1420.213,"Well, you haven't... again, the circumstances in this case are, you haven't availed yourself of it because of the show of authority."
1999.98-9349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1423.721,1426.579,"But that's where Bostick comes in, and it seems to me that case is against you."
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1426.579,1437.745,"--Again, respectfully, I would disagree, because if Agent Cantu had said to Mr. Bond, may I squeeze your luggage, I would have a much harder case, but he didn't."
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.247,1440.81,Do you think your fellow passengers can sniff your luggage?
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1440.81,1444.083,"--I think you wouldn't like it, and I think it would--"
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1444.083,1444.797,But that's okay.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1446.867,1449.931,"--Again, you pose a very hard question--"
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1449.931,1454.699,"I mean, you have to say that it wouldn't, because we've said that the police or police dogs can sniff the luggage, right?"
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1454.699,1458.487,"--Well, we've... this Court has approved police dogs sniffing--"
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1458.487,1458.876,Uh huh.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1458.876,1460.982,"--luggage, and I think that anything--"
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1460.982,1464.039,"Now, do you think it would be an invasion of privacy if you saw a passenger who was moving--"
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1468.62,1469.831,--I think I would.
1999.98-9349,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1469.831,1470.992,"Yes, because--"
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.992,1477.663,"--I think I would, too, but you know it can happen, and you've exposed yourself to it when you put the soft luggage up there--"
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1477.663,1478.665,Because--
1999.98-9349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1478.665,1484.971,--just as you expose yourself when you put your trash out in containers that can be readily opened and looked into.
1999.98-9349,0,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1484.971,1507.469,"--Again, I find the difference between luggage, which is meant to safeguard personal belongings and kept close by, the difference between that and former possessions that have been placed in a bag and set on the street to be destroyed, to be... it is a qualitative difference that I think shows absolutely different privacy interests."
1999.98-9349,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1533.78,1534.232,"Very well, Ms. Fuentes."
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1536.727,1549.595,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:--"
1999.98-9349,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1565.198,1574.913,"Yes, but do they squeeze and manipulate it in such a way as to disclose contents by virtue of the kind of handling that's done?"
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1576.228,1586.536,"--That very well may occur, Justice O'Connor, because when bags are so handled the sense of touch inevitably operates, so if a passenger places his hands on a piece of luggage to push it or snug it into the rack, he may very well--"
1999.98-9349,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1586.536,1602.612,"Well, certainly you could, but I would think there would a difference in the kind of squeezing and manipulation that would occur to identify objects within a bag than would occur normally when you just move it to make more room for your own."
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1602.612,1604.738,"--That's possible, Your Honor."
1999.98-9349,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1621.521,1627.129,"Mr. Lamken, supposing the passenger put a sign on his bag that said, fragile, please do not touch?"
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1627.129,1636.554,"Your Honor, there's a very good possibility that touching that bag notwithstanding the sign would be a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment."
1999.98-9349,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1655.026,1655.505,Is there--
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1655.505,1656.059,--it would be a search.
1999.98-9349,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1656.059,1667.169,"--Is there a seizure or an invasion of privacy if the passenger moves your object, the object for any reason other than to make room for his or her own luggage?"
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1667.169,1681.734,"Would that constitute... well, if it's private conduct it would not be governed by the Fourth Amendment at all, but if a passenger moves it for any other reason, I don't... still don't think that would be a meaningful deprivation of a possessory interest, which... so it's not a... it's not a Fourth Amendment violation."
1999.98-9349,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1681.734,1684.713,"Well, a meaningful deprivation of possessory interest is defined how?"
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1686.834,1689.174,"Yes, that the owner's dominion or--"
1999.98-9349,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1689.174,1689.788,All right.
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1691.619,1696.259,"--No, Your Honor, I don't believe there was any injury to the chattel of any variety."
1999.98-9349,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1697.476,1698.939,I'm talking about the injury to the owner.
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1698.939,1702.267,--That he was caught with drugs and sent to jail?
1999.98-9349,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1706.413,1707.868,"You're saying he has no standing to object, he hasn't been injured."
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1709.249,1732.772,"Well, no, I'm not saying that he does not have standing to seek... file a motion to suppress, but in terms of the bag being moved, if you're applying common law standards, which would be neither necessary nor sufficient for a Fourth Amendment violation, there certainly wouldn't be any sort of tort, because there is no damage to the chattel, the object was not meaningful... he wasn't deprived of possession of it for any meaningful period of time, and in the absence of those conduct there would be no trespass to chattel."
1999.98-9349,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1746.414,1749.391,May I ask a question about the... what if he kept it in his lap?
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1749.391,1756.137,--The law treats items that are on the person and in the person's grasp as if they're part of the person itself.
1999.98-9349,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1761.505,1761.905,What if he had it under the seat?
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1763.176,1768.859,"--To the extent that's an area reserved for the exclusive use of the passenger sitting behind the seat, that would not be a public area."
1999.98-9349,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1768.859,1769.622,Maybe somebody else needed to use it.
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1777.683,1785.942,"I think ordinarily, Justice Stevens, the rule would be that the area under the seat in front of you is reserved exclusively for your use and possession."
1999.98-9349,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1787.404,1794.353,"What if the bus was empty, except for... and he had the choice of putting it in the seat or an entirely overhead bin, and only one bag up there?"
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1794.353,1795.99,"Again, I think--"
1999.98-9349,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1795.99,1796.723,What about that case?
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1796.723,1801.376,--The happenstance that the bus is empty does not convert an area that is ordinarily shared with other passengers--
1999.98-9349,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1801.376,1810.64,"So even on an empty bus, if he made the mistake of putting it up in the overhead bin he would allow it to be searched, but if he put it under the seat, it could avoid that?"
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1810.64,1821.008,"--I think that would be correct, Your Honor, because the area under the seat is reserved exclusively for his use under most circumstances, and you would not expect other passengers to be pushing or touching or having contact with the bag in that area."
1999.98-9349,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1821.008,1851.185,"Since this case may well turn on rather fine spun distinctions, would there be any difference between the situation where, by simply observing the bag, and there's something unusually kind of sticking out that you can tell, and this, where apparently there was nothing unusual sticking out, and it required, you know, pushing, feeling, whatever you want to call it, to discern the methamphetamine?"
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1851.185,1855.381,"I think, Your Honor, in both cases the question is one of knowing exposure."
1999.98-9349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1865.944,1869.541,"You do want us to go into the degree of manipulation, then, you're say."
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1877.913,1880.503,"No, I don't think that's the inquiry, Justice Scalia."
1999.98-9349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1895.167,1896.265,"Well, okay, suppose I say no."
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1896.265,1897.624,--Pardon me?
1999.98-9349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.624,1916.305,"Suppose I... if my answer to that question is no, it would not have been discerned simply by pushing or by grabbing, it would have taken... it would have had to be another member of the traveling public who wanted to know what was in the bag, and who squeezed it to figure it out, you say, if that's the case, you lose."
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1916.305,1920.945,"Yes, I think we would lose if that were the case, and... now--"
1999.98-9349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1920.945,1922.21,I think you may lose.
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1922.639,1925.857,"--I don't think so, Justice Scalia."
1999.98-9349,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1925.857,1928.136,I think you're making two different assertions.
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2012.31,2016.646,"You would choose the latter, for... because it's consistent with this Court's cases, for example."
1999.98-9349,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2024.467,2033.811,"Ah, but you're making... your argument there makes the assumption that touching and looking are for Fourth Amendment purposes identical, and I don't see that identity at all."
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2066.194,2072.556,"--Well, the two... the same Fourth Amendment principles apply to both cases, but they may turn out to yield different results."
1999.98-9349,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2073.727,2092.454,"Well, the basic principle is one of reasonable expectation, and the reasonable expectation in looking, or being seen, is different from the reasonable expectation, or the expectation about being touched, or explored by someone who is touching to find out what he can feel."
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2092.454,2105.097,"--Your Honor, that is correct, and there are many circumstances where one would knowingly expose their person, for example, to visual observation, and I can't imagine any circumstances where they'd knowingly expose... we'd say they'd knowingly expose their person to tactile observation."
1999.98-9349,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2114.216,2123.482,"It is... yes, but there again, you make the argument easy when you make it at that generality and say, it's exposed to touching."
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2130.229,2135.503,That distinction I think turns on the purpose with which someone is acting.
1999.98-9349,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2135.503,2136.132,"Well, there's--"
1999.98-9349,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2136.132,2138.641,I think that's not a purpose that the law recognizes in the Fourth Amendment--
1999.98-9349,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2138.641,2140.218,--I don't know that that is so.
1999.98-9349,2,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,3348.756,3370.859,"I think overall, Your Honor, the... all of the Government's argument is based on the knowing exposure of Mr. Bond's bag, and those cases that this Court has decided on knowing exposure vary so radically from Mr. Bond's situation that they should not be applied."
1999.98-9349,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3476.945,3479.564,"Well, I'll ask you one... I mean, when I came into this, I thought, well, it isn't that hard."
1999.98-9349,2,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,3506.684,3507.317,--Yes.
1999.98-9349,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3507.317,3507.771,Now what?
1999.98-9349,2,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,3508.624,3528.522,"Well, I think the answer is, the reason they will do it is to move their luggage, and your expectations would be violated if it were an empty bus and someone came and started touching your luggage anyway, and when our reasonable expectations of privacy are violated by private persons, that doesn't matter for Fourth Amendment purposes."
1999.98-9349,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3540.153,3543.226,"Thank you, Ms. Fuentes."
