1979.79-48,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.268,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 79-48, Andrus, Secretary of the Interior v. Glover Construction Company."
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,15.989,19.27,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-48,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,118.151,124.659,"Mr. Levander, are you going to cover the chronology of the statutes and the regulations some time in your argument?"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,124.659,128.908,"Yes, I will attempt to."
1979.79-48,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,172.722,181.163,When did the Secretary first start construing the Buy Indian Act to cover construction of roads?
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,181.163,190.083,I think that as we detailed in our brief that the earlier reports -- the Buy Indian Act itself was enacted in 1910.
1979.79-48,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,240.402,243.348,That was before the Buy Indian Act was even enacted.
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,243.348,266.749,"There was a predecessor act which has the same language and therefore should be construed similarly, and in 1910 when the act was enacted the legislative history and again the contemporary administrative reports show that Congress intended the act to apply to construction as well as to goods."
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,312.508,318.396,Did the Bureau or the Secretary ever construe it as not to apply to construction?
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,318.396,320.012,"No, they did not."
1979.79-48,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,379.605,385.749,"Mr. Levander, the word ""product"" is not used by itself, it is used as products of Indian industry."
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,385.749,386.016,Right.
1979.79-48,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,386.016,390.844,Do you normally think of road construction as a typical product of Indian industry?
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,390.844,392.91,"Well, I would think -- yes, I would."
1979.79-48,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,404.042,409.803,"Is that the normal interpretation you get in just wording the words ""products of Indian industry""?"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,415.318,415.951,I don't think so.
1979.79-48,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,415.951,416.174,You don't think it does?
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,416.174,427.497,"And the respondent concedes that the Buy Indian Act would apply to an Indian corporation today that produced electronic computers, and you would not think of that as a typical product."
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,472.672,475.42,Is that report in connection with this legislation?
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,475.42,482.459,These were annual reports that were submitted each year by both the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the Department of the Interior to Congress --
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,482.459,485.238,But did that particular comment have any specific relationship to the enactment of --
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,485.238,486.306,"Yes, it did."
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,523.068,536.236,"But I take it the Indian industry from which products may be purchased must precede the contract, the existence of the industry?"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,536.236,538.347,"I'm not quite sure I follow your question, Mr. Justice White."
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,538.347,546.721,"Well, could the government finance the Indian industry at the same time that it gives a contract to it?"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,546.721,548.854,"Well, they could but not under the Buy Indian Act."
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,550.151,558.4,"I know they could, but would they be required, would they be permitted to buy from that industry without advertising?"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,558.4,560.183,"Yes, I think they would."
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,562.469,564.745,Even though the industry was not pre-existing?
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,564.745,566.207,"Well, in 1974, Congress --"
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,566.207,570.453,Even though this was the first time the Indians had ever been in this industry?
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,570.453,584.329,"Yes, I think it would, but that is because in 1974 Congress passed the Indian Financing Act of 1974 which specifically directs the BIA to start new industries, to fund the money and to develop."
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,590.886,595.464,"I understand that, but I am wondering about the Buy Indian Act --"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,595.464,600.01,"Once the business got started, the BIA would be entitled to --"
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.01,603.781,But it must have gotten started?
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,603.781,617.4,"That's right, but as soon as it got started -- I mean I'm not sure what that -- in any event, we think that the construction of the words ""products of Indian Industry"" should be given a liberal construction."
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,961.705,965.575,"Mr. Levander, can I slow you down for a second, because I am trying to follow it."
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,970.74,971.374,Right.
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.374,976.326,But does that meet the argument presented by subsection (e) that follows?
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,976.326,979.133,"I am working my way there slowly, if I could."
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,979.133,979.503,All right.
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,979.503,980.382,Okay.
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,980.382,984.153,I thought you were going pretty fast for me.
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,984.153,986.8,"All right, I will try to slow down."
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.401,1118.846,"Mr. Levander, does section 302 itself authorize construction contracts?"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1118.846,1120.901,Does 302(e)(B)?
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.901,1131.649,Is 302 an authorizing statute or merely a statute that spells out the procedure that shall be followed when construction is otherwise authorized?
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1131.649,1135.546,302 (e)(B) --
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1135.546,1137.013,Just the whole section 302.
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1137.013,1138.037,"Oh, section 302."
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.037,1140.49,Is that an authorizing statute?
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1140.49,1150.586,It is as to negotiated contracts which are authorized by sections (1) through (14) of subsection (c).
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1164.133,1180.74,"Well, what language in section 302 authorizes the government to do anything?"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1180.74,1197.187,"302(c) says all purchase under contracts for property and services shall be made by advertising, except that such purchases and contracts may be negotiated by the agency head without advertising if -- and it lists 15 exceptions."
1979.79-48,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1197.187,1203.115,"But that wouldn't authorize an agency to go ahead and make a contract, would it?"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1203.115,1204.881,"No, that is correct."
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1231.57,1237.693,"I make the point because you rely heavily on the word ""authorize"" in (e) as I understand you."
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1237.693,1259.138,"Well, we rely heavily on the word ""authorize"" but we also rely heavily on the legislative history of that section and the clear intent that we think emanates from sections 310 and 302(a)(2) of the act as well."
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1271.981,1277.622,"Well, it would still have viability for everything except those things that are covered by 302(e), namely road construction--"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1277.622,1278.457,That's right.
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1278.457,1286.869,"-- and it seems rather clear that 302(e) was intended to have more restrictions apply to the kinds of contracts that are described, doesn't it?"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1286.869,1288.383,"Well, the legislative history is quite clear --"
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1288.383,1291.251,Otherwise you wouldn't need (E) at all.
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1291.251,1332.155,"The legislative history is quite clear as to what -- that's right, but 302(e), the legislative history to 302(e) states that the provision simply restates what is past law and that is if you look at the seven exceptions which are stated in 302(e) and compare them to the seven exceptions, the other seven exceptions in (1) through (14) which are not present there, it is quite obvious that the first seven which are mentioned would or could possibly apply to major construction, and that the other seven could not, and the other seven are items --"
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1332.155,1335.675,Are you saying otherwise authorized by law could not apply to major construction?
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1335.675,1336.904,"No, no, no."
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1337.468,1338.692,You can't have it both ways.
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1338.692,1339.235,"No, no."
1979.79-48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1448.006,1452.21,"Well, it didn't really authorize anything either, did it?"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1452.21,1452.63,That's right.
1979.79-48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1452.63,1456.641,It simply set down procedures to be followed.
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1456.641,1475.517,It simply made sure that agencies would not attempt to negotiate major construction projects without bidding based on the exemptions from advertising contained in subsections (4) through (9) and (13).
1979.79-48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1477.442,1505.797,"That was my brother Stevens' point, that section 302(e), when it says this section shall not be construed to authorize the erection, repair or furnishing of any public building or public improvement, that such authorization shall be required in the same manner as heretofore, is in a way unnecessary since section 302, the entire section didn't authorize anything."
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1505.797,1510.033,"Well, it authorized agencies to make --"
1979.79-48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1510.033,1512.939,It set down certain procedures to be followed.
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1512.939,1514.492,"That's right, but that is an authorization --"
1979.79-48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1514.492,1517.158,To carry out previous authorizations.
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1517.158,1517.599,"No, I --"
1979.79-48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1517.599,1518.964,Existing authorizations.
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1518.964,1526.814,"I'm not sure that is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart, in the sense that it didn't create any power of an agency to contract."
1979.79-48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1526.814,1527.807,No.
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1527.807,1540.444,It did create power among the agencies to negotiate contracts for which they already had authority and it is a very simple -- it just restates what is obvious from the face of section (e).
1979.79-48,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.444,1587.342,"Mr. Levander, in your brief on page 5, you say that the Buy Indian Act -- in the footnote -- is the common name for section 23 of the act of June 25, 1910, and section 23 simply consists of the statement that hereafter the purchase of Indian supplies shall be made in conformity with the requirements of section 3709 of the Revised Statutes provided that so far as may be practicable Indian labor shall be employed and purchases of the products of Indian industry will be made in the open market in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior."
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1594.071,1620.259,"Well, the first part was simply -- and was later repealed -- simply stated that the Indian, hereinafter all Indian service procurement shall be subject to the general advertising statute, that is Revised Statute 3709, but we maintain and we enact into positive law the common preference for Indian goods and Indian products and Indian labor that heretofore existed in every appropriations act since 1884."
1979.79-48,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1620.259,1623.443,So you rely simply on the proviso in section 23?
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1623.443,1628.376,"Right, which was not repealed when the first sentence was repealed."
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1628.376,1639.892,Do you think section 302 applies to this road contract at all?
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1639.892,1644.646,"Yes, I -- well, it may -- not 302, no, I don't think it applies at all."
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.957,1654.353,"In which event you never get to (15), you don't need to get to (15), do you?"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1654.353,1661.153,"Well, 310 tells you that the advertising exceptions that previously existed are preserved in their entirety --"
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.153,1664.435,"I know, but 302(a)(2) says --"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1664.435,1665.178,Right.
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1665.178,1670.051,-- says that there are some things to which this subchapter doesn't apply at all.
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1670.051,1673.663,"We think the Buy Indian Act also qualifies under that section, although we don't think the Court --"
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1673.663,1681.297,I suppose you could have saved us a lot of ear trouble if you had just argued that.
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1681.297,1684.537,"Well, we argue both in the brief, but we think that --"
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1684.537,1687.68,"But this is your stronger argument, the one you made today?"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1687.68,1694.861,We think it quite clear that the Buy Indian Act does qualify under 310 and 302(c)(15).
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1694.861,1700.849,What authority does the Secretary claim for issuing his present regulations under the Buy Indian Act?
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1700.849,1706.787,Section 2 of Title XXV authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue regulations regarding all Indian programs.
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1706.787,1715.947,So you don't think that -- he has never claimed any authority under section 302(a) to issue any regulations?
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1715.947,1717.745,302(a)?
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1717.745,1719.094,Yes.
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1719.094,1720.699,"Well, the --"
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1720.699,1736.869,"The executive agencies shall make purchases and contracts in accordance with the provisions of this chapter in implementing regulations of the administrator, so his regulations, outstanding regulations now under the Buy Indian Act, are they -- does he refer to this section at all?"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1736.869,1748.563,"No, the statute is critical, the subchapter does not apply to -- the subchapter is made inapplicable pursuant to any other law."
1979.79-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1748.563,1749.779,I understand that argument.
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1750.721,1753.049,But he has not relied on (a)(2) in issuing regulations.
1979.79-48,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1753.049,1757.749,"And he first issued this regulation in 1961, didn't he?"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1757.749,1764.552,There have been regulations or policy statements and the policy has been followed before 1961.
1979.79-48,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1771.643,1773.438,"Well, those aren't regulations."
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1773.438,1774.3,No.
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1786.991,1790.672,Do you have a cite to his regulations under the Buy Indian Act in your brief?
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1790.672,1799.618,"Yes, one of the regulations is 41 C.F.R. 14H-3.2.5.70."
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1799.618,1802.07,It is 41 --
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1802.07,1802.812,41 C.F.R. --
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1802.812,1805.494,"Give me the first number, 41 C.F.R. what?"
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1805.494,1806.367,14H.
1979.79-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.367,1806.92,That's enough.
1979.79-48,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1806.92,1807.916,Okay.
1979.79-48,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1812.119,1814.636,Very well.
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,1822.192,1826.923,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-48,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2009.584,2011.95,"The topography was quite different, was it not?"
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2011.95,2034.8,"I agree, Your Honor, it was quite different, but I think the significant point is that we built it for less than the BIA's engineer estimated it would cost, and also its specifications were changed, they built it for -- they let a contract to build it for 22 percent more than what it was estimated it would cost."
1979.79-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2245.302,2255.539,"What about services, the language of subsection (c), contracts for property and services?"
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2265.692,2274.364,"Well, I think it is a construction contract and I believe you are talking about the Federal Property Act, is that correct?"
1979.79-48,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2291.166,2293.444,"Well, they referred to Indian labor."
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2293.444,2294.859,That was in the proviso.
1979.79-48,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2410.121,2417.429,Do you differ with your colleague on the other side as to what the consistent administrative construction has been?
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2417.429,2419.287,I certainly do.
1979.79-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2456.806,2460.532,"Well, what was the view before that time, do you know?"
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2460.532,2484.174,"Well, there wasn't any evidence in the District Court, but if the competitive bidding laws have applied all along, and they have, and if the Solicitor's opinion in 1971 says for the first time that it is legal to exempt it from competitive bidding, they had to be building those projects by competitive bidding."
1979.79-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.241,2556.225,Do you agree with the government's argument that section 5 of Title 41 does not apply to a construction contract?
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2556.225,2556.945,"No, I do not."
1979.79-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2578.093,2580.0,And required advertising.
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2580.0,2580.943,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2606.261,2614.594,"Well, what about non-construction Indian products?"
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2614.594,2624.227,We believe that the Buy Indian Act can be applied to non-construction products.
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2624.227,2626.533,Because why?
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2631.244,2633.285,Because of the Buy Indian Act.
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2633.285,2647.04,So you think that the Buy Indian Act was a provision that otherwise authorized the purchase of Indian goods without advertising?
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2647.04,2647.256,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2652.048,2657.354,"So your whole case turns on the definition of ""products""?"
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2657.354,2659.844,"That's correct, I believe it does."
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2681.901,2698.886,"How about under Title 5 before the passage of the Federal Property Act, do you think that you would distinguish between construction contracts and other contracts under section 5?"
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2698.886,2714.843,"No, sir, I don't think section 5 does it, but I think the Buy Indian Act would permit the Secretary, when it was practicable, in purchasing Indian supplies to buy those products, but I don't think there is any distinction."
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2722.789,2736.572,"Then the BIA was regulated by Title 5, but you just told me that Title 5 would not require or section 5 would not require advertising under the Buy Indian Act."
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2736.572,2743.699,"Your Honor, I think what I said is, with all due respect, is that Title 5 is a general --"
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.699,2744.434,Section 5.
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2744.434,2748.252,-- section 5 was a general advertising statute.
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2757.599,2759.322,You said it was a moment ago.
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2759.322,2759.983,Okay.
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2759.983,2765.114,But do you still think it is or not?
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2765.114,2769.106,I think it is an exception to --
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2769.106,2771.39,Section 5 is an old statute.
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2771.39,2772.124,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2772.124,2776.577,And you think when the Buy Indian Act came along it was an exception to Title 5?
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2776.577,2782.99,It was a limited exception applying only to certain products of Indian industry available in the open market.
1979.79-48,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2789.566,2800.343,"Your whole case really depends upon the proposition that roadway construction is not Indian products available in the open market, is that --"
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2800.343,2801.174,That's correct.
1979.79-48,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2801.174,2802.44,Isn't that your whole case?
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2802.44,2805.329,"Well, our whole case, Mr. Justice, is that --"
1979.79-48,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2805.329,2820.659,"Because if these are Indian products available in the open market, you have just said, as I understood your answer to my brother White, they would not be subject to competitive bidding."
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2820.659,2823.483,That's correct.
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2823.483,2826.923,"Mr. Hayes, does that mean that you have abandoned your argument based on subsection (e)?"
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2826.923,2828.351,"No, it doesn't, not at all."
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2828.351,2831.534,Then you had better explain why it doesn't.
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2831.534,2832.169,Section (e) --
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2832.169,2840.81,"As I understood the court below to place alternative and separate reliance on (e), I understand you in effect to be abandoning that position."
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2840.81,2843.323,Perhaps I haven't been clear.
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2854.356,2866.066,"Well, I understand that if you are right about products under the Buy Indian Act, you don't need to reach (e); but assuming you are wrong about products, does it also take it out of (e)?"
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2866.066,2884.806,"If this Court should construe products to be roadway construction and the Buy Indian Act exempts roadway construction, then the question arises is did (e) imply the repeal of the Buy Indian Act to that extent."
1979.79-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.853,2960.069,Can't Indian products change?
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,2983.794,2994.14,"I agree with that statement, but I think that Congress has drawn a distinction between products of Indian industry and construction, and I think they --"
1979.79-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2994.14,3001.475,"Whenever a road was built, it just never was a product, that is just not within the reach of the word ""product."""
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3001.475,3015.53,"That is our position and we believe it is Congress' position because in 1908 if they had wanted it to apply, they had construction language and when they intended an act to apply to construction they said contracts let for construction of."
1979.79-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3026.779,3034.924,"Well, there must have been an awful lot of roads built from 1910 on Indian reservations."
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3040.389,3049.792,"Based on the administrative reports that I have seen, in 1935 the federal government, through the BIA, got into the road-building program."
1979.79-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3058.567,3062.283,I see.
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3062.283,3065.738,At any rate --
1979.79-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.738,3074.533,But you say from '35 to '71 you think they were built on competitive bidding?
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3074.533,3076.623,That is our position.
1979.79-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3088.761,3092.979,"But not on services, not on Indian products."
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3092.979,3094.856,Not on Indian products.
1979.79-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3102.802,3105.376,"There is nothing to stop you from putting that in evidence, was there?"
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3105.376,3106.046,No.
1979.79-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3106.046,3110.658,Why didn't you put it into evidence?
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3110.658,3113.07,"Well, Your Honor, we just --"
1979.79-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3113.07,3114.053,You didn't think of it?
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3131.949,3133.95,I respect --
1979.79-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3133.95,3139.963,The point is that there was competitive bidding up until '71.
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3139.963,3140.436,Your Honor --
1979.79-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3140.436,3145.94,"Unless you can prove that, how can we assume it?"
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3145.94,3146.298,Okay.
1979.79-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3200.042,3220.36,"I just would not like to participate in an opinion which says that prior to 1961 the government awarded its contracts on competitive bidding insofar as roads are concerned -- footnote, your thinking."
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3222.541,3231.689,"Well, it is our position that the law was at that time and it still is that they were required to do it by competitive bidding."
1979.79-48,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3329.224,3330.997,"Mr. Hayes, may I ask a question."
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3330.997,3331.394,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-48,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3331.394,3338.857,You described the officers of this Indian company and they didn't sound a lot like Indians to me.
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3347.156,3348.263,"I believe it does, Your Honor."
1979.79-48,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3358.387,3368.42,"Another question, I think your brief or the government's brief described this road as being built in land occupied by Indians."
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3371.357,3373.58,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1979.79-48,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3374.631,3378.284,What determines where one of these roads may be built?
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3378.284,3386.218,There is a statute -- and I am not familiar with the cite -- that sets out the BIA's jurisdiction over certain roads.
1979.79-48,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3386.218,3390.959,Does that relate to the percentage of population composed of Indians?
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3390.959,3393.716,I can't answer that question.
1979.79-48,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3401.523,3403.434,And the United States government pays for the roads?
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3403.434,3406.858,"Yes, Your Honor, the United States government pays for it."
1979.79-48,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3406.858,3411.924,Without regard to whether Indian labor is used or not?
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3411.924,3416.067,"Obviously in this case regardless of whether Indian labor was used or not, because --"
1979.79-48,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3416.067,3422.163,Because the contractor doesn't obligate the contractor to use Indian labor?
1979.79-48,1,21024,d_d_hayes,,3422.163,3424.914,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
1979.79-48,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3430.113,3432.708,My questions may be entirely irrelevant to this case.
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3436.018,3440.36,"Mr. Hayes, I had a similar question about the definition of the Indian enterprise."
1979.79-48,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3449.024,3462.647,"The memorandum that we sued on, this 1976 bulletin says that it has to be 100 percent Indian owned, which I would interpret that to mean that all the stockholders have to be at least one percent Indian."
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3462.647,3472.168,"If that is true, then the third person that you named apparently had no Indian blood, was just merely an executive of the company, he didn't have any effect on the eligibility of the enterprise."
1979.79-48,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3472.168,3474.091,"That is my understanding, he is not a stockholder."
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3484.43,3486.982,"The other two people were stockholders, is that what it is?"
1979.79-48,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3486.982,3491.619,I think there are three stockholders and I think they are all at least one-fourth Indian.
1979.79-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3491.619,3494.781,I see.
1979.79-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3494.781,3495.514,"Thank you, gentlemen."
