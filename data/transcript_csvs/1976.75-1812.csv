1976.75-1812,0,32529,john_r_reese,,45.747,49.071,"Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the Court."
1976.75-1812,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,113.964,121.479,Do each one of the 28 fulfill what you have just stated either an officer or a Director or a key employee?
1976.75-1812,0,32529,john_r_reese,,121.479,122.816,"No, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1976.75-1812,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,128.657,131.415,But all are one or the other?
1976.75-1812,0,32529,john_r_reese,,131.415,135.655,That is right.
1976.75-1812,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,242.187,254.86,"They under the Uniform Commercial Code, am I incorrect in my memory that the situs of the certificate is the situs of the stock."
1976.75-1812,0,32529,john_r_reese,,254.86,267.771,"Well, under the Uniform Commercial Code as applied in every state except Delaware, Mr. Justice Stewart, the certificate itself must be seized in order to affect an attachment."
1976.75-1812,1,36281,michael_f_maschio,,1587.582,1590.733,"Yes, you did."
1976.75-1812,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1679.599,1681.436,Can I ask you this before you proceed?
1976.75-1812,1,36281,michael_f_maschio,,1692.645,1694.169,I am not sure I understand you question.
1976.75-1812,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1695.999,1711.036,"As whose property was it, contrary to the facts in this case in Delaware and under Delaware law, if there is a serious question or if a question is raised or the potential of being raised, as to whose property it really is?"
1976.75-1812,1,36281,michael_f_maschio,,1718.907,1732.006,"I can answer that question by just saying that there are procedures in Delaware, builds in equity exist in Delaware, that can only had take place in the hypothetical situation which is not before this court where there has been at transfer of the stock."
1976.75-1812,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1732.006,1736.73,"Well let us say it is not even stock, let us say it is an automobile."
1976.75-1812,1,36281,michael_f_maschio,,1736.73,1738.689,I know the answer with respect to stock.
1976.75-1812,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1786.404,1800.3,"What if in this case, one of the defendants had in fact validly transferred his shares of stock to his nephew, who is not a defendant and had validly done so before this attachment or sequestration whatever you call."
1976.75-1812,1,36281,michael_f_maschio,,1800.3,1801.688,Before the attachment?
1976.75-1812,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1801.688,1802.593,Yes.
1976.75-1812,1,36281,michael_f_maschio,,1802.593,1804.716,"Well, then at that point there would be no stock."
1976.75-1812,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1804.716,1810.126,"No, but on the books of the transferrations it still showed that the defendant was the owner."
1976.75-1812,1,36281,michael_f_maschio,,1816.852,1819.283,"I think he could, I think he can bring an equitable suit in doubt."
1976.75-1812,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1819.283,1823.604,As one reads the Statute there is no opportunity for a hearing on that sort of an issue.
1976.75-1812,1,36281,michael_f_maschio,,1823.604,1831.714,"No, there is not, but referring to case law in the state of Delaware which does provide for equitable proceedings to basically, resolve the question of ownership."
1976.75-1812,2,32529,john_r_reese,,3478.405,3483.686,Mr. Justice Stewart we know that an order has been entered by the highest court instead of Delaware.
1976.75-1812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3483.686,3485.632,Interlocutory order.
1976.75-1812,2,32529,john_r_reese,,3505.341,3514.625,"Presumably, defaults would be taken and the property of the defendants sold, which -- a point we could start back up."
1976.75-1812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3514.625,3515.415,"Well, it is one presumption."
1976.75-1812,2,32529,john_r_reese,,3534.635,3537.748,If we successfully defended on the merits the lawsuit would be over.
1976.75-1812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3537.748,3549.174,"And therefore why is this a final order, and if it is not as you know we do not have any jurisdiction over it?"
1976.75-1812,2,32529,john_r_reese,,3549.174,3551.718,It is a question that I have not considered previously Mr. Justice Stewart.
1976.75-1812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3551.718,3555.863,"Well, it just occurred to me."
