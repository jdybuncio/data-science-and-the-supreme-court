1974.73-1573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,34.085,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1573, Withrow against Larkin."
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,34.183,39.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court."
1974.73-1573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,104.518,127.308,"Ms. Brown, I certainly -- it's not my purpose to disturb the planned order of your argument but I trust that sometime during the course of your argument you will get to the point that the three judge Court order has now been amended and no longer does declare a statute unconstitutional?"
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,127.308,127.889,That's right.
1974.73-1573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,169.097,170.244,Right.
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,170.244,170.61,So there has been --
1974.73-1573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,170.61,179.251,"So then that -- is that were the only judgment that we have from the beginning, it would be very clear that this Court would be without jurisdiction of this appeal, would it?"
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,179.251,181.244,"No, I don't believe so Your Honor."
1974.73-1573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,181.244,194.678,But just looking at the language of the now existing judgment which appears on page 20 of the suggestion of mootness filed here on September 3.
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,220.673,223.908,We wouldn't be here Your Honor if that was the initial order.
1974.73-1573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,224.044,225.831,"You could be - you could be here, could you?"
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,225.831,239.775,"Right, but we would have been here because of the content of the decision which would be followed by a final injunctive order and it came to same conclusions which we believe are completely erroneous."
1974.73-1573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,260.831,267.36,"So when as or if some final judgments were entered declaring this statute unconstitutional, but the --"
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,267.36,278.002,"Well, I doubt that there would be any and or if primarily because of the content of their decision Your Honor -- they had made up their minds."
1974.73-1573,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,278.002,287.707,Well the -- this maybe of that the injunction may have been amended but the Court had already declared the statute unconstitutional?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,287.707,288.045,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1573,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,288.045,289.492,Did they -- they withdraw that declaration?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,289.492,294.337,"No, the decision is still in effect, it's being cited and it's being followed."
1974.73-1573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,294.337,300.806,"Well, they did amend their judgment of January 31, 1974, didn't they?"
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,302.529,304.328,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,304.328,307.965,"Well, to that extent they did change the original --"
1974.73-1573,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,307.965,329.094,"Let me read you a sentence from 28 USC Section 1253 in order to call my brother Stewart's attention to it and, “Except as otherwise provided by law, any party may appeal to the Supreme Court from an order granting or denying after a notice in hearing and interlocutory or permanent injunction”."
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,350.967,355.099,"Yes, yes it was Your Honor."
1974.73-1573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,392.031,399.883,Suppose if it is that might have -- I think you're suggesting your briefs on the impact on the federal communications commissions for example.
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,399.883,409.592,"I think it would have an impact Your Honor on all administrative agencies, state, federal, local, I think that it has an impact."
1974.73-1573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,459.732,470.487,Would you tell us to what evidence was taken on this subject or did the Court act solely on the pleadings?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,470.487,484.026,"There was absolutely no evidence in any shape or form which, either showed the availability of injunctive relief in this type of case or established grounds for the granting of the motion."
1974.73-1573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,613.989,616.846,Was it from the Gibson v. Berryhill?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,616.846,618.161,Yes.
1974.73-1573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,732.55,738.625,"You say the evidence that the information that the board acquired in its investigatory process, is that it?"
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,738.625,739.141,Right sir.
1974.73-1573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,829.327,843.977,"I don't know whether it's relevant here in this ground at issue but as you know often, would it be a violation of a Wisconsin statute of some kind to have a license under one name and carry on to practice of medicine under another name?"
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,843.977,847.194,"Yes sir, it's a violation of the criminal law and it --"
1974.73-1573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,847.194,849.018,Apart from the medical problem?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,849.018,849.752,Right.
1974.73-1573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,887.542,890.651,It may not be of sure guarantee but it might be a big help.
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,890.651,893.931,"Well, it's a hindrance anyway."
1974.73-1573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,984.384,988.559,Was that the same three-judge court?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,993.596,1003.993,"Yes, that is the three-judge court was not formed at the time that I'm referring to right now, they were formed shortly afterwards."
1974.73-1573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1064.985,1070.823,That was in effect in order to show cause functionality?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1070.823,1114.825,"Well, it really was more than that, it was really bringing, starting up a whole contested proceeding in which the person had a right to be present, to testify, to have counsel, to cross examine witnesses, to a written statement of the issues, to the burden of proof on his opponent, a whole list which I have set forth with statutory reference in one of the footnotes to my brief, but it was a whole complicated procedure in which there was very careful guarding of procedural rights of a licensee."
1974.73-1573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1200.22,1217.956,"In the affidavits that you've described that were before the board in the investigation stage, was there any denial by Dr. Larkin of his -- of these allegation about practicing -- holding out practice under another name?"
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1217.956,1218.824,No.
1974.73-1573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1225.927,1228.709,But did he deny it that --
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1228.709,1244.887,He was invited to attend and he was also invited to come before the board and to inform it of any explanation or any material he wish to present to the board during their investigative hearing and he declined to do so.
1974.73-1573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1418.415,1424.564,Was there any claim made in the oral argument before the three judge court that this was a class action?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1424.564,1432.549,"No, no, no, there is no class action aspect to this at all."
1974.73-1573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1434.465,1444.797,"Of course, if the statute were in fact and law, unconstitutionally it would apply to everyone whether it had a class action or not, I assume?"
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1444.797,1447.994,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1974.73-1573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1493.927,1500.759,You mean to suspend the man from practicing medicine for six months is not irreparable harm?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1500.759,1506.152,"I would submit to you -- well, in the first place, we don't know whether he was going to be suspended at all."
1974.73-1573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1506.152,1507.113,But he could be?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1507.113,1508.951,"He could be, right."
1974.73-1573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1509.587,1512.677,Would that be irreparable harm?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1512.677,1521.33,It could be an irreparable harm and some situations but I would submit to you Justice Marshall that we have some unique facts in this case and that is --
1974.73-1573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1521.33,1524.923,You said there were no facts?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1524.923,1531.928,There are some facts -- there are no facts establishing a base for the issuance of a preliminary injunction.
1974.73-1573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1542.697,1544.115,Was that before the Court?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1544.115,1544.883,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1544.883,1545.937,The three-judge court?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1545.937,1546.87,Sure.
1974.73-1573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1546.87,1548.661,So they did have some facts?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1548.661,1563.803,In the form of the proceedings and notices of the board which were attached to affidavits filed with the pleadings and with some other affidavits.
1974.73-1573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1564.668,1572.278,"But when you made the statement, there was no evidence you meant there was no oral evidence, there were affidavits?"
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1572.278,1584.577,There were affidavits Your Honor but my point is that they did not relate in any way to whether or not a preliminary injunction could issue in this case.
1974.73-1573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1584.577,1591.557,"If the bar association took away your license to practice law for six months, would you consider that to be irreparable harm?"
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1591.557,1593.111,I certainly would --
1974.73-1573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1593.111,1593.364,What's the difference to --
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1593.364,1598.231,-- if the bar association of Wisconsin did and I was practicing in Wisconsin.
1974.73-1573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1606.243,1610.593,These are just the facts of this particular case.
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1610.593,1619.384,"Well, the facts are Your Honor that Dr. Larkin had a license to practice medicine in Michigan."
1974.73-1573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1688.891,1703.89,I suppose his probability of success would depend upon his denial and refuting the information that was before the medical board.
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1718.382,1723.332,The only thing in this of course is another very important point.
1974.73-1573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1764.342,1765.928,The preliminary injunction?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1765.928,1770.484,Yes Your Honor. Rule 52 does provide that whether it's a permanent --
1974.73-1573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1770.484,1773.19,Did you ask for it?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1773.19,1773.53,I'm sorry.
1974.73-1573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1773.53,1776.8,Did you ask for a finding?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1776.8,1781.278,"I don't think it's a matter of asking, it's a matter of mandatory duty on the Courts Your Honor."
1974.73-1573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1781.278,1791.726,"I mean after they didn't do it, did you raise the point with them or did you just come up here and get us -- did you give them a chance to correct that?"
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1791.726,1794.807,I was not trial counsel Your Honor.
1974.73-1573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1794.807,1801.244,Alright.
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1801.244,1809.861,"I'm informed that the state, on behalf of the appellants there was a motion for judgment made and it was not."
1974.73-1573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1832.072,1834.334,Just the TRO?
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1834.334,1834.955,"Well, preliminary injunction."
1974.73-1573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1834.955,1837.508,Preliminary injunction.
1974.73-1573,0,17425,betty_r_brown,,1837.508,1841.316,Declaring the statute unconstitutional and enjoining all the utilization.
1974.73-1573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1851.202,1861.376,"Mr. Friebert, at some point will you touch on the Mayo against the Canning Company and tell us what you think that has to do with this case?"
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,1861.376,1862.945,Mayo against the Canning Company?
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1862.945,1864.631,Yes.
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,1864.631,1867.319,Is that in my brief Your Honor?
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1867.864,1877.241,I don't know if it's in your brief but it's in this case.
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,1895.107,1895.834,Oh yes.
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1895.834,1898.808,-- in rule 528 was bound which we're just talking about.
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,1898.808,1903.641,Yes I'd be happy to comment on immediately Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1925.243,1926.95,When did they do that?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,1926.95,1937.458,"Well, I believe that the three-judge court did make an error in its original statement by not saying that there was irreparable injury."
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1989.244,1991.191,"Which have been, the last one?"
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,1991.191,1994.04,"Yes the last one couple, their opinion --"
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1994.04,1995.174,Where is that opinion?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,1995.174,2000.662,The opinion is in the jurisdictional statement.
1974.73-1573,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2000.662,2002.449,"The December 21, 1973."
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2002.449,2004.762,"Yes, yes, I am --"
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2004.762,2007.896,Do you think that one takes place of finding --
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2007.896,2015.578,I think they make findings that there's nothing extremely different called about the critical facts in this case.
1974.73-1573,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2120.838,2125.419,Mr. Friebert who actually does that investigative work?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2130.475,2156.56,"In this instance, testimony was taken by the board, brought in by counsel who was a trial counsel in this case, who was also counsel to the board and brought in by an employee but the testimony was taken by these board members themselves and they questioned these people and hence the analogy which they said to a grand jury."
1974.73-1573,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2156.56,2164.378,But what if a right of conclusion than those that so called investigative procedures the board had simply suspended the license?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2164.378,2171.626,I think that that would have been unconstitutional -- first of all I think would violate Wisconsin practice because there --
1974.73-1573,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.626,2175.927,If the board just sits in here for testimony and then decide that's unconstitutional?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2175.927,2184.337,"Yes, I think without giving notice that that's what they are going to do and giving me an opportunity to cross examine or respond, I do."
1974.73-1573,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.337,2189.982,"Well, that may be so but would be because of external function?"
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2189.982,2196.088,"Well, it would be in this -- again, in this case because I did not receive notice that that's what they were going to do."
1974.73-1573,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2196.727,2200.934,"And if so it wouldn't be the mixing function probably, it would be a procedural due process."
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2200.934,2206.829,"Correct, which I consider mixing a function is a procedural due process problem."
1974.73-1573,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2206.829,2231.464,"Mr. Friebert, in Arizona where I practiced, I sat on one of the grievance committees and we would have a session of that committee whereby we would hear complaints and hear a complaining witness and simply decide whether there was sufficient basis to go ahead and notify that the lawyer was being complained against and if we decided that there was no sufficient basis we dismiss it."
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2243.417,2246.863,The same group would then be the trial people?
1974.73-1573,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2246.863,2247.579,Precisely.
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2247.579,2252.003,"Yes, I think that that would violate procedural due process."
1974.73-1573,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2275.934,2287.85,"That was true in Arizona too after the administrative committee got there, went to the board of governors with the Supreme Court but here I take it your medical thing goes eventually under Court."
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2287.85,2295.924,The medical thing goes eventually under the way they are moving in this case to two Courts.
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2320.331,2325.963,You suppose that was partly because there was no contest after notice?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2325.963,2326.442,No I don't.
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2326.442,2334.394,"Dr. Larkin undertook to put in no evidence, never denied the charges, if that's correct?"
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2334.394,2337.561,"Well, Dr. Larkin denies the charges and I --"
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2337.561,2339.431,Did he get a notice?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2339.431,2350.346,"I was present and I made a statement as to the reasons why this board -- why these charges as on the record that they have before it, this is not in the record."
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2356.302,2358.822,Did Dr. Larkin ever appeared?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2358.822,2360.179,"No, he did not."
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2360.179,2361.224,Why not?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2361.224,2363.123,I didn't -- it was on my advice.
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2365.752,2368.289,So then he didn't dispute anything?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2368.289,2372.364,"Oh yes, I appeared on his behalf, he appeared through counsel."
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2372.364,2375.122,Were the other witnesses sworn?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2375.122,2376.723,"I'm not sure, I believe so."
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2376.723,2377.868,Were you sworn?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2377.868,2378.395,No.
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2378.395,2380.361,"Well, how could you make that testimony?"
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2380.361,2385.844,Because I made an extensive legal argument --
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2385.844,2386.186,Legal?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2387.093,2394.014,"Oh yes, it's a factual argument and legal argument which appears at footnote 13 of my brief."
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2398.449,2403.919,"Did he ever deny any of these facts, that's what it seems justice was asking."
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2403.919,2406.985,"Did he by testimony, no."
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2406.985,2408.593,Did you deny?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2408.593,2411.303,I denied that they had sufficient facts.
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2411.303,2414.372,Did you deny the facts that they had be improved?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2414.372,2420.53,"Yes, I denied that they have improved that there was personal knowledge of some of the allegations."
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2420.53,2424.214,My question is did you deny that they were true?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2424.214,2439.55,"I denied that some of them yes, I denied that the so-called unlicensed physician was unlicensed and I told them that he was a licensed physician at all times in South Korea according to my understanding."
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2449.848,2455.227,Did you ever questioned fact that he was operating under the assumed name?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2455.227,2456.531,"I denied that, yes."
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2456.736,2458.22,How could you deny it?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2458.22,2463.736,"Just because he signed a list, Dr. Larkin hit the papers in Milwaukee in October of 1971 and everybody knew who he has."
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2463.736,2466.323,I'm not rewarded by hitting the paper.
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2472.022,2475.048,And I challenge that they did not have all the facts?
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2475.367,2477.291,But you didn't question the facts?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2477.291,2487.962,I was not given an opportunity to cross examine witnesses and I had no subpoena powers -- I had no subpoena powers in the hearing.
1974.73-1573,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.802,2491.042,Could you have produced Dr. Larkin?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2491.042,2494.459,Possibly.
1974.73-1573,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2496.478,2498.721,(Inaudible)
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2498.721,2502.865,"I did not want him, yes."
1974.73-1573,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2502.865,2509.303,"Mr. Friebert, what do you consider as before this Court as of today?"
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2509.303,2530.707,I consider the major issue before this Court as to whether an administrative agency can combine each and every function of investigation of accusatorial and decision making all within the same pursuits.
1974.73-1573,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2563.92,2565.022,May I interrupt you a minute.
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2565.022,2565.748,Excuse me.
1974.73-1573,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2565.748,2582.993,"You're not quite answering the question I had in mind or perhaps is not clear that two orders that were entered in this case had been discussed the other day, the one on December 21, 1973, the subsequent one of 74, the July 25, I think."
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2588.912,2589.896,I think they're both here.
1974.73-1573,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2620.155,2629.347,"The problem is if I may say so in the first action of December of 1973, they held this statute unconstitutional."
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2650.514,2661.22,"In fact -- and if the Court views only the first -- judgment is up here, it's automatic, they should not have declared a statute unconstitutional in a preliminary injunction."
1974.73-1573,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2661.22,2662.683,I don't agree with you at all.
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2662.683,2667.124,I think the case law is clear on that.
1974.73-1573,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2679.207,2696.364,"I thought that the law was -- it's sufficient to issue a preliminary injunction that you find a high probability of success but surely, if you wanted -- if the Court wants to go further than that and say, this isn't just a high probability of success -- it's a hundred percent thing in our eyes."
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2705.464,2711.998,"Well, this Court said it in Mayo and I don't wish to dispute."
1974.73-1573,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2729.233,2735.69,What was the ground for your filing on this document on this September 3rd suggestion of mootness?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2735.69,2757.302,"If that was the issue before the Court, whether they should not have issue -- if the Court felt that's a reason and not a probable jurisdiction and ordered it to oral argument was because they made a finding of unconstitutionality, then that issue is moot because they have subsequently corrected that situation."
1974.73-1573,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2793.487,2804.82,Do I understand that you do not think of this amended judgment raises a question as to the predicate of our jurisdictions to review either judgment?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2804.82,2808.273,It's just that -- it seems like such a waste of time to --
1974.73-1573,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2808.273,2812.569,"Waste of time or not, if we don't have jurisdiction, we don't have jurisdiction whatever maybe it was."
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2812.569,2815.927,"Oh, I think we have jurisdiction under either circumstances, an appeal --"
1974.73-1573,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2815.927,2820.546,Even if we're to take the only judgment before us as the amended judgment?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2820.546,2822.075,"Oh yes, I think there --"
1974.73-1573,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2822.075,2822.122,Why?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2822.122,2825.513,-- Because the statute allows appeals from preliminary injunctions.
1974.73-1573,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2825.513,2826.186,What statute?
1974.73-1573,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2826.186,2829.541,Only preliminary injunctions entered on grounds of constitutionality?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2829.541,2832.038,Yes and there is that injunction as that.
1974.73-1573,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2832.924,2837.682,"The amendment wipes out the finding of unconstitutionality, does it?"
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2842.31,2850.241,Mr. Justice Brennan I believe the statute allows an appeal from a preliminary injunction restraining the enforcement of the statute which doesn't show --
1974.73-1573,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2850.241,2852.258,If founded on a --
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2852.258,2853.66,A constitutional defect.
1974.73-1573,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2854.729,2857.148,"Well, that judgment, that's judgmental?"
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2857.148,2877.369,"It certainly does, I don't have the statute before me, I believe it an appeal from a preliminary injunction and to this Court is available from a holding of a preliminary injunction restraining the enforcement of a statute of state wide application which is this situation."
1974.73-1573,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2877.369,2879.203,Required to be heard by a three- judge court?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2879.203,2884.815,"Yes, required to be heard a three- judge court which is at stat situation by definition."
1974.73-1573,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2886.061,2895.188,"There was no other reason for the three-judge District Courts enjoining of the statute in this case than its serious doubt about its constitutionality, was there?"
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2897.826,2900.634,No.
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3036.147,3042.539,"Now, you said this was the denied, by what process or means was this denied?"
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3042.539,3043.635,By the board?
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3043.635,3044.043,No.
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3044.043,3044.461,I'm sorry.
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3044.461,3050.34,"You said that Dr. Larkin, Mr. Larkin whatever he is denied this thing, quoted he denies it."
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3050.34,3065.971,"In my appearance on his behalf before the board, which I told them and made these arguments to them and which I think also demonstrates at least that the -- well, I'd rather not state."
1974.73-1573,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3226.642,3233.695,"In the statute now, in Wisconsin against signing you alleged name on the list?"
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3233.695,3235.008,No.
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3244.637,3256.614,We'll resume after lunch.
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3259.396,3262.103,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-1573,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3300.828,3307.62,Did the board recommend to the District Attorney that he files specific certain kinds of charges against the --
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3307.62,3308.739,Yes Mr. Justice White.
1974.73-1573,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3308.739,3314.233,"-- and in accordance with the statute they may so called prefer charges with the District Attorney, is that it?"
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3314.233,3316.654,Correct Mr. Justice White and they've done that --
1974.73-1573,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3316.654,3331.027,"Well, you don't -- I would suppose that's your easiest case to argue and maybe you've got a hard case and no matter what but if -- but it's easier to argue that you put that, isn't it?"
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3331.027,3333.19,"Well, that they've already done that, yes they had --"
1974.73-1573,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3333.19,3336.932,And then if they wanted to proceed to a contested hearing themselves.
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3336.932,3361.995,"Well, under the statute they have made findings of facts and conclusions of law prior to the issuance of the preliminary injunction which resolved each and every fact situation, factual matter which they propose to and submitted that to the District Attorney and then, they then propose to hold a hearing to suspend on the very same charges."
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3391.818,3399.722,"When you say the District Attorney decided not to prefer charges, is there anything in the record that supports that."
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3399.722,3403.925,"No, but it was stated in all argument to the three- judge court but I assume the transfer --"
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3403.925,3409.112,Perhaps the District Attorney like others is just waiting for the outcome of this case?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3409.112,3410.787,"No, --"
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3410.787,3411.152,And we don't agree with you.
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3411.152,3412.65,-- on the criminal case?
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3412.65,3415.927,"We don't know that, this case we arguing today?"
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3415.927,3428.479,I think the District Attorney stated that he would only pursue revocation proceedings and they haven't proceeded I might add but that was the position that he had taken.
1974.73-1573,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3438.038,3443.364,Does the District Attorney taken any action at all either for revocation or on the criminal charge?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3443.364,3454.699,"No he is just -- he's made that public statement, the one I just indicated which was that he would not pursue criminal charges but would only pursue revocation proceedings."
1974.73-1573,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3454.699,3456.441,And is the situation the same?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3461.079,3471.948,"No, I don't know of any subsequent activity with respect to Dr. Keenan subsequent to the Supreme Courts decisions on the abortion cases."
1974.73-1573,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3522.49,3525.15,But you said doesn't involve economic regulations.
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3528.932,3529.695,Yes.
1974.73-1573,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3547.881,3551.205,But aren't we talked but economic regulation here to?
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3551.205,3572.128,The economics of Dr. Larkin's right to make a living but not in the same sense as the FTC regulates the economy or the charge given to them by Congress and therefore that the due process might allow a certain amount of inter mingling with respect to an agency like that which is not the situation here.
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3572.128,3585.527,"Well, since you mention the Federal trade commission, isn't this some of the alleged conduct found by the board that is he's setting up an office under a false name, something like Miss Brandy?"
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3585.527,3599.036,"No, that lease and all of those situations are -- it seems to say that Dr. Larkin was not a known person and that he was a fly by night doctors so to speak."
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3627.552,3637.521,"Petition was never denied, he is never denied, the boards determination made on sworn testimony that he opened an office in Milwaukee under a false name."
1974.73-1573,1,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3637.521,3666.822,"That I don't think that's their charged, their charges is he signed a list under a different name and that is a man signing a list there is no way that people did not know that that was Dr. Larkin's clinic and we talked about him not being available to answer for civil litigation, everybody knows that it was Dr. Larkin's clinic, there is no showing or statement under that at all."
1974.73-1573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3725.175,3726.307,The case is submitted.
