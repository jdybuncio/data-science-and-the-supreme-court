2015.14-981,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,26.595,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 14-981, Fisher v. The University of Texas at Austin. Before we get started, I'll advise the lawyers that this is our only case this morning, so we intend to grant the parties ten minutes or so of extra time and the amicus five minutes. So Mr. Rein, no need to rush. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,26.595,100.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I appreciate the extra time, and I didn't rush up here to start before you invited me this time. In reviewing the Fifth Circuit's initial decision in what we call Fisher I, seven members of this Court reaffirmed that a clear precondition to the use of race as an admissions factor was the ability to satisfy what was called the ""demanding burden of strict scrutiny"" articulated in Grutter and Bakke. By establishing that she was considered for admission to UT under a system that discriminated against her on the basis of her race, Ms. Fisher placed upon UT the burden of -- of proving, by evidence of record, that its use of race was, first, in pursuit of a compelling, constitutionally legitimate interest expressed with sufficient clarity and concreteness to allow a reviewing court to determine, first, that the use of race was a necessary last resort in pursuing the interest defined, taking into account reasonably available nonracial alternatives."
2015.14-981,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,100.12,129.51,"Mr. Rein, may I ask, if we didn't have the 10 percent plan, if that were out of this case, and all that were left were the Grutter-like plan, would you then recognize that you had no claim? We have the -- what -- what the University of Texas has added on to the 10 percent plan."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,135.595,146.18,"Well, I -- with respect, I -- I would question the premise of the question because it's not the Grutter-like plan in its entirety."
2015.14-981,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,146.18,146.59,I know it's not --
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,146.59,147.57,That would be a totally different --
2015.14-981,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,147.57,149.55,-- but -- but I'm asking the hypothetical.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,149.55,149.94,No.
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,186.89,190.925,Assume need was proven. I know.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,198.685,209.745,"Well, let's put it this way: We do not oppose the use of the various PAI factors that were in place before race was added."
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,212.435,212.99,"No, no, no, no."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,212.99,213.12,And --
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,213.12,215.62,I know you're saying they don't need to do it.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,219.94,220.55,"And I -- yes, and --"
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,220.55,226.025,"If they had to use race, how are they using it improperly?"
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,226.025,244.945,"If you have to use race and you want to use the model that was created in Bakke and Grutter, you would need to build profiles of individuals that would allow you to judge them one against another in the context of the class and the educational experience you are trying to create."
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,244.945,250.12,"My God, that sounds like it's using race more rather than less than this plan does."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,250.12,252.29,I -- I'm sorry if it sounds that way.
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,279.89,280.29,How does that --
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,280.29,282.04,Those are whole-person comparisons.
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,320.99,325.935,You still haven't answered why this is worse than Bakke.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,327.35,331.45,Because it -- it's not used to build a class.
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,337.28,337.88,How is race given --
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,337.88,338.945,It's race as such.
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,338.945,350.85,"How is race given a plus? I -- I thought that what they're looking for is leaders in diversity, not just of race, but of experiences generally."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,350.85,351.87,Those factors --
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,351.87,352.749,So how --
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,352.749,353.62,I'm sorry.
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,393.5,406.63,"I think your brief admitted that this isn't in favor of any particular race, that white people in some situations can show leadership, as -- as well as black or Hispanic or Asian or Native American."
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,411.93,413.3,-- worse than Bakke?
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,413.3,423.055,"With respect, we did not concede that, and we would not concede it because the other PAI factors might benefit anybody of any race."
2015.14-981,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,434.41,443.93,"But in Grutter -- in both Grutter and what Justice Powell said would be proper in Bakke, race was a factor."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,489.16,493.595,"Justice Ginsburg, let -- let me respond to this, with respect, this -- this way."
2015.14-981,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,501.3,503.91,But it could work only in the background.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,503.91,506.66,"When you say ""work,"" it works on a number of fronts."
2015.14-981,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,530.62,532.995,It is created because of race.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,532.995,536.32,I -- I'm not in a position to tell you why it was created.
2015.14-981,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,537.31,544.82,Is there any doubt that it was created to increase the number of minority students? Was there any other reason for the 10 percent plan?
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,544.82,556.675,"Well, I've given you other reasons, which are it's a -- it's kind of a democratic recognition that you want to invite people from all over Texas, regardless of the school they went to."
2015.14-981,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,561.57,565.365,It was recreated in the wake of Hopwood.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,565.365,567.445,"That -- that timing, yes."
2015.14-981,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,567.445,576.675,"So I think that was the purpose, to find a neutral framework within which to satisfy the State's and the university's objectives."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,576.675,583.86,"And certainly one in the legislature might have looked at the predictable effect, but that purpose and effect are different."
2015.14-981,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,602.12,622.16,"You argue that the University of Texas' goals and -- or announced goals are insufficiently concrete. Can you give an example of what, in your view, would be a sufficiently concrete criterion or set of criteria to achieve diversity?"
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,622.16,629.68,"Well, and -- and certainly, the Solicitor General's attempted to do so by breaking down the abstract goals into concrete objectives."
2015.14-981,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,665.12,667.255,"Well, but I don't understand. How do you do that?"
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,667.255,670.985,"It's not easy to do, and it's not our job to do it."
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.285,697.64,"Are there any critical mass studies that you can refer to? I mean, are there --"
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,697.64,698.22,None that I know about.
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,698.22,704.19,-- scientific studies where you know at what point you suddenly have enough of a mass?
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,704.19,704.95,No.
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,705.51,707.25,So what did the university base it on?
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,707.25,709.93,The university based it on two things.
2015.14-981,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,728.85,729.905,Seven year -- sorry.
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,729.905,732.0,Excuse me. To their satisfaction.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,740.76,748.945,"They premised it on good faith, and that was accepted in the Fifth Circuit on the first iteration of this case, and this Court said good faith does not suffice."
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,749.18,749.91,I'm sorry.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,798.465,799.73,"Well, I think --"
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,799.73,804.08,"What's wrong -- since you have to infer these things, you can't use a quota."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,804.08,805.07,Let me --
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,805.07,808.31,You're saying we can't -- they can't use demographics.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,837.94,855.38,"Let me start with your first concern, which is this classroom study. First thing I would observe about that if I were in their position, and I'm not, is that the second study was done at a time when there were more minorities admitted than the first study, and they claimed it went backwards."
2015.14-981,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,862.45,862.61,Yeah.
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,960.575,962.16,Does anybody but the faculty --
2015.14-981,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,962.16,963.53,That's what their program is.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,977.495,991.71,"So, Justice Breyer, let me answer that. First of all, one thing your question establishes quite clearly is if one assumes premises from evidence that doesn't exist, you can draw conclusions that are perhaps invalid. So let me go back to -- to where you started."
2015.14-981,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1000.94,1001.23,Well --
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1001.23,1006.06,"And it's not truly holistic because in the holistic systems, you look at the person as a whole."
2015.14-981,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1014.1,1024.155,"Every school is like that. Every school in the country that's a college that I've ever experienced is a combination of grades, class position, and a lot of other things."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1024.155,1024.37,But --
2015.14-981,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1024.37,1031.145,"So I'm talking about people who aren't admitted; 75 percent are, solely on the basis of class ranking."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1031.145,1031.34,Yeah.
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1035.055,1041.12,"I was going to ask that. Does anybody, except the faculty, know who this elite 25 percent is?"
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1041.12,1041.44,No.
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1041.44,1045.0,And all of the 10 percent people identified themselves?
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1045.0,1045.36,No.
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1045.65,1047.77,"They go around in bunches, hey, I'm one of the 10 percent?"
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1047.77,1048.54,"They don't, and --"
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1048.54,1050.155,"They don't know who the 10 percent are, do they?"
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1050.155,1060.57,"-- and the level of admission to the faculty at the university subgroup in which they study, whether it's business or communications, there it's all done by AI/PAI."
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1061.05,1061.55,Could I --
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1061.55,1062.56,They're all done equally.
2015.14-981,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1062.56,1070.88,Could I come back to the issue of classroom diversity? Because that does seem to me to be something that could be measured.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1118.99,1122.11,"The best of the record, because they didn't study that specifically."
2015.14-981,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1140.29,1157.79,I don't want -- I don't want to pre-demit this line of questioning because I think it's important and we're well into the substantive issues. May I begin with almost a procedural point: Did you object to the University's request that this case be remanded to the district court?
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1157.79,1159.72,We did in -- in the Fifth Circuit.
2015.14-981,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1159.72,1186.07,"In the Fifth Circuit. It does seem to me, as Justice Alito's question, and frankly some of the other questions have indicated, that the litigants, and frankly this Court, have been denied the advantage and the perspective that would be gained if there would be additional fact-finding under the instructions that Fisher sought to give."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1189.4,1189.91,Well --
2015.14-981,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1189.91,1191.82,It's as if nothing had happened.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1191.82,1193.52,And -- and the reason for that --
2015.14-981,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1193.52,1202.985,And I -- it seems to me that Justice Alito's question indicates that this is the kind of thing that we should know but we don't know.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1202.985,1208.365,"Well, let -- let me point out that the -- the purpose of strict scrutiny is not just to adjudicate."
2015.14-981,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1224.13,1228.65,But they weren't given the chance to add additional evidence in order to meet that standard.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1228.65,1231.175,"Well, they can't go back and recreate the past."
2015.14-981,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1234.67,1239.88,But they could answer some of the questions as -- like the ones Justice Alito added.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1243.23,1250.445,"They could -- I mean, but they'd have to go back and study the conditions at the time they made the decision."
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1258.24,1258.99,Not only that.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1263.625,1264.04,Yes.
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1264.6,1266.63,"So we're going to say, oh, they failed to put it in."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1268.565,1269.39,"Well, procedurally --"
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1269.39,1270.71,Let's do a do-over.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1270.71,1271.0,They --
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1271.0,1276.74,Send it back down so they can now put in what they should have put in in order to prevail the first time around.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1276.74,1279.74,And that I -- I entirely agree with that.
2015.14-981,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1301.58,1307.265,"Well, the issue in this case is not whether the University can have holistic review."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1307.265,1307.87,Correct.
2015.14-981,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1307.87,1342.16,"The issue is whether they can have as a component of holistic review after they have taken into account other characteristics that are not dependent on race; they can add race as an additional characteristic. And so if it were -- is there -- would there be any way of determining, if there were a remand, which of the non-top 10 admittees were admitted solely because of race? In other words, these students would not have been admitted taking into account leadership and family, education and socioeconomic background and hardship and everything else."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1342.16,1345.115,"According to the University of Texas, the answer to that is no."
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1395.78,1396.28,May I ask --
2015.14-981,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1396.28,1406.625,"Could you associate a number with ""the very small""? I guess it would be the number of students who were admitted with the consideration of race who were not also --"
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1406.625,1407.21,Correct.
2015.14-981,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1407.21,1407.35,Yeah.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1407.35,1412.54,That would be the measurement. And -- and there's no perfect answer to that when the University says they can't identify them.
2015.14-981,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1431.24,1437.665,Two and a half percent difference in entering class numbers or number of minorities admitted?
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1437.665,1439.17,Number of minorities.
2015.14-981,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1450.12,1452.19,The number is important to me.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1453.81,1454.75,It's under 3 --
2015.14-981,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1454.75,1456.685,"I can ask your friend on the other side, but --"
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1456.685,1458.33,It's under 3 percent.
2015.14-981,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1458.33,1459.74,Of what? Of numbers --
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1459.74,1463.125,Of total admits or the -- and the total enrollees both.
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.8,1468.39,Of the minority students. Of blacks.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1468.39,1469.89,Of the class itself.
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1482.11,1482.52,I'm sorry.
2015.14-981,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1482.84,1499.01,"But in Parents -- in Parents Involved, you indicated that at some point the actual benefit of the program turns out to be not really worth the very difficult decision to allow race to be considered if at the end of the day it generates a certain number."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1500.7,1508.07,"And -- and I am saying that, as we said in our briefs, and we tried to -- there's no perfect measurement because you don't have them running simultaneously."
2015.14-981,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1508.07,1508.22,Right.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1508.43,1522.73,"But if you tried to do it by looking at the results when using the PAI, but not race, versus the results both at the admission and enrollment stage of using the PAI affected by race, it's a -- it's under 3 percent."
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1523.59,1523.89,I'm sorry.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1579.6,1580.495,"Well, you know --"
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1580.495,1581.48,When your number --
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1581.48,1583.29,-- when you -- when you use numbers about --
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1583.29,1583.89,-- that's not small.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1583.89,1590.945,"-- admission on holistic review, that incorporates the ones who would have made it without race, so it's not a valid comparative number."
2015.14-981,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1590.945,1593.7,The ones who would -- the ones who would have made it --
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1593.7,1600.79,"-- without race are incorporated in, quote, ""holistic review."" So those numbers really don't tell you anything about the effect of race."
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1601.01,1601.59,"Well, wait a minute."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1615.61,1616.84,It -- it has some effect.
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1622.625,1629.05,Could I ask you a different question now? I fear something.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1677.47,1687.005,"We're not, certainly, trying to dictate that every school use a 10 percent plan, nor is it the only way in which you can encourage and increase minority enrollment."
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1696.97,1698.83,So your answer is yes. If there's no other --
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1698.83,1698.93,No.
2015.14-981,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1698.96,1723.87,"-- way of doing it, then the only other race-neutral way -- if offering scholarships, which this university did, increasing outreach to minority neighborhoods, they did and continue to do -- there's a list of about six or eight other things they did that didn't increase the admission of minorities."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1723.87,1726.56,There are many other things they could do.
2015.14-981,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1770.89,1773.54,"No, but that's exactly the question, I think."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1828.6,1832.45,"Well, I mean, you have the example of Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke."
2015.14-981,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1882.37,1882.59,All right.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1884.37,1892.61,"Justice Breyer, you can achieve this small increment of under 3 percent, in our view, by a number of alternatives that would -- would -- would give this same boost."
2015.14-981,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1895.14,1895.905,I have one.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1896.32,1896.61,But not --
2015.14-981,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1896.61,1902.275,"What you're saying is you should look at the two folders, and as a kind of tiebreaker, use race."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1910.525,1914.31,You could -- you could give more emphasis to the socioeconomic factors in the school.
2015.14-981,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1914.31,1918.67,"That's not to use race. I'm saying r-a-c-e, race."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1938.54,1945.41,"And what I've said first is they could shape their system more toward the Bakke system, and move toward individualized consideration."
2015.14-981,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1963.29,1965.88,"But the top 10, you said it doesn't use race."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1988.15,1993.63,"Well, I mean, the first question is, you know, why are you using it? The why. Therefore, it can be a factor."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,2007.545,2011.245,Because race is not the baseline. It's an odious classification.
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.22,2026.39,"As I understand what you're saying, the Bakke approach -- comparing two individuals and -- and -- and, where they're tied, giving a -- a benefit to one for race -- that's okay."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,2030.245,2030.705,No --
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2030.705,2035.29,-- of achieving the -- the racial balance that you're looking for.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,2035.69,2043.17,"Well, Justice Powell indicated in Bakke that that approach could be used where it's part of a greater function form in the class."
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2043.17,2043.66,Understand.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,2044.09,2045.32,And that -- and the Court has --
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2045.32,2045.71,But you -- you don't --
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,2045.71,2046.26,-- apparently accepted.
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2047.43,2053.83,You don't have to apply the question whether it could possibly be done in any other way.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,2068.05,2068.84,That is correct.
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2068.84,2068.93,Right?
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,2068.93,2071.21,"And it's not just me, Justice Scalia."
2015.14-981,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2073.92,2074.955,That's what I thought.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,2074.955,2079.21,"They had -- it has to be shown to be necessary. And of course, that's true of all strict scrutiny."
2015.14-981,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2092.67,2099.355,Is there any evidence that the holistic review being used by UT operates as a quota?
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,2099.355,2121.34,"I -- you know, I'm -- we have not claimed that, but since so much of it is masked and hidden -- but -- but if -- certainly if you're motivated, as they said, by demographics, they want to get the number up, it's certainly number-driven. And if you look at -- one thing this Court said in Grutter, you have to have a basis to review this, because you would like to make it end."
2015.14-981,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2154.38,2169.24,"Mr. Rein, because your time is running out, there is one preliminary question I'd like you to address, and that is: What is the relief you're seeking? I take it not injunctive, because Ms. Fisher has graduated."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,2169.24,2169.755,Correct.
2015.14-981,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2169.755,2177.274,And you have no class. So what -- what specific relief are you seeking in this case?
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,2177.274,2179.995,This case started with a plea for damages.
2015.14-981,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2183.47,2185.31,But what do the damages consist of?
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,2185.31,2192.62,They were -- the damages consisted of a -- a refund of the unjustly-committed fee for application.
2015.14-981,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2213.64,2236.46,"If the -- if the university should say, okay, the application fee and whatever else we add to that, we -- we offer that so that this contest will be over; if they offered you the damages that you are seeking, would the case become moot?"
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,2236.46,2237.225,No.
2015.14-981,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2247.46,2247.67,What are --
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,2247.67,2248.29,They answered --
2015.14-981,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2248.29,2250.42,-- what are the broad -- what are the broader? You gave me the application fee.
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,2250.42,2261.375,"Well, now, Ms. Fisher has not been admitted, and that she has suffered the consequences of nonadmission, which include she went to an alternative university; she had to travel as opposed to being in her home State."
2015.14-981,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2315.19,2318.22,"I suppose -- I suppose if they tender it, you don't have to accept it either, right?"
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,2318.22,2319.455,Correct.
2015.14-981,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2319.455,2321.05,"Thank you, Counsel."
2015.14-981,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,2321.05,2323.809,I'll reserve the rest of my time.
2015.14-981,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2323.809,2326.235,Mr. Garre.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2326.235,2332.605,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To pick up on the questions this morning, I'd like to focus on three things."
2015.14-981,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2396.07,2396.74,Excuse me.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2400.9,2406.06,"That's right, which is an important component of the class, Your Honor. Second, and I think this goes to your point, Justice --"
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2406.06,2415.965,"Well, on that point, can you determine which of the holistic admittees would not have been admitted if race was not added to the -- to the determination?"
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2415.965,2416.4,Okay.
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2446.54,2447.53,That's not really my question.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2461.18,2465.77,"Your Honor, I think, given the contextualized and individualized nature of that inquiry, that's going to be difficult."
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2493.47,2507.69,What -- one of the things I find troubling about your argument is the suggestion that there is something deficient about the African-American students and the Hispanic students who are admitted under the Top 10 Percent Plan.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2514.605,2514.97,Okay.
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2514.97,2519.21,It's -- really it's based on a terrible stereotyping that --
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2519.21,2520.6,"Your Honor, it's --"
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2520.6,2521.81,What is the basis for that --
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2521.81,2523.84,It's exactly the opposite.
2015.14-981,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2555.55,2559.865,But -- maybe I misapprehended either the question or the answer.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2570.4,2570.57,No.
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2584.945,2585.13,Yeah.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2605.395,2607.36,"It's -- it's not a stereotype at all, Your Honor."
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2648.81,2657.63,"I don't doubt that that is one of the things that it does, and I would have thought that that would be something that you would regard as beneficial."
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2657.63,2657.75,We --
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2657.75,2672.18,"Wasn't that the -- the reason for adopting affirmative action in the first place because there are people who have been severely disadvantaged through discrimination and -- and lack of wealth, and they should be given a benefit in admission --"
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2672.18,2673.09,And the University --
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2673.09,2676.55,"-- but that's one -- one of the things that it does, but it's not the only thing that it does."
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2676.55,2679.83,"Your Honor, the University of Texas applauds those students."
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2695.12,2704.31,"This is a statistic that jumped out at me, which it seems to me contrary to the stereotype on which the Fifth Circuit panel proceeds and on which you proceed."
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2748.43,2750.4,"Your Honor, we've never claimed that all of them do."
2015.14-981,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2776.43,2780.83,We know that -- can you -- can you say this? Let me read you two phrases from Fisher I.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2848.675,2853.72,"Your Honor, it's set forth in the 2004 proposal which is in the Supplemental Joint Appendix."
2015.14-981,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2916.645,2916.9,And --
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2916.9,2917.81,"-- on that, if you would like."
2015.14-981,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2917.81,2920.05,And you're talking about the 2004 plan?
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2920.05,2920.77,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-981,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2920.77,2921.42,Excuse me.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2926.825,2928.275,It absolutely has.
2015.14-981,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2936.58,2939.86,How did you measure -- how did you measure whether or not the plan was working --
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2939.86,2940.4,Your Honor --
2015.14-981,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2940.4,2942.4,-- under the review that you undertook?
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2942.4,2944.08,We would look to a number of different --
2015.14-981,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2944.08,2944.16,No.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2945.7,2947.61,And -- and I'll answer that question.
2015.14-981,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2971.11,2971.58,Excuse me.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2976.42,2977.34,It's -- well --
2015.14-981,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2977.34,2982.365,"To say that, you know, if the faculty thinks we're doing great, we must be doing great."
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2988.8,2990.05,"And look at the facts, Your Honor."
2015.14-981,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3009.73,3020.07,"Well, you're talking about the time -- Grutter said that we did not expect these sorts of programs to be around in 25 years, and that was 12 -- 12 years ago."
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3025.4,3038.345,"Your Honor, I'm not here to give you a date, but what I would say is this: There are systematic problems that these problems -- that these policies are attempting to address, including the test score gap between -- between African-Americans and Hispanics."
2015.14-981,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3047.58,3048.18,I understand.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3064.93,3066.12,And we -- we appreciate the --
2015.14-981,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3066.12,3071.535,"-- course. And so it was important in Grutter to say, look, this can't go on forever, 25 years."
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3074.59,3091.695,"Your Honor, as soon as we -- we can achieve the same -- sufficient numbers for the educational benefits of diversity without taking race into account, we will no longer take race into account. The strict-scrutiny inquiry focuses on whether or not there are race-neutral alternatives, which I think really is the way to police this."
2015.14-981,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3107.975,3114.26,"Well, how -- what percentage of the class is -- what legacy is that a consideration for?"
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3114.26,3129.3,"University of Texas does not do legacy, Your Honor. But if you look at what happened -- and this is the second reason why it's necessary -- it's -- it's -- I don't think it's debatable that student body diversity suffered at the University of Texas under the policies that they're asking this Court to impose."
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3139.76,3171.9,"Well, on that subject, I don't know of any -- you haven't mentioned in your briefs anything that the University of Texas has done to increase racial diversity at the classroom level, other than this admissions program. And I mentioned during your -- your friend's argument a way in which you could determine whether the top 10 admittees are any more or less likely to enroll in classes -- small classes where there is a lack of racial diversity than the holistic admittees."
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3176.87,3189.205,"Let me answer that in two ways. One, doubling the enrollment of African-American students, which happened from 2002 to 2008, is going to increase diversity in the classroom."
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3219.72,3230.2,But I don't -- you could have determined whether this is -- whether the admission -- the addition of race to the holistic equation has done anything to increase classroom diversity.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3230.2,3230.5,It has.
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3230.5,3231.595,And you haven't done that.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3231.595,3235.565,"Your Honor, we've looked at in the five-year analysis --"
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3235.565,3235.76,No.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3250.43,3252.36,"There's a different breakdown there, Your Honor."
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3287.35,3290.85,"Well, I -- but that's where I'm looking for evidence that that's true."
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3290.85,3291.26,And I would --
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3291.26,3309.0,"What is it -- what is it -- have you looked at the top 10 percent admittees, for example, to see how many of them are leaders, which is certainly -- and certainly a legitimate factor to look for, students who are leaders. At -- do you say, well, there are -- there are just not very many leaders here; these are students who all they do is study."
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3311.765,3328.91,"I don't think it's -- it's seriously debatable, but if we need evidence on this, let us put it into the record that a class selected by the holistic consideration of numerous factors is going to be more diverse in a way that promotes the University's educational interests than a class selected by a single factor. And let me give you the deposition --"
2015.14-981,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3328.91,3329.45,I'm sorry.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3337.625,3339.535,And there's two problems with that.
2015.14-981,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3348.09,3348.3,Wait.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3356.12,3356.75,No.
2015.14-981,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3380.1,3385.765,What -- what unique -- what unique perspective does a minority student bring to a physics class?
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3385.765,3387.08,Your Honor --
2015.14-981,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3387.08,3391.99,You're counting those among the classes in which there are no minority students.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3395.535,3413.01,"Your Honor, we can talk about different classes, but -- but this Court has -- has accepted in Bakke and Grutter, and I think it accepted again in Fisher I, that student body diversity is a compelling interest. Our friends do not ask this Court to rule -- overrule any aspect of Grutter or of Fisher or of Bakke --"
2015.14-981,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3413.01,3415.66,I'm not sure we said it's class by class.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3415.66,3416.28,And we're not asking --
2015.14-981,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3416.28,3418.79,I'm not sure we said it's the case class by class.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3418.79,3421.97,"Your Honor, that's a caricature of the University's interests here."
2015.14-981,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3424.68,3427.9,It's a caricature of the argument you're making.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3427.9,3434.09,"Student body -- classroom diversity, Your Honor, if that's what you're focused on, was one aspect that the University looked to."
2015.14-981,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3456.5,3457.41,One of the --
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3457.41,3458.55,"Justice Kennedy, I didn't want to --"
2015.14-981,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3458.55,3476.4,"I -- I was going to ask: What evidence would you have put in if you had been successful in your motion to remand? And preliminary to that, I assume that district court would have had authority to remand to -- to allow the summary judgment record to be expanded or reopened?"
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3476.4,3478.87,"Well, the court of appeals would have had authority in our view."
2015.14-981,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3484.06,3484.36,I understand --
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3484.36,3485.11,-- the triable issues at fact --
2015.14-981,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3485.11,3485.55,I understand.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3493.45,3493.85,Sure.
2015.14-981,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3513.11,3514.96,But you -- but you asked for the remand --
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3514.96,3515.07,Yes.
2015.14-981,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3515.07,3521.485,-- and my question was: What evidence did you propose to put in if your motion had been granted?
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3521.485,3529.85,"Your Honor, we didn't -- we -- we -- we specifically pointed to evidence on standing, and we talked about that, if the Court would like to supplement the evidence in other respects."
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3559.425,3560.1,I don't know what that --
2015.14-981,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3560.1,3560.31,Let me --
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3560.31,3561.78,I don't know what that proves.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3588.505,3610.47,"I -- I think certainly you can conclude, Your Honor, that, where you have all out-of-state students, all students from the best schools in Texas that don't rank, students who fall just below that 10 percent but nevertheless are great students, if we're not getting adequate diversity out of the -- that class, special class of students, we're not meeting our educational objectives. If you have -- if you have doubts about whether or not the record --"
2015.14-981,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3610.47,3625.26,"Mr. Garre, this is the fundamental problem that I think Justice Alito is pointing to, and you're sort of talking past each other. So maybe I'll explain his view. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-981,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3625.26,3626.42,"Strange, isn't that?"
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3626.42,3628.25,I -- I could use -- I can use the help. (Laughter.)
2015.14-981,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3628.25,3661.37,"I think I'll explain what his view is. He seems to think that you didn't study the 10 percent admittees enough before -- to make -- to see whether that group was diverse in and of itself, whether you had enough people within that group that were change agents, that were -- had -- were not just poor people, but people with college-educated parents, whatever other diverse view factors."
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3668.68,3669.24,Right.
2015.14-981,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3669.24,3677.925,"And with deficits that plan created, that you should have filled in the holistic-looking."
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3680.965,3681.48,Right.
2015.14-981,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3681.48,3683.07,All right? Because of that.
2015.14-981,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3687.18,3688.62,"Well -- well, that's my question."
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3689.06,3691.27,"Well, let me -- let me answer that question."
2015.14-981,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3691.27,3691.51,I know.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3692.7,3695.215,"First, we did look at that."
2015.14-981,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3705.1,3707.35,That was with the ten -- so seven years --
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3707.35,3708.56,Race-blind --
2015.14-981,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3708.56,3709.34,Race-blind --
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3709.34,3710.55,"-- race-blind holistic, and up to 10 --"
2015.14-981,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3710.55,3712.84,-- and a certain number of them were with the 10 percent --
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3712.84,3713.46,Absolutely.
2015.14-981,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3749.34,3750.44,And if you did not have --
2015.14-981,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3750.44,3750.95,That's right.
2015.14-981,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3751.88,3765.175,"If -- if you did not have the Top 10 Percent Plan, but you did have the program that you're advocating for here, the holistic review, would you have a better or worse chance of achieving the diversity you seek?"
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3765.175,3769.32,"Your Honor, I -- I think the first thing I would like to say is that it's a different way."
2015.14-981,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3883.36,3895.17,"Well, all of the colloquy so far indicates to me that, if you had a remand, you would not have put in much different or much more evidence than we have in the record right now."
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3895.4,3895.555,Well --
2015.14-981,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3895.555,3896.665,-- is that correct?
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3896.665,3897.97,"No, it's not, Your Honor."
2015.14-981,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3936.5,3941.97,"But why can't we make those inferences from the record? I mean, if -- if you had a trial, you'd have credibility."
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3943.28,3946.89,"Well, I -- I -- I think you can make those going in the University's favor."
2015.14-981,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3953.825,3957.79,"What you're saying, we -- we have a -- a remand only if we lose."
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3959.14,3961.94,"Well, I mean, I don't want to be result-oriented about this, Your Honor."
2015.14-981,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4034.03,4054.925,"There are -- there are those who contend that it does not benefit African-Americans to -- to get them into the University of Texas where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less-advanced school, a less -- a slower-track school where they do well."
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4066.69,4067.39,So this Court --
2015.14-981,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4067.39,4076.12,They come from lesser schools where they do not feel that they're -- that they're being pushed ahead in -- in classes that are too -- too fast for them.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4076.12,4077.34,This Court --
2015.14-981,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4077.34,4081.79,I'm just not impressed by the fact that -- that the University of Texas may have fewer.
2015.14-981,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4103.64,4111.0,"This Court heard and rejected that argument, with respect, Justice Scalia, in the Grutter case, a case that our opponents haven't asked this Court to overrule."
2015.14-981,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4139.635,4160.975,"Thank you, Counsel. General Verrilli."
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4160.975,4180.165,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to make a point about the compelling-interest inquiry in light of what this Court said previously in Fisher, and then I'd like to make a point about the process aspect of the narrow-tailoring inquiry in light of what this Court said in Fisher, which I believe, Justice Kennedy, will address your concerns about whether race is determinative here."
2015.14-981,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4219.25,4222.12,In addition to the -- this is in addition to the 10 percent?
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4222.12,4222.48,Correct.
2015.14-981,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4237.71,4242.8,"But the problem, I guess, which is one issue that we haven't looked at is how do you tell how many of those --"
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4242.8,4242.96,Right.
2015.14-981,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4242.96,4245.325,-- would have been admitted if their race were not --
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4245.325,4255.16,"You're right -- you're right that you can't tell for sure, but you do have a pretty good benchmark, I think, given that you have a number of years without considering race where 141 was the high-water mark."
2015.14-981,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4255.96,4256.52,"Well, wait a minute."
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4261.33,4261.66,Right.
2015.14-981,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4261.66,4268.38,"So you could have said there -- there is a fluctuation before then, when race wasn't considered."
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4269.3,4272.74,"Well, it went -- before they started considering race, it went up and down, frankly."
2015.14-981,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4276.85,4307.295,"Well, there's an aspect of the holistic review process done at the University of Texas which may militate against the admission of African-American and Hispanic students for a -- an ostensibly race-neutral reason, and that is, that as I understand it, standardized test scores count pretty heavily in that process. One of the things the University says it's looking for is students with high SAT scores who are not in the top 10 percent of their class."
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4334.055,4351.07,"It's -- or I guess what I'd say about that, Your Honor, is that in Grutter, what the Court specifically held was that the University is allowed to make those kinds of judgments in seeking to advance multiple objectives to maintain an academic environment of excellence, and to diversify the student body, both."
2015.14-981,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4351.07,4359.96,I thought the -- I thought the record showed the Top Ten admittees have a higher grade point average than the holistic African-American and Hispanic admittees.
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4359.96,4362.01,"Well, the -- the SAT scores are about the same."
2015.14-981,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4362.5,4363.76,"But, I mean, once they get to --"
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4363.76,4364.19,But I guess --
2015.14-981,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4364.19,4367.5,Once they get to -- the SAT is supposed to predict how you are going to do in college.
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4379.47,4449.96,"So I -- I'm not sure what the answer to that is, Your Honor, but this all goes to the compelling-interest inquiry, and let me focus on that. What the -- what the Court said last time around is to satisfy the compelling-interest inquiry, the University has got to articulate a reasoned, principled explanation for its decision to consider the educational benefits of diversity in a matter that this Court has found to be constitutional and substantial. The University of Texas has met that standard, has articulated exactly the same educational benefits of diversity at exactly the same level of specificity that this Court held constituted a compelling interest in the Grutter case at page 330. It's exactly the same. And the -- the principal argument that my friend Mr. Rein makes in challenging that is, well, actually a lot of that is post hoc rationalization, in particular, the effort to find whether you call it qualitative diversity, diversity within diversity is all post hoc rationalization, that is simply not so. If you look at page 1 of the Supplemental Joint Appendix, the first page of the 2004 Proposal, the University specifically says that what it's trying to accomplish is to create a diversity of perspectives among minority students."
2015.14-981,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4460.82,4465.49,"Mr. Verrilli, do you -- you think all of this won't be necessary in another 13 years --"
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4465.49,4465.7,Well --
2015.14-981,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4465.7,4469.01,-- where we stop disadvantaging some applicants because of their race.
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4469.01,4475.4,"What I think about that is that the -- the Court, I think, made a prediction in -- in Grutter that that would hopefully be the case."
2015.14-981,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4475.4,4477.52,I think that's a -- that's too short term.
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4478.24,4478.59,I think --
2015.14-981,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4478.59,4478.81,-- 30 years?
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4478.81,4480.17,I think the University's always --
2015.14-981,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4480.17,4487.57,"What is it about this program that is going to change things, so that -- so that we can stop classifying people by race?"
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4487.57,4487.73,No.
2015.14-981,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4517.145,4524.22,"Just before, you -- you said -- I agreed with you, of course, that is what the Court said, the reasoned explanation."
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4602.45,4602.64,Yeah --
2015.14-981,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4602.64,4605.175,Is that affidavit the relevant one? Are there others?
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4605.175,4605.36,Yeah.
2015.14-981,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4731.89,4736.18,"If none of that is true, how does the University know when it has achieved its objective?"
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4736.18,4736.705,So --
2015.14-981,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4736.705,4739.9,"At what point does it say, okay, the plan has worked?"
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4739.9,4746.99,"So I think -- I was trying to address process, and I -- and I'll go right now to need, which I think is -- is -- I really do think that you're right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2015.14-981,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4777.89,4778.13,Okay.
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4778.6,4778.99,And so --
2015.14-981,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4778.99,4779.995,-- how should they do it?
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4779.995,4783.85,"So the -- the -- and the reason, of course, that that's no good is that that's just a Catch-22."
2015.14-981,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4783.85,4783.97,"No, no."
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4785.93,4797.14,"So -- so here's how you should do it, and we've -- we've laid it out in our brief: We think that the approach -- we think that approach is always going to be fatal in fact because, if they don't -- they -- they fail strict scrutiny if they --"
2015.14-981,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4797.14,4799.05,I know you don't agree with their approach. (Laughter.)
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4799.05,4800.73,I -- I promise you I'm going to answer it.
2015.14-981,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4842.95,4843.76,I'm trying to get at the --
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4843.76,4843.85,Yes.
2015.14-981,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4844.8,4848.8,"-- at a -- at a more concrete -- and so to look at what they say they want and see if they've done it, but how do you see it?"
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4848.8,4851.635,And -- and you -- and so the kind -- you would look for concrete evidence.
2015.14-981,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4884.26,4891.715,And they -- they can do that with evidence that -- and -- and of events that occurred after the suit was brought?
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4891.715,4893.3,"Well, I -- I think what --"
2015.14-981,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4893.3,4894.84,I -- I'm not quite sure how that works.
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4894.84,4895.03,Sure.
2015.14-981,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4922.295,4928.095,The reason I -- I think it's a matter of concern is -- what I heard from Mr. Garre were a lot of numbers.
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4946.92,4947.06,Yes.
2015.14-981,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4947.06,4950.06,"-- with -- I mean, that was -- this is consideration of race."
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4951.17,4951.27,Yes.
2015.14-981,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4951.27,4955.37,"And to pass out some survey and see, I don't think is an adequate --"
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4955.37,4957.725,It certainly wouldn't be adequate by itself.
2015.14-981,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4990.43,4991.99,600 is going to make the difference?
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4991.99,4992.52,It -- it -- it --
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4992.52,4992.9,It might well --
2015.14-981,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4992.9,4994.93,They wouldn't feel isolated with 600?
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4994.93,5020.44,"It might well make a significant difference. And if I could, in the time I have remaining, I'd like to just try to refocus the Court on the importance of what's at stake here. As we told you in our brief, our military leaders believe that it is imperative that we have officer corps that are not only diverse but capable of leading a diverse military, not only for effectiveness but for the very legitimacy of sending our troops into harm's way."
2015.14-981,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5020.44,5031.2,But do you think that the African-American and Hispanic students who were admitted under the Top 10 Percent Plan make inferior officers when compared to those who were admitted under holistic review?
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5031.2,5031.94,"No, I don't."
2015.14-981,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5032.98,5043.425,"Do you think that the -- that the ROTC graduates from the University of Texas make superior officers to those who -- who graduate from, let's say, Texas A&M or Texas Tech?"
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5043.425,5050.66,"Here's what I think about that, Justice Alito: I think that we want to make sure -- and this military example is only one of the important interests here."
2015.14-981,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5074.33,5086.945,"Now, that's certainly important, but to come back to my first question, is there anything to suggest that the top 10 percent students are less likely to enroll in ROTC or, when they do, they're not as good as the -- as the holistic admittees?"
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5086.945,5087.17,No.
2015.14-981,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5160.005,5161.49,If -- if I can ask a question.
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5161.49,5161.88,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2015.14-981,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5161.88,5162.14,No.
2015.14-981,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5281.5,5297.43,"So I -- I would point Your Honor specifically to the declaration at pages 483a and 484 -- and 484a of the Joint Appendix of the admissions director, in which he explains the way race is considered in the University of Texas system."
2015.14-981,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5328.515,5328.9,Thank you.
2015.14-981,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,5333.204,5356.53,"Thank you, Chief Justice. Let me first indicate that one of the questions that's been asked repeatedly, as -- well, what impact did the use of race actually have? Judge Garza -- and this is at Appendix 200 -- tried to make an estimate, because you can only make an estimate, because UT didn't know, and they don't know now."
2015.14-981,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5367.27,5372.84,Do you think -- do you think that change has to happen overnight? And do you think it's --
2015.14-981,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5372.84,5373.27,Excuse me.
2015.14-981,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,5379.98,5391.2,"He assumed, at the outside, that any of the admits that were actually African-American or Hispanic outside the Top Ten, he said let me take that assumption and see what it would add."
2015.14-981,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5400.805,5401.66,What are you reading from?
2015.14-981,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,5401.66,5403.515,But he did not -- can I finish?
2015.14-981,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5403.515,5405.78,Can you just tell me where you're reading from?
2015.14-981,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,5405.78,5409.77,This is Appendix 250 to 251a.
2015.14-981,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5500.21,5519.78,"I -- I -- I -- what you're saying, basically, is, is this is what the Fifth Circuit concluded and which the school basically agrees, okay? If you don't consider race, then holistic percentage, whatever it is, is going to be virtually all white."
2015.14-981,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,5519.78,5520.71,And that is incorrect.
2015.14-981,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5520.71,5521.12,All white.
2015.14-981,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,5521.12,5522.32,And that is an assumption --
2015.14-981,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5522.32,5523.06,And to say -- no --
2015.14-981,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,5523.06,5524.56,-- that has no basis in this record.
2015.14-981,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5524.56,5524.95,"Oh, but there is --"
2015.14-981,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,5524.95,5526.44,It's a stereotypical --
2015.14-981,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5526.44,5527.23,"No, it's not --"
2015.14-981,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,5527.23,5527.89,-- assumption.
2015.14-981,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5528.56,5529.74,"It's not, because the reality --"
2015.14-981,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,5529.74,5530.5,With all deference --
2015.14-981,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5530.5,5530.99,-- that Justice --
2015.14-981,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5530.99,5531.61,Mr. Rein --
2015.14-981,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5531.61,5536.17,-- Alito wants to rely on. Let me finish my point. He's right.
2015.14-981,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,5590.82,5592.345,No.
2015.14-981,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5618.23,5619.76,Why? What we know is --
2015.14-981,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,5619.76,5620.43,That's what he assumes.
2015.14-981,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5620.43,5622.095,-- the school doesn't have enough --
2015.14-981,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,5622.095,5623.14,Justice Sotomayor --
2015.14-981,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5623.14,5627.27,"-- no matter what it does, it doesn't have enough numbers of black people."
2015.14-981,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,5627.27,5650.4,"That -- that comes back to the fundamental point. If we're just talking numbers, then you have to show the compelling need for more numbers, so that -- one of the reasons for defining your compelling need is that you have to then look at necessity in terms of the need. So as in Grutter, what they said was we have insufficient numbers of minorities to provoke the appropriate dialogue."
2015.14-981,4,17998,bert_w_rein,,5726.98,5729.32,"You can't -- can't litigate that way. Thank you, Your Honor."
2015.14-981,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5729.32,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
