2003.02-1794,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.173,"We'll hear argument now in 02-1794, the United States v. Manuel Flores-Montano."
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,9.621,13.003,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1794,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,34.923,39.631,"Well, now in this case, I suppose the Government did have reasonable suspicion."
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,39.631,52.756,"That's correct, but we did not rely on it and the evidence was suppressed on... based on the Ninth Circuit's rule that a gas tank cannot be removed and opened without reasonable suspicion."
2003.02-1794,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,52.756,75.501,"Can you make us, i.e., I'm not saying this pejoratively, but can this Court be required to decide what might be a hypothetical question, it seems to me, the dog barked and therefore they had grounds for thinking their were drugs in the gas tank, and he kicked the gas tank and it was hollow, and no one disputes those facts."
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,94.123,97.55,"Well, I don't think it's an advisory opinion in that the evidence has been suppressed."
2003.02-1794,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,194.683,195.798,Can we go back to your--
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,195.798,196.169,--to conceal contraband.
2003.02-1794,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,196.169,200.627,--You gave a Bivens justification for what is extraordinary.
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,229.856,238.894,"No, but we didn't want to have to tell the men and women who were in charge of enforcing the border that they should be subject to a potential suit, at least being named in their personal capacity in a lawsuit."
2003.02-1794,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,251.048,254.498,I suppose you could also say it's a question of resources.
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,274.438,279.146,It... it helps to explain why we thought there was a paramount interest in getting the case as soon as possible.
2003.02-1794,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,296.608,298.958,--This is a... I wasn't doubting the Government's motive here.
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,328.641,329.634,"Well, that--"
2003.02-1794,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,329.634,330.46,Have you ever looked this up?
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,333.265,337.723,"--I think it's... it's clearly an... as Justice Ginsburg said, it's not an article 3 problem."
2003.02-1794,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,344.576,352.75,"No, all there is, is there happens to be, I think, in the record, undisputed facts that the dog barked and that they kicked the gas tank and it was hollow."
2003.02-1794,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,352.75,354.691,"Well, I... wait a minute--"
2003.02-1794,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,354.691,355.229,--Anyway--
2003.02-1794,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.229,360.142,"--I think the kick of the gas tank or the tapping showed it was full, not hollow."
2003.02-1794,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,360.142,360.885,"Full, whatever, whatever, whatever--"
2003.02-1794,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,360.885,361.135,--Am I right?
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,361.135,362.083,"Yes, it was--"
2003.02-1794,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,362.083,363.281,Showed... showed whatever it wasn't supposed to show.
2003.02-1794,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,363.281,363.498,Exactly.
2003.02-1794,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,366.996,367.229,All right.
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,367.229,367.851,--That's right.
2003.02-1794,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,369.624,371.648,I know we have an agreement on that.
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,371.648,372.696,--as a prudential matter--
2003.02-1794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,372.696,375.158,Are we sure that there was reasonable suspicion?
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,375.158,376.977,"--No, there's no--"
2003.02-1794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,376.977,379.988,Or is it just possible that there was... that there reasonable suspicion?
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,379.988,381.268,"--There's no finding, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-1794,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,393.983,399.351,But the Ninth Circuit would require evidence of the training of the particular dog and so forth?
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,399.351,404.014,"--Well, at least that the defense is titled to discovery on that so that the... the handler."
2003.02-1794,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,434.357,439.27,Does it matter how... how much you have to take apart of a car to make a search?
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,450.87,459.886,"--Well, it might matter, but it certainly doesn't matter where the... the compartment or container in question is designed to be removed and put back together by mechanics."
2003.02-1794,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,465.276,466.474,How much time does it take?
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,466.474,468.498,"--Well, in this case, once the--"
2003.02-1794,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,468.498,469.613,To take it off and put it back?
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,469.613,483.913,"--Well, in this case it took under a half an hour, but, Justice O'Connor, I want to stress that in other cases, depending on the type of car, it might take an hour or two hours, and the last thing we want is our customs official to be on a Fourth Amendment stopwatch and telling the mechanic to rush."
2003.02-1794,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,484.535,488.909,"On the 25 percent figure, you say 25 percent of all seizures from vehicles?"
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,492.252,492.995,"--No, it's 20--"
2003.02-1794,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,492.995,495.407,What's... the 25 percent is a percentage of what?
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,495.407,499.561,--Twenty-five percent of narcotics seizures in terms of amount of seizures along land borders.
2003.02-1794,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,501.585,502.616,"Oh, 25 percent in terms of quantity?"
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,502.616,504.391,--In terms of number of seizures.
2003.02-1794,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,510.873,514.587,But included in that base is seizures from the person where somebody has it in their pocket and so forth?
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,514.587,516.073,"Yes, that's correct, but--"
2003.02-1794,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,516.073,518.303,"Well, the gas tank here had 80 pounds in it, didn't it?"
2003.02-1794,0,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,518.303,527.014,"--Eighty pounds of marijuana with five gallons of gas, and that's an enormous amount, and this could have been another... another... other dangerous items, it doesn't have to be just marijuana."
2003.02-1794,1,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,545.878,555.249,May I ask of you if the Government has procedures in place for the cases in which inadvertently they damage the car or... or maybe the thing might blow up on some occasion or something like that?
2003.02-1794,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,561.482,571.141,"Any time there's damage to any types of property at the border, the person is handed a claims form, which is processed through customs, first under the Federal Tort Claims Act."
2003.02-1794,3,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,604.085,612.609,"I would think there are a lot of cases, repair bills are getting pretty expensive now, where $1,000 wouldn't cover it, the damage to a car."
2003.02-1794,4,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,612.609,618.636,"--Well, that may be, Your Honor, but this doesn't involve claim of damage and--"
2003.02-1794,5,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,618.636,626.438,"No, I just... but it's... it's sort of in the background as we're asking whether it's reasonable in the... in the... in an ultimate sense, and I just... that's one of the things that I'm concerned about is--"
2003.02-1794,6,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,626.438,634.157,"--Well, sure, a gas tank is about $100, $200 item, and it's conceivable that any search can result in damage."
2003.02-1794,6,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,635.438,638.244,--You mean to repair it or to replace it?
2003.02-1794,6,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,638.244,639.32,"--Well, you're right."
2003.02-1794,6,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,640.473,642.885,"When you say $100, to reconnect it, it's about $100?"
2003.02-1794,6,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,642.885,643.157,--That's right.
2003.02-1794,6,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,646.584,647.41,"Well, that's not true."
2003.02-1794,7,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1529.251,1536.969,"Well, but not just on the... the... if you smash it unnecessarily, but suppose the only way to get behind the fabric in say a seat cushion or something like that is to cut it open."
2003.02-1794,8,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1540.147,1540.89,--Well--
2003.02-1794,9,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1540.89,1544.977,Because I don't suppose you have a seamstress who sews up the seat right away.
2003.02-1794,10,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1544.977,1545.348,--Right.
2003.02-1794,11,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1552.201,1553.294,But suppose it's something that cannot be repaired.
2003.02-1794,12,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1553.294,1553.687,Let's--
2003.02-1794,13,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1553.687,1555.339,You have to cut up a seat... a seat cushion.
2003.02-1794,14,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1556.165,1557.94,--Let's suppose that there's a significant deprivation.
2003.02-1794,15,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1579.26,1580.003,I see.
2003.02-1794,16,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1580.003,1590.489,"--might turn on the facts and circumstances, but these are wonderful pieces of equipment that customs officials use all the time to look inside places that are hard to see, and they use them exactly on seats."
2003.02-1794,16,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1636.064,1636.351,"Very well, Ms. Blatt."
2003.02-1794,17,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1639.157,1640.605,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1794,17,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1655.344,1661.493,"Well, Mr.... Mr. Hubachek, Montoya discussed that in the context of a search of the person."
2003.02-1794,17,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1668.569,1679.781,"Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice, but four courts of appeals have unanimously applied the analysis in Montoya to searches of property or effects under the Fourth Amendment."
2003.02-1794,17,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1690.184,1703.93,"Well, would you say that a ship coming in at a port in our country from elsewhere cannot be searched thoroughly without reasonable suspicion?"
2003.02-1794,17,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1703.93,1708.099,A ship could be searched thoroughly without reasonable suspicion.
2003.02-1794,17,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1709.008,1716.727,"But a land vehicle coming from, for example, Mexico at the land border crossing cannot be?"
2003.02-1794,17,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1716.727,1719.206,"--Well, I... the distinction that I would draw would be the point--"
2003.02-1794,17,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1719.206,1719.699,What is the difference?
2003.02-1794,17,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1719.699,1720.692,--of disassembly.
2003.02-1794,17,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1724.529,1734.271,You think that if the ship came in that the gas tank could be removed and examined for presence of illegal goods?
2003.02-1794,17,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1734.271,1741.126,"I... I don't think that it would be reasonable to disassemble a ship either, particularly in light of all of the various methods that are available."
2003.02-1794,17,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1766.101,1780.469,"But in today's world, the figures, the statistics are staggering about how many narcotics are brought into our country by way of the use of gas tanks."
2003.02-1794,17,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1783.729,1784.844,--And I certainly would--
2003.02-1794,17,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1784.844,1786.951,And... and what are we supposed to do about that?
2003.02-1794,17,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1786.951,1794.215,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, I think that what we're supposed to do about it is to use the methods that are tried and true by the customs service itself."
2003.02-1794,17,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1803.131,1810.933,"Well, they have to dismantle to get into a gas tank where it... the opening will not permit the entry of a... the little looking device."
2003.02-1794,17,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1810.933,1818.985,"--Well, sometimes... maybe in the brief I was too excited by all this technology that's available, but I think that sometimes it's important to start back at the initial things."
2003.02-1794,17,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1834.755,1842.102,"Mr. Hubachek, now you say, you give the impression that all courts of appeals have agreed with the Ninth Circuit."
2003.02-1794,17,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1853.414,1860.473,"--Mr. Chief Justice, no court but the Ninth Circuit has addressed this specific issue here, the dismantling of gas tanks."
2003.02-1794,17,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1862.497,1865.097,Is it not done along the Texas border?
2003.02-1794,17,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1865.097,1868.895,"--I'm sure it is done, but there just hasn't been a case that has arisen."
2003.02-1794,17,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1868.895,1871.496,But there hasn't been a reported case where it was challenged?
2003.02-1794,17,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1871.496,1872.05,That's correct.
2003.02-1794,17,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1889.003,1898.041,"Is... is it the... you... you described the search as intrusive, but as I understand it, your objection is not to the intrusion, your objection is to the disassembly."
2003.02-1794,17,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1898.041,1899.156,"Yeah, yes, that's correct."
2003.02-1794,17,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1899.156,1918.353,"So... so the... the... I... I assume your objection rests on either or both of these grounds, either the value of the property, which is either lessened or placed at risk, or the inconvenience to the driver and passenger while the... while the intrusion or the disassembly goes on."
2003.02-1794,17,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1919.218,1931.106,"I would say it's both of those and I think that the... of course, the Court's Soldal decision establishes that a meaningful interference, even if there's no privacy interest at all, still implicates the Fourth Amendment."
2003.02-1794,17,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1934.904,1937.133,"All right, you know, what is the issue on value?"
2003.02-1794,17,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1942.706,1943.449,--Well--
2003.02-1794,17,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1943.449,1945.761,So... so what is the... the property concern?
2003.02-1794,17,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1945.761,1947.58,"--Well, I think that there a number of concerns."
2003.02-1794,17,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1995.356,1996.842,Your... your clients weren't worried about all that apparently.
2003.02-1794,18,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3341.148,3343.832,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1794,18,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3392.789,3393.782,Are those public documents?
2003.02-1794,18,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3393.782,3396.754,I would doubt it.
2003.02-1794,18,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3405.958,3410.501,Is it public that such a thing exists?
2003.02-1794,18,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3410.751,3411.782,I've just made it public.
2003.02-1794,18,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3412.525,3419.129,--But... but... I mean besides your word for it.
2003.02-1794,19,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,3429.177,3432.421,I don't want to cut you off if you had something else to say.
2003.02-1794,19,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3432.421,3433.043,"No, that was--"
2003.02-1794,19,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,3433.043,3440.677,"I just want... I do think it's correct though, is it not, that what really we're asked to decide is whether you have the power to make random searches?"
2003.02-1794,20,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3457.274,3470.316,"--That's correct, Justice Stevens, and it's quite conceivable if the country ever went on a red alert that the commissioner of customs might say, or if there was some vague intelligence about smuggling in pick-up trucks, they might want to do very extensive searches of pick-up trucks."
2003.02-1794,20,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3483.031,3483.652,"Thank you, Ms. Blatt."
