1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,15.426,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 91-155, International Society versus Krishna Consciousness v. Walter Lee, and Walter Lee v. International Society for Krishna Consciousness."
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,17.276,21.478,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,243.888,244.74,Mr. Fisher--
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,244.74,245.157,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,245.157,251.561,--Are you making some point that they have waived that or that the Second Circuit was wrong in dealing with it on the merits?
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,253.763,256.882,"I think what this case is about, and what the--"
1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.882,257.415,Can you answer my question?
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,257.415,260.084,"--The answer is no, Your Honor."
1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,260.517,261.149,You're not arguing that--
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,261.149,283.949,"--I'm not arguing that point, and the reason I'm presenting this is that I think that it's important for the actual factual context of this case and the importance or nonimportance of facts that are now being argued to the Court be put in perspective as to what this case is about, so I think it is important for the Court to understand this, and I'll just spend another minute or two on it."
1991.91-155,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,412.148,412.698,--Mr. Fisher--
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,412.698,413.184,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-155,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,413.184,421.856,--Would you conceive that the airport could limit access to only ticketed passengers?
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,421.856,427.308,"Yes, Your Honor, and in fact the--"
1991.91-155,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,427.308,431.545,And it did so rather recently in many areas--
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,431.545,431.778,--In Desert Storm.
1991.91-155,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,431.778,432.361,--Did it not?
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,432.811,434.727,"Yes, and that wasn't the first time that that happened."
1991.91-155,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,446.202,457.259,Do you think that that conceded ability of the airport to limit access bears on our forum analysis in any way?
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,457.259,462.746,Not on the question of whether the airport is a forum or not.
1991.91-155,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,479.423,494.1,"Well, I would have thought that it had some relationship to the analysis in Kokinda, for example, and I just wondered how you would characterize that."
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,494.1,523.619,"--I don't think that the question, again, of whether the airport is a forum which can be subject to time, place, and manner regulation as it has been for these 17 years is answered by the question of whether, in an emergency or some catastrophe or whatever, areas in addition to areas that normally would be no problem for passenger flow or whatever, whether those areas also could be closed at that time."
1991.91-155,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,544.147,557.923,You would say that if an airport permanently permitted only ticketed passengers that you would think that was invalid.
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,557.923,561.625,Not necessarily.
1991.91-155,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,562.075,564.493,"Well, it's hardly a time, place, or manner--"
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,564.493,565.56,"--Well, it wouldn't be--"
1991.91-155,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,565.56,566.177,"--Regulation, is it?"
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,566.177,566.66,--No.
1991.91-155,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.662,569.814,"Just as long as it's forever, that's a time all right."
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,569.814,571.097,--That's a time--
1991.91-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.228,593.311,What jurisprudence is that?
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,598.828,599.03,"Well, I would hope it at least includes that."
1991.91-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,599.263,608.302,"--This is either a public forum, in which case things that make sense have to be allowed, or it's not a public forum, in which even things that make sense don't have to be allowed."
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,612.421,613.054,Whether it's a public forum--
1991.91-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.054,619.943,--I don't see how you can answer Justice White to say that the airports can keep everybody out except ticketed passengers and yet still maintain that it's a public forum.
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,619.943,623.395,"--Well, I don't know what it would look like if they really did that. It would not make it a--"
1991.91-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,623.395,624.978,I don't care what it would look like.
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,627.18,633.934,--I acknowledge that you can have an airport that did that.
1991.91-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,640.071,644.391,"Well, if it's not a public forum... I mean, you couldn't do that with the public streets, could you?"
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,645.891,649.593,"--In some places and some times, you can close streets."
1991.91-155,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,649.593,651.128,"Yeah, but not forever."
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,670.959,674.994,I said yes in the context of the fact that happens on occasion.
1991.91-155,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.982,686.135,It can't be a public forum if they could do it all the time.
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,686.135,700.978,"--Well... all I meant by that was that it would be subject to time, place, and manner regulation, and I would argue that they couldn't, but in fact they do sometimes close the airports."
1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,700.978,704.447,"Well, why couldn't they limit it to ticketed passengers?"
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,712.453,712.953,Thank you.
1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,713.786,729.145,"--Well, that's just circular, to say that they can't because it's a... what we do is look at the way a thing exists and decide whether it's a public forum, not say in advance it's a public forum and therefore it has to exist in a certain way."
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,737.068,742.055,"Well, that obviously is true, that this has never happened."
1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,778.609,779.811,"Well, is there anything that--"
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,787.965,790.35,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,790.35,800.974,"What I'm trying to get at, do people simply come out to the airport to shop even though they're not meeting anybody or sending someone off or themselves traveling?"
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,800.974,802.074,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,805.426,808.711,"Well, did the district court make findings?"
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,808.711,809.33,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,809.33,810.363,What are they?
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,810.363,814.365,I cannot refer you to the page.
1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,814.365,816.667,"Well, I mean if you could generally--"
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,816.667,824.923,"The findings were generally characterizing the airport, pointing out that people come to the airport, first of all travelers, and they're there and they're waiting around because of delay, cancelled flights--"
1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,824.923,827.042,--Could you address yourself to my particular inquiry?
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,827.042,827.475,--Yes.
1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,840.097,840.699,"I realize that, but--"
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,840.699,841.033,--Yes.
1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,841.033,845.751,"--Let me rephrase my question, since you apparently didn't understand at first."
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,861.696,862.079,And the answer is yes.
1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,868.433,871.718,Did the district court find on this particular point?
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,878.908,881.508,"--I'm sorry, I cannot refer you... I cannot refer you to a specific--"
1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,881.508,886.812,--Maybe you could cover... then what was your answer based on that you gave me just now if it wasn't on a district court finding?
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,886.812,902.171,"--There are materials in our brief that set out statistics regarding the nature and interest of the people that go to the airports, and it's a wide variety, and it's all set out in our brief."
1991.91-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,902.171,903.023,To Kennedy Airport?
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,903.023,906.141,"Yes, Your Honor, and airports generally in the country."
1991.91-155,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,906.141,920.485,"Mr. Fisher, would it make any difference to the significance of your case if the answer was no, that nobody went out there who was not either going out to get a plane or meet somebody, but that they did other things while they were there?"
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,945.016,947.302,"The answer is yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,960.443,962.395,They're designed to attract people.
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,965.847,967.73,"Yes, they're trying to get people to come there."
1991.91-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,969.73,972.865,I know a lot of people who go out of their way to avoid Kennedy Airport.
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,974.55,974.883,"Your Honor, there are--"
1991.91-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,974.883,977.299,--Just to be part of the crowd.
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,977.299,979.085,--There are wonderful shops there.
1991.91-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,988.857,1004.568,"Can you argue, counsel, that it is consistent with our precedents to say that a public forum exists in part depending upon the uses to which the Government decides to put the property from time to time?"
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,1004.568,1008.437,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that is a factor."
1991.91-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1011.222,1021.512,So the fact that the Government or the airport authority can close the airport is under that theory irrelevant if in fact it has not done so.
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,1023.947,1043.992,The theory of the case first of all is that the airport is a transportation crossroads and we've made an argument of crossroads and transportation nodes in history that are marketplaces for commerce and ideas and that are appropriate places for First Amendment expression.
1991.91-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1045.776,1051.43,"Well, I'm still puzzled as to the answer to my question."
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,1063.822,1079.915,There would be the argument discussed before that even if arbitrarily and suddenly they decided to close the airport to the nonticketed public that it would still be a public forum.
1991.91-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1107.784,1126.645,"Well, I'm trying to ask you to focus on the precedents of this Court and to ask you whether or not we approach a public forum by determining whether or not property has certain objective traditional criteria like streets and parks so that we know it's a public forum from that standpoint, or whether or not the analysis is different."
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,1140.572,1181.232,"--The cases that we rely on for the proposition that the airports as a general proposition throughout the country, like streets and parks, are thoroughfares and sidewalks and the same sort of enterprise of Government that provides a place for commerce and ideas to be disseminated is the public street cases and all of the park cases and it's a jurisprudence that is not so well developed."
1991.91-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1216.655,1219.607,Perhaps with the consent of the people who owned the transportation centers.
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,1219.607,1221.457,--Sometimes that's the case.
1991.91-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1221.457,1229.963,"Do you have cases that show that these people were sought to be excluded and the court said no, you can't exclude them from, let's say, Penn Station, which was privately owned?"
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,1229.963,1275.611,"Well, the Salvation Army cases that we came across from the 1880's, soon after the Salvation Army came through Ellis Island to these shores, were cases where the cities tried to exclude them and they weren't based on First Amendment law but the courts talked in terms of natural law or common law, and it's true, you know, we have a history that we've shown in our brief of the fact of this activity taking place, of the fact of broadsides and pamphlets being distributed everywhere where there were people in the 18th Century, and the American Track Society and others sending out their culpators to pioneer wagon train trailheads and to docks and to riverboat sidings and everywhere else."
1991.91-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1275.611,1283.765,"I know, and private hotels let the Gideon Society put Bibles in their rooms, too, but that doesn't make that a public forum, just because they choose to allow that."
1991.91-155,0,17614,barry_a_fisher,,1283.765,1309.932,"I'm not arguing that it does make it a forum, but to the extent that the word tradition comes into play and history is any part of the decision, looking to what was accepted, what really occurred over our history, is something that the Court should consider, and so looking to what has been the history, what has been accepted, what were the social norms, is what we've presented in part in our argument."
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1460.511,1469.683,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-155,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1597.818,1599.618,What are you reading from?
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1599.618,1602.77,This is page 499 of the joint appendix.
1991.91-155,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1602.77,1606.508,And you're reading from the district court--
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1606.508,1610.976,This was a hearing before the magistrate.
1991.91-155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1610.976,1617.28,--You were arguing.
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1617.28,1618.815,Excuse me?
1991.91-155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1622.267,1623.717,Thank you.
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1623.717,1633.841,"Conceding that the Port Authority had not changed its position, and that the regulations didn't alter the Port Authority's policy that we have always maintained."
1991.91-155,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1633.841,1646.216,"Just so I understand it, your regulation would prohibit handing out pamphlets relating to candidates in a presidential campaign at the time of the general election."
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1646.216,1648.185,"That is correct, Justice Kennedy."
1991.91-155,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1648.185,1658.54,Does the regulation allow the gathering of signatures on petitions in the airport?
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1658.54,1667.296,It would allow that as long as there was no distribution of literature and as long as it did not create--
1991.91-155,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1667.296,1672.616,I thought the regulation only went to repetitive distribution of literature.
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1673.516,1674.818,"--No, that is correct."
1991.91-155,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1674.818,1684.591,"Well, by repetitive, does that mean to more than one person, or does that mean on more than one occasion, or what?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1684.591,1687.876,"Well, there's two words used."
1991.91-155,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1696.066,1721.264,"Well, does that... as you understand it, would it prohibit a local charity, for example, from going to the airport on a given day and handing out a bunch of leaflets encouraging people to participate in a fundraising activity to many people, or does it just prohibit coming back day after day to do that?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1722.983,1728.203,--Our understanding is that it would prohibit a one-day activity.
1991.91-155,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1730.822,1733.941,To more than one person.
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1733.941,1735.757,"Right, to more than one person."
1991.91-155,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1753.585,1766.162,"Well, let me ask you this: suppose it's a nonpublic forum, do the regulations still have to meet a reasonable test, do you suppose?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1766.162,1768.864,--I believe they do.
1991.91-155,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1777.553,1799.383,"And in an airport that has a lot of commercial activity and permits people to stand around and visit and allows children to play, and petition signatures to be gathered and one thing and another, do you think it's reasonable to prohibit the passing out of literature in the public area?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1802.435,1804.453,"I do, Your Honor."
1991.91-155,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1804.453,1804.853,And why?
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1804.853,1820.962,Because our experience has shown that this type of activity solicitation and distribution of literature is inconsistent with the air travel purpose to which the airports are devoted.
1991.91-155,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1820.962,1842.412,"Well now, how can you say that handing out a leaflet to someone who wants to accept it is inconsistent with the other activities that the airport has allowed, and hasn't this Court drawn a distinction in part for solicitation, which requires much more?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1842.412,1873.197,"This Court has drawn such a distinction, and I agree that solicitation is more disruptive and that solicitation also has other problems attached to it such as it's conducive to fraud, but I also believe that distribution of literature is also disruptive and that it would be reasonable to prohibit such activity."
1991.91-155,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1884.822,1890.476,"Well, does it bother you if you say no thanks, and keep walking?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1893.011,1914.174,"Presumably with a solicitor you could also say no, I'm not interested, and keep walking, but the activity at the airports is... does cause delay by stopping people, even if it stops a person who wants to discuss it."
1991.91-155,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1916.293,1920.995,"Well, isn't the answer that it does bother you, but there are a lot of things in the First Amendment that bother you?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1925.399,1932.653,"The issue, I believe, is where this type of activity is appropriate."
1991.91-155,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1932.653,1961.739,"Mr. Berg, are you sure you want to concede that the First Amendment requires that even in nonpublic forums any limitations you impose have to be reasonable, it's sort of an overarching reasonableness requirement for all areas that are at all publicly owned or publicly regulated, a sort of general Federal administrative prescription that every rule has to be reasonable?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1961.739,1970.428,I believe this Court in Cornelius and other cases has stated that even in a nonpublic forum--
1991.91-155,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1970.428,1977.432,"You can't have content discrimination, I suppose, but does every restriction have to be a reasonable restriction?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,1984.52,1985.037,--Right.
1991.91-155,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2000.28,2014.974,"Mr. Berg, doesn't reasonable mean you have to be judged in some kind of a functional term, and doesn't that prevent there being any kind of a blanket rule, necessarily, for all airports?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2068.108,2074.411,"Well, I believe that our airports are typical of--"
1991.91-155,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2074.411,2076.03,"Well, how about the answer to my question?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2080.899,2097.294,"--I believe that you have to look at each individual case and look at the purpose of the facility, the nature of the facility, the characteristics, and to the extent that other airports would be different than our airport, you would have to look at that--"
1991.91-155,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2097.294,2129.665,"Well, do you agree that if an airport is compatible with and has apparently been designed for and used for the kind of functions that historically have taken place in town centers, in courthouse squares, in sidewalks and things like that, that the answer to the question of whether a public forum had been created there would be different from the answer in the case that I gave in which a no-frills airport with narrow corridors had been created?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2130.982,2150.845,"--If an airport terminal was the substitute for a public street, the answer would be different, but the concessions at major airports are designed for the people who are there for an air travel purpose, not for the general public."
1991.91-155,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2150.845,2164.505,So that you think that regardless of the characteristics of the particular airport it's the intention of the Government that determines whether or not it may be treated as a public forum?
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2164.505,2175.694,It is the... I think the major consideration is the purpose of the facility as shown by--
1991.91-155,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2175.694,2187.668,"Well, is purpose... are you talking... when you say purpose, do you mean intention, or do you mean the apparent functional capacity of what has been created?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2187.668,2192.572,--I mean the purpose to which the property is dedicated.
1991.91-155,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2192.572,2216.938,"So that if the Government says we're going to build an airport, we're going to have vast expanses of meeting places, shops, stores, we're going to have restaurants and invite the world in, but we're doing this only for the ultimate purpose of facilitating air traffic and nothing which is in our judgment incompatible with that can be allowed, that would foreclose the question whether there was a public forum or not."
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2219.14,2230.28,"No, I don't believe that the Government by Government fiat can dictate what the purpose is."
1991.91-155,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2230.28,2230.647,Okay.
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2236.934,2257.532,"In this case all the record evidence supports the finding that the sole purpose of the air terminals at Kennedy, La Guardia, and Newark Airports are to facilitate the safe, efficient, and convenient movement of air travel."
1991.91-155,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2257.532,2272.041,"So you rest in effect on the factual findings as you understand them that the function of the airport as an airport is inconsistent with leafleting and solicitation, is that the nub of it?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2272.041,2273.559,That is correct.
1991.91-155,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2287.301,2297.259,"So... and I don't mean to interrupt you unduly, but the real difference, then, between you and your brother is a disagreement over the significance of facts in this case, then."
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2297.259,2306.281,"--Well, I think it's a disagreement over the controlling factors in public forum analysis."
1991.91-155,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2308.015,2310.416,But it's also a disagreement in fact.
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2317.553,2329.48,"--Well, I think he disagrees with the purpose of the facility, which is uncontested in the record and which was found by the Second Circuit--"
1991.91-155,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2329.48,2331.563,"Oh, he disagrees with more than that."
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2364.3,2372.24,"--Well, I think that we have... we have demonstrated that all the characteristics of the airport distinguish it from public streets."
1991.91-155,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.623,2382.946,But he's making a fundamental argument that does not hinge upon what you in this particular airport have in fact allowed the public to do.
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2393.153,2394.653,--That is correct.
1991.91-155,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.144,2420.221,"Facts have to do with whether this is a designated public forum, where... they have to do with whether, even though it isn't a traditional public forum, you have chosen to make it that, and that it seems to me is quite a separate question, and maybe we ought to discuss the two separately."
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2420.221,2429.91,"--There is no contention here, from what I understand, and the Second Circuit found there wasn't a contention, that this is a designated public forum."
1991.91-155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2429.91,2438.598,"May I ask, Mr. Berg, you had this long history under the sort of tentative settlement or stand-by agreement, or whatever you might call it."
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2446.804,2449.656,"No, Your Honor."
1991.91-155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2456.66,2463.933,"Do you think we should just presume that there's going to be all this crowding and interruption, or should there be a remand for hearings on that issue?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2463.933,2466.785,I don't believe there should be a remand.
1991.91-155,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2485.829,2498.137,Is it reasonable for us to find that solicitation at this airport causes a serious problem with reference to the convenience of passengers and the congestion of traffic?
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2498.137,2501.256,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-155,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2501.256,2504.391,"Is that uncontested, in your view?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2504.391,2525.656,The Second Circuit made a finding that solicitation would be even more of a problem here at air terminals than it was on the sidewalk involved in the Kokinda case.
1991.91-155,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2525.656,2528.692,It made a finding.
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2528.692,2556.359,"They held that because of the nature of air travel, with passengers going through the terminal buildings, rushing to catch a plane or going to secure ground transportation, carrying luggage, that it would be more disruptive here than in Kokinda to allow solicitation."
1991.91-155,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2721.817,2727.554,"You allow solicitation and distribution of literature on the sidewalks anyway, don't you?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2727.554,2728.237,That is correct.
1991.91-155,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2728.237,2731.089,"So why isn't that enough, anyhow?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2736.41,2756.073,We do make that argument in our brief that even if it would be found to be a public forum that our regulations are valid because they are narrowly tailored and leave open ample alternative means of communication.
1991.91-155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2756.073,2764.144,I think you have the same opportunity to collect from somebody carrying a lot of baggage at the terminal in the street as you do once they get in to check their baggage.
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2764.144,2768.964,It gives exposure to those people if they wish to contribute.
1991.91-155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2789.795,2792.83,Would you help me on that separation from the rest of the community?
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2795.132,2805.923,I think the separation is relevant because people are clearly aware that they are entering a different facility.
1991.91-155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2826.587,2828.953,Where they're protected from this kind of activity.
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2828.953,2840.244,"Where the operator of the facility has the right to protect them from annoying activity, since they're--"
1991.91-155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2840.244,2843.362,Would your argument be the same with regard to railroad stations if they were publicly owned?
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2843.362,2856.439,"--The railroad... a railroad station would have many of the similarities of the airport, but they also would have some differences."
1991.91-155,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2918.846,2942.628,"Mr. Berg, let's assume that the airport is not a traditional public forum but that what we're arguing about is whether it's in effect a designated public forum, that you've allowed some forum-type activity and you should therefore have to allow this: I mean, you have stores, you have shops, you have a lot of those other things."
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2956.805,2977.718,"--Well, the reasonable basis, Your Honor, is that it causes delay, and causes congestion, and that the passengers are a captive audience because they must be in the terminal and they must take designated routes in order to accomplish their air travel purpose."
1991.91-155,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2977.718,2985.555,"Well, couldn't those problems be solved by restricting the solicitors to certain areas?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,2988.859,3011.272,"Well, as a practical matter, time, place, and manner regulations are very difficult to administer, and if it's a nonpublic forum, there is no requirement that a regulation be narrowly tailored as long as the regulation is reasonable."
1991.91-155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3011.272,3020.795,What do your lessees do in the forum with respect to handing out literature and soliciting?
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,3034.888,3045.909,As... they cannot... they could not distribute literature or solicit on Port Authority-controlled areas of the airports.
1991.91-155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3045.909,3052.23,"Well, I know, but don't you lease out areas to stores?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,3052.23,3053.349,That's correct.
1991.91-155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3057.801,3060.086,"Well, but it would be up to the lessee, wouldn't it?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,3060.086,3061.169,That's correct.
1991.91-155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3061.169,3066.407,You don't require the lessees to keep them out or let them in.
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,3066.407,3069.942,That is correct.
1991.91-155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3071.161,3078.731,"So it would depend on the lessee as to whether solicitation could take place in, say, a bar."
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,3078.731,3091.49,"--The Krishnas entered into an agreement with the lessees, with the airline lessees that they would not solicit or distribute literature in their areas."
1991.91-155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3095.342,3096.476,But how about stores?
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,3096.476,3101.43,The issue has never come up.
1991.91-155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3115.256,3131.099,"I take it your... I take it that your regulation would forbid solicitation or handing out of handbills at the very entrance, say, to a big store."
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,3131.099,3132.884,That is correct.
1991.91-155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3132.884,3139.705,Even though anybody who is entering that store certainly isn't on the way to a gate.
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,3139.705,3146.209,"That is correct, but they would be a captive audience."
1991.91-155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3146.209,3152.279,"What difference does that make, by the way?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,3152.279,3154.898,Well--
1991.91-155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3154.898,3163.254,"It just means that they are what, going to be bothered against their will?"
1991.91-155,1,15517,arthur_p_berg,,3163.254,3177.58,"--It means that they have no choice but to be bothered, whereas on a public street you have the option of taking a different route or being in a different location."
1991.91-155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3182.365,3185.686,"Thank you, Mr. Berg."
1991.91-155,2,17614,barry_a_fisher,,3188.336,3189.371,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1991.91-155,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3271.088,3272.021,Mr. Fisher--
1991.91-155,2,17614,barry_a_fisher,,3272.021,3272.521,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-155,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3272.521,3274.04,--Let me ask you about a procedural point.
1991.91-155,2,17614,barry_a_fisher,,3278.992,3279.225,Yes.
1991.91-155,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3279.225,3283.313,--And the court of appeals ruled in favor of the Port Authority also.
1991.91-155,2,17614,barry_a_fisher,,3288.531,3294.887,"I suppose so, Your Honor, and what it did that none of the litigants asked to be done."
1991.91-155,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3314.515,3320.402,So the case now... the court of appeals in its view ended the case.
1991.91-155,2,17614,barry_a_fisher,,3322.621,3323.254,Exactly.
1991.91-155,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3323.254,3324.14,--Or factual development.
1991.91-155,2,17614,barry_a_fisher,,3324.14,3324.723,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-155,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3340.066,3341.216,"It's in the regulations, isn't it?"
1991.91-155,2,17614,barry_a_fisher,,3341.216,3345.97,"--It's not even mentioned in the regulations, Your Honor."
1991.91-155,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3407.274,3407.94,"Mr. Fisher, may I--"
1991.91-155,2,17614,barry_a_fisher,,3407.94,3408.107,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-155,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3408.107,3409.14,--I understand that is a fact.
1991.91-155,2,17614,barry_a_fisher,,3419.498,3433.305,"We are arguing the general proposition that airports as transportation crossroads and thoroughfares are, in the first instance, to be considered public forum."
1991.91-155,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3434.007,3434.974,You say the first instance.
1991.91-155,2,17614,barry_a_fisher,,3436.174,3437.376,"--Well, let me explain, because I... I obviously--"
1991.91-155,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3437.376,3438.493,Are they public forums or are they not?
1991.91-155,2,17614,barry_a_fisher,,3438.493,3442.863,"--Well, I'm trying to be, you know, open in this discussion."
1991.91-155,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3472.014,3472.549,Mr. Fisher--
1991.91-155,2,17614,barry_a_fisher,,3472.549,3474.199,--But I mean I could theoretically conceive of--
1991.91-155,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3474.199,3474.482,--Mr. Fisher.
1991.91-155,2,17614,barry_a_fisher,,3474.482,3475.668,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-155,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3475.668,3477.551,I think you've answered the question.
1991.91-155,2,17614,barry_a_fisher,,3478.703,3479.47,"Yes, thank you, Your Honor."
1991.91-155,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3479.47,3482.755,The case is submitted.
