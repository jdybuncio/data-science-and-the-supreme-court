1977.77-324,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.76,We will hear arguments first this morning in Hicklin against Orbeck and others.
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,17.217,34.321,"In 1972, the legislature of the State of Alaska adapted a law which gives a residents’ preference to all designated Alaska residents in any job having to do with oil and gas within the state."
1977.77-324,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,107.415,110.574,The Fourteenth Amendment claim passed on that?
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,110.574,112.025,"Yes, it was."
1977.77-324,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,161.22,173.604,"Mr. Wagstaff, would your position here be precisely the same if Alaska restricted its residency requirement to employment directly by the state?"
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,173.604,178.499,"That issue, of course, the state employment issue is much different than this case."
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,213.738,217.975,"You are really talking just about pipeline or oil employment, are not you?"
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,217.975,222.405,"Oil and gas, as far as this law goes, is so far."
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,236.366,241.515,But there is no reason why a nonresident cannot go up there and start manufacturing widgets.
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,243.872,245.078,Not this specific law.
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,257.776,260.219,But Alaska has not prohibited that sort of thing?
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,260.219,261.636,Not at this time.
1977.77-324,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,262.374,272.102,"Mr. Wagstaff, suppose that Alaska set up a WPA project as we knew in the preparation."
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,286.374,291.007,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, those would be public works type projects working on public works."
1977.77-324,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,291.007,292.439,Building roads and this kind of thing.
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,292.439,294.964,Building roads actually employed by the state.
1977.77-324,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,294.964,296.181,Yes.
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,296.181,302.26,"Of course, that is a different issue and we would not be here under Alaska Hire on that issue."
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,348.373,350.813,I am not sure I got your answer to Mr. Justice Blackmun’s question.
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,350.813,353.124,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.124,354.04,I am not sure I have got it correct.
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,354.04,355.871,Yes.
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,355.871,357.392,What?
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,357.392,361.505,"His question, as I recall, it would bézier if this was a WPA project."
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,361.505,367.831,And then Alaska had provided that only residents could work on the state-funded WPA project.
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,367.831,369.168,"No, this is a different case than that."
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,370.992,385.127,"I realized that, but would you feel that you had substantial constitutional grounds if Alaska had enacted such a law and your clients were excluded because of nonresidency?"
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,385.127,386.01,"Yes, I do."
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,394.804,404.009,So a state cannot use its own tax moneys to relieve unemployment among its own residents?
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,404.009,409.098,"It can, just so long as it does not violate the constitution and specific other types of projects."
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,421.589,436.961,"Well, the Alaska Native Claim Settlement Act, a lot of people are not interesting in just sitting at home and getting a check every month to buy groceries, they want work."
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,436.961,437.859,That is correct.
1977.77-324,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,509.34,529.466,"What difference constitutionally do you see, if any, in a statute such as you have confine to natural resources of Alaska and all employment in Alaska, independent of the resource, the source of the material?"
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,529.466,534.275,"I do not think there really is that much difference, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.77-324,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,561.683,576.042,"It could be expanded on that theory to a salesman of Toyota automobiles, which as far as I know, do not draw any resources of Alaska to manufacture."
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,576.042,576.797,They do.
1977.77-324,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,652.388,655.046,"Mr. Wagstaff, would you help me with one thing?"
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,659.453,659.914,That is correct.
1977.77-324,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,659.914,665.971,What exactly is it other than being in the state for 30 days that your clients must do in order to be eligible for work?
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,665.971,679.658,"It is covered specifically by statute, Mr. Justice Stevens, and it appears on the definitional section within the Appendix."
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.516,689.434,What page is that?
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,689.434,705.521,"Page 12, he must maintain a place of residency within the state, most importantly, must show by all attending circumstances that his intent is to make Alaska his permanent residence."
1977.77-324,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.691,731.317,"You would not object to the residence, I suppose, because I guess he has got to live in Alaska during the work."
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,735.027,736.62,That is correct.
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,762.946,777.665,"Your position then is that Alaska could not even prohibit hiring someone, say, from Kansas or Texas, who simply apply to an Alaska firm that they could not require the people even to show up in Alaska before they were hired."
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,777.665,778.24,That is correct.
1977.77-324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,957.082,965.273,Is not the fact of unemployment among Alaska residents appropriately rational reason for this?
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,970.797,972.704,It is a legitimate concern.
1977.77-324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,984.713,989.521,What if the person has a job somewhere else?
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,995.67,1001.498,"These jobs that we are talking about, particularly are of extremely high-paying and extremely desirable."
1977.77-324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1023.586,1034.204,I am still not sure that -- I understood your answer to my question which was prompted by your assertion that there was no reason whatsoever.
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1038.574,1041.42,"Yes, it is a reason and it does exist."
1977.77-324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1057.752,1059.127,Which said what?
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1059.127,1061.991,It said that this is simply an economic preference.
1977.77-324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1061.991,1063.722,"That is the same thing, is not it?"
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1063.722,1064.534,No.
1977.77-324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1077.672,1081.747,"An economic preference, i.e. hiring residents before you hire a nonresident."
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1081.747,1087.974,"Yes, economic preference to all Alaskans, not just the unemployed."
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1087.974,1091.96,"But it would help the unemployed, even under the view that the Supreme Court of Alaska?"
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1091.96,1094.574,"If they were unemployed Alaskans, yes."
1977.77-324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1100.532,1103.877,I am not sure I understand you.
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1107.142,1108.021,That is correct.
1977.77-324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1127.58,1130.744,The Alaska state legislature enacted this statute.
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1135.208,1138.065,They enacted it.
1977.77-324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1138.065,1139.508,There must have been a reason behind it.
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1139.508,1142.188,"Yes, they wanted to give preference to Alaska residents."
1977.77-324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1142.188,1143.829,"Precisely, that is what they did."
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1143.829,1149.337,"That is exactly what they have done and we believe, impermissibly so."
1977.77-324,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1163.619,1179.619,"If this statute was sustained here and Alaska had another goal rush, could they extend the sweep of this statute to gold mining?"
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1179.619,1189.15,"Yes, it could cover any state natural resource that it purportedly or believes that it owns like gold, coal, or anything of that nature."
1977.77-324,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1192.847,1202.608,Only Alaskans could take gold out or non-Alaskans only after they had resided for one year.
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1207.533,1210.221,"Yes, they would have to establish permanent residency."
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1210.221,1212.364,The one-year provision was struck down by the majority.
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1212.364,1214.923,"Yes, it was limited to 30 days."
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1254.155,1258.855,Can Alaska require that candidates for public office be residents of Alaska?
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1258.855,1260.309,"Yes, it can."
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1262.644,1263.728,Why is that different from this?
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1263.728,1281.303,"There are some legitimate exceptions if they be deemed such to the privileges and immunities clause, and I believe that a state cannot discriminate against the citizen of another state unless there is a substantial compelling and legitimate interest that is being further thereby and the means chosen is the least drastic."
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1284.252,1287.178,Why?
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1287.178,1289.986,That is how the state government is controlled.
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1289.986,1292.721,"But that is not much of an answer, is it?"
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1292.721,1304.312,"I think, as far as the controlling of how state government is created, how the people choose the persons to govern that state, that it is legitimate in that context."
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1304.312,1317.956,"One would think though that would be quite illegitimate, there is a kind of self‑perpetuation scheme built in by the legislature to make sure that the people do not have a right to choose anybody but people who have been around Alaska for quite a while."
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1317.956,1321.162,"The legitimate state interest is to keep people, I suppose."
1977.77-324,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1325.012,1326.635,"Not only exists, it has been upheld by the court."
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1326.635,1328.269,"Yes, it has been upheld."
1977.77-324,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1331.167,1333.213,"So, you would not have floating governments?"
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1333.213,1334.0,"Excuse me, Justice White?"
1977.77-324,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1334.0,1335.029,So you would not have floating government.
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1335.029,1336.512,That is correct.
1977.77-324,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1336.512,1342.561,"You would spend six months in Alaska and six months in Georgia, and the next six months in California."
1977.77-324,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1343.626,1345.21,Yes.
1977.77-324,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1375.751,1382.53,Very well.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1385.202,1389.146,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the court."
1977.77-324,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1445.695,1452.471,I take it your argument would be the same if there was not a single unemployed person in Alaska?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1452.471,1457.171,"Yes, it would with respect to the underlying justification of course."
1977.77-324,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.171,1460.235,Supreme Court upheld the law on the basis you are submitting?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1460.235,1463.536,Yes.
1977.77-324,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1463.536,1467.139,"General Lorensen, I have been curious."
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1481.805,1486.298,"It is repeated in two places, but Section 050 does contain a scope."
1977.77-324,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1507.63,1512.196,050 seem to be a little broader.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1523.487,1533.752,"Yes, what 050 requires is that a lessee, who leases the oil, agrees that he will see to it that his subcontractors do in fact also hire Alaska residents with a preference."
1977.77-324,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1533.752,1535.51,And suppliers of his subcontractors.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1535.51,1536.233,And suppliers.
1977.77-324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1545.017,1547.51,Would they supply the refineries?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1547.51,1550.325,"It would depend on the nature, in which the refineries arose."
1977.77-324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1555.196,1564.823,"No, if this is a refinery built on public land, not state land, United States’ land."
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1567.726,1569.182,"No, we are not."
1977.77-324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1571.621,1572.557,Yes.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1572.557,1574.387,Alaska oil and gas which is being refined?
1977.77-324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1574.387,1578.382,"Some of these pipelines are on the United States’ land, do not they?"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1578.382,1579.606,"Yes, they do."
1977.77-324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1579.606,1581.939,Does this law apply to those?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1581.939,1583.926,"It applies to the extent that there is employment taking place, yes."
1977.77-324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1583.926,1586.403,Where do you get jurisdiction on United States’ land?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1586.403,1590.138,"It is not the land, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1977.77-324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1590.138,1591.706,The pipe is on the land.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1591.706,1595.696,"Yes, but it is the employment activity which we are regulating."
1977.77-324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1595.696,1599.901,You would go on to the United States’ land and enforce your state law?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1599.901,1602.949,"Yes, and I think we have."
1977.77-324,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1602.949,1608.707,What percentage of this state workforce would be affected by this Act?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1610.644,1611.172,That is correct.
1977.77-324,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1618.116,1626.992,"Would that be true if you had included suppliers, as well as contractors or subcontractors or lessees?"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1626.992,1633.7,"It may have been somewhat higher, Mr. Justice Powell, but, again, as I indicate, we have not in fact enforce it against suppliers at this point."
1977.77-324,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1633.7,1634.971,But you could under the Act?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1634.971,1636.101,We could.
1977.77-324,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1652.426,1661.281,"When you say suppliers, the Act applies to our employees of suppliers, not to the supplier themselves, I take it."
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1661.281,1665.495,"It requires the supplier to hire employees, who are Alaska residents."
1977.77-324,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1665.495,1669.22,But the supplier himself or itself need not be an Alaska resident?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1669.22,1670.017,"No, that is correct."
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1694.401,1700.326,"Mr. Lorensen, is it fair to analogize this to sort of a monopolist, who imposes a tying clause on its customers?"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1709.068,1710.745,I suppose that analogy could be made.
1977.77-324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1718.538,1722.909,"But your natural gas, once it hits the pipeline."
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1722.909,1723.822,Mr. Justice Marshall?
1977.77-324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1723.822,1727.416,That gas does not belong to Alaska once it hits the pipeline.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1727.416,1728.201,"No, that is correct."
1977.77-324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1732.378,1734.352,"You regulate the line, the pipeline."
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1734.352,1742.688,Only the construction before gas is ever put into it.
1977.77-324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1750.24,1756.073,But there is no question that Alaska can use that money?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1756.073,1760.118,There is no question that Alaska can use it and will be using the money that it receives.
1977.77-324,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1787.734,1794.655,Do you happen to have any idea of how many people in Alaska are on relief?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1797.411,1798.55,It is a substantial number.
1977.77-324,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1806.22,1808.245,"At this time of year, it is approximately 12%."
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1813.518,1816.598,"If they declare themselves residents, yes."
1977.77-324,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1816.598,1819.779,"That consumes a natural resource of Alaska, does it not?"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1819.779,1820.532,"Dollars, that is right."
1977.77-324,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1820.532,1821.291,Tax revenues?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1821.291,1822.76,That is right.
1977.77-324,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1822.76,1832.405,I suppose that is a research whether a natural or artificial.
1977.77-324,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1832.405,1838.442,"I can understand perhaps why you would prefer residents, but how about residence for a year?"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1840.944,1846.561,"That aspect of the law has now, of course, been struck by the State Supreme Court."
1977.77-324,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1882.724,1886.48,The Supreme Court of Alaska threw it out on state constitutional grounds.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1886.48,1889.758,It threw it on both the State and the Federal Constitution.
1977.77-324,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1896.566,1899.454,But that is not here because they also relied on state counts.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1899.454,1899.864,That is correct.
1977.77-324,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1899.864,1902.159,"In any event, you did not cause petition."
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1902.159,1902.594,That is correct.
1977.77-324,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1903.623,1910.394,"You accepted the 30-day and, indeed, your brother on the other side does not quarrel with the 30 days as such as I understand it."
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1910.394,1921.231,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart, yes."
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1971.37,1974.58,"Mr. Lorensen, is that a valid argument?"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2000.017,2003.19,That argument does not form the basis for our position at all.
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2003.19,2003.411,I understand that.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2003.411,2005.257,It may in fact be reasonable.
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2015.659,2017.699,But you have the same interference here.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2028.242,2030.414,"In fact, there is no interference with interstate commerce."
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2036.329,2045.554,"It would be precisely the same statute, except that Louisiana might not say with respect to oil we own, but just the oil that the other oil companies own that comes out of Louisiana."
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2054.114,2055.382,They may have the same motivation.
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2072.208,2076.819,"McCready does not deal with employment of other persons in using the resource, does it?"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2076.819,2078.659,"No, the fact of the situation, McCready did not."
1977.77-324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2099.66,2103.362,What about Texas where the state does own the oil?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2103.362,2105.479,If Texas does in fact own the oil.
1977.77-324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2105.479,2109.116,The University of Texas got more oil than anybody else in there.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2109.116,2121.098,I would certainly argue on behalf of Texas that they would have the same constitutional basis for requiring the Texas residents to be hired first.
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2121.098,2137.69,You were starting to say when we interrupted you that this would not have a broad impact in the other states because Alaska is peculiar in that it owns a great quantity of developable resources.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2157.75,2158.582,That is certainly true.
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2169.106,2170.277,The western states.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2170.277,2171.198,And parks.
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2175.97,2180.804,What percentage of the area of Alaska is owned by the state?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2180.804,2186.944,"When transfer of all property to the state is finally completed, it would be about one-third of the property of the state."
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2186.944,2191.649,And about almost two-thirds by the United States.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2191.649,2196.234,Except for the transfer to the native corporations which is presently in the offing.
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2202.318,2204.075,And individual private land owners?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2204.075,2205.106,They own about 1% of the land.
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2205.106,2206.045,Own 1% of the whole.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2206.045,2207.24,That is right.
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2253.309,2266.206,"Federal government has at least one statute that imposes conditions with which those who contract with the Federal Government have to comply, is that not true, the Davis Bacon Act?"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2266.206,2270.218,"The Davis Bacon Act, I do not know how that applies to residency."
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2270.218,2272.91,It does require a certain level of compensation.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2272.91,2273.708,It does.
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2288.968,2302.18,Would you argue that Alaska could provide that people who lease or buy its property as a condition of that lease have to employ only white people?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2302.18,2305.324,I would not argue that.
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2305.324,2307.721,So there is a limit on the conditions.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2307.721,2308.402,"I think so, yes."
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2308.402,2310.614,"Which the state, even as owner, can impose?"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2310.614,2311.376,"I think so, yes."
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2340.96,2348.378,You are relying on the state’s power as owner to contract with respect to the property which it owns?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2348.378,2349.731,That is right.
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.562,2355.195,"That is your sole reliance, is it not?"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2357.58,2360.152,We begin with the premise that the state owns the land.
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2377.884,2382.044,But you do concede clearly that there are limitations.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2385.04,2386.82,Yes.
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2394.9,2399.197,Is there any difference between its power as a contractor and its power as an owner?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2399.197,2403.364,That is an interesting question which I have been unable to resolve in terms of the research.
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2403.364,2404.936,"It is basically the same, is it not?"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2404.936,2407.572,It seems to me that it should be the same.
1977.77-324,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2412.489,2419.127,I would suppose that you would say then that certainly in the state’s own employment it could put on the same condition?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2419.127,2422.266,"Yes, for state public employment."
1977.77-324,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2422.266,2430.939,But you would not say that the state could require that all the oil taken out of the lands it owns in Alaska be used only in Alaska?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2430.939,2431.189,No.
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2436.815,2437.783,The commerce clause.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2437.783,2439.284,"That is right, commerce clause."
1977.77-324,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2446.196,2471.285,"General Lorensen, with respect to this one-third of the land in the state that is owned by Alaska, I take it your theory would justify a statute which said that any purchaser of any portion of that land must, as long as he owns the land, put preference in employment to Alaska residents and require his purchaser to do the same so that forever, for one-third of the state, the employment preference could be restricted to Alaska residents."
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2471.285,2476.04,"If we are going upon a state power to contract theory, yes, very definitely."
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2491.939,2502.135,"But historically, the homesteading was basically used to be a federal program and it was for new comers primarily, was it not?"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2502.135,2509.414,"It was to encourage people to settle the land, whether the federal program was for new comers or just to encourage settlement."
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2509.414,2516.275,"Do you know, with respect to homesteading, whether historically there had been residential restrictions?"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2516.275,2517.843,I really do not know that.
1977.77-324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2517.843,2518.239,I do not either.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2519.149,2520.557,"No, I do not."
1977.77-324,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.312,2535.401,"Of course, your statute does not conclude employment of a resident-alien, does it?"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2535.401,2536.047,"No, it does not."
1977.77-324,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2587.436,2600.975,"How from a constitutional point of view, is that an independent basis as contrasted to a legislature simply deciding without any constitutional mandate that it wants to do that?"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2600.975,2614.745,It seems to me that the constitutional requirement places a nature of a trust upon the legislature and its relationship with that land that may or may not exist in the absence of that kind of a constitutional requirement.
1977.77-324,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2614.745,2618.791,"But in either case, you are being challenged on federal constitutional grounds."
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2618.791,2619.249,That is correct.
1977.77-324,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2653.0,2654.36,Where are you reading from?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2654.36,2663.053,I am reading from – this is the brief of the appellants in their footnote 7 on page 7.
1977.77-324,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2732.818,2744.891,"Under your view of the privileges and immunities clause, would it forbid the Alaska legislature from requiring all private employers to hire Alaskans first?"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2744.891,2747.131,I would not say that it would forbid it.
1977.77-324,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2761.877,2780.311,"Assume the legislature invoked the same reasons that it did here with respect to employment on state property, namely that Alaska has a high employment rate and we intend to give an economic benefit to Alaska residents."
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2780.311,2790.052,I would hate to express an opinion on behalf of the Attorney General’s Office at this point in time on that issue.
1977.77-324,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2790.052,2793.086,"Let me ask you something different, just short of that."
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2800.759,2802.062,A law such as the one you are proposing?
1977.77-324,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2802.062,2802.905,Yes.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2802.905,2809.244,"Your Toomer test, are there valid independent reasons for the discrimination?"
1977.77-324,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2810.816,2817.127,Are there just any reasons?
1977.77-324,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2817.127,2818.953,You mean whatever the court meant in Toomer?
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2818.953,2821.21,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-324,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2826.366,2827.897,I was not here.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2827.897,2830.855,The court articulated it.[Laughter]
1977.77-324,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2870.223,2880.511,"Suppose we reject your McCready principle then we reach this, you still have to think the Toomer problem."
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2880.511,2881.676,"That is right, the Toomer test."
1977.77-324,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2885.084,2894.47,That is why I am asking you.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2911.88,2925.26,"Yes, and that is where the constitutional provision of the state constitution comes into play which directs the legislature to see to it that land, which the state owns, is utilized for the maximum benefit of residents."
1977.77-324,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2933.513,2936.693,"There is still a valid independent reason and, that is that the state seeks"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2951.436,2960.321,"The reason is that the state owns this land and desires to utilize; if it is to be utilized at all, if it is to be disposed of."
1977.77-324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3054.612,3057.804,"It would be in the constitution, would it?"
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,3057.804,3058.337,"I beg your pardon, Mr. Justice Marshall?"
1977.77-324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3058.337,3060.34,You do not need the privileges and immunities clause.
1977.77-324,1,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,3065.636,3067.805,"I am not going to take that position, certainly not."
1977.77-324,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3148.891,3150.955,"Mr. Wagstaff, do you have anything further?"
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3150.955,3151.589,"Yes, I do."
1977.77-324,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3212.358,3218.598,"Mr. Wagstaff, do you think that the Alaska State Bar can impose a residency requirement?"
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3218.598,3220.663,It does impose a residency requirement.
1977.77-324,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3270.609,3278.392,You can see it as our cases hold that the residency requirement for admission to the State Bar is permissive.
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3278.392,3295.024,"Yes, that is one of the exceptions similar to the Boating Professional Licensing, Divorce, if you want to think it in those terms, possibly municipal employment under the McCarthy opinion, and the Receipt of Welfare."
1977.77-324,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3320.319,3321.689,Maybe it could and maybe it could not.
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3337.104,3339.759,"Yes, that it purports to own, that is correct."
1977.77-324,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3339.759,3340.289,It does own.
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3343.275,3346.752,"Own in the sense of being able to restrict it, I do not think you can."
1977.77-324,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3346.752,3347.448,Own.
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3347.448,3348.393,"Yes, it does."
1977.77-324,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3374.551,3379.011,Is that an argument that it can prevail even if we do not overrule McCready?
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3379.011,3383.745,"Yes, it is because this is a different type of ownership."
1977.77-324,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3389.854,3397.475,"McCready did not involve transient, fugitive, why a wife would rather suddenly tear oysters or plant oysters?"
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3397.475,3404.543,"Planting oysters in the tidelands of the Ware River, access to this had nothing to do with sale or jobs or anything else."
1977.77-324,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3408.111,3408.989,Mr. Wagstaff.
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3408.989,3410.507,Yes?
1977.77-324,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3410.507,3415.925,Earlier in your arguments you emphasized the fact that the employment here was private.
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3437.575,3438.516,It is a different case.
1977.77-324,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3476.815,3480.705,"In McCarthy, we were dealing with employees of the city of Philadelphia, as I recall."
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3480.705,3482.556,That is correct.
1977.77-324,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3482.556,3495.087,"Would you draw a distinction between city employees, on one hand, performing public functions and employees of Alaska in an example I gave you?"
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3495.087,3496.051,"Yes, I certainly do."
1977.77-324,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3522.19,3527.622,"You say McCarthy was per curiam opinion, is that one of the distinctions you would draw?"
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3527.622,3537.116,I said that in the sense that that was not fully analyzed as I recall in a particular opinion as to the specific reasons for uniqueness of municipal employment.
1977.77-324,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3537.116,3539.699,"I do not think it was an arguable case anyway, do you?"
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3539.699,3541.055,I do not believe it was.
1977.77-324,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3541.055,3542.728,It was a summary disposition.
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3542.728,3543.189,Yes.
1977.77-324,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3543.189,3545.744,Which is why it was per curiam.
1977.77-324,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3545.744,3549.875,"You feel, therefore, that it is less authoritative?"
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3549.875,3553.047,"In my judgment, it is, in trying to seek guidance from it."
1977.77-324,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3563.289,3570.411,"As a matter of fact, I think we have suggested that perhaps summary decisions are less authoritative even for us."
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3570.411,3572.248,"Yes, that is correct."
1977.77-324,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3572.248,3573.265,Not even for us.
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3573.265,3574.066,Especially for us.
1977.77-324,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3574.066,3576.739,"No, for us.[Laughter]"
1977.77-324,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3577.973,3580.423,Exactly.
1977.77-324,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3580.423,3581.322,I see that my time is up.
1977.77-324,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3582.542,3583.342,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
