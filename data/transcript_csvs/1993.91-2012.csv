1993.91-2012,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.717,"We'll hear argument next in Number 91-2012, Jackie Holder v. E. K. Hall."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,47.163,49.464,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.91-2012,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,94.094,124.512,"Well now, that means that if, for instance, we had a situation where some counties had three-member commissions and others had five-member commissions, that if minority voters in a three-member commission county sued under section 2 seeking a five-member commission, you would say that, as in this case, section 2 just doesn't cover it."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,124.512,130.445,"Your Honor, our position is not that section 2 doesn't cover a claim."
1993.91-2012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,143.716,159.404,"Suppose there were a commission, a county commission of five commissioners, and it was shrunk to three, allegedly causing a dilution, would there be a section 2 remedy for the court in that instance?"
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,159.404,163.027,There would be a remedy under section 5.
1993.91-2012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,163.538,165.388,"No... no, I said section 2."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,165.388,171.983,--If there were a lawsuit seeking to change the size of the government from five--
1993.91-2012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,171.983,172.264,No.
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,185.022,194.128,"--If there was an intentional reason to dilute minority voting strength because of the reduction, yes, there would be a violation."
1993.91-2012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,197.601,197.899,"No, but--"
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,197.899,198.781,--of a section 2 claim.
1993.91-2012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,198.781,200.563,--It's not intentional.
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,206.156,220.937,"If there has been a retrogression of minority voting strength and minority votes are diluted by virtue of that change by county government, then there would be a section 2 claim, but the county--"
1993.91-2012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,220.937,232.443,So that the overarching proposition that section 2 does not apply to changes in the size of a governing body has at least one exception in the case that I put.
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,232.443,233.104,"--No, sir."
1993.91-2012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,261.954,264.514,But I just want to make sure what your proposition is.
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,279.143,287.999,"--Your Honor, section 2 has not... section 2 addresses the method of electing persons to office."
1993.91-2012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,303.59,312.505,"All right, then the courts are, in that instance, interfering with a governmental decision as to what the size of the governing body ought to be."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,312.505,317.599,That is because the governing body has made a change in the size.
1993.91-2012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,321.162,324.373,It's just a difference between an act of omission and of commission?
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,324.373,327.255,"No, sir, I don't agree with that."
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,353.542,366.64,"Is it your position that in a multiofficial district, if the lines were not redrawn, let's say, that there never could be a dilution claim?"
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,379.97,390.816,"Under the preconditions set forth by this Court in Gingles, in order to bring a vote dilution claim, you must meet three preconditions."
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,390.816,392.518,"Well, I... let me interrupt you, if I may."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,408.337,413.751,"There can be a change... there can be a challenge, regardless of whether there has been a change or not."
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,413.751,414.612,All right.
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,414.612,415.704,Our position in this case--
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,415.704,424.99,"Well, why is the case different in a multiofficial district than it is from the district before us, where there's only one commissioner?"
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,424.99,429.481,"--Well, in the district before us we're talking about a single-member district--"
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,429.481,429.722,Yeah.
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,429.722,434.794,--which is the smallest political unit from which any elected person can--
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,434.794,450.165,"Well, I grant you that, but if change by the government in the manner of disposing of its authority is not a precondition in non-single-member districts, why should it be a precondition in a single-member district?"
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,450.165,454.269,--There's nothing magical about this being a single-member district.
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,455.488,458.039,"Well, if there isn't, don't you lose?"
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,458.039,458.65,"--No, sir."
1993.91-2012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,498.608,498.936,Mr. Murphy--
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,506.893,516.229,"Our position is, the court, when it is analyzing a section 2 claim, must analyze the claim according to the existing governmental structure."
1993.91-2012,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,517.717,536.723,"But since you've conceded that you can look to the way it was... let's say you go from five and shrink it to three, or even to one, you concede there could be a dilution case that plaintiffs could win by showing the way it was when it was five, and the way it is when it's three or one."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,542.918,545.191,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
1993.91-2012,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,546.26,546.66,--But why--
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,547.471,573.378,"--Because the statute... when you talk about changing government structure, you're talking about local voters voting to change the way their county is operated, whether it be by one, three, five, and in the cases thus far, there have been changes in the size of the local governing body, and the courts have looked to see whether there was an attempt to discriminate because of the change in the local governing body."
1993.91-2012,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,573.378,574.569,"Well, there wasn't a change in the--"
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,583.696,584.635,In the--
1993.91-2012,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,584.635,585.466,--for each judge--
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,585.466,586.127,--Your Honor--
1993.91-2012,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,586.127,595.214,"--and this case appeared, at least, in Houston Lawyers, to reject the kind of blanket exclusion from section 2 that you're urging."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,595.214,604.249,--Houston Lawyers I do not believe involved a challenge to any district that had only one judge.
1993.91-2012,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,609.081,615.997,"Well, there were a number of judges elected by the voters county-wide."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,619.448,625.053,Some of those counties... all of those counties had more than one judge.
1993.91-2012,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,625.964,626.355,Yes.
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,626.355,629.687,"--3 up to 59, and--"
1993.91-2012,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,629.687,632.7,"Each one elected county-wide, right?"
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,632.7,633.591,--That's correct.
1993.91-2012,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,633.591,634.56,Yes.
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,639.164,646.607,The distinction here is not that a sole commissioner form of government is not subject to section 2.
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,664.78,671.145,"You can state that whenever the government, for example, goes from a multimember district to a single-member district."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,673.776,676.317,Our case--
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,676.317,676.938,Will you?
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,681.46,684.295,"--Would you repeat the question, Your Honor?"
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,684.295,703.115,"Well, if the county, for example, decided to go from a multimember district to three single-member districts, and it did it in a carefully crafted way that would exclude any minority election, on your theory, there never would be a dilution claim in that kind of case."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,703.115,706.918,"In that kind of case, you would have a section 5 preclearance--"
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,706.918,710.621,Let's assume that somebody is asleep under section 5.
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,715.284,727.902,"--If the method of electing judges violates or dilutes... or electing any representative, dilutes minority voting strength, then you do have a claim--"
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,727.902,731.863,"But on your reasoning, you never would have a dilution claim, isn't that true?"
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,731.863,744.352,"--My reasoning... my argument here is that when you analyze a section 2 claim, you don't look to... you look at the existing structure."
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,746.923,749.614,"Well, this just goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,756.06,768.377,"--Your Honor, the reason we don't do that here, number 1, in this case we are looking at a single-member district itself, which is the basic political unit."
1993.91-2012,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,773.45,787.181,"But you conceded that if you went... if you had a system of five, and you went to a system of one, even though it was only one, there might be a section 2 claim of voter dilution."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,787.181,790.682,If minority voting strength is diluted.
1993.91-2012,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,791.763,805.581,"Even though you end up with one, and you conceded that you... the test of the ""if"" is to compare what was to what is, and so we're now back... since you can make some comparison, why can't you compare what will be?"
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,805.581,811.144,--Because I think we're talking about two separate events here.
1993.91-2012,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,852.433,854.885,How many counties are left that have this system?
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,856.014,857.356,--I believe it's 14.
1993.91-2012,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,857.356,862.339,"Fourteen are left, and is it so that Georgia's the only State that has a single commissioner?"
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,862.339,862.84,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.91-2012,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,862.84,867.682,"How many have recently changed, do you know, from--"
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,867.682,879.229,"I think from the time we filed the petition until today, five have changed, either by settlement of voting rights litigation or by county election to change."
1993.91-2012,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,879.229,903.145,"--May I ask another, sort of more basic... let's assume you have a history with just one commissioner, as you have, you never had anything else, but assume that... and contrary to the facts in this case, assume that there was overwhelming evidence that the reason that they had maintained the single-member district, or single commissioner form of government, was to prevent the black voters from having an opportunity to elect a representative."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,912.201,928.082,"Your Honor, that hypothetical question probably would go more toward a constitutional claim than it would a section 2 claim."
1993.91-2012,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,928.082,929.512,"Oh, I understand it might violate the Constitution."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,932.323,938.658,Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act does not address difficulty to elect.
1993.91-2012,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,940.862,947.104,"It seems to me that you could tell me in very short... two different words, yes or no, probably, I'd find out what your position was."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,947.104,953.718,--If you can prove that during the time that this sole commissioner--
1993.91-2012,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,953.718,956.49,Prove it from 1865 to today.
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,963.826,968.519,"--Yes, but that is not our argument here."
1993.91-2012,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.949,973.352,"Your answer is yes, that would be a violation."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,973.352,976.973,--By virtue of the method of electing.
1993.91-2012,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,982.907,996.628,"No, I understand, but you do seem to be willing to acknowledge that if it were motivated solely by racial animus and discriminatory intent and all the invidious language we can put into it, that situation would constitute a violation of section 2."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,996.628,998.869,Your Honor--
1993.91-2012,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,998.869,1001.25,If you also prove the three Gingles factors.
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,1001.25,1002.612,--If you also prove the three Gingles factors.
1993.91-2012,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1002.612,1002.812,"Sure, you have to prove those."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,1002.812,1004.763,"Which is my argument exactly, in this--"
1993.91-2012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1004.763,1006.045,"Which is impossible, you say."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,1006.045,1006.856,--It is impossible--
1993.91-2012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1006.856,1009.397,"So therefore, it would not be a violation of section 2--"
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,1009.397,1010.397,--Simply because it exists--
1993.91-2012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1010.397,1010.697,--Right?
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,1011.378,1011.949,--it is not diluted.
1993.91-2012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1011.949,1013.529,So why don't you say it would not be a violation?
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,1021.195,1022.644,"Yes, sir, that is our position."
1993.91-2012,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1028.538,1030.391,Even with the kind of intent I've described.
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,1030.391,1031.901,Yes.
1993.91-2012,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.901,1034.352,You've changed... Justice Scalia has persuaded you to change your position.
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,1038.665,1040.847,"I have changed my answer, yes."
1993.91-2012,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1040.847,1041.758,You did make that concession before you had a little help.
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,1041.758,1042.666,"Yes, sir."
1993.91-2012,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1042.666,1051.934,"Not... if you've always had it, it can never be a violation, but if you changed to get a one-member district, then you could have a violation."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,1051.934,1054.437,The change could be a violation.
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1062.922,1070.947,"Well, how can you satisfy the Gingles factors after a change but not be able to satisfy the Gingles factors before a change?"
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,1070.947,1071.728,I think--
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1071.728,1074.379,"One-member district, same factors."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,1075.11,1080.664,"--Okay, because in our case there has not been a change, number 1, and number 2--"
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1080.664,1084.035,"No, but that... that doesn't respond to the question."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,1105.018,1119.587,"--Well, Gingles... Gingles' three preconditions require that you have compactness and numerosity in a single-member district, that you have political cohesion, and racial polarization--"
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1119.587,1119.797,Okay--

1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,1182.5,1188.173,"--No, sir, because I'm looking at this as an intent to discriminate when you make a change."
1993.91-2012,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1188.173,1192.917,"Yeah, but the intent to discriminate is not the essence of section 2."
1993.91-2012,0,40056,r_napier_murphy,,1194.907,1195.558,That's correct.

1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,1673.76,1680.505,"No, sir, because the President of the United States has traditionally been a true single-member office in this country."
1993.91-2012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1696.744,1700.417,What about the governorship of some States?
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,1706.392,1711.336,"No, sir, because I think, again, the governorship of the State is a true, single-member office."
1993.91-2012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1711.336,1714.637,This is not a statute that talks about intent.

1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,1734.751,1735.82,"--Well, section 2--"
1993.91-2012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.82,1738.412,"It just looks to the consequence, whatever the intent was, doesn't it?"

1993.91-2012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1742.255,1743.487,What is the intent component?
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,1744.947,1753.903,"Section 2 has been construed to prohibit racially motivated voting procedures, which would be the same as prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment."
1993.91-2012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1753.903,1754.414,It requires intent.
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,1754.414,1755.535,"No, sir, it does not."
1993.91-2012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.945,1758.397,Then my question stands.
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,1774.035,1774.806,"Yes, sir."
1993.91-2012,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1790.117,1803.545,"Well, do you think that Congress really did intend in section 2 to authorize dilution claims to the various single-member offices found around the country--"
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,1803.545,1804.706,--My position--

1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,1809.658,1811.04,"--No, I do not."
1993.91-2012,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1823.908,1831.664,"But it certainly didn't in language in the statute draw a legislative or executive distinction, did it?"
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,1831.664,1855.029,"That's correct, Your Honor, but looking at the legislative history, the principal problem that the Congress was addressing in enacting the Voting Rights Act was the dilution of minority voting strength at the legislative body process, and I think that that's the distinction that should be drawn here with regards to true single-member offices and legislative offices--"
1993.91-2012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1855.029,1857.32,"The statute doesn't apply to executive offices, is that it?"
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,1859.831,1874.602,--It does... there was not an intent by Congress in enacting the statute to increase... to allow section 2 plaintiffs to increase the number of true... true single-member offices.

I've spent much of my life in administrative law trying to figure out what's executive and what's legislative, but you very clearly see that some things are truly executive and other things truly legislative."

1993.91-2012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1902.13,1905.462,What about Federal agencies that can issue regulations?
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,1907.162,1912.238,--They... my understanding would be that they would be executive agencies.
1993.91-2012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1912.238,1915.728,Even though they can make all sorts of rules just the way this county commission can.
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,1915.728,1917.681,But they would not be legislative bodies.
1993.91-2012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1917.681,1918.031,Why?
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,1918.031,1925.846,Because they do not have the power to govern in the sense of passing ordinances that a local--
1993.91-2012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1925.846,1926.306,They pass regulations.
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,1929.038,1929.956,"--Yes, sir."

1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,1946.559,1949.02,"That's another distinction, Your Honor."
1993.91-2012,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1949.02,1952.963,"Well, do you really have to rest your case on this distinction?"
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,1979.18,1979.851,"Yes, sir."
1993.91-2012,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1991.639,2004.957,"No, I realize that, but doesn't it equally address the question whether the office in issue is one which may be subject to a section 2 claim if it is, as in this particular case, a single-member office?"
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,2004.957,2022.057,"I think the benchmark test would go to that question, and you would look to tradition in this country of having a distinction between legislative offices, which are normally multimember boards, and executive offices, which are normally true, single-member offices."
1993.91-2012,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2022.057,2023.54,Why do you have to get executive and legislative in there at all?
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,2025.129,2025.57,"Yes, sir."
1993.91-2012,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2033.825,2042.16,Do you concede that it is essential to make a legislative executive distinction in order to support your position in this case?
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,2042.16,2047.085,"--Not for this particular case, but in response to his question I was answering it in that way."
1993.91-2012,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2047.085,2072.96,"Mr. Coates, you said, I thought, in response to Justice Souter's question that you look all around the country for a benchmark so that even if all of the 250 or whatever it is counties they have in Georgia all had single commissioners, you might find a benchmark out in the State of Oregon, say, where perhaps they all had... the counties had five-member commissions?"
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,2072.96,2073.482,"No, sir."
1993.91-2012,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2079.286,2086.36,"So if you found all single commissioners in Georgia, could you look any further?"
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,2086.36,2102.249,"I think that that would be a much more difficult case, because if Georgia had a statute that provided that every county would have a sole commissioner, then there would be a strong argument in this case that the State policy required the sole-commissioner form of government, but I thought--"
1993.91-2012,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2102.249,2103.301,It wouldn't be conclusive?
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,2103.301,2109.466,--It would not be... I think it would be a much more difficult case.
1993.91-2012,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2126.998,2127.719,"I was thinking of Texas, I think."

1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,2174.768,2184.203,"Well, the court of appeals held that the analysis applied to the issue of racial bloc voting by the district court judge was too narrow."

1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,2251.927,2283.099,"--That's correct, because in 1986, the eight existing precincts that existed in 1984 had been consolidated into one precinct, and under a one-precinct situation regression analysis is not possible because you need at least two or more precincts to compare to do the regression analysis, so it was not a possibility for the plaintiffs in this case to offer a statistical showing concerning the 1986 referendum."

1993.91-2012,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2419.976,2421.358,"Well, let me put it this way."

1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,2831.887,2845.445,"--Well, for example, there was a finding by the district court, affirmed by the court of appeals, that black people in Bleckley County continue to suffer from the effects of racial discrimination in housing and employment and areas like that, and that--"
1993.91-2012,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2845.445,2847.237,"Well, what's that got to do with participation?"
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,2847.237,2847.678,--Because--
1993.91-2012,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2847.678,2849.268,Under section 2?
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,2849.268,2876.225,"--Because that's one of the factors that the Senate report pointed to as bearing upon the question of equal participation, and both the district court, I think, importantly, and the court of appeals, found that that present depressed socioeconomic status hindered the ability... and this is what the district court said, even though that judge ruled against us... hindered the ability of black people to vote and run for office."

1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,2928.789,2930.581,Yes.
1993.91-2012,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2980.993,3002.077,"Suppose that throughout Georgia the choice were between having either a one-commissioner system or a three-commissioner system, and suppose further that in Bleckley County the increment from one to three would not result in the election of any representatives of the black community."
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,3007.091,3021.32,"That would be a much more difficult case, because there would be a policy, a State policy applied across the board to counties that would establish either a one-person commission or a three-person commission."

1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,3110.108,3115.532,"The only place that it is referred to is not in the face of the statute, but in the seven Senate factors."
1993.91-2012,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3118.994,3126.188,"In looking at the totality of the circumstances to determine the dilution question, right?"
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,3126.188,3127.149,"--Yes, ma'am."
1993.91-2012,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3131.911,3138.216,"But if dilution is found, then I suppose a remedy is required."
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,3138.216,3140.169,Yes.
1993.91-2012,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3156.097,3159.581,"Now, it's a little hard to read the limiting principle into the language of the statute."
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,3159.581,3161.14,"Yes, ma'am."
1993.91-2012,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3161.14,3180.103,"Well, isn't it the nub of your argument that dilution is in effect a question involving comparisons, and what the appropriate comparison may be, you assume, Congress intended to be established by looking to traditional practice within a State?"
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,3180.103,3180.504,"Yes, sir."
1993.91-2012,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3180.504,3182.234,Is that--
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,3182.234,3187.998,"That's correct, a State practice establishes the benchmark, and it would be a different case--"
1993.91-2012,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3187.998,3201.077,"--So ultimately you're saying, what is an appropriate comparison is a question of congressional intent, and congressional intent was, look to what they have been doing within the State for other possible, reasonable comparisons."
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,3201.077,3213.957,"--That's correct, because I think section 2 shows that there's a demonstrated Federal interest to cure the problem of vote dilution in the United States."
1993.91-2012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3233.99,3244.646,"You talk about vote dilution as though it's something objective, but you've told us it isn't objective, that there's no such thing as vote dilution if you've had a single-member office all along."
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,3252.78,3254.422,--If I said there--
1993.91-2012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3254.422,3255.671,I don't know what vote dilution means.
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,3259.514,3266.0,"--Well, if I said that there wasn't vote dilution under the single commissioner form in Bleckley County, I did not intend to say that."
1993.91-2012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3266.0,3268.19,"No, no, but you said in another State there wouldn't be."
1993.91-2012,1,18722,christopher_coates,,3279.628,3285.271,It would depend upon the particular circumstances or evidence in that particular jurisdiction.

1993.91-2012,2,40056,r_napier_murphy,,3458.456,3471.222,"--Adequate proof of political cohesion would be proof that minorities get together to sponsor candidates, that they run a candidate."
