2010.09-751,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.57,"We will hear argument first today in Case 09-751, Snyder v. Phelps."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,10.189,14.843,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,37.856,39.541,Are we just talking about a funeral?
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,48.814,51.683,There was a flyer that was sent out prior to the funeral.
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,57.503,58.17,Right.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,59.789,74.131,"--As the district court explained, and the circuit court followed their logic, and I think the facts at trial confirmed this, that the epic was essentially a recap of the funeral protest itself."
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,74.131,77.416,"That's fine, but it -- it does not intrude upon the funeral."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,95.712,97.195,"Well, the--"
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,97.195,100.532,"And they were just submitted to the jury as one big lump, right?"
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,100.532,105.917,"--Well, we had the flyer that was submitted, that was sent out before the funeral."
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.225,119.677,"Suppose there hadn't been a funeral protest, just the epic."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,124.481,126.181,--I think that's a closer call.
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,127.183,127.849,Yes or no?
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,127.849,136.789,"--I would say yes, because we have the personal, targeted epithets directed at the Snyder family."
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.789,139.157,Even though it's -- he doesn't have to watch them?
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,141.776,143.293,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,143.293,149.429,"It's his choice to watch them, but if he chooses to watch them he has a cause of action because it causes him distress."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,149.429,151.464,"Well, the -- he has a cause of action."
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,157.952,160.654,"Well, why does he have a claim?"
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,198.593,202.83,"Justice Ginsburg, the statute wasn't in place at the time."
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,214.137,216.922,Didn't they stand where the police told them to?
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,216.922,221.624,"--Well, they -- they told the police where they wanted to stand and the police said okay."
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,225.492,230.48,And it was there with the knowledge of the police and with the permission of the police.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,230.48,233.848,--It's true they did not violate any criminal statutes.
2010.09-751,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,233.848,243.204,"Is there anything to suggest that the Maryland legislature, in enacting that statute, intended to occupy the field of regulations of events that occur at funerals?"
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,243.204,252.31,I believe the Maryland legislature made it clear that they didn't want people to protest funerals in general.
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,253.626,254.595,But they didn't prohibit it.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,254.595,258.546,--They didn't prohibit it under certain circumstances and in a certain--
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,258.546,260.998,"Well, is this the case which the facts here meet."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,260.998,266.402,--For statutory enforcement.
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,268.769,274.806,"That statute applies to any protest at funerals: Protesting the Vietnam War, protesting whatever."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,303.975,306.444,"That's our position, yes, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,307.227,313.029,"If you knew just what was going on, do you suppose -- because this had been done before."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,318.933,321.718,"--They picketed, yes, those three locations that day."
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,321.718,323.403,So they knew what the signs were going to be.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,330.24,345.602,"I don't think they could have beforehand because although you said we knew what the signs were going to be, generally from their pattern I think we could guess what the signs may have been, but you don't really know what the signs are going to be until they show up."
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,353.089,368.766,"So you could go into court and say that the signs were this, that or the other things at the State Capitol, the same signs at Annapolis; they're going to use the same signs at this protest."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,368.766,372.467,"As -- Justice Ginsburg, from our perspective, the signs that said"
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,397.999,403.384,"Did they have the ""going to hell"" sign at the State Capitol and Annapolis?"
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,403.384,407.271,"--They had -- the majority of the signs were the same, yes."
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,407.271,411.223,"Those particular ones that you mention, did they have those at the other two?"
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,411.223,412.023,Yes.
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,417.993,424.03,"So it sounds like to you it's the whole society, the whole rotten society in their view."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,424.03,429.268,"--If we are forced to accept their view, yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's what they testified to."
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,449.765,458.953,Where did -- you said the Fourth Circuit found that those signs targeted the family rather than the whole U.S. society?
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,458.953,478.701,The v. Falwell.
2010.09-751,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,478.701,491.275,Do you think that the epic is relevant as an explanation of some of the these arguably ambiguous signs that were displayed at the funeral?
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,499.78,514.79,"It can shed light, but if you put this in the context of a funeral-goer, Justice Alito, what you have is -- it was a typical funeral, family members driving in and--"
2010.09-751,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,514.79,522.528,"Well, yes, but the signs say ""you"" and the argument is made ""you"" doesn't mean Matthew Snyder; it means a larger group."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,534.002,536.038,"--Correct, and that's where I was going to go with that, Justice Alito."
2010.09-751,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,557.701,560.001,I'm not certain that this is about the funeral.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,580.364,581.566,He didn't read the content.
2010.09-751,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,581.566,582.699,So he hadn't seen them.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,600.278,605.563,"Your Honor, 2 days in advance they sent out a flyer announcing they were going to protest the funeral."
2010.09-751,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,611.067,622.024,"Did they say in -- my question is, how did your client find out these very objectionable things on the signs?"
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,624.143,627.761,He found out about the specifics of the signs--
2010.09-751,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,627.761,628.545,"Yes, that's what I'm interested in."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,628.545,632.915,--by going to the family wake immediately following and seeing it on the television.
2010.09-751,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,632.915,633.632,Okay.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,701.124,702.158,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,711.48,721.537,Your claim is that Hustler was a -- Falwell was a public figure and the Snyder family is not.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,731.227,733.512,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-751,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,733.512,734.129,Okay.
2010.09-751,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,737.547,742.368,"The more you say about this the happier I will be, because I'm quite interested."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,742.368,749.439,The private targeted nature of the speech in our judgment is what makes it unprotected.
2010.09-751,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,775.19,784.362,"So you have no objection if the sign said ""Get out of Iraq"", an antiwar protest, in other words not directed at this particular individual?"
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,784.362,785.162,Correct.
2010.09-751,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,785.645,786.98,So no objection there?
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,786.98,793.568,--I don't think there'd be any constitutional impediment to bringing -- or the Constitution would not -- would bar that claim from going forward.
2010.09-751,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,793.568,794.568,Excuse me--
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,794.568,803.424,"So the intrusion upon the privacy of the funeral is out of the case then, right, because that sign would intrude upon the privacy of thea funeral just as much?"
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,808.561,819.868,"Yes, Justice Scalia, and I think under a certain scenario, you could have, regardless of the signs, you could have a scenario where the funeral was disrupted and it was disrupted in this case."
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,819.868,821.737,It was or it wasn't.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,821.737,823.203,"It was, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,823.203,829.391,I thought that when the service itself began the protesters stopped.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,829.391,836.145,"The police testified that, I think it was, about 8 minutes after the funeral started, that the protesters left the area."
2010.09-751,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,836.145,837.163,--Were they encouraged--
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,837.163,838.863,I thought that they had to come in a different entrance?
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,841.532,846.269,"Well, according to I believe all the witnesses, yes, they had to come in--"
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,846.269,847.436,In order to avoid the protest.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,847.436,859.91,"--That, and they certainly took away, according to the priest that was coordinating the mass, they certainly took away the peaceful experience that all private figures--"
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,859.91,864.564,"But you wouldn't have objected to that if there weren't these nasty signs, you just said, right?"
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,864.564,864.997,--No.
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,882.376,883.009,All right.
2010.09-751,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,883.009,898.302,"--Counsel, I'm trying to tease out the importance of the -- whether the person's a private -- or public figure -- a private person or a public figure."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,905.474,914.413,"Well, in the context of defamation we had the Rosenbloom followed by the Gertz decision."
2010.09-751,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,914.413,919.151,"No, I'm talking about in terms of infliction of emotional distress."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,946.801,952.455,"I'd think there'd be -- have to be a lot more facts involved, harassing type of facts."
2010.09-751,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,953.938,955.074,But you are saying yes.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,972.167,981.773,"--Public speech, even directed to a private figure, should be treated differently than as directed towards a public official."
2010.09-751,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,981.773,982.44,All right.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1000.984,1006.888,"Gertz v. Welch treated the public versus private figure status different, albeit--"
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1006.888,1008.107,"That was defamation, wasn't it?"
2010.09-751,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1008.107,1008.84,That was defamation.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1010.792,1011.925,--Correct.
2010.09-751,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1029.771,1035.924,But have they done it in the context of differentiating between public and private speech?
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1035.924,1052.117,"Yes, there is an Illinois case that we cited in the brief where it was specifically said it was a matter of public concern, and they said the plaintiff was not a public figure; therefore the -- just, you have to meet the elements of intentional infliction of emotional distress."
2010.09-751,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1052.117,1053.819,I was not talking about State cases.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1071.079,1072.613,I think Gertz v. Welch says that.
2010.09-751,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1076.415,1078.184,So it goes -- it goes to the context.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1094.194,1102.383,"I think you have to look at the particular signs, because if you don't, anyone could come up with a public concern, because they could direct any type of epithets at a person."
2010.09-751,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1108.204,1108.92,"Well, in that case--"
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1108.92,1131.985,"Mr. Summers, I'm a little concerned at your apparent acceptance of -- of the proposition that if one comes up to a Marine and says, you are contributing to a -- a terribly unfair war, that that alone would -- would form the basis for the -- the tort of intentional infliction of an emotional distress."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1139.622,1141.274,"--It does, Justice Scalia, and I wasn't suggesting--"
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1141.274,1146.678,"Well, I mean -- I mean, why accept that as -- as parallel to what -- to what you are claiming here?"
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1146.678,1147.862,--And I hope I didn't.
2010.09-751,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1159.302,1175.681,"What about the -- taking -- if you have an instance where the defendant has said on television or on the Internet something absolutely outrageous, you showed that."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1246.408,1250.293,The -- I think the standard should be Hustler v. Falwell generally does not apply--
2010.09-751,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1250.293,1254.245,Hustler -- Hustler v. Falwell is defamation.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1254.245,1257.632,--I thought Hustler v. Falwell was intentional infliction of emotional--
2010.09-751,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1257.632,1258.882,"Intentional infliction, okay, good."
2010.09-751,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1260.015,1260.834,Mr. Summers--
2010.09-751,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1260.834,1262.35,"Well, answer then, please."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1262.35,1272.475,"--I think the rule should be Hustler v. Falwell generally does not apply to a private figure unless the defendant can show some compelling connection there, and if you -- if you--"
2010.09-751,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1272.475,1273.158,Compelling.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1273.158,1274.925,"--Or at least reasonable, rational connection."
2010.09-751,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1284.365,1291.936,"--Mr. Summers, Hustler seems to me to have one sentence that is key to the whole decision, and it goes like this."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1316.219,1323.788,"Well at least in Hustler -- Justice Kagan, at least in Hustler v. Falwell we had a traditional area of public discourse."
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1342.869,1343.436,So--
2010.09-751,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1343.436,1354.86,"But that goes back to the question that was asked previously about, suppose you had a general statute that just said, there will be no disruptions of any kind at private funerals."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1373.905,1380.225,"Well, the States have -- in the statutory case, they have the interest of penalizing the offending party."

2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1464.712,1469.799,I'm talking about this intentional infliction of emotional distress claim that you're bringing.

2010.09-751,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1477.103,1485.809,Is this the situation in which all conduct that complies with the Maryland funeral protest statute is lawful?
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1502.587,1505.872,"--Justice Alito, I don't know whether that would be criminally--"
2010.09-751,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1505.872,1508.322,Because it's not specifically prohibited by the statute.
2010.09-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1508.322,1510.407,"Well, it certainly wouldn't be because of the distance."
2010.09-751,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1516.061,1519.03,Perhaps you would like to answer Justice Alito's question.
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1519.03,1526.785,"--I believe that you could commit a tort and still be in compliance with the criminal code, Justice Alito."

2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1548.115,1551.151,"Of course this Court could do that, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1551.151,1561.673,"So you have to support both causes of action here, the intentional infliction of emotional distress and the invasion of privacy, right?"
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1561.673,1562.875,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1568.011,1569.345,Waived what issue?
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1569.345,1572.064,The invasion -- or elements of the invasion of privacy.
2010.09-751,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.372,1586.407,"Oh, all right."
2010.09-751,0,42125,sean_e_summers,,1586.924,1588.34,I'd like to reserve the remainder.

2010.09-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1717.023,1717.892,My goodness.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,1731.683,1735.42,We agree that fighting words are less protected under the First Amendment.

2010.09-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1752.547,1753.732,Do we know that?
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,1774.645,1785.018,I get the notion from the series of cases starting within 7 years after your Chaplinsky case with the Gooding case and on down through the Brandenburg case and on down--
2010.09-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1785.018,1785.87,Which say what?

2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,1884.533,1885.899,--Right.
2010.09-751,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1922.824,1939.084,Is it your -- is it your argument that the First Amendment never allows a claim for the intentional infliction of emotional distress based on speech unless the speech is such that it can be proven to be false or true?
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,1939.084,1940.12,--In--
2010.09-751,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1940.12,1941.953,Is that your argument?
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,1941.953,1958.729,"--With a -- yes, Justice Alito, and with a little bit more from your cases, if I may: And not under an inherently subjective standard, and where you're only claiming that the impact of the speech was adverse emotional impact."
2010.09-751,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1958.729,1959.163,All right.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2011.429,2012.213,Right.
2010.09-751,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2020.035,2021.769,"Well, it's an elderly person."

2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2032.093,2033.879,--Yes.
2010.09-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.09,2053.24,Do you think that everybody--
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2053.24,2055.875,What is your answer to Justice Alito's question?
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2059.76,2063.481,"--There would have to be a very narrow circumstance where it didn't, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2064.231,2073.587,"So you think there are situations where a tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress is allowed, even for a matter of public debate?"
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2073.587,2076.956,"Not public debate, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2079.991,2085.911,"Well, I understood the hypothetical, that the person disagreed with the war in Iraq and the sending of American troops there."
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2085.911,2090.465,"Right, and knew that this elderly woman was the grandmother of a soldier."
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2098.202,2105.141,The person selects the grandmother because he thinks that will give maximum publicity to his views.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2109.777,2114.831,"If the grandmother entered the public discussion, the First Amendment bars it."
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2114.831,2119.818,"Well, no -- Justice -- Justice Alito posed, the grandmother was returning from the grave of her grandson."
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2128.923,2132.791,"I am reluctant to say that it does not, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-751,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2133.325,2136.66,But you gave the answer before about -- you said stalking.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2136.66,2137.393,--Right.
2010.09-751,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2137.393,2140.029,Isn't this comparable to stalking?
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2140.029,2144.099,"And that's what I was trying to liken it to, and that's what it sounds more like to me."
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2144.099,2151.103,Do you think it satisfies the normal tort or law against stalking for someone to come up to an individual and engage in discussion?
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2152.789,2158.526,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I would not file that claim for that person, for that elderly grandmother."
2010.09-751,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2169.298,2174.135,"Well, if there -- if that -- there is a possibility there is a claim there, then what distinguishes that from this case?"
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2200.853,2203.388,"Not the deceased person, Justice Alito."
2010.09-751,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2208.223,2212.16,"But if the grandmother called up the local paper and said, let me tell you something about my grandson--"
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2212.16,2212.56,--Yes.
2010.09-751,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2212.56,2214.277,--who was just killed in Iraq.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2217.897,2218.764,Right.
2010.09-751,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2218.764,2220.933,That makes him -- that makes her a public figure?
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2220.933,2222.049,It's getting closer.
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2262.093,2267.128,Your response -- your response to Justice Alito is dwelling on the facts of this particular case.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2267.128,2267.628,"--Yes, sir."
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2267.628,2271.115,I'm interested in knowing what your position is on the broader question.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2281.655,2283.09,"Yes, I can imagine, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2283.09,2283.807,"I'm sorry, can or cannot?"
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2283.807,2284.457,I can.
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2284.457,2285.007,You can.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2285.007,2296.58,"I can imagine that there could be a circumstance, a hypothetical, where there was not this level of involvement, and it was out of the blue and it was up close, if I may use the term, confrontational."
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2296.58,2296.98,Okay.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2308.305,2321.013,"I don't agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice, because you have now taken an inherently subjective standard with the absence of any of these non-speech misbehaviors."
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2333.32,2335.236,Does it make -- I'm sorry.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2335.236,2340.354,"--with just that subjectively inherent standard, and that subjective statement of emotional impact."
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2342.056,2342.74,Does it make a--
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2342.74,2343.74,--we won't let that go.
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2343.74,2356.233,"--Does it make a difference, which seems to me to be the case here, that Mr. Snyder was selected not because of who he was, but because it was a way to get maximum publicity for your client's particular message?"
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2356.233,2360.352,"That is not accurate, Mr. Chief Justice, with due respect."
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2360.352,2362.72,"Well, assuming it is accurate, does that make a difference?"
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2362.72,2377.979,"The motive of the speaker to get maximum exposure, which every public speaker pines for, looks for, strives for, and is entitled to -- does not change the legal principle that's at play."
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2377.979,2391.037,"Well, it might affect whether or not the selection inflicts emotional distress for a reason unconnected with the individual who is the subject of the emotional distress."
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2391.037,2391.67,"Well, if--"
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2391.67,2405.297,"In other words, if the person is selected because, as I indicated, it gives maximum publicity, rather than because of a particular connection to the matter of public debate, I wonder if that makes a difference."
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2405.297,2419.972,--I think it makes a difference when you are looking at what role the plaintiff had in that public discussion and how tied the words that they seek to punish are to his role in that public discussion.
2010.09-751,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2421.872,2430.078,"Well, Ms. Phelps, let's say that we disagree with you as to whether Mr. Snyder had at all injected himself into this controversy."
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2456.746,2462.883,"--I'm saying it does make a difference, and no -- but no, there would not be a claim there in my opinion because--"
2010.09-751,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2462.883,2464.835,So it's not a difference that matters.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2464.835,2469.489,"--It is a difference that matters in some measure, I believe, Justice Kagan, in this light."
2010.09-751,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2506.912,2513.166,"But your argument depends on the proposition that this is speech on a matter of public concern, is that correct?"
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2513.166,2515.016,"Absolutely, Justice Alito."
2010.09-751,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2515.016,2516.868,So let me -- let me give you this example.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2543.268,2546.737,I think the issue of race is a matter of public concern.
2010.09-751,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2554.826,2556.609,But that's simply--
2010.09-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2556.609,2557.293,--Excuse me--
2010.09-751,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2557.293,2575.157,"--That simply points out that all of us in a pluralistic society have components to our identity; we are Republicans or Democrats, we are Christians or atheists, we are single or married, we are old or young."
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2613.413,2630.689,"Well, but again, this Court has given substantial, longstanding protection to speech on public issues, and how could it be gainsaid that the dying soldiers is not on the lips of everyone in this country?"
2010.09-751,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2650.586,2655.573,But your position is you can take this and you can follow any citizen around at any point?
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2660.542,2661.094,--Not follow--
2010.09-751,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2661.094,2668.214,"And -- and Justice Alito, and it seems to me that there -- you should help us in finding some line there."
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2668.214,2671.25,"--Yes, I will help you, Justice Kennedy and I am pleased to do that."
2010.09-751,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2683.723,2693.662,But in the -- but the hypotheticals point out that there can be an intentional infliction of emotional distress action for certain harassing conduct.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2693.662,2696.448,"--For harassing conduct, not for speech."
2010.09-751,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2698.75,2702.368,But torts and crimes are committed with words all the time.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2702.368,2703.168,I agree with that.
2010.09-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2712.826,2714.493,--Let's talk about subjectively.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2722.931,2727.252,"I believe that your cases give some good light on that, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2727.252,2728.319,You don't think it's subjective?
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2728.319,2731.871,There may be in some people's mind an element of subjectivity.
2010.09-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2732.671,2742.977,"You think that's solid, absolutely, what's a fighting word, whereas what is an outrageous statement is very much different from what's a fighting word?"
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2783.37,2787.858,"--Well, because the Court said it was inherently subjective in the Falwell case."
2010.09-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2818.543,2829.351,So your point depends -- depends upon the proposition that what is outrageous is more subjective than what is fighting words?
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2829.351,2834.672,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I must hasten to say this: I am not a fan of the fighting words doctrine."
2010.09-751,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2838.04,2843.527,"The Court has made that a very narrow category, hasn't it?"
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2861.239,2863.922,And especially not to where there's just emotional injury.
2010.09-751,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2901.197,2907.351,We are still so worried about the statements on television and on the internet and the knowledge there.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,2931.55,2932.002,Right.
2010.09-751,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2932.002,2935.204,"And emotional injury, deliberately inflicted, could be one."
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3020.56,3021.526,"Thank you, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-751,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3079.598,3084.05,Why aren't the members of the family -- why aren't the members of the family of the deceased a captive audience at the funeral?
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3084.05,3091.637,"If we were right outside the door like the other expressers were in these exhibits, they might have been."
2010.09-751,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3118.687,3123.675,I thought the targeted picketing of a person's house is not protected by the First Amendment.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3123.675,3128.809,"--Focused picketing, per Frisby, directly in front of can be regulated."
2010.09-751,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3130.661,3134.213,What's the difference between that and picketing around the site of the funeral?
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3134.213,3136.648,"--Proximity, Justice Alito."
2010.09-751,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3156.66,3163.798,So it doesn't have to do with whether this is a -- what you characterize as a public funeral as opposed to a private funeral?
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3166.417,3167.55,Not primarily.
2010.09-751,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3182.224,3191.347,"Counsel, I am following your argument that the bulk of your speech in the epic, and even the bulk of your signs, involve public speech."
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3237.228,3237.861,Right.
2010.09-751,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3251.154,3265.312,"So if we disagree that that made him a public figure, if we view him as a private figure, is that enough to defeat your argument?"
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3265.312,3266.58,"No, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-751,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3266.58,3271.532,Assume that the Matthews are private figures and you did this.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3274.734,3283.589,If without regard to what label is put on a person who steps into the public discussion.
2010.09-751,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3283.589,3285.539,You want to change my assumption.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3285.539,3286.957,Okay.
2010.09-751,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3286.957,3289.257,We assume that he is a private figure.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3297.213,3299.449,"Well, I don't know, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3326.166,3335.522,"Well, so that what if -- did Mr. Snyder, the father, become a public figure simply because his son was killed in Iraq?"
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3335.522,3336.974,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3337.457,3337.857,Okay.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3337.857,3339.04,--I don't allege that here.
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3339.04,3345.294,"So if he didn't take out -- if he didn't take out the usual obituary notice, then this case should come out the other way?"
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3345.294,3349.465,"It's not the obituary notice, Mr. Chief Justice, he went far beyond that."
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3349.465,3349.832,All right.
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3353.167,3353.667,Right.
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3353.667,3355.25,He is then not a public figure?
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3355.25,3357.535,If he does nothing we don't picket him.
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3358.069,3364.039,"Well, that's because if he does nothing and it's not publicized, you don't get the maximum publicity that your clients are looking for."
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3372.129,3376.596,"--I don't know in the context of a war, if I can give a definitive answer to that."
2010.09-751,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3391.606,3405.433,"What if a parent is called after the -- puts in the obituary information and called by the local newspaper and asked for a comment, and he says or she says, I'm proud of my son because he died in the service of our country."
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3408.385,3416.823,"--How -- by however you call it Justice Alito, a church or anybody has the right to answer that public comment; that is our position."
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3416.823,3416.989,"Thank you, Ms. Phelps."
2010.09-751,1,36443,margie_j_phelps,,3416.989,3417.473,Thank you.
2010.09-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3417.473,3420.025,"Mr. Summers, you have 4 minutes remaining."
2010.09-751,2,42125,sean_e_summers,,3420.025,3422.425,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-751,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3422.425,3428.797,"Mr. Summers, could I ask you to go back to an answer that you gave to one of my colleagues when you were last up there?"
2010.09-751,2,42125,sean_e_summers,,3480.063,3489.435,"Justice Kagan, I say that is a -- one, it's a much closer call, and two, I would look to the facts of the case to see if the funeral itself was disrupted."
2010.09-751,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3501.057,3515.634,"Well, suppose it is not disrupted and suppose -- and I know you that this is, that contest these facts -- that yours wasn't disrupted, that they stopped when you started, that they were a sufficient number of feet away from the funeral and so forth."
2010.09-751,2,42125,sean_e_summers,,3530.643,3534.647,I would say that's a much closer call and not the--
2010.09-751,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3534.647,3537.249,But why is it a closer call?
2010.09-751,2,42125,sean_e_summers,,3537.249,3547.605,"--It's a closer call because it's not a personal, targeted nature of the attack on the Snyder family that we have in this case."
2010.09-751,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3547.605,3558.711,"So does that mean that now we have to start reading each sign, and saying ""war is wrong"" falls on one side of the line but ""you are a war criminal"" falls on another side of the line?"
2010.09-751,2,42125,sean_e_summers,,3559.996,3566.0,"I think that, generally speaking, yes, Justice Kagan."
2010.09-751,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3586.313,3593.8,I guess that that kind of a call is always necessary under -- under the tort that you're -- that you're relying upon.
2010.09-751,2,42125,sean_e_summers,,3596.519,3597.419,--Correct.
2010.09-751,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3597.419,3607.727,"That always requires that kind of a call, unless the tort is unconstitutional, as applied to all -- all harm inflicted by words."
2010.09-751,2,42125,sean_e_summers,,3607.727,3613.88,"Correct, Justice Scalia, the element of intentional infliction of emotional distress requires outrageousness."
2010.09-751,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3613.88,3630.342,"Well, that's true, but I was assuming a situation in which a jury found that the war was wrong, that a jury did find that outrageous; and the question was were we going to reverse the jury verdict because we -- the First Amendment prohibited it?"
2010.09-751,2,42125,sean_e_summers,,3630.342,3643.9,"Again, I believe that's a closer call and I would say yes, if it's a general statement, does not disrupt the funeral, does not target the family, I would say that it's one, a much closer call, and yes, it's more likely that the Constitution is going to prevent that claim from going forward."
2010.09-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3648.471,3649.554,"Thank you, Mr. Summers."
