2018.17-8151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.84,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-8151, Bucklew versus Precythe. Mr. Hochman."
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,7.84,33.28,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Missouri intends to carry out Mr. Bucklew's lethal injection execution without informing medical members of the execution team of the well-documented and extremely uncommon medical condition that will very likely cause his execution to involve severe harm and suffering from the time they begin to gain venous access all the way through his eventual death."
2018.17-8151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,33.28,63.4,"Mr. Hochman, can you tell me the current condition of your client in light of Footnote 2 of your opening brief? And in particular but not exclusively, does he still have a trach in his throat? And if he does, doesn't that moot out certain of your claims, particularly I thought much of the prep work and dangers related to him choking on his own blood."
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,67.52,68.16,Yes.
2018.17-8151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,111.6,123.72,"So we may be -- we may be issuing a decision on -- an advisory decision because, if the trach stays, it's a totally different case than if it is removed."
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,123.72,125.88,"I don't think it's an advisory decision, Your Honor."
2018.17-8151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,157.24,159.28,How long has he had it now?
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,159.28,162.84,It was put in in June. Part of the reason he may --
2018.17-8151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,162.84,167.2,Isn't it your job to find out if it can be removed now?
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,167.2,168.88,"Well, it certainly can be removed."
2018.17-8151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,173.16,173.56,I -- I --
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,173.56,174.2,And so --
2018.17-8151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,174.2,186.52,-- I'm a little bit upset that you would come in and lodge medical records without having secured the information of whether he's physically capable of having the trach removed or not.
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,186.52,200.68,"So this is what we know about why -- I don't know whether this is the precise reason, but he is scheduled to have dental surgery for a -- for a tooth issue that, you know, because his mouth is so prone to infections."
2018.17-8151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,209.04,210.8,I really don't like suspicion.
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,210.8,211.8,-- prior to the surgery.
2018.17-8151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,211.8,258.64,"But go ahead. Assuming nothing, because I don't know what's going to happen, it appears that your Dr. Zivot was misreading the horse study, that his four-minute estimate had to do with a different study having to do with a dog and a different agent, not the agent at issue here. Given that without that study there's no basis to believe that this -- that pentobarbital would take four minutes to -- to take effect, it would likely be -- I think it was -- the figures were at maximum 52 and the average is 20 to 30 seconds."
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,267.56,267.76,So --
2018.17-8151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,267.76,269.04,-- that factual misstatement?
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,269.04,269.84,"Yes, there is, Your Honor."
2018.17-8151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,291.16,291.64,But the --
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,291.64,293.28,What you have to do is you have to look at the study.
2018.17-8151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,371.16,375.8,"That's to -- your termination point at that is when the EEG is zero, right?"
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,375.8,377.4,"That's correct, on those studies."
2018.17-8151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,377.4,380.24,"But -- but, for major surgery, they don't wait until the EEG is zero."
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,382.72,383.32,"That's right, Your Honor."
2018.17-8151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,383.32,385.6,So why are we concerned about the time to get to zero?
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,385.6,395.8,"Well, because there's no -- there's no way to measure exactly when -- there is no studies and there's no way to measure exactly when you pass through the various stages of consciousness."
2018.17-8151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,396.32,401.28,"Well, I don't know, but they're -- they -- they undertake major surgery with the EEG at a much --"
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,401.28,401.28,But --
2018.17-8151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,401.28,402.96,-- higher level here than you're talking about --
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,402.96,425.8,"But there's no -- but there's no particular reason to believe that you get -- it's -- well, first of all, that -- that -- that reading, those -- those ranges are somewhat disputed in the science, but, regardless, the point is there's no reason to believe that it takes very long to get from the level at which you're -- you're -- you're prepped for surgery, so to speak, and all the way to zero."
2018.17-8151,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,426.04,429.48,Why is that? Why is there no reason to believe that?
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,429.48,430.48,Why is there no reason to believe that?
2018.17-8151,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,430.48,430.6,Yeah.
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,430.6,433.52,"Because there's -- well, at this point, there's nothing in the record, but there's also no --"
2018.17-8151,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,433.52,434.08,"Well, there's nothing in the record --"
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,434.08,435.2,-- there's no real way to measure that.
2018.17-8151,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,435.2,436.68,-- to show one way or the other.
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,436.68,440.52,There's -- but -- and there's -- it's -- it's a difficult situation to measure for obvious reasons.
2018.17-8151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,509.6,511.84,"I'm sorry, what -- what new facts?"
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,511.84,531.12,"Well, that's the -- the -- at page 882 of the appendix, the statement from Ms. Boyles that he will lie flat, he will not lie fully supine at the time they administer the lethal drug, which I take to be strong evidence, actually."
2018.17-8151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,567.08,569.72,Is that because of the injection difficulties?
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,569.72,570.24,"Yes, right."
2018.17-8151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,570.24,577.84,"Well, does that include the femoral injection option, or are you only talking about the regular veins?"
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,577.84,579.28,We're talking about the femoral.
2018.17-8151,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,644.88,658.48,"Well, do they have a -- do they have a certified anesthesiologist available and did Dr. Antognini testify that any board certified anesthesiologist would be able -- in most instances, is able to access the femoral vein without a cut-down procedure?"
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,658.48,663.36,"Dr. Antognini did say that, but -- but the board certified anesthesiologist --"
2018.17-8151,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,663.36,664.52,Is there contrary -- is there contrary evidence?
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,664.52,674.68,"Yes, because the board certified anesthesiologist that I'm referring to who previously accessed the femoral vein via cut-down is the same person who's going to do Mr. Bucklew's execution."
2018.17-8151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,749.12,754.52,Is there another alternative to the cut-down to access the femoral vein?
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,754.52,763.72,"So -- so it may -- if we had discovery of M2 and M3, we could have a conversation with them about whether they would use an alternative, some other procedure."
2018.17-8151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,765.6,766.84,Are there any?
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,766.84,768.2,"I -- I believe there are, Your Honor."
2018.17-8151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,891.04,891.16,May I --
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,891.16,892.44,And that might -- that would have gone --
2018.17-8151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,892.44,894.24,Let me -- let me stop you right there.
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,894.24,894.84,Yeah.
2018.17-8151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,894.84,898.28,Let's assume -- and they're going to -- I'm going to ask them this directly.
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,898.28,898.92,Sure.
2018.17-8151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,898.92,935.08,"It does seem very logical that the state would give an affidavit a lot better than the one they did through Mr. Boyles that would say, no, we're not going to put him sublime, from the minute he's laid down, the gurney will have the top part raised, we've talked to the medical team, they have experience by their own requirements, they have training, education, and experience with two or three different ways to reach a femoral line. There's at least one of the two people who do. We've told them about the breathing problem."
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,958.0,966.84,"I think -- I think if the judgment were based on that kind -- on those kinds of assurances, I would probably want to add a few."
2018.17-8151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1014.36,1014.96,Could I ask --
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1014.96,1036.44,"So this has to be taken care of, thought through in advance, I think it's very complicated, and the judgment we have right now just doesn't do it for us, and I think you have to vacate and remand. What you are proposing, Justice Sotomayor, is entirely sensible and could happen on remand before the trial court, and that's where it should happen, where it should have happened before."
2018.17-8151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1036.44,1048.88,"Could I ask you to address the reasonable alternative question? I know you think it's not required in your case, but assuming that it is, how can it be a reasonable alternative if it's never been used before?"
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1048.88,1063.36,"Yeah, Your Honor, I think -- I think there are a couple reasons why that's so. First, I don't think that this Court ever said in Baze that it has to have been used before for it to be a reasonably available alternative."
2018.17-8151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1135.4,1152.68,"Well, one of the things we see often in the Eighth Amendment cases is the point or allegation that things can go wrong regardless of the method of execution. And it seems to me that if you have a method that no state has ever used, that that danger is magnified."
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1152.68,1154.32,"Possibly, Your Honor, but --"
2018.17-8151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1154.32,1158.08,And yet your claim is that this is a better -- a better alternative?
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1158.08,1163.8,"Yeah, because here's -- here's why: I mean, when you -- think about what our claim is, this as-applied claim."
2018.17-8151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1200.4,1208.88,"Well, but that gets to the point -- I mean, you understand the theory between Baze and Glossip, which is what the Eighth Amendment prohibits is the unnecessary infliction of pain."
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1230.84,1232.88,"I -- I don't think that -- I don't think that's true, Your Honor."
2018.17-8151,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1269.36,1311.28,"What do you do with the -- do I understand where we are is that the district court and the court of appeals assumed that you had shown enough to deny summary judgment to the state, you'd shown enough that this method, because of his special condition and the terrible tumors and so forth, could cause serious suffering, and now they overturned you on the second part and said: But you haven't shown that that serious suffering wouldn't occur anyway, even with your new method."
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1378.92,1379.76,I have a proposal.
2018.17-8151,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1379.76,1380.2,Yes.
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1380.2,1381.84,"Thank you, Justice Breyer, because I have a proposal."
2018.17-8151,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1450.96,1458.44,What is your basis for arguing that there would be a shorter twilight period with lethal gas?
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1458.44,1459.12,So this --
2018.17-8151,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1459.12,1462.2,Are you relying on Dr. Antognini's testimony for that?
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1462.2,1463.76,So -- no.
2018.17-8151,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1464.76,1465.64,You're not? Okay.
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1467.0,1472.8,So -- so the way I understand it is the issue is not that there would be a shorter twilight period.
2018.17-8151,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1518.52,1522.4,But you're making this very complicated.
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1533.88,1536.52,"I think it's several minutes, Your Honor."
2018.17-8151,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1537.0,1537.08,All right.
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1543.48,1545.6,"I -- no, it would be less with lethal gas."
2018.17-8151,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1545.6,1545.84,Yeah.
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1549.12,1549.44,"Well, the --"
2018.17-8151,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1549.44,1549.92,-- is what I'm asking.
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1549.92,1553.12,-- the testimony from lethal gas is twofold.
2018.17-8151,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1565.88,1568.12,So you're relying on -- on the Oklahoma study for that?
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1568.12,1570.68,The Oklahoma information and Dr. Antognini's testimony.
2018.17-8151,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1570.68,1571.04,Okay.
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1575.8,1579.88,He said it would be the same as he thought pentobarbital would produce. And that was --
2018.17-8151,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1579.88,1579.96,All right.
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1600.04,1600.44,"Yes, Your --"
2018.17-8151,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1600.44,1602.28,Even though what he said was that they are the same.
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1602.28,1602.8,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-8151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1607.8,1609.64,"Thank you, Mr. Hochman."
2018.17-8151,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1609.64,1611.96,I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.
2018.17-8151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1611.96,1613.6,Sure. Mr. Sauer.
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,1613.6,1626.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Missouri's single-drug protocol using pentobarbital is the most humane and effective method of execution that is currently known. Missouri has used it 20 times without any significant incident."
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1628.84,1633.8,How many people have had the same condition as Mr. Bucklew?
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,1633.8,1634.36,"Zero, Your Honor."
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1635.04,1635.16,All right.
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,1642.24,1643.52,Absolutely not.
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1643.52,1648.52,You don't deny that he has a small tumor but a tumor in his throat?
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,1648.52,1650.04,"The evidence is it's quite sizable, in fact."
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1650.04,1650.76,All right.
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,1701.8,1702.68,"Correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1702.68,1716.32,So why haven't you represented that you're going to take the basic steps necessary to avoid the horrific circumstances that your adversary says can and will happen?
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,1716.32,1721.68,"We vigorously dispute that horrific circumstances will arise, but I believe we have made those representations."
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1721.68,1724.76,How do you -- why do you dispute that?
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,1724.76,1731.36,Because there's -- every -- every stage -- every stage of the predictions that are made by the Petitioner is contradicted by evidence in the record.
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1731.36,1732.0,All right.
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,1732.0,1735.68,I -- I do want to address the question about what representations we have made.
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1765.24,1766.6,But that -- I'm hard pressed.
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,1787.84,1788.6,I disagree with that.
2018.17-8151,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1825.08,1825.68,Do we know --
2018.17-8151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1825.68,1860.2,"That seems to be -- what do you recommend that we do? I mean, the difficulty with the discussion to me that you're having right now is a legal difficulty, that -- that you have the district judge and the court of appeals both assuming he's made his case on this point for summary judgment purposes. And -- and you may be right, he hasn't, but it's unusual for us to go into a record like this, I think, and then reverse both courts on that. So then we're stuck with the other part of it, which we don't know all that about -- much about."
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,1903.48,1915.04,"I would say two things in response to that, Justice Breyer. First, the State of Missouri has a compelling interest in seeing this just and lawful sentence is carried out as quickly as possible."
2018.17-8151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1970.96,1971.48,It could.
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2014.36,2022.04,"Absolutely, Your Honor. What I would say is that it is -- the holding of Baze could not be clearer -- that if it's completely untested and untried, it is not --"
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2022.04,2022.88,I'm sorry.
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2137.32,2138.68,I don't --
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2138.68,2155.16,"Secondly, address the question of why feasibility -- there are some courts who have now held the only feasible alternative is an alternative mentioned in a state statute, so now we're in a Hobbesian circle."
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2193.88,2209.8,"There was a lot there. I'd like to address first, if I may, the question of whether -- why the second element in Baze should apply in an as-applied challenge, and I'd offer four reasons for the Court's consideration. The first reason is that it is dictated by the holding and the reasoning of the Baze case."
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2249.48,2257.4,"We exempt certain people from the death penalty: the mentally ill, the incompetent, people who are young."
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2272.28,2281.76,"In all or virtually all of those contexts, the person who is exempted from the death penalty possesses a characteristic that undermines the penological objectives of the death penalty."
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2286.76,2287.72,How about the constitutional --
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2287.72,2289.84,This Court held that there would be no deterrence or retributive purpose to that.
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2289.84,2300.16,How about the constitutional principle against unusual -- cruel and unusual punishment? I -- I think every individual has that Eighth Amendment right.
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2300.16,2300.8,That is correct.
2018.17-8151,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2304.88,2313.04,"Are you saying, even if the method creates gruesome and brutal pain, you can still do it because there's no alternative?"
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2313.04,2322.56,"I believe that any petitioner who is claiming that it would create gruesome and brutal pain must, under Baze and Glossip, offer an alternative method that significantly reduces the pain."
2018.17-8151,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2322.56,2327.28,"So you're saying that even if the method imposes gruesome, brutal pain --"
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2327.28,2328.8,That is --
2018.17-8151,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2328.8,2330.76,-- you can still go forward?
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2330.76,2333.32,"Well, I would say again that that petitioner has to if they want to --"
2018.17-8151,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2333.32,2334.2,Is that a yes?
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2334.2,2336.96,"Yes, it is, Your Honor. And that is the holding of Glossip."
2018.17-8151,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2348.92,2352.56,Is there any limit on that? Is there any limit to the degree of --
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2352.56,2354.04,"There is a limit, Your Honor."
2018.17-8151,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2407.56,2423.24,"But doesn't the first prong deal with that? Namely, that you have to have a substantial showing of severe pain? Doesn't that get at the concern you just identified, which is there's always going to be some degree, but it has to be a substantial risk of severe pain?"
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2423.24,2424.52,I don't think it gets all the way to it.
2018.17-8151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2432.36,2449.56,"I thought -- I'm trying to get back to my question, which is asking you as a prosecutor, but, look, I guess you would agree that some -- X has a rare medical condition that makes the method of execution to him feel exactly like being burned at the stake."
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2454.08,2457.16,"The Constitution would rule out burning at the stake, absolutely, Your Honor."
2018.17-8151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2457.16,2459.76,"And -- but, yeah, he doesn't -- he has a mental condition of some kind."
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2461.92,2462.6,That is --
2018.17-8151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2462.6,2464.28,It feels exactly the same.
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2464.28,2466.52,I would have to know more about the hypothetical.
2018.17-8151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2466.52,2466.8,"Well, that's it."
2018.17-8151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2468.48,2474.44,Okay? But what I want is -- it's exactly the same to him as if you burned him at the stake.
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2548.96,2556.32,"If I may, Your Honor, I understand the question to be if -- if there is an exceptional delay before the implementation of the death penalty, does that raise a question as to whether or not the passage of --"
2018.17-8151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2556.32,2557.92,"No, I'm not doing it that technically."
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2587.08,2587.48,It --
2018.17-8151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2587.48,2589.96,So -- so what is your take on that?
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2589.96,2590.04,If this --
2018.17-8151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2590.04,2591.76,My general argument.
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2591.76,2601.72,"If this Petitioner were to predict that he would experience a sensation like burning at the stake, he would be the third petitioner or the third set of petitioners in the last 10 years to make that prediction."
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2654.2,2667.4,"That may well be, but the reality is that there are alternatives. Many of them have not been implemented because people want -- don't want to see them: the firing squad, electrocution."
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2701.36,2737.76,"I believe statutory authorization alone is insufficient to demonstrate that something is readily implemented or known and available within the meaning of Baze. Now, if there were a petitioner -- some capital petitioners, for example, in Ohio have been pleading things like firing squad and hanging as alternative methods of execution. Where there is historical pedigree to it, this Court has previously affirmed that that is a viable method of execution that is constitutional. There is a dispute in the courts of appeals about whether or not statutory authorization is a necessary condition to show that things are readily available, but right now, in the Eighth Circuit, statutory authorization is not required."
2018.17-8151,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2753.08,2765.48,"So are you saying, Mr. Sauer, that we would be in a different situation in this case right now if the Petitioner had instead requested an electrocution or a firing squad?"
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2765.48,2768.2,It would certainly have been a stronger case.
2018.17-8151,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2790.88,2791.16,General --
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2791.16,2791.96,And Missouri takes no position on that now.
2018.17-8151,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2791.96,2844.36,"May I ask a -- a different question? You know, one of the things that strike me -- strikes me, when I went back and -- and looked at Baze, there's a lot about kind of deference to a state legislature and state officials about determining the appropriate method of execution, about giving a kind of considered judgment to the sort of pain that would be expected from an execution, as well as their interests in carrying out legitimate sentences and making decisions on that basis. But what strikes me is that when we think about that, those officials really are thinking in gross, if you know what I mean. They're thinking about a method of execution as applied to the general class of people and deciding that it's appropriate. And what, of course, makes this case very different is that it's not in gross."
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2888.52,2913.92,"I think what I would say to that is the deference that Baze and Glossip, as you described, gave to sort of the legislature, you know, as to the generalized method of execution, it would be appropriate. It would be deeply consistent with this Court's precedents to give that same kind of deference to the state officials who are implementing the -- the execution in the concrete, in this individual case. Missouri has a board-certified anesthesiologist who will be in charge of putting IVs into this particular person."
2018.17-8151,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2913.92,2918.28,"See, I'm not sure that that's true, because those officials are working within a system."
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2946.72,2960.44,"I think the deference that I had in mind is deference to the determinations that are made on the site as the execution is going forward, where there's uncontradicted evidence in the record in this case that the -- the medical team is making all the medically relevant judgments."
2018.17-8151,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2960.44,2969.52,"On -- on -- on that point, do we know that he will not be lying flat, or are you saying that doesn't matter?"
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,2969.52,2970.48,Both of those.
2018.17-8151,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2992.44,3002.52,"And related to that, the -- your opposing counsel said, even if everything goes according to plan, there will still be significant suffering. Can you respond to that?"
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,3002.52,3004.64,"I absolutely, absolutely disagree with that."
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3073.36,3096.04,"I'm sorry, there was a prior execution where a cut-down was done by, he says, the same person who's going to do this one, and there was problems then. Why isn't it a predictive -- a reliable predictive tool to show that the same person who's going to do it now botched it earlier?"
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,3096.04,3098.2,There is no evidence of problems.
2018.17-8151,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3118.88,3129.96,"Mr. Sauer, I believe some time ago you said there were four reasons why you thought at step 2 a defendant should be required to show an alternative."
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,3139.0,3157.84,"The first reason is that the logic and the holding of Baze and Glossip requires -- it holds that this is a substantive element of any method of execution challenge. The second one is that, as Baze and Glossip both said, the death penalty is constitutional and there must be a means of carrying it out."
2018.17-8151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3231.48,3232.16,You better get to three quickly.
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,3232.16,3233.48,"That was three, Your Honor."
2018.17-8151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3233.48,3234.16,That was three?
2018.17-8151,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3234.16,3235.16,I'm waiting for four still.
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,3235.16,3247.76,"And number four, of course, is the risk, as we have discussed, that there is a risk of interminable litigation. And, Justice Gorsuch, I would direct your attention to the way that the alternative method was pled and proven in this particular case."
2018.17-8151,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3263.96,3272.0,"Wouldn't the first prong of Baze deal with your second, third, and fourth arguments that you just listed?"
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,3272.0,3273.24,I don't think it deals with them very effectively.
2018.17-8151,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3273.24,3276.72,"If properly applied, in other words, substantial risk of severe harm."
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,3276.72,3279.48,I don't think it does so effectively.
2018.17-8151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3291.04,3293.52,"Challenge after challenge, that's -- I see that."
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,3311.96,3312.24,This Court --
2018.17-8151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3312.24,3331.12,"And if he has the right to make that argument, then how do we avoid the situation that we're in of having to decide it? And if he has the right to make the argument, that I want this alternative, how do we avoid the situation of 15 years of testing every possible method of execution?"
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,3331.12,3332.72,I would say two things in response to that.
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3404.8,3414.12,"Can we define -- can you define foreseeability -- or feasibility, I'm sorry? Does the statute have to authorize it for it to be feasible?"
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,3414.12,3414.64,Missouri --
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3414.64,3421.16,Does any statute in a particular state have to authorize the method you choose?
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,3421.16,3423.32,Missouri has never taken a position on that question.
2018.17-8151,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3423.32,3424.24,Take it now.
2018.17-8151,1,63054,d_john_sauer,,3424.24,3428.92,I -- I -- I do -- I do not believe I'm compelled to do so by the way the record is presented.
2018.17-8151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3434.64,3437.76,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Hochman."
2018.17-8151,2,39470,robert_n_hochman,,3437.76,3440.8,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2018.17-8151,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3573.8,3602.88,"Doesn't the -- isn't the role of the second prong at least in part, and maybe in full, what has been called by the lower courts as the second prong, something that informs the first prong? So you determine whether something is severe and substantial in relation to other known methods of execution on the assumption that any execution can cause pain. Certainly, it's going to cause a lot of emotional pain that's probably going to exceed the physical pain."
2018.17-8151,2,39470,robert_n_hochman,,3602.88,3614.0,"I think that's true when you're talking about a facial challenge because, remember, in a facial challenge, you're trying to figure out, as this Court said, all methods of execution involve some degree of pain and suffering."
2018.17-8151,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3631.32,3655.04,"But why -- why -- why wouldn't we want to do the comparison, if we're going to do it in gross on a facial challenge, why wouldn't we do the comparison, if you concede it's valid there, why wouldn't we want to do the same comparison specifically when it comes to your client? Perhaps we have to look outside what Missouri has authorized, but -- a firing squad or whatever, but why wouldn't we do that exact same analysis in specific?"
2018.17-8151,2,39470,robert_n_hochman,,3655.04,3655.8,May -- may I answer?
2018.17-8151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3655.8,3655.96,Yes.
2018.17-8151,2,39470,robert_n_hochman,,3655.96,3671.08,"Because -- because, Your Honor, the -- the issue in Baze and Glossip was a concern, you have prior rulings of this Court that make clear that the Constitution, in general, does not define death, the death penalty, as cruel."
2018.17-8151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3680.0,3681.32,"Thank you, counsel."
