1985.84-1288,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.935,"We will hear arguments next in Evans against Jeff D., et al.--"
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,82.327,101.163,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, may it please the Court, I am here today to ask the Court's assistance in restoring a valuable bargaining procedure for both plaintiffs and defendants, a procedure which has been effectively denied to civil rights litigants in the Ninth Circuit by the lower court's decision."
1985.84-1288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.398,267.142,"General Jones, do you read the Ninth Circuit's opinion as being limited to class action situations where Rule 23 would apply?"
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,267.142,276.67,"Justice Rehnquist, I read it as being applicable to all situations, not only class action cases but all situations."
1985.84-1288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,276.67,283.666,What is the authority of the District Court to supervise the settlement of something that isn't a class action?
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,283.666,295.287,"Well, under Rule 16, the judge or the parties can talk about settlement, pretrial conferences."
1985.84-1288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,308.0,310.014,I am sure it could be brought to the attention of the District Court.
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,334.037,335.537,"I wouldn't think so, Your Honor."
1985.84-1288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,370.961,387.282,"General Jones, in the class action setting which I guess this was, is it your position that you could ethically have offered the respondents complete relief on the merits of all their claims?"
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,401.979,404.962,"--Justice O'Connor, I think it certainly would have been ethical."
1985.84-1288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,437.903,454.005,Would the situation be any different in your view if there had been an assignment agreement by the plaintiffs below to their attorney assigning any and all rights to attorneys' fees under Section 1988 to the attorneys?
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,454.005,463.501,"--I don't think it should make difference on the outcome of this case, because that is a matter between the client and the attorney."
1985.84-1288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,465.656,473.264,Does it alter the ethical considerations at all in the propriety of making an offer of settlement?
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,473.264,480.494,"--As between the parties, see that it alters the ethical arrangements at all."
1985.84-1288,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,501.235,521.431,"Mr. Attorney General, you said earlier that if there are no ethical considerations, then the Court shouldn't get into it, but except as you now suggest that the bar association might get into i later, how else would the ethical factors be flushed out?"
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,540.595,560.258,"Well, Your Honor, I think that there has to be an inquiry to make sure in the settlement conference that the plaintiff class is not being put upon, that is, this is not some kind of a sweetheart deal, that they are being shortchanged on their relief at the gain of the lawyers."
1985.84-1288,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,587.483,599.994,"Would you think the situation would be any different if the class was made up entirely of minors under the age of... whatever the age was of the particular state, 18 or 21?"
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,609.02,619.204,--I think to an extent you have got to have a little greater review and make sure the settlement is being fair to the class as the trial judge did here.
1985.84-1288,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,644.803,654.566,"You are not challenging, then, the idea that the trial judge who is supervising the whole situation can appropriately inquire into the fee?"
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,655.97,657.47,"--No, I don't question that."
1985.84-1288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,670.747,674.089,And the looking into would be for the benefit of the class.
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,674.089,678.291,"Yes, to do like the trial judge did here and say, yes, this is fair to the class."
1985.84-1288,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,691.878,697.407,"In a rate case, for example, there have been class actions involving utility rates."
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,723.912,734.096,"I see nothing wrong with the Court looking at that and saying, well, it is justifiable, we will approve the settlement, but that is not what happened in this case."
1985.84-1288,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,857.875,865.356,Do you think our recent holding on the Rule 68 case has any impact on this situation at all?
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,865.356,884.427,"Certainly, Your Honor, the whole underpinnings of the Court's decision was that there was some special rule that applied in civil rights cases which allowed the judge to enter an order that says, well, you don't negotiate the fee portion along with the merits portion."
1985.84-1288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,961.052,987.089,"Mr. Jones, in this case injunctive relief was sought, but if damages were sought in a class action, and the plaintiffs entered into a contingent fee agreement with their attorney, would it be appropriate for the defendants to propose settlement contingent upon giving up the contingency fee?"
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,987.089,993.241,"They could probably propose that, Your Honor, but--"
1985.84-1288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,993.241,994.787,You think that is ethical?
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,994.787,996.974,--I suppose it is--
1985.84-1288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,996.974,1000.879,No interference with contractual relations or anything of that kind?
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,1000.879,1007.361,"--I think they could propose it, but they certainly are not in a position to compel the other side to accept it."
1985.84-1288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1014.171,1020.746,How does that differ from the assignment at the outset of any right to attorneys' fees under Section 1988?
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,1020.746,1034.928,"--Well, I think again there is a difference because the other side is intruding into the arrangement between counsel and the party, and I think--"
1985.84-1288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1034.928,1039.832,Could the same be said if there were a contractual assignment ahead of time of any attorneys' fees rights?
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,1039.832,1052.92,"--Well, the other side, the defendant is not attempting to become involved in the relations between the client and the party."
1985.84-1288,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1091.875,1131.389,"Mr. Jones, in the typical contingent fee case where the plaintiff's lawyer has taken the case on a contingency, and his fee is going to depend on how much he recovers, I suppose that he can... the defendant could surely propose a settlement to him, say we will pay you client X dollars, and if that is X dollars whereas the attorney thinks that he will make more money if it is 2X, he may turn it down."
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,1141.589,1141.478,Certainly.
1985.84-1288,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1158.534,1165.093,"Mr. Attorney General, something you said there, if there isn't enough to go around."
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,1178.573,1194.83,"The problem is always there, and they have always got to work it out between themselves, but if we get the Ninth Circuit and everybody else involved in the process, it is going to bog the courts down to a point where we won't be able to get these cases moving through the courts."
1985.84-1288,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1194.83,1206.218,"Well, in Merrick against Chesny, for example, our Rule 68 case, if the Ninth Circuit rule applied there, would you say there might not have been a settlement?"
1985.84-1288,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,1210.013,1211.059,That is very likely the case.
1985.84-1288,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1281.078,1283.498,"Thank you, Mr. Attorney General."
1985.84-1288,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1297.088,1324.654,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require judicial approval of a settlement in a class action, but that has generally been regarded as protective of the members of the class rather than protective attorneys' fees for counsel of the class."
1985.84-1288,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1504.003,1514.843,"Rule 68 pushes the ethical problem to the extent that there is one right onto the plaintiff and his lawyers, does it not?"
1985.84-1288,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1514.843,1518.389,"That is our position, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1288,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1602.527,1622.377,"Mr. Wallace, do you suggest that Rule 23 in class actions offers no source of authority for the Court to make any inquiry under any circumstances and to the appropriateness of the fee waiver proposal in the settlement?"
1985.84-1288,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1622.377,1625.969,"We don't go that far, Your Honor."
1985.84-1288,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1674.356,1697.721,"Do you think the circumstances in this case would be sufficient to at least enable the District Court to look at it where it is made on the eve of trial, and only injunctive relief was sought, and the relief granted was substantial in the settlement."
1985.84-1288,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1710.467,1714.856,"--Well, I hate to say no."
1985.84-1288,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1883.443,1893.378,"Mr. Wallace, before you sit down, counsel for the respondent contends there is only one question properly before the Court, and that is the waiver question."
1985.84-1288,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1901.233,1912.931,"Well, I thought the Ninth Circuit rested its decision on the impropriety of simultaneous negotiation in this case."
1985.84-1288,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1912.931,1915.369,Have you looked at respondent's brief?
1985.84-1288,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1916.541,1917.385,Yes.
1985.84-1288,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1924.272,1928.786,"It is a very good brief, but doesn't it make the point that only the waiver issue is here?"
1985.84-1288,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1928.786,1942.514,"As they argue their case, but they are defending a judgment which addressed it on the proposition that only in rare circumstances would simultaneous negotiation be permissible."
1985.84-1288,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1942.514,1945.951,"May I ask you one question, too, Mr. Wallace?"
1985.84-1288,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1973.393,1980.342,The circumstances in our view would have to be much more aggravated than is shown or alleged here.
1985.84-1288,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1980.342,1981.326,Assuming they are quite aggravated.
1985.84-1288,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1981.326,1999.678,"Well, the hypothetical that I suggested would be a vindictive effort to try to deny legal representation for this class of persons in the future by giving them an offer they can't refuse in this case contingent on a waiver in order to teach the attorneys a lesson."
1985.84-1288,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2001.209,2005.832,"But short of that, you say there is never discretion to disapprove a settlement."
1985.84-1288,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2005.832,2008.55,"--I don't see a source of it, Mr. Justice."
1985.84-1288,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2008.55,2016.422,"Your response would mean that if the Court thought the fee was grossly exorbitant, the Court would have a function then also?"
1985.84-1288,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2016.422,2026.651,"Well, under Rule 23 it would have a concern with whether the attorney was favoring himself as against members of the class."
1985.84-1288,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2026.651,2034.367,Mr. Coleman.
1985.84-1288,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2034.367,2082.801,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the basic issue here is whether Idaho's settlement offer made just seven days before trial which on the merits gave plaintiffs everything they had asked for but demanded that they waive all counsel fees, created an inappropriate ethical situation for plaintiff's counsel and contravened the very purpose of the Civil Rights Act with respect to fees of 1976, which was to provide fees to available plaintiffs to encourage private counsel to represent individuals seeking to vindicate constitutional rights."
1985.84-1288,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2082.801,2083.722,Mr. Coleman--
1985.84-1288,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2083.722,2084.301,"Now, we have been--"
1985.84-1288,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2084.301,2098.67,"--Mr. Coleman, I take it that what you are saying would be just as true of an action brought under the Farmers and Packers and Stockyards Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, where Congress has provided for attorneys' fees."
1985.84-1288,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2098.67,2100.762,"I would have to look at the Acts, Your Honor."
1985.84-1288,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2117.411,2124.956,"Well, your brief, your response brief doesn't cite Merrick against Chesny, which we decided last June."
1985.84-1288,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2138.919,2199.629,"That is true, but I hope you would agree that if the state here had acted under Merrick and under Rule 68, filed this proposal as the judgment and said no counsel fees, I think you, Justice Powell, certainly in your concurring opinion in... in a case, the Delta Airline case, and you, Your Honor, would say that an offer made in a civil rights case where all the defendant offered was an injunction, that that would be an inappropriate offer under Rule 68, and would not bring Rule 68, and you, Mr. Justice Powell, said that under those circumstances the Court, if it accepted the judgment, would thereafter impose a regional counsel."
1985.84-1288,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2199.629,2203.08,I repudiated in Merrick my statement in Delta.
1985.84-1288,4,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2203.08,2208.266,"--Justice Powell, I think, has not repudiated it, and I think that is clear."
1985.84-1288,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2354.831,2356.643,"Can I interrupt you with a question, Mr. Coleman?"
1985.84-1288,4,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2387.802,2390.16,"--That didn't happen in this case, Your Honor."
1985.84-1288,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2390.16,2392.44,"Well, I know, but I mean that is the kind of problem it seems to me we have to think about."
1985.84-1288,4,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2392.44,2407.529,"Well, what would happen would be that there would be negotiations, and if it is a fact that the state after three months of trial finally realizes since the day the complaint was filed they were violating the constitution--"
1985.84-1288,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2407.529,2411.574,"I am saying three months after a complaint is filed, they study it, and they say, we think the best thing to do--"
1985.84-1288,4,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2411.574,2414.057,"--Well, I think the facts of this case are very interesting."
1985.84-1288,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2451.152,2458.242,--But why wasn't the same ethical problem presented to the plaintiff lawyer at the first settlement proposal by the educational defendant?
1985.84-1288,4,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2458.242,2461.273,"Well, that is... no you have put your finger on it, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1985.84-1288,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2514.378,2521.765,"Mr. Coleman, to what extent can the state bar associations regulate this problem as a matter of ethics?"
1985.84-1288,4,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2536.259,2552.909,"Well, Justice O'Connor, the problem is that that does not take care of the part of the case where Congress by statute has said if you successfully settle the case you are entitled to a counsel fee."
1985.84-1288,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2556.032,2561.39,"Well, but, of course, Merrick versus Chesny rather undercuts that argument, doesn't it?"
1985.84-1288,4,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2561.39,2563.389,"--I would disagree, Your Honor."
1985.84-1288,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2606.918,2611.072,The defendant's offer in Merrick against Chesny was not the way you just hypothesized it.
1985.84-1288,4,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2619.881,2644.465,"--And the court below found that with respect to that, that what they got in... what... after suit was $50,000, and that the counsel fees incurred prior to the time that the offer was made was only $32,000, so therefore by arithmetic $82,000 is less than $100,000."
1985.84-1288,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2667.815,2679.28,"There have been several suggestions, including some of our questions from the bench, that this is a matter for the organized bar to deal with, but how does it get to the organized bar?"
1985.84-1288,5,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2679.28,2694.023,"Well, it so happened... well, it would get to it... it so happens that the three organized bars that have looked at the situation have all said that is inappropriate in this type of case for the defendant to make that type of offer."
1985.84-1288,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2694.023,2707.892,I am not talking about the generality but the specific... some party must bring the particular case to the attention of the bar association if there is to be an evaluation of the appropriateness of the particular case.
1985.84-1288,6,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2708.502,2711.673,"Oh, yes, but what has happened, Your Honor, this has come up."
1985.84-1288,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2809.541,2816.132,"Mr. Coleman, before you go on, the Court of Appeals did not adopt a per se rule."
1985.84-1288,6,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2817.24,2817.678,--That's right.
1985.84-1288,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2817.678,2831.655,--But it went on to say that the rule in the Ninth Circuit was that there must be a showing of unusual circumstances and then proceeded to find that there were no such unusual circumstances in this case.
1985.84-1288,6,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2831.655,2841.573,"And they also cite a case where they approved of the fee, even though it had been negotiated simultaneously."
1985.84-1288,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2841.573,2845.698,"Do you think that would be a proper rule, that there had to be a showing of unusual circumstances?"
1985.84-1288,6,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2845.698,2845.885,No.
1985.84-1288,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2858.847,2862.814,"But you might have to, Mr. Coleman, if that issue also is here."
1985.84-1288,6,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2862.814,2890.913,"Well, if that is the second... if you want to decide the case on two issues, then I will have to go to bat, and I would certainly say I would urge you to reread the briefs of the Legal Defense Fund, the Bar Association of New York, and the other associations that are involved in this type of litigation, and they will tell you that what is happening today is creating havoc among those that are supposed to be representing in these cases, and that this is the point."
1985.84-1288,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2903.001,2907.109,"Well, Mr. Coleman, you say the simultaneous negotiation isn't here."
1985.84-1288,6,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2916.028,2924.868,"Actually, it was the original... under these circumstances, after two and a half years of litigation, this type of proposal, but even--"
1985.84-1288,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2924.868,2925.852,Which is to waive your fees.
1985.84-1288,6,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2925.852,2927.71,"--Not quite, Your Honor."
1985.84-1288,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2961.166,2973.347,"But you don't... I take it you don't contend that the defendant's lawyer should not say to a plaintiff's lawyer I want to make you an offer of settlement on the merits, and also on your attorney's fees."
1985.84-1288,6,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2973.347,2985.17,"I would say that... he could say that and he could say how many hours have you spent, what is your hourly rate, and he did not make any... this is... you give it all up."
1985.84-1288,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3009.49,3039.993,"Well, suppose the defendant's lawyer says here is an offer on the merits and here is an offer of your attorney's fees, and they negotiate back and forth, and the plaintiff's lawyer finally agrees on both, and then the settlement is approved, except that the plaintiff's lawyer then says it was unfair, it was unfair, it put me in a bad spot, and I think I should have an additional award of fees."
1985.84-1288,6,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3039.993,3041.399,"Well, that is not this case, Your Honor."
1985.84-1288,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3044.039,3044.945,How about my case--
1985.84-1288,6,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3044.945,3047.833,"--And, Justice O'Connor, I read... because this is a class action."
1985.84-1288,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3070.7,3080.211,"--But what if the plaintiff's lawyer says, look, judge, go ahead and approve the settlement on the merits, but I think I am entitled to a hearing on what a reasonable fee would be?"
1985.84-1288,6,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3080.211,3097.455,"We think under the 1976 statute and under the class action rules, Rule 23, at that point the federal district judge has the responsibility of setting a reasonable fee."
1985.84-1288,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3097.455,3103.373,So the fact that the plaintiff signed the settlement on his fee should not bar the judge from setting another fee.
1985.84-1288,6,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3103.373,3118.538,"I think the judge clearly has a duty to look at it, and the judge certainly would take into consideration that what... the amount suggested, but after two and a half years of litigation--"
1985.84-1288,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3118.538,3119.257,It is more than suggested.
1985.84-1288,6,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3120.772,3133.502,"--Yes, it is what they agreed to, that he would consider that as one of the factors, and particularly when you consider it, as I understand the cases, when, if it is too much, the judge has a duty to adjust it downward."
1985.84-1288,6,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3133.502,3145.417,"Then a defendant in a case subject to the 1976 Act, if he wants to concede a single issue on the merits, is bound to pay some attorneys' fees."
1985.84-1288,6,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3145.871,3150.854,"Well, the 1976 Act says--"
