2003.02-954,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.371,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-954, the Office of Independent Counsel v. Allan J. Favish."
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,10.857,13.846,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-954,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,101.591,108.112,Must there be identifiable family members to suffer this invasion of privacy?
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,114.799,121.652,"No, the... the practice of the Federal Government is that we need to identify the existence of a survivor."
2003.02-954,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,162.725,177.38,"And if you're so unfortunate as not to have survivors, or to have survivors who don't like you, the most embarrassing and gory photographs of your body can be released?"
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,177.38,182.21,"Well, Justice Scalia, that has been the practice after the Outlaw decision of the Federal Government."
2003.02-954,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,223.283,225.141,But only on the assumption that there are survivors?
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,225.141,227.991,"--On the assumption that there... a reasonable... obviously, a reasonable assumption--"
2003.02-954,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.991,228.817,I don't know why that's necessary.
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,237.295,247.432,"--For the most part, courts have said that privacy dies with the individual, but again, the problem in this case is the Ninth Circuit didn't think we were withholding too little."
2003.02-954,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,260.313,286.441,"Before we get to that though, on the question that was asked, if there are no survivors, given that the main rule of FOIA is disclosed, unless you fall under an exemption, and exemptions are to be narrowly construed, I don't think the... the Government could suppose, could hypothesize an interest that may or may not have existed in the decedent when there are no survivors."
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,286.441,310.962,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, that has been the Government's practice, is to identify a survivor, but again, I think our position is, because the nature of our world has changed and we now have to deal with situations involving mass deaths, that we aren't going to insist when you have a large collection of remains and we know that for some percentage of those there... there are survivors, that withholding would still be permissible."
2003.02-954,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,310.962,319.961,But why is that any less of a leap than saying the deceased... the deceased's privacy is being invaded?
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,347.825,375.689,"Well, Justice Scalia, the common law... a number of common law courts did, and they did... and we cite... one of the very first common law courts ever to recognize the right to privacy, in 1895, the Schuler v. Curtis case, which is cited in our reply brief, found exactly a privacy interest in the survivors, and it said it is not the privacy interest of the deceased, because under the common law tradition, privacy dies with the individual."
2003.02-954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,416.685,424.737,"Well, I guess we're, in this case, asked to apply FOIA's exemption 7(C) to interpret it anyway."
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,424.737,425.124,Yes.
2003.02-954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,425.124,425.601,Right?
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,425.601,425.951,Yes.
2003.02-954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,425.951,427.421,So that's what we're focused on.
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,427.421,427.914,Yes.
2003.02-954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,427.914,429.854,And what do you propose as the test?
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,429.854,454.746,"The test... the test is, as this Court has... to decide whether a... a invasion of privacy is clearly unwarranted, you have to weigh and balance the intrusion on privacy against the extent to which the information disclosed would, in this Court's Reporters Committees decision, contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Federal Government."
2003.02-954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,473.156,483.353,Is that the test that the CADC used in the Accuracy in Media case involving these same photos?
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,483.353,485.228,They used a... the same balancing.
2003.02-954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,486.159,492.558,"So whatever you're proposing, you think the CADC correctly employed in that case?"
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,492.558,499.124,"--The... there... with... with one qualification, which I don't think is a distinction... don't think it's a distinction that makes a difference."
2003.02-954,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,534.623,536.769,I'm... I'm... I'm glad you backed off from compelling evidence.
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,552.084,553.654,That may... that may well be.
2003.02-954,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,571.448,580.198,"But are the... does the term compelling interest refer to the allegations that the person seeking the photographs makes, or the evidence he has supporting his position?"
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,580.198,583.376,--It has to be the... the evidence of governmental misconduct.
2003.02-954,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,584.49,586.802,Independently of what the... the photographs themselves would show?
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,586.802,598.608,"--That... I mean, that presumably will not be the evidence, right, you can't just come say that... that would be sort of boot-strapping to say that the evidence is the... I have to see that so that I will have my evidence of your governmental misconduct, which essentially--"
2003.02-954,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,598.608,601.291,"Okay, tell me again what... what the test is as you... you understand it."
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,601.291,607.169,--The... the test... you mean with respect to unsubstantiated allegations of governmental misconduct?
2003.02-954,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,607.169,607.69,Yes.
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,607.69,626.638,"That is that the FOIA requester must come forward with clear evidence of governmental misconduct on their own, independent evidence on their own, to have a cognizable public interest to weigh against the intrusion on privacy that has occurred in this case."
2003.02-954,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,640.59,661.273,"Does the Government... does the Government... as I understand FOIA, the Government has the burden of proof, the Government presents an exemption and it is the Government's burden to show that the exemption applies, not the requester, because going in, am I right to say, the requester can ask for this information for any reason or no reason?"
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,661.273,668.453,"That... that's... with respect... until an exemption is triggered, there's no need to have any reason for your FOIA."
2003.02-954,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,671.22,678.279,"So what is the Government's burden that it has, at least the initial burden is on the Government to show what?"
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,678.279,682.943,--The... the initial burden on the Government is once an exemption... we have to show that an exemption is triggered.
2003.02-954,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,688.022,694.975,"Now, after you point to which number, 7, you point to 7(C) and that... that... the burden must be more than just, say--"
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,694.975,697.37,"--No, that... that's right, in fact, we get the written steps."
2003.02-954,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,751.157,756.442,"--Ms. Millett, you... you... you say that you have to show clear evidence of... have clear evidence of government misconduct."
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,783.562,789.523,"--Justice Scalia, first of all, I don't think there's any evidence of negligence or sloppiness here, but if we adopt that--"
2003.02-954,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,789.523,789.712,"All right, well, we... we'll get to that, I assume, right?"
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,790.083,803.996,"--If we adopt that characterization, the fact that someone cannot... can identify something more that they should have been done, or the fact that... that they disagree with the ultimate result, is not governmental misconduct."
2003.02-954,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,817.387,817.742,Willful?
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,818.025,818.94,--I'm sorry?
2003.02-954,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.94,819.6,Has to be willful?
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,824.058,828.311,"I don't... I... I don't think... well, if... if they've got evidence of a sloppy job, then FOIA has already worked."
2003.02-954,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,838.713,839.169,Okay.
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,869.384,871.946,"Well, Justice Souter, let me be very clear."
2003.02-954,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,878.262,893.577,"Right, but if misconduct... my... the reason I'm raising the question is, if misconduct does not have to be shown, I suppose that would have a bearing on the degree of misconduct in a case like this that would... that would suffice."
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,893.577,899.438,"--Well, a public interest has to be identified at some point, and the problem with this case is, or the problem--"
2003.02-954,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,899.438,900.719,"No, but what about my question for a minute?"
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,900.719,901.09,--Right.
2003.02-954,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,901.09,906.869,"Why is... why is it an illegitimate public interest for somebody to come along and say, I want to make the Government look good."
2003.02-954,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,918.28,930.441,"Well, I think that... that... that is sort of nothing more than... than a desire to show what the Government did in this investigation, transparency in government interest, which is the point of FOIA."
2003.02-954,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,974.364,975.683,"Very well, Ms. Millett."
2003.02-954,1,30691,james_hamilton,,978.079,995.54,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-954,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1103.114,1105.61,"Mr. Hamilton, assume we agree with you on all of that."
2003.02-954,1,30691,james_hamilton,,1128.106,1133.662,"Well, Justice Scalia, we think that there is no public interest on the other side."
2003.02-954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1190.421,1206.563,"Yes, but it seems to me that the... arguably, the interest in disclosure might not challenge the ultimate conclusion, but rather they might contend... want to show that one of the team of investigators was totally incompetent, and it was necessary to have three or four other investigations to reach the correct result."
2003.02-954,1,30691,james_hamilton,,1215.951,1228.77,"--Well, Justice Stevens, the... 7(C) requires a balancing, and when you have this balance, you have to weigh whatever the public interest is against the privacy interest."
2003.02-954,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1251.889,1273.065,"Well, let... let's take a particular item of evidence, I mean, like the... the autopsy report that Mr. Favish claims was... was... was altered, that the word neck was white... whitened out and head was written in instead to... to cover the fact that the bullet exited the neck rather than the head."
2003.02-954,1,30691,james_hamilton,,1297.586,1308.853,"--Well, I think the first response I would make is that it is a difficult argument to make that Judge Starr conspired with members of the Clinton administration to protect that administration."
2003.02-954,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1340.31,1341.275,He might have been protecting Newt Gingrich.
2003.02-954,1,30691,james_hamilton,,1342.455,1344.685,--I... I beg your pardon?
2003.02-954,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1344.685,1347.202,Mr. Starr might have been protecting Newt Gingrich.
2003.02-954,1,30691,james_hamilton,,1350.796,1351.289,Justice--
2003.02-954,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1351.289,1355.626,"--the... I wanted to ask this question of the Government, didn't have the opportunity."
2003.02-954,1,30691,james_hamilton,,1379.403,1387.698,"--Well, I would hope... I would hope, given the full record here, that this Court would not remand, that this Court would decide this issue."
2003.02-954,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1391.951,1406.934,"I... I understand, but as a... as a legal matter, if the Ninth Circuit didn't apply the proper test and if the district judge has to exercise discretion in the first entrance... instance... whether or not we have to remand even if we adopt the Government's argument?"
2003.02-954,1,30691,james_hamilton,,1406.934,1421.795,"--I... I believe that on the record before the Court, the Court can decide that there is no valid public interest here, and that the interest of... the privacy interest of the Foster family greatly outweighs--"
2003.02-954,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1421.795,1423.631,So you want us to do that weighing?
2003.02-954,1,30691,james_hamilton,,1423.631,1425.017,--I... I certainly do.
2003.02-954,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1431.165,1434.305,"That was the initial position of the district court, wasn't it?"
2003.02-954,1,30691,james_hamilton,,1438.513,1440.332,"The... yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-954,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1440.332,1459.668,"So the district judge... what... I don't recall what standard the district court applied in the first instance, but it was the Ninth Circuit that... that said, district court, you have to look at these and disclose the ones that aren't, whatever that series of adjectives is."
2003.02-954,1,30691,james_hamilton,,1473.436,1474.512,Not... not exactly.
2003.02-954,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1596.908,1597.363,Thank you.
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,1602.686,1605.081,"Yes, Chief Justice, thank you."
2003.02-954,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1642.15,1644.379,The issue wasn't before the Court.
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,1651.234,1661.386,"Justice Ginsburg, the definition of privacy as intended by Congress in exemption 7(C) was before the Court in Reporters Committee, and this Court--"
2003.02-954,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1661.386,1667.125,"But the... the Court didn't have a case that involved, say, for example, what was presented in the Challenger case."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,1671.75,1673.236,--I agree--
2003.02-954,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1673.236,1677.073,Are... are you saying that Reporters Committee showed that that decision was wrong?
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,1677.073,1678.438,--No.
2003.02-954,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1699.736,1703.097,There's a tradition going back thousands of years in human life.
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,1726.031,1738.374,"I believe it is an important interest, but Congress left no indication that it intended for that interest to be protected by the privacy language in exemption 7(C)."
2003.02-954,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1738.374,1748.2,"Well, if the history is totally silent, why wouldn't we assume that Congress intended to recognize something so deep in human nature?"
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,1748.2,1754.023,"Well, the... the legislative history isn't totally silent."
2003.02-954,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1754.023,1759.512,"No, I mean if they said, no, no, we do not intend to respect this sacred tradition, fine."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,1763.227,1771.689,"They did not say that, but they did talk about personally identifying details and government agencies where person--"
2003.02-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.689,1772.803,Are you reading from the legislative history?
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,1772.803,1774.206,"--From the legislative history, which is at page--"
2003.02-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.206,1775.404,Why don't you use the text of the statute?
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,1775.404,1775.858,--Yes.
2003.02-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.858,1789.25,I would... I would think that your response to... to Justice Breyer would be that the... that the word privacy is not a... the normal way of... of expressing those concerns for respect for the dead.
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,1789.25,1805.58,"I agree, I agree, and that's why I cited what this Court did in Reporters Committee, and those concerns are valid and those concerns should be made to Congress in an attempt to get them to add another exemption to the FOIA, if that's what the Government and the Foster respondents want."
2003.02-954,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1806.779,1820.525,"You've heard... you've heard Mr. Hamilton mention aspects of how the revelation of documents, pictures of the dead, can injure a survivor."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,1826.674,1831.586,--That's not the way this Court defined it in Reporters Committee.
2003.02-954,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1837.819,1846.614,"Well, one... one of the... one of the definitions that I think we instinctively assume is the very simple one that Justice Brandeis used, the right to be let alone."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,1911.668,1919.925,--The right to be let alone was not the sole expression of the definition of privacy in that article.
2003.02-954,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1921.594,1931.731,"Well, nothing it... I... I'm not suggesting... your... I mean, your argument is based upon the fact that there has to be one narrow definition of privacy encompassed by this word, and no other."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,1943.991,1959.927,"--Well, the word privacy, if it's going to be meaning the right to be let alone in its broadest sense, I suppose anything that could be considered a tort then would be considered a violation of somebody's privacy right."
2003.02-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.927,1968.222,"Mr. Favish, do... do we have any case law that suggests that the exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act are to be narrowly construed?"
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,1968.222,1972.681,"Well, sure, this Court's decision in Rose, Department of Air Force, there are many cases--"
2003.02-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1972.681,1977.882,Isn't that your... isn't that your response to why you should not think that privacy means the right to be let alone?
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,1977.882,1978.996,--Exactly.
2003.02-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1978.996,1981.021,Or anything beyond its narrowest meaning?
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,1981.021,1982.34,I... I--
2003.02-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1982.34,1983.25,I assume that that's your argument?
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,1983.25,1984.365,"--Yes, absolutely."
2003.02-954,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2019.204,2036.21,"Are you saying that this Court, because of the definition in Reporters Committee, has already recognized that it's got to be the individual that is in the photograph and families are out of it?"
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2047.067,2048.016,Okay.
2003.02-954,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2079.594,2080.588,"Yeah, but it went back to the district court."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2080.588,2086.904,"The district court made the decision that there was a privacy interest, but it wasn't the D.C. Circuit that made that decision, and the D.C.--"
2003.02-954,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2086.904,2096.851,"But in... in any event, you would say that district court decision was off-limits because this was a case of survivor grief, no information about the survivors?"
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2096.851,2098.05,"--Yes, I would."
2003.02-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2137.614,2141.079,"Well, if... if they were decided in 1969, why are they not in your brief?"
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2141.079,2149.624,"--Well, I didn't... I filled up my 50 pages and I didn't address this specific issue, other than citing Reporters Committee."
2003.02-954,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2149.624,2172.248,"Well, on... on... on Reporters Committee, maybe you'll disagree, but what I think is... is... is the key language is in roman IV, where the Court says, to begin with, both the common law and the literal understandings of privacy encompass the individual's control of information concerning his or her person."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2186.405,2187.398,I... I--
2003.02-954,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2187.398,2190.946,I... I just think that's a very unfair reading of that sentence.
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2192.143,2196.89,"--No, well, then I look at... well, first of all, I generally agree with what you just said."
2003.02-954,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2196.89,2199.286,I... you... you agree that that is... that's the key sentence that we're talking about.
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2199.286,2210.925,"Yes, and... but I don't... I disagree that it's unfair, because then I look at what was cited by the Court, and all these scholarly articles talk about the right to control information about yourself."
2003.02-954,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2225.869,2226.529,"Well, but that's what we were involved with."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2241.556,2242.216,--Right.
2003.02-954,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2253.157,2257.326,"Well, Mr. Favish, now, the court below didn't really rest on that ground, did it?"
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2264.961,2266.986,Neither the district court nor the Ninth Circuit--
2003.02-954,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2266.986,2267.252,No.
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2267.252,2267.979,--accepted that.
2003.02-954,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2267.979,2272.725,And so I assume you may want to address the other arguments in the case.
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2272.725,2274.045,Certainly.
2003.02-954,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2275.159,2279.968,Do you defend the approach taken otherwise by the courts below?
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2279.968,2281.104,"--No, I don't."
2003.02-954,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2384.636,2396.069,"Explain how the... the four documents that we're concerned with don't talk about... none of them show head and neck, so I don't... we... we hear only about those four documents, right?"
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2407.315,2411.962,--I... I... I'm... I'm not sure I follow your question.
2003.02-954,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2416.048,2426.905,"Well, that... that's what I'd like clarified, because I thought that we are reviewing a decision that the Government has asked us to review, which said, Government, disclose four photographs."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2426.905,2438.794,"--My understanding is that the petition that was granted by the Government had, as its question presented, was the Office of Independent Counsel correct in withholding all of these photographs?"
2003.02-954,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2440.651,2443.624,But the court below said yes with respect to six of them.
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2446.763,2447.256,"--Yeah, the--"
2003.02-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2447.256,2448.47,Didn't you cross-petition on the six?
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2449.751,2451.608,"--Yes, I did, and that's being held over."
2003.02-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2451.608,2451.897,That's the answer.
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2452.351,2465.354,"So I believe all 10 photos are at play here in what decision you come up with, because the... all the issues presented by all three petitioners are subsumed under the question presented in the petition that you granted."
2003.02-954,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2465.354,2467.972,I'm worried about... suppose you won.
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2511.711,2516.17,"Well, if I was one of those people that you're talking about and--"
2003.02-954,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2516.17,2516.541,"Yes, well--"
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2516.541,2521.454,"--and there's information about me in the document, I have a privacy interest in the document, is what my position is."
2003.02-954,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2521.454,2542.73,"--Well, if you... but suppose you won this, if you won it, then you and everybody else, let's say millions of people, you don't mind perhaps, or not enough, you don't mind enough, but a lot of people would mind having a police report about them on the front page of the local paper."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2542.73,2544.116,"Well, then, in that case--"
2003.02-954,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2544.116,2549.689,"Now, what is it that... if you win, I don't see that those people would have any protection whatsoever."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2549.689,2552.457,--The protection would be in the balancing that's done to see--
2003.02-954,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2552.457,2566.696,"The balancing would be that the police had found them innocent, and it's not that hard if you win this, where there have been five investigations, for somebody to say, oh, there was a police cover-up, they weren't really innocent."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2566.696,2567.439,--I--
2003.02-954,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2567.439,2576.539,"And if there are two investigations, they'll still say it, and there'll always be something that isn't perfect about the investigation, so they'll have a peg to hang their hat on."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2576.539,2579.988,"--Under the balancing, all the factors must be taken into account."
2003.02-954,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2609.504,2612.476,But I don't see how you can confine it to uniqueness.
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2628.285,2628.823,--I--
2003.02-954,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2628.823,2647.044,"Every... everyone in... in... in any Federal district has an interest in whether the United States Attorney and the FBI and so on are investigating serious crimes, and I... I don't see how you can confine this to what you call the unique case."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2647.044,2649.462,--I... I'm not saying it would be confined.
2003.02-954,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2660.586,2660.979,So--
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2660.979,2662.177,--under the FOIA as it currently exists.
2003.02-954,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2662.177,2690.701,"--But here's the... I think one of the... the... one of the things that's bothering Justice Breyer, and it's bothering me, if we accept as broad a principle as you argue for, is this: that one of the things that... that most police investigators learn very early on is that when the investigate a crime and they investigate a suspect, the suspect's old friends and enemies come forward, and the latter frequently even ups some old scores."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2716.501,2725.13,"Well, first of all, I believe in the FOIA, in exemption 7, there is an exemption for ongoing investigations, so much of what you're talking about--"
2003.02-954,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2725.13,2734.706,"Well, yeah, but the... the problem for the person being investigated who is ultimately exonerated is going to be the same the day after the investigation is... is over."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2736.73,2737.39,--Yeah.
2003.02-954,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2749.855,2751.137,"Neither... neither do I, in fact."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2813.096,2818.01,"Justice Scalia, I would not characterize them as foot faults."
2003.02-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2860.856,2865.481,"Well, why should the high level of the victim make that much difference?"
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2865.481,2870.516,"As opposed to just an innocuous neighbor down the street, perhaps."
2003.02-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2870.516,2877.575,"Well, say a... a public interest in something that happens in Albuquerque, New Mexico, maybe the assistant to the mayor is shot."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2877.575,2892.064,"Because we're dealing with somebody who was working close to the President of the United States and we're talking about the Freedom of Information Act, whose primary purpose is to allow the people to be a check on government, not only to--"
2003.02-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2892.064,2899.76,"Well, but... but why... why wouldn't that be just as true of this incident, hypothetical incident in Albuquerque as the Vince Foster slaying?"
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2899.76,2913.241,"--Well, it very well might be with regard to city or state government and states have their open records acts, and as we heard before, some of them prohibit death photos, but they do that by legislation."
2003.02-954,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2935.039,2937.927,"Well, you're... you're... you're getting away from the hypothetical."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2949.9,2952.045,"--Oh, absolutely then."
2003.02-954,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2974.791,2987.051,"So... so... so then it doesn't just turn on the fact that it's Vince Foster and that... and the Chief Justice's point is... is that this was going to apply to every police department, every... every local government in the country that has an act like this?"
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,2987.051,2990.245,"--Well, in principle, yes."
2003.02-954,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2998.047,3005.727,"When a person goes to work for the Government, on top of everything else, he even loses a private right to bury the body."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,3023.393,3024.136,Well--
2003.02-954,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3024.136,3025.539,--It would just go on forever.
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,3025.539,3028.018,"--Well, we're not talking about interfering with the... the burial process."
2003.02-954,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3028.018,3028.273,"No, I know."
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,3032.526,3048.335,"Again, as I read the FOIA exemption 7(C), the privacy exemption, Congress has not legislated that the Government is allowed to withhold death photographs under this privacy exemption."
2003.02-954,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3060.595,3062.164,What does privacy cover without that?
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,3075.25,3079.709,"--Oh, in terms of what Congress might do or what this Court might do?"
2003.02-954,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3079.709,3090.317,"--No, in terms of... the Court has no leeway unless Congress has such a catalog and this is one of the enumerated items--"
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,3090.317,3097.004,"Well, we know that Congress used the phrase, personal privacy, in the statute, and now the debate is over what did they mean by that."
2003.02-954,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3105.26,3110.75,--But it's not very Alice in Wonderland-like to take the Brandeis definition that started this all.
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,3110.75,3114.055,--What I like about the Brandeis article is--
2003.02-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3114.055,3115.459,I think it's Alice in Wonderland-like.
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,3115.459,3123.276,--What I like about the Brandeis article is the section of that article that was cited by this Court in Reporters Committee.
2003.02-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3270.648,3274.484,"Mr. Favish, are there any other Federal statutes that use the term privacy?"
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,3274.484,3293.969,"There is the Privacy Act enacted in 1974, and there is a definition which talks about personally identifying details, and I don't have that at hand right now, but it's consistent--"
2003.02-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3293.969,3295.994,You don't think that covers relatives who are deceased?
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,3295.994,3301.9,--I don't think it enacts a definition that gives somebody a privacy interest in a document--
2003.02-954,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3301.9,3302.681,I don't either.
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,3302.681,3306.563,"--which has no information about them, and I think that's indicative also."
2003.02-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3351.6,3356.263,Do you think the Ninth Circuit is bound to agree with Justice Scalia's concurrence?
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,3357.916,3359.402,I... I--
2003.02-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3359.402,3362.374,You just think they would be well advised to do so.
2003.02-954,2,15958,allan_j_favish,,3363.489,3374.057,"--I think they would be well advised to have at least noted what Justice Scalia said and compare it to what they were doing, and if they had done that, they would see that what they did was wrong on that score."
2003.02-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3379.547,3380.95,"Thank... thank you, Mr. Favish."
2003.02-954,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3384.005,3386.939,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-954,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3627.295,3628.176,"Thank you, Ms. Millett."
