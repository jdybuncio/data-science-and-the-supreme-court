2006.06-618,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,9.116,"We will hear argument in No. 06-618, the Office of Senator Mark Dayton against Brad Hanson."
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,9.116,11.8,Justice Stevens and may it please the Court:
2006.06-618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,78.833,97.634,"Do you think... do you think that we owe any special measure of respect to the Congress, that is most intimately concerned with the Speech or Debate Clause, with their view that this is, this legislation is compatible with that clause?"
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,97.634,99.537,"--I do not, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.06-618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,134.149,143.415,But what we are involved with in this case is Congress subjecting itself to the laws that govern all other employers.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,143.415,155.362,"It did, Justice Ginsburg, subject itself, but it also in Section 413 recognized that there may be Speech or Debate Clause issues and maybe not all of these cases can be adjudicated in a court."
2006.06-618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,164.359,171.603,"Which is what the statute says, and so how could the statute possibly be unconstitutional?"
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,171.603,172.474,We are not--
2006.06-618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,172.474,178.377,"I mean, the Constitution... I mean, the statute has within itself a Speech or Debate Clause exception."
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,200.263,204.674,"--Well, Justice Scalia, we are not arguing that the statute is unconstitutional."
2006.06-618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,221.107,228.359,"Well, that doesn't comply with Section 412, which says that an appeal may be taken directly to the Supreme Court from"
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,244.682,254.126,"Justice Scalia, in the United States versus Eichman, that statute at issue there had statutory direct appeal language that was exactly the language of 412."
2006.06-618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,254.126,260.68,"Isn't there a further problem here, though, that the order of the district court gave no explanation?"
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,279.264,284.607,"I believe that you can take appellate jurisdiction of this case because, as I was saying, in United--"
2006.06-618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,284.607,285.659,"Well, there'S no direct appeal."
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,292.123,301.638,"--Oh, Section 412 provides direct appeal from either court, unlike the Flag Protection Act direct appeal language, which must be from the district court."
2006.06-618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,306.793,309.226,What pages are the text of 412 set out on?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,310.716,311.127,I'm sorry.
2006.06-618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,329.309,334.472,"Well, why wasn't the ruling of the district court a ruling upon the constitutionality of the statute as applied?"
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,356.117,362.492,"--Well, Justice Alito, the argument we made was that to reach that decision there were a couple of sub-arguments the court had to reach."
2006.06-618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,391.81,393.35,Was there a dispute about the nature of his duties?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,393.35,394.061,I'm sorry?
2006.06-618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,394.061,397.334,"Not how you characterize his duties, but what his duties actually were."
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,398.303,400.526,He did not dispute his duties.
2006.06-618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,423.4,434.097,"But didn't the district court rule that somebody performing those duties can constitutionally be tried... bring suit, and it doesn't, and it doesn't violate the Speech or Debate Clause?"
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,438.12,440.043,"--No, Justice Alito, the court didn't rule that."
2006.06-618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,454.71,457.582,Don't you agree with Justice Scalia... Justice Alito?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,462.457,465.409,--It is a... not the district court ruling.
2006.06-618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,477.746,478.436,I see.
2006.06-618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,478.436,482.5,"My problem is, it's extraordinary."
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,533.304,537.257,Section 408 as applied to this case is unconstitutional.
2006.06-618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.257,539.478,Which... but it hasn't been held to be unconstitutional.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,545.111,546.303,"Well, when Congress--"
2006.06-618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.303,547.181,"I mean, read the language."
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,556.438,561.09,"--Yes, and in United States versus Eichman, Justice Scalia, the very same language was at issue."
2006.06-618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,561.09,562.211,What is that citation?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,565.265,571.96,"Yes, United States versus Eichman is cited at the Appellant's reply brief at page 1."
2006.06-618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,571.96,572.711,Thank you.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,572.711,580.245,"And the statutory section is 18 U.S.C. Section 700(d), and the direct appeal language is exactly the same,"
2006.06-618,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,596.005,598.837,But in the flag case the whole statute was either valid or not.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,600.72,603.672,"--Counsel argued both, but this Court did not deal with both."
2006.06-618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,611.026,613.747,You mean we held that the statute was constitutional on its face?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,613.747,615.249,--What the Court held was--
2006.06-618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,615.249,625.585,"I'll look at Eichman, but it's not my recollection of the case, that the whole, the essence of the duty imposed by, under the statute was held void."
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,625.585,629.068,--It was the application in that particular situation.
2006.06-618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,629.068,633.242,"Well, but there's always an application or there's no case."
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,633.242,634.253,"Well, the--"
2006.06-618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,634.253,636.645,Absent some declaratory judgment provision.
2006.06-618,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,636.645,639.937,We simply didn't rule hold was a right to burn flags in some cases and not others.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,639.937,643.149,"--Well, there were two questions that the parties raised."
2006.06-618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,659.752,661.571,What... what had the lower court held?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,667.605,672.678,"I'm sorry, Justice Scalia, I don't remember what the lower court held in that case--"
2006.06-618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,672.678,682.115,"I mean, but that can mean... you can always dispose of a, of a facial challenge by just saying we don't have to reach the facial question; we can decide it on an as applied question."
2006.06-618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,690.973,699.837,And in Eichman we recite that the district court held the Act unconstitutional as applied to appellees and dismissed the charges.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,699.837,700.638,--Right.
2006.06-618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,740.865,747.149,"I realize, before you leave that I realize that on a jurisdictional issue like that we have an obligation to raise it ourselves."
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,751.611,754.853,--Not that I recall in the Eichman case.
2006.06-618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,808.679,809.71,What does he do?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,840.291,843.093,"Justice Breyer, he did significantly more than that."
2006.06-618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,843.322,844.824,I have the whole list here.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,857.121,858.391,"--Oh, Justice--"
2006.06-618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,858.391,858.742,What?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,858.742,859.613,--Justice Breyer--
2006.06-618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,859.613,860.234,What are the words?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,860.234,881.679,"--Actually in the Kimball declaration, which is at jurisdictional statement 66a, and the self evaluation of Mr. Hanson which is attached thereto as a jurisdictional statement at 78a, and this is his self evaluation and Mr. Kimball, his supervisor at the time telling what he had done, he being Mr. Hanson."
2006.06-618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,892.294,893.444,I agree with that one.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,906.884,909.015,--Justice Breyer actually he did both of those.
2006.06-618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,930.829,931.119,Oh.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,935.201,936.242,"--Yes, he did."
2006.06-618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,936.743,937.784,Where does it say that?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,937.784,943.396,--That is in the Kimball declaration which is jurisdictional statements at page 66a.
2006.06-618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,960.619,963.071,"Well, he didn't do exclusively that stuff anyway."
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,981.844,983.283,--Because it is--
2006.06-618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,983.283,984.904,Why is the whole suit precluded?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,984.904,994.821,"--The whole suit is precluded because when you have as we do an employee who is in this legislative sphere, that the Court has identified, he is in that sphere because he is performing legislative acts."
2006.06-618,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.015,1034.166,I'm puzzled.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1036.878,1038.388,"I'm sorry, Justice Stevens?"
2006.06-618,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1038.388,1041.17,Firing someone is a legislative act?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1041.17,1047.104,"Firing not anyone is a legislative act, but firing your second self is a legislative act."
2006.06-618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1064.976,1069.36,That's part of... how many second selves would there be?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1069.731,1071.271,"I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg?"
2006.06-618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1071.271,1072.212,On the Senator's staff?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1072.212,1072.703,I'm sorry.
2006.06-618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1073.28,1074.962,How many second selves?
2006.06-618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1081.457,1082.997,Maybe he was the 23rd self.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1085.418,1095.426,"Well, in Gravel, in United States vs. Gravel, this Court stated not only do you have second selves, but you must... members must delegate and redelegate and redelegate authority."
2006.06-618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1100.479,1102.692,What's wrong with this?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1156.575,1178.36,"--What's wrong with that solution is that when a member, as I was explaining in response to Justice Stevens' questions, when a member has a second self who is in the legislative process and the member says you know, I'm pulling him out of the process because he doesn't perform well, he... I don't think he is my second self, that termination for whatever reason is part of the process because the member has changed the process."
2006.06-618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1178.36,1178.661,All right.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1185.674,1188.756,The... it is a whole employee.
2006.06-618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1234.63,1237.662,Isn't that a... can you give me examples of cases where that Act applies?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1237.662,1239.052,I'm sorry?
2006.06-618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1239.052,1251.46,Can you give me instances in which employees of an the office of a Senator are covered by these obligations and cannot invoke the Speech or Debate Clause?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1255.533,1257.284,Where you cannot invoke the Speech or Debate Clause.
2006.06-618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1257.284,1257.554,Yeah.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1257.554,1258.445,"Was that the question, or can?"
2006.06-618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1258.445,1258.824,Yes.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1264.718,1275.837,"If I may answer the second question first, approximately 75 percent of the people who are covered by this Act, the employees who are covered by this Act are not employed by members of Congress or committees."
2006.06-618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1282.279,1285.842,"Well, except the Act itself has a provision for office of Senators."
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1285.842,1287.234,--And those employees--
2006.06-618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1287.234,1290.265,And so it seems to me you're giving no effect to that.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1293.627,1298.48,"--No, Justice Kennedy, those employees... first of all some of those employees can sue."
2006.06-618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1342.189,1342.91,If this statute--
2006.06-618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1342.91,1344.58,"Wouldn't they get into... no, you."
2006.06-618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1344.58,1353.018,"--If this statute was set up so that the defendant here was the Senate, as opposed to the office of a Senator, would you still say that this suit couldn't go forward?"
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1353.018,1363.243,"With respect to the abatement issue, I would... this is with respect to the abatement issue... I would say that the case would not be abated, because the defendant would still exist."
2006.06-618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1433.931,1446.089,"In what sense would the member be called to answer under those circumstances, if the member isn't a defendant and has no financial liability and is able to invoke the clause as an evidentiary privilege?"
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1449.051,1451.192,In the scenario where the Congress is the defendant?
2006.06-618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1451.192,1451.622,Yes.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1451.622,1462.439,"Well, what we are arguing is that the termination itself, the termination itself is a legislative act because the termination itself is part of the due functioning of the legislative process."
2006.06-618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1476.049,1478.66,Well why doesn't it matter who the defendant is?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1507.782,1510.553,"--No Justice Ginsburg, there has been no waiver--"
2006.06-618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1510.553,1511.314,I'm Justice Souter.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1511.314,1511.744,--I'm sorry.
2006.06-618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1513.885,1514.887,You're very flattering.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1515.257,1518.24,--Sorry.
2006.06-618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1527.774,1545.098,"Yes, but I was just going to say if this case continues we've got to accept the proposition that the Office of Senator Mark Dayton is still a, some kind of an entity that has got to be accorded reality by the judiciary, right."
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1545.098,1545.746,"--That is correct, because--"
2006.06-618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1545.746,1547.038,And how do we do it?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1586.232,1588.124,"--I agree with that, Justice Souter."
2006.06-618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1605.626,1606.688,"Yes, but at this point that's silly."
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1611.319,1614.461,--I agree with you that there is no defendant any more.
2006.06-618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.903,1650.205,There's never an office.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1672.368,1675.31,"--Justice Scalia, it is not just a fiction."
2006.06-618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1676.062,1682.887,Why isn't it a waiver of sovereign immunity when you set up a system that envisions a suit which will be paid off by the Senate?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1684.759,1688.791,"--It is, Justice Scalia, a waiver of sovereign immunity that has a condition on it."
2006.06-618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1688.791,1690.153,Is it unequivocal?
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1690.153,1691.753,It is unequivocal--
2006.06-618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1691.753,1696.858,"I mean, when it's done on the basis of this fiction, is that what we should accept as an unequivocal waiver?"
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1696.858,1703.092,"--Well, first, I disagree with the premise in that I don't think it is a fiction that this office never existed."
2006.06-618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1715.488,1716.96,"A physical, a physical office, yes."
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1724.314,1727.767,"Well, actually the structure doesn't support that."
2006.06-618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1741.197,1744.069,Setting it is quite different from paying it.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1744.069,1745.508,It is paid for--
2006.06-618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1745.508,1748.4,The Senator sets it and the Senate pays it.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1748.4,1755.056,"Justice Scalia, actually the Senate is given an appropriation and all of his salaries must be paid from the appropriation."
2006.06-618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1755.056,1755.396,Right.
2006.06-618,0,31894,jean_m_manning,,1771.246,1776.389,It is the appropriated fund for the Senator and the Senator is the one who pays the fund.
2006.06-618,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1778.58,1782.583,Mr. Salzman.
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,1782.583,1790.628,Justice Stevens and may it please the Court:
2006.06-618,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1900.432,1910.538,The other side's contention is that the firing is itself a legislative act and so when you challenge the firing you are challenging the legislative act.
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,1911.429,1914.692,"We say that's absolutely wrong Justice Scalia, that is absolutely wrong."
2006.06-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2013.59,2035.983,"What if his dissent... or defense, rather, to the charge is that he was very inefficient in giving me help in legislative hearings and so forth, or words of that kind which might be arguably a legislative act, and that Speech or Debate Clause forbids inquiry into the quality of his performing those duties?"
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2035.983,2041.977,"Justice Stevens, certainly the Speech or Debate Clause does incorporate... I'm sorry."
2006.06-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2064.771,2079.902,"But maybe the Senator might argue that this is all privileged: It's the reason I fired him, but I can't go into it because I don't want to invade my own privilege not to discuss matters that are covered by the immunity."
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2079.902,2101.626,"Well, Justice Stevens, again if the reason for the firing would shed light if the district court would show that the allowing the evidence that is proffered in would so intrude upon a real legislative act, then the district court can excise that evidence from the case."
2006.06-618,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2105.998,2107.911,What's the test for intruding?
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2121.018,2137.581,"I think, as this Court has described it, Justice Kennedy, if it would compel the Senator to testify about his motives for legislation or for a legislative act, then a district court could decide that that evidence would not come in."
2006.06-618,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2145.384,2155.001,"What if it required him to say how he allocated his resources, that he allocate his resources 10 percent to foreign affairs issues, 50 percent to health care issues?"
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2158.425,2161.105,"I don't believe that it would, be Justice Kennedy."
2006.06-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2228.068,2231.281,That doesn't quite capture the problem that I'm having.
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2256.557,2258.019,"Understood, Justice Stevens."
2006.06-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2291.341,2292.811,Or he just wrote a lousy memo.
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2297.563,2315.825,"--If that is truly the situation and if a district court assessing, once all of the information is presented to the district court, that requiring the Senator in that circumstance to discuss really his legislative goals, we think that maybe that evidence would not be permitted."
2006.06-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2320.279,2321.138,Even if the Senator did not have a defense?
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2321.138,2350.687,"--Well, in Brewster, Your Honor, this Court recognized that there may be situations where the court permits an indictment to go forward, in which the indictment itself and the proof that the prosecutor will be presenting does not so intrude on the legislative process that it would be precluded but that the Defendant may decide that in order to explain the accusation he needs to rely on legislative acts."
2006.06-618,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2379.568,2381.901,"Yes, but what if the Senator doesn't want to put it in?"
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2391.466,2395.019,"Well, if he chooses to sit moot and if the evidence--"
2006.06-618,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2395.019,2396.661,"""Mute"" I guess I should have said."
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2396.661,2398.471,"--Mute, I'm sorry."
2006.06-618,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2398.471,2399.122,Yes.
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2399.122,2407.527,"If he chooses to stay silent, then perhaps the case just goes forward without an explanation."
2006.06-618,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2408.168,2421.766,"Well, why don't, why doesn't that... why doesn't being placed in that dilemma in effect implicate the clause, and why can't he invoke the clause as a basis for dismissal?"
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2421.766,2434.887,"--Well, Judge Randolph below thought that there may be circumstances where the evidence is so, all of the evidence is so bound up in a legislative act that the case might not go forward."
2006.06-618,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2456.488,2462.722,"Well, yes, so far as the member's immediate financial concern, they took care of it."
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2501.559,2517.901,"Well, Justice Souter, our argument is that the decision itself is certainly not a legislative act, and the most... and that is in accordance with this Court's view of the judicial privilege in Forrester that the decision itself is not a judicial act."
2006.06-618,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2592.858,2596.461,That would go for a stenographer in a committee hearing?
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2596.461,2607.77,"Yes, Your Honor, and I believe that's the Browning case, that the D.C. Circuit originally had found would be considered a legislative act."
2006.06-618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2666.706,2668.759,"Well, it could or couldn't be."
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2693.414,2707.104,"Justice Breyer, I think that that is one of the rare circumstances where the, the Senator's assessment of the performance is very tied up with a legislative act."
2006.06-618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2707.104,2714.428,"Well, all he'd have to say is it's relevant to my decision to fire the person."
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2736.283,2738.283,"You are, Justice Breyer."
2006.06-618,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2815.835,2822.239,Have any cases gone through a district court on the merits under this Act?
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2822.239,2823.689,"I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg?"
2006.06-618,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2823.689,2830.915,Have any cases under this Act gone to a district court to judgment on the merits?
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2830.915,2832.327,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.06-618,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2859.692,2861.993,I have one question.
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2869.61,2871.07,--Yes.
2006.06-618,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2871.07,2880.927,"But under 1291, the United States Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction where direct review may be had in the Supreme Court."
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2886.511,2889.403,"Not entirely, Justice Kennedy."
2006.06-618,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2918.111,2929.711,"Well, but my point is that the Appellants are telling us that this is appealable here directly, but if that's so they shouldn't have gone to court of appeals, they shouldn't have gone to the court of appeals; they're untimely when they come here."
2006.06-618,1,40547,richard_a_salzman,,2929.711,2933.452,--That is our understanding of the way it generally works.
2006.06-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2968.904,2971.508,"Thank you, Mr. Salzman."
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,2980.992,2985.065,Justice Stevens and may it please the Court:
2006.06-618,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3028.343,3031.074,And there's no jurisdiction under 412 because?
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,3031.074,3045.864,"Because, as we said in our brief, the decision of the court of appeals was a decision on the scope of the Speech or Debate Clause as that clause is preserved in Section 413 of the act and therefore there would be no appeal under Section 412."
2006.06-618,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3125.406,3126.958,Can we go back a step.
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,3146.43,3147.331,Correct.
2006.06-618,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3147.331,3147.932,That's your reason.
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,3157.016,3164.423,"Well, that is an application of Section 413, the preservation of Speech or Debate Clause in the statute."
2006.06-618,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3164.423,3166.814,"No, no, no, I'm not asking about the argument you are making."
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,3185.88,3189.38,"Our view is that that is correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-618,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3189.38,3189.731,That is correct.
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,3192.471,3195.634,The Eichman case they cited.
2006.06-618,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3195.634,3216.528,"In Eichman, I was able to get out the district court and the last part of the district court, the last line of the district court, it says the law under which these three... let me begin again... the law under which these three defendants have been prosecuted is unconstitutional, which seems to me to contradict what Appellant's counsel told us about what happened in the district court."
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,3216.528,3217.87,I think that's correct.
2006.06-618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3217.87,3227.826,"It wouldn't matter anyway, because our prior decisions that do not explicitly refer to jurisdictional questions are not authority on jurisdiction."
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,3227.826,3229.438,That's correct.
2006.06-618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3229.438,3236.052,"We have that firm rule: When we take a case and don't get into the jurisdictional question, it is not precedent for the fact--"
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,3236.052,3238.143,"For a finding of jurisdiction later, that's correct."
2006.06-618,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3238.734,3258.556,"So then a holding of a district court in your opinion, the holdings say, imaginary, is that no one who actually works in an office of a Senator and who ever worked on any matter having to do with legislation falls within this Act because that would violate the speech and debate clause."
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,3265.101,3266.543,--Right.
2006.06-618,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3274.979,3290.839,"Does that mean if I go to your argument... I mean, the problem with your argument it seems to me is that that leaves no room for this appellate provision at law, because the only reason that anything is likely to be unconstitutional in this area, at least 99 percent of it, would be Speech or Debate Clause violation."
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,3295.591,3300.674,"Well, there was a lot of discussion in the legislative history about the separation of powers generally."
2006.06-618,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3300.674,3306.818,We were told that 75 percent of the employees who were covered by the Act do not work for an individual member.
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,3314.004,3317.637,"Well, I think the provision wasn't held facially unconstitutional."
2006.06-618,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3317.637,3318.228,What could it possibly be?
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,3328.386,3348.999,"Again, there was major debate in the Congress over whether or not the provision of judicial hearing of suits over congressional employment decisions, separate from the Speech or Debate Clause, just a separation of powers concern of having the judiciary oversee the workings of Congress, and there was a concern about that separation of powers issue, which would be a facial issue."
2006.06-618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3363.868,3365.449,--Yes.
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,3381.309,3381.62,Right.
2006.06-618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3383.851,3384.462,Yeah.
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,3384.462,3397.82,"And when Congress did provide these rights under the statute, it was very important for the Congress under the previous regime affecting the Senate, employees had employment protections and they had administrative processes that they could go to."
2006.06-618,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3538.443,3541.234,But it will... the money is simply Senate money.
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,3541.234,3542.754,Yes.
2006.06-618,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3550.608,3563.889,"But none of those funds are, as I understand it, are somehow subtracted from or contributed by the funds of individual senatorial offices while a Senator is in office."
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,3570.113,3571.793,Under the Act there is.
2006.06-618,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3583.48,3583.911,Okay.
2006.06-618,2,42579,thomas_e_caballero,,3587.584,3595.028,"Perhaps it's a party in interest, but I would say again that the named party is not a party without any life except under the Act."
2006.06-618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3596.52,3602.474,"Ms. Manning, you have about a minute left."
2006.06-618,3,31894,jean_m_manning,,3602.474,3611.5,There are four instances in which the Court has found that jurisdiction is barred in Speech or Debate Clause cases.
2006.06-618,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3658.711,3659.202,Right.
2006.06-618,3,31894,jean_m_manning,,3665.386,3668.568,Direct me... I'm sorry.
2006.06-618,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3669.319,3670.599,Direct your office to... to do that.
2006.06-618,3,31894,jean_m_manning,,3670.599,3672.261,To pay the judgment?
2006.06-618,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3672.261,3684.89,"Because it... suppose they thought there was liability and if you say yes, then I need to know why you and counsel who just addressed this are on different sides of the case, if you're both representing the Senate."
2006.06-618,3,31894,jean_m_manning,,3684.89,3686.671,They cannot direct us to pay.
2006.06-618,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3696.427,3697.086,"Could it, if it chose?"
2006.06-618,3,31894,jean_m_manning,,3697.086,3705.033,"--Well, I believe that it cannot because the defendant in this case is the employing office."
2006.06-618,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3705.033,3705.373,All right.
2006.06-618,3,31894,jean_m_manning,,3705.373,3709.986,"So for that reason the Senate has never, doesn't even know the cases exist."
2006.06-618,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3732.02,3732.4,Ms. Manning--
2006.06-618,3,31894,jean_m_manning,,3732.4,3733.662,--Where this they been for twelve years?
2006.06-618,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3735.933,3736.224,"--Thank you, Ms. Manning."
2006.06-618,3,31894,jean_m_manning,,3737.065,3737.245,Thank you.
