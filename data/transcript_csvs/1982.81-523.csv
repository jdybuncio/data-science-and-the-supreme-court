1982.81-523,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.152,"We will now hear arguments in <Eighty one five twenty three> [81-523], Container Corporation of America versus Franchise Tax Board."
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,70.082,80.858,"May it please the Court, this is an appeal from the California Court of Appeals, the California Supreme Court having declined to hear the case."
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,149.815,156.811,"They would also, I take it, include the assets in the calculations."
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,156.811,162.762,"They would include the subsidiaries' assets in the calculations, is that your question?"
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,162.762,164.168,Yes.
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,164.168,165.747,"In the formula, that is right."
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,170.666,173.555,Which wasn't true in--
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,173.555,177.63,"Which was not true in ASARCO and Woolworth, but the court didn't get to that specific problem."
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,177.63,179.817,--Although there was some interest in it.
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,179.817,181.082,Yes.
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,243.448,255.397,"Mr. Latcham, would you be here making the same argument if these subsidiaries were all domestic subsidiaries operating in precisely the same way as these foreign subsidiaries?"
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,255.397,258.567,"We would be making the same argument, I think, Your Honor--"
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,258.567,261.175,You wouldn't be making the latter argument?
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,261.175,262.518,--We would be making the unitary argument.
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,262.518,269.953,"Yes, the same... So, the unitary argument is the same whether these are foreign or domestic subsidiaries?"
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,269.953,271.062,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-523,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,325.727,326.493,Mr. Latcham--
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,326.493,327.087,Yes.
1982.81-523,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,327.087,335.819,--There were no administrative proceedings within the California State tax system prior to this that were contested?
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,339.505,356.046,"Well, the administrative proceeding in California was under a protest due to the Franchise Tax Board based on their proposed deficiency based on the fact that Container and its subsidiaries were unitary."
1982.81-523,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,366.088,371.337,"Well, how is the stipulation... Had there been depositions?"
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,382.926,388.722,"Well, we went about stipulating the facts much as we have done in many, many cases in California."
1982.81-523,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,414.273,417.678,What was the total amount of tax in controversy?
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,417.678,424.284,"The total amount of tax in controversy is approximately $71,000 for the three years in question."
1982.81-523,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,424.284,428.252,That is the difference California says it can tax you and what you say California can tax you?
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,428.252,428.814,That is right.
1982.81-523,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,428.814,431.267,And that is for three years?
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,431.267,432.36,"Three years, yes."
1982.81-523,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,435.093,440.419,Is the same thing true for all the intervening years?
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,440.419,455.834,"For all intervening years up through 1972, the stipulation says the Franchise Tax Board determined additional liabilities due to the proposal worldwide combination, that is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-523,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,455.834,458.161,"It is a long time ago, isn't it?"
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,458.161,465.642,"It is a long time ago and, as a matter of fact, the problem is even with us today, I am told, the company and many other companies."
1982.81-523,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,650.115,660.549,"Now, the flow of goods test was not really one that was suggested by this court in the majority opinion in ASARCO and Woolworth, was it?"
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,660.549,665.0,"Well, I think, Your Honor, that it was suggested."
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,762.757,768.505,"But, I suppose the parent elected the boards."
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,768.505,778.485,"Well, as a matter of fact, the record shows that the parent had less than a majority of the directors on the overall."
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,778.485,782.185,"What do you mean, they had the majority of the directors?"
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,782.795,784.529,They elected less than a majority.
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.529,789.184,"--Well, didn't it take a majority vote to elect all the directors?"
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,789.184,790.932,No.
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,796.633,797.695,That is a totally different statement.
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,797.695,798.867,--Yes.
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,798.867,800.351,They elected all of the directors.
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,804.444,806.395,"Well, yes, that is true, Your Honor."
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,806.395,818.406,It is just that they put their own... What do you call a Container person that was on the board?
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,819.922,821.764,"Yes, that is true, Your Honor."
1982.81-523,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,872.385,879.023,You are not suggesting it is just as if Container had invested in a chain of hotels in South America?
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,879.023,885.395,"I am not suggesting it is the same as if the foreign subsidiaries were operating hotels, no, Your Honor."
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1063.884,1066.696,How does it work out if the subsidiary has a loss?
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,1066.696,1069.476,How does it work if the subsidiary has a loss?
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1078.457,1079.378,It is a two-way street.
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,1079.378,1092.108,"Well, it is not a two-way street, of course, in this case, because the very substantial profits of the subsidiaries which have been going on for a considerable period of time."
1982.81-523,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1221.01,1226.365,"Venezuela and Colombia didn't require you to use separate accounting in California, did they?"
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,1226.365,1227.349,"They did not, Your Honor."
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1281.687,1289.356,Does California recognize at all that taxes have been paid on some of this income that it has included in this formula?
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,1289.356,1290.746,"No, they do not, Your Honor."
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1331.278,1339.634,What if the subsidiaries paid a substantial amount of dividends to Container?
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,1344.71,1354.629,"That is not included in Container's income insofar as California is concerned, because the commerical domocile is in Chicago."
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.587,1456.961,What does California do about a British corporation?
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,1461.132,1462.552,It is Delaware headquartered in Illinois.
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1462.552,1465.708,"So, what if it were a British corporation?"
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,1465.708,1467.473,A British parent company?
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1467.473,1469.222,"Yes, with headquarters in New York."
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,1471.58,1482.591,California treats... It applies the unitary method to all multinational corporations whether the parent is headquartered in the United States or in a foreign country.
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1484.981,1485.902,Yes.
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,1485.902,1497.241,"--if the British company is an English, United Kingdom corporation with a subsidiary operating in California, California would apply the unitary method there also."
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1497.241,1501.74,"Even if it didn't have a subsidiary, if it were just doing business there and had income from there."
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,1501.74,1506.067,"They would apply it, yes, in that situation."
1982.81-523,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1506.067,1525.839,"Mr. Latcham, in our proposed treaty with the United Kingdom, the Senate, of course, removed the language that would have denied the states the right to apply this formulary apportionment which certainly is at least an indicator that the federal government isn't interested in speaking with one voice in this area."
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,1525.839,1539.052,"Well, I would say in regard to the treaty, Your Honor, there was... A majority of the Senate voted in favor of the treaty retaining that provision, but a two-thirds majority did not."
1982.81-523,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1539.052,1539.787,Right.
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,1539.787,1556.905,"And, in the legislative history to that treaty, there is considerable indication that many senators were concerned that this problem should not be taken up by Congress through the treaty mechanism, but it should go to both houses of Congress."
1982.81-523,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1562.06,1567.948,"But, it is a negative indicator in that argument, is it not?"
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,1567.948,1569.837,It is a negative indicator.
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1603.012,1606.759,"Has the Solicitor General weighed in on this question, not in this case anyway?"
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,1606.759,1609.321,"--I was going to mention that very point, Your Honor."
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1613.616,1614.1,Yes.
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,1614.1,1625.33,--that in their view the worldwide unitary method as imposed by the states does impair the ability of the federal government to carry out its foreign policy.
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.33,1630.719,Did he say just to the extent it applies to foreign corporations?
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,1630.719,1631.719,"No, he did not, Your Honor."
1982.81-523,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1635.406,1636.093,Just this kind of a case?
1982.81-523,0,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,1636.093,1642.013,"--Just this kind of a case, because Chicago Bridge presents just this kind of a case."
1982.81-523,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1645.605,1648.87,Attorney General Gobar?
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,1648.87,1660.301,"Mr. Acting Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-523,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2029.964,2034.65,Now you spoke of foreign-controlled companies.
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2046.801,2056.547,"We are talking... When I say ""foreign-controlled company"", I am talking about a foreign company who has a subsidiary here."
1982.81-523,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2056.547,2058.39,Which is not this case?
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2058.39,2059.484,Which is not this case.
1982.81-523,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2059.484,2062.826,You feel that is a very different case than this one?
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2062.826,2063.67,That is a very different case.
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.498,2071.37,How do you read the Solicitor General's submission in the Chicago Railroad case?
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2071.37,2075.9,--I read that just like I read the AC briefs filed by--
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2075.9,2077.322,You disagree with your colleague on the other side that the--
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2077.322,2077.869,--Yes.
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2187.886,2193.369,"--Well, on that basis, the whole unitary concept is meaningless anyway."
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2200.568,2253.438,"My point, Your Honor, is that the unitary formula method should be applicable as California has uniformly applied it regardless of the activities... whether the unit... you have to have a unitary business, but regardless of whether the unit is operated through a single corporation or through a parent in a number of subsidiaries, the treatment has to be the same if they are both unitary businesses to avoid the ability, which the major companies here are trying to retain in this case, to shift their income by switching from a division situation, subject to formula apportionment while it is a loss, and as Your Honor pointed out, when they start they are losses, and you run your loss divisions in and that reduces your California tax."
1982.81-523,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2357.505,2359.8,And to what oral argument were you referring to?
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2359.8,2363.909,The oral argument in the CDI Caterpillar case.
1982.81-523,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2363.909,2366.252,Last term?
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2366.252,2367.424,Last term.
1982.81-523,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2368.781,2376.045,"General, may I ask you a question about the SG's position in Caterpillar."
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2397.318,2402.018,Not if it is what I believe it is.
1982.81-523,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2402.018,2415.248,He relied explicitly on Japan Line and argued that it was clear that double taxation would result.
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2451.453,2459.043,"Well, the Solicitor General, in a brief in Caterpillar... Incidentally, if I might give the citation on that."
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.886,2469.774,--Doesn't the Solicitor General file the written amicus brief in the Chicago Bridge?
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2469.774,2471.445,He did in that case.
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.57,2476.084,"No, but that is a pending hearing, is it so."
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2476.084,2480.191,--It is not in tandem with this case.
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2480.191,2480.799,"No, no."
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2480.799,2481.112,It is pending.
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2481.112,2482.065,It's not set for argument.
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2482.065,2485.158,It is still undecided by this Court.
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2485.158,2485.799,Yes.
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2488.672,2489.891,"That is my understanding, yes."
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2489.891,2497.95,"And, what about the same question Justice Powell put to you about his position there?"
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2502.559,2505.244,"Well, he makes a broad statement."
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.851,2510.804,And he argued Japan Line?
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2510.804,2511.99,And he argued Japan Line.
1982.81-523,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2523.549,2535.278,"How can you say that for in Colombia, for example, where the amount of the tax is the amount of that you have attributed for their whole income down there?"
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2541.557,2556.222,"The facts here do not show double taxation, Your Honor, because all California is doing is apportioning eight percent of the total worldwide income to California."
1982.81-523,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2629.537,2635.722,"Well, your definition of double taxation is a tax bill that exceeds your entire income?"
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2635.722,2651.482,"--I don't define the term, Your Honor, and I stay away from it, because, quite frankly, I think it has been used in many different cases to mean different things."
1982.81-523,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2654.746,2671.458,"But, in a property tax concept, it was more sensible really, because you could talk about a specific piece of property having a situs in one state being taxed, two separate things, but I am not sure how much sense the term itself means when you talk about income tax."
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2671.458,2674.675,"--We agree 100 %, Your Honor, exactly."
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2985.333,2991.659,What is involved in the so-called arm's-length system of taxation?
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,2991.659,3006.871,"Well, what is involved in it is theoretically you take this unitary business, which this Court has said by its very nature is indivisible, and say we try to divide it."
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3009.683,3016.945,Isn't that what the foreign countries do who are taxing these particular subsidiaries involved in this case?
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,3016.945,3019.147,--I have never heard of a foreign country doing it.
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3028.674,3032.596,Do any of the foreign countries put an income tax on these subsidiaries?
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,3032.596,3034.485,"Yes, I believe so."
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3034.485,3035.564,How do they tax them?
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,3035.564,3040.842,They tax them by their own separate accounting or whatever method they use.
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3040.842,3042.216,Do they do it by an arm's-length method?
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,3042.216,3044.575,"I don't think they do it by an arm's-length method, because, for example--"
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3044.575,3045.918,How do they do it?
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,3047.449,3050.261,--I don't know the details of how they do it.
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3073.845,3078.045,"But, it doesn't use the formulary system like California?"
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,3078.045,3084.934,"--As far as I know, it does not use a formulary method for its own determination nor does it use an arm's-length method."
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3084.934,3087.933,Do you think that system is unfair?
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,3087.933,3089.542,"Which, the arm's-length method?"
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3089.542,3093.054,"No, whatever system it is that Venezuela is using."
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,3093.054,3094.054,Whatever they use?
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3095.118,3096.803,Unfair to them?
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,3096.803,3098.084,Well--
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3098.084,3099.068,They should be able to tax more?
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,3099.068,3101.723,"--No, I think they should tax less."
1982.81-523,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3155.749,3164.948,"Would your position be the same if the parent here, so-called parent, owned only 33 % of the--"
1982.81-523,1,37109,neal_j_gobar,,3164.948,3167.056,"--No, no, Your Honor."
1982.81-523,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3468.061,3471.075,"Thank you, Mr. Attorney General."
1982.81-523,2,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,3472.792,3475.355,"Just a few things in rebuttal, Your Honor."

1982.81-523,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3490.863,3492.113,You are talking about--
1982.81-523,2,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,3492.113,3494.504,--His submission in the Chicago Bridge case.
1982.81-523,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3494.504,3495.502,--in Chicago Bridge?
1982.81-523,2,24245,franklin_c_latcham,,3495.502,3502.422,"That is right, Your Honor, which certainly represents the position of the United States on this question of worldwide unitary apportionment."
1982.81-523,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3693.766,3694.844,"Thank you, counsel."
