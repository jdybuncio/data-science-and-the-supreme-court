1985.85-599,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.494,We'll hear arguments next in United States against the American Bar Endowment.
1985.85-599,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,82.126,87.649,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,1089.048,1091.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1300.688,1303.69,"You're on page 12a, Mr. Gregory?"
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,1303.69,1305.76,"Yes, I am, Justice Rehnquist?"
1985.85-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1305.76,1312.054,"I can't... well, perhaps... it's in the petition?"
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,1312.054,1321.05,"It's... the Claims Court opinion is to be found commencing at page 2a of the petition, I believe, and according to my notes, the quote is at 12a."
1985.85-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1397.48,1402.104,"If the point is so crucial, it is somewhat surprising to find it in a footnote."
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,1402.104,1415.592,"It's also found in the text, Justice Rehnquist, and if I could read what the Claims Court said which issued the initial findings of fact, this is page 41a of the Claims Court opinion,"
1985.85-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1744.318,1753.424,"Are you now arguing, Mr. Gregory, the second part of the case, whether the members are entitled to take deductions, or are you arguing the unrelated business income part of the case?"
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,1753.424,1756.408,"--I'm arguing both parts of the case, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.85-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1756.408,1757.037,At the same time.
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,1757.037,1761.961,To this extent we believe that the cases are inseparable as to this fact.
1985.85-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1784.086,1788.598,"But the Court of Claims found against you on the deductibility of the individual members, didn't it?"
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,1788.598,1798.696,"The Court of Claims found against us, Justice Rehnquist, not because it had any disagreement with us as to the value of the professional association group insurance."
1985.85-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1816.1,1817.419,"Well, suit yourself."
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,1821.031,1827.116,"--Well, I appreciate the question because as to this fact, we're right on both points, and we think it's essential."
1985.85-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2044.588,2044.939,May I ask you a question?
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2044.939,2045.96,--Certainly.
1985.85-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2045.96,2046.351,Maybe it's in the record.
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2052.125,2057.718,"The record reflects, Justice Stevens, that 57,000 members participated in the plan."
1985.85-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2067.324,2070.927,So about something like 20 percent of the association.
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2070.927,2087.207,"I believe that the government and we have said that something in the order of 25 percent or perhaps a little less actually participated, but Chief Judge Kozinski found correctly that this plan was kept in place by members who did not participate as well as those who did."
1985.85-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2173.584,2178.396,"Well, if you're arguing the second point now, Mr. Gregory, I thought that the Claims Court had found against you on that point."
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2178.396,2180.477,The Claims Court found against us--
1985.85-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2180.477,2189.913,"The Claims Court found that cheaper insurance was not available to three of the people, and although cheaper insurance had been available to the fourth, that person had not known about it."
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2189.913,2204.984,"--That is... that is correct, Justice Rehnquist, looking solely at that particular individual, and let me explain what we perceive the error of the Claims Court to be and what the Federal Circuit said it was."
1985.85-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2213.679,2218.073,"Well, now, these are Respondents that were testifying, not dissenters, according to the Claims Court."
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2218.073,2218.903,That is correct.
1985.85-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2361.307,2368.641,Does that mean that individual members could have received back the dividends that went to charity or that the membership as a whole could have changed it?
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2368.641,2380.91,"The membership as a whole could have changed the plan, Justice Rehnquist, and the finding is that the membership as a whole, which is nothing but the members, chose not to do so."
1985.85-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2380.91,2385.651,"Well, how would that affect the intent to give or the donative intent of individual members?"
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2385.651,2387.023,"Well, let me give you an example?"
1985.85-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2433.323,2442.048,"It may be, but I don't see how the fact that the membership as a whole could have changed it bears one way or the other on the motivation of the particular individual you've described."
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2442.048,2446.873,"Well, the membership as a whole can be nothing but the sum total of the members."
1985.85-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2467.726,2469.158,"Mr. Gregory, may I ask you a question?"
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2469.158,2469.528,Yes.
1985.85-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2469.528,2472.841,"It seems to me you're making two arguments, and I'm trying to sort them out In my mind."
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2488.572,2492.865,"Justice Stevens, it's often stated that in a group one votes with his feet."
1985.85-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2492.865,2493.654,Right.
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2509.335,2514.059,"It's both, Justice... well, it's the 100 percent of the American Bar Association, Justice Stevens."
1985.85-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2514.059,2515.92,So 100 percent decided to give away the money that belongs to 20 percent.
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2515.92,2532.489,"That's what the government said at trial, but the Claims Court found that there was surprisingly little dissent, three people of record out of 57,000, and it drew the inference that the members of the entire organization wanted it to happen this way."
1985.85-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2567.403,2586.777,"I'm puzzled There must he something, I'm sure there is a lot to the case I don't understand, but I'm puzzled as to why you don't argue more forcefully the fact that the 20 percent themselves, individually, are electing... and presumably lawyers know what they're doing... to take this unusually expensive insurance and thereby to make the contribution as they renew year after year."
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2588.036,2589.739,"--Well, I think it is, Justice Stevens."
1985.85-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2589.739,2592.94,"That's not the theory of the lower court at all, is it?"
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2592.94,2597.222,"Well, I think if you look at our brief, which I know you have--"
1985.85-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2597.222,2598.614,I've read the briefs.
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2598.614,2600.144,--we say that.
1985.85-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2608.719,2612.452,"But everybody is arguing about a group gift, and it seems to me that's an individual gift, and that's why--"
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2612.452,2620.326,I think it's an individual gift made possible because there is a group that acting together can obtain this lower insurance.
1985.85-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2620.326,2628.223,"--And the government has conceded if you didn't attach the condition at the time of purchase of the policy but you sent them the dividend and they mailed it back, then there'd be no lawsuit."
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2628.223,2637.89,"The government has so conceded, and we think they have conceded the case because of the findings of the Claims Court which we commend to this Court, that that's exactly what happened here."
1985.85-599,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2639.761,2641.451,"Now, Mr. Gregory, let's back up a minute."
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2641.451,2642.623,"--Yes, Justice Marshall."
1985.85-599,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2642.623,2652.26,"Your point that the whole membership decides this, what procedure of the American Bar Association is for the whole membership to vote on anything?"
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2652.26,2657.452,"Mr. William Reece Smith, Jr. testified at this trial, Justice Marshall."
1985.85-599,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2686.805,2687.767,And how many times is that done?
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2687.767,2688.588,Well--
1985.85-599,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2688.588,2689.479,If ever?
1985.85-599,1,23983,francis_m_gregory_jr,,2689.479,2691.209,"--Oh, yes."
1985.85-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2800.283,2801.753,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Lauber."
1985.85-599,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2801.753,2805.705,A few points.
1985.85-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2860.322,2870.318,"But Mr. Lauber, is it correct that there is this dramatic difference in the amount of the dividends, something like 40 percent in this program, and in the three cases you cite, there is about 5 percent or 2 1/2 percent?"
1985.85-599,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2870.318,2874.802,"Well, the amount of the dividend is simply a function of the price that the Endowment charges."
1985.85-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2876.933,2879.885,"Well, that tends to show they were paying close to $200 for $100 worth of services, then."
1985.85-599,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2879.885,2884.619,But what that $100 is part of the price they are charging for the insurance.
1985.85-599,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2899.549,2912.877,"Well, the real comparison then for someone wanting to save money would have been to have the Bar Association organize the same thing but on a noncharitable basis, rather than go to some other insurance company."
1985.85-599,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2912.877,2917.131,"Well, if the Endowment... you mean the Endowment would just offer... not make any profits."
1985.85-599,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2917.131,2930.9,"If the American Bar Endowment insurance had not been designed to return any dividends but just to give lawyers the insurance protection at the minimum price, that would have been more favorable than the way it was set up."
1985.85-599,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2934.231,2935.321,That's right.
1985.85-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2985.175,2986.815,Let me ask one other question.
1985.85-599,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3002.176,3004.918,"Well, they haven't filed an amicus brief on our behalf."
1985.85-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3004.918,3006.938,"I hadn't noticed any, and I was just wondering what you would say about that."
1985.85-599,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3006.938,3013.333,The competitors of the Endowment here most directly would be other groups offering group insurance to--
1985.85-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3013.333,3015.183,"Like New York Life, would that be one of them?"
1985.85-599,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3015.693,3016.985,"--No, New York Life is an underwriter."
1985.85-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3048.956,3052.068,"I'm sorry, but I am really trying to learn something about this."
1985.85-599,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3067.649,3068.888,"Well, they could be."
1985.85-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3080.686,3082.619,And the Knights of Columbus program is exempt by a specific--
1985.85-599,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3082.619,3083.137,That's exempt.
1985.85-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3083.137,3083.678,--Yes.
1985.85-599,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3083.678,3087.542,But now there are other non... many noncharitable groups who also are trying to sell insurance.
1985.85-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3087.542,3092.494,So the market we are talking about in which the competition occurs is at least partially exempt from taxation.
1985.85-599,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3092.494,3100.819,"Part of the market is partially tax-exempt, but a great deal of it isn't as well, credit card companies, American Express, VISA, all the rest of them."
1985.85-599,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3228.122,3231.564,"Thank you, gentlemen."
