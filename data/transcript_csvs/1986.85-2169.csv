1986.85-2169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,15.401,"We will hear argument now in No. 85-2039, Saint Francis College versus Mahid Ghaidan Al-Khazraji, etcetera."
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,74.028,107.01,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves issues similar to that present in the prior discussion, and started by the filing of three complaints in the Western District of Pennsylvania by plaintiff Dr. Al-Khazraji charging various offenses under the civil rights laws of the United States."
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,258.721,260.26,What did the Court of Appeals hold?
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,260.26,267.726,"--The Court of Appeals, Your Honor, held here that Arabs do fall within the scope of Section 1981."
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,267.726,275.36,So the race issue was... rather than national original was before it.
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,275.36,276.562,"Oh, yes, indeed, it was."
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,281.204,292.281,"So we are reviewing a judgment of the Court of Appeals, so I am not sure the pleadings have got much to do--"
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,292.281,314.056,"Well, Your Honor, the point about getting into the pleading history and what have you is that the various pleadings are some indication that from the beginning the plaintiff here has been viewing this as a national origin claim and that Arab at least initially and to some extent has been characterized as being in the national origin category."
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,314.056,318.51,"--The Court of Appeals said... went on a racial ground, didn't it?"
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,318.51,324.825,"Yes, but I am discussing this in terms of, to use the phrases that were used previously, the--"
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,324.825,326.557,So you will discuss it on a racial ground.
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,326.557,328.538,"--Yes, I am... yes, I will, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,328.538,328.948,All right.
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,328.948,336.465,My position is really a rather simple one in this case.
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,413.974,426.313,He doesn't have in his allegations or in his proof things that are in the prior case that was argued--
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,426.313,426.894,Absolutely.
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,426.894,437.151,"--Namely, that he was discriminated on the grounds of race because that was the intent of the people who fired him."
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,437.151,448.167,"There is absolutely no evidence in the record to my knowledge, Your Honor, that there is any racial animus at all in terms of the decision that was made."
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,448.167,454.032,Or that the decision was made because they thought that he was of different race.
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,454.032,455.411,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,468.08,480.338,"So his argument, you say, is that he claims to have been discriminated on the grounds of race but concedes he is not of a different race?"
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,480.338,493.288,That is correct That is basically what we end up having here because the presumed discrimination was in relation--
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,493.288,499.139,How did the Court of Appeals come to such a... make such an error then?
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,499.139,526.828,"--Your Honor, all I can do is read the way the Court of Appeals dealt with the racial issue and defined it as being membership in a group that is ethnically and physiognomically distinctive, and that presumably would ignore the admission of the plaintiff that he in fact was a Caucasian and was presumably discriminated against in relation to other Caucasians."
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,526.828,535.063,"Well, ethnicity, that may be different from race, isn't it?"
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,535.063,537.186,"I would submit it is, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,540.709,549.037,You say the Court of Appeals applied the statute too broadly if it applied it just to ethnic groups.
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,549.037,556.481,"--I would suggest that it did, Your Honor, yes, that the language used in the statute talks about white-citizens."
1986.85-2169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,572.92,575.561,You say ethnicity is different from race.
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,580.186,587.459,"Your Honor, I have read the references to the Congressional Globe debates that are cited--"
1986.85-2169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.459,588.13,Never mind that.
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,592.394,621.943,"--Your Honor, I would submit that that is irrelevant, that the critical thing is that the statute is in terms of white citizens, and the contrast therefore to have a discrimination claim under 1981 has to be in reference to white, which is a racial characterization, and that you cannot contrast that and treat Germans or English or Greeks or Italians as being people within the scope of the statute."
1986.85-2169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.943,627.016,Even though they thought they were doing something about race in the sense that they understood race at that time.
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,627.016,641.744,"If the Court please, I do not think that the legislative history is anywhere near clear enough to indicate that that in fact is what the 39th Congress had in mind whenever they were going through the debates on the Civil Rights Act of 1866."
1986.85-2169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.891,670.403,"Well, I think it is clear that what they meant by race is something quite different from what we mean by race."
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,674.698,676.538,"--Justice Scalia, even if that is so--"
1986.85-2169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,676.538,683.383,"They meant a stock, a stock of people, whether it was ethnically distinct or not, but I--"
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,683.383,684.044,--Justice... I am sorry.
1986.85-2169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,684.044,696.763,"--I think the other point you are making I think is worth pursuing, and that is, does white person imply only color, or does it mean race?"
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,696.763,697.932,"Well, I--"
1986.85-2169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,697.932,699.063,You say it means just color.
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,699.063,703.025,--Color in the racial sense at least.
1986.85-2169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,703.025,704.758,Color in the racial sense at least.
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,704.758,740.531,"Because otherwise we start getting into the situation that we then start looking for 1981 purposes at the individual shades of the purported plaintiffs and then starting deciding what degree of darkness or lightness, depending on a particular situation, we are going to say is sufficiently distinctive so that we are going to get involved in saying that we are making out a Section 1981 claim because the purported favored group is dark and the purported aggrieved group is light or vice versa."
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,912.401,930.313,"If this person was denied tenure to make room for an Asian, say, he could stake a good claim under McDonald."
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,930.313,931.685,"I think that is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,931.685,934.015,Or to make room for a Negro.
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,934.015,937.96,"That, too, would be correct under McDonald."
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,937.96,941.64,"Well, how do we know what the facts are here?"
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,941.64,947.534,"Well, the only thing we have in the record at this point is that the only other person granted tenure--"
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,947.534,948.426,Was a white person.
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,948.426,953.899,"--was the plaintiff's wife, and she was granted tenure two years after he was turned down for tenure."
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,964.035,972.17,But his claim is that he was discriminated against because he was ethnically different.
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,972.17,975.913,The way the Third Circuit apparently has--
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,975.913,988.473,"Well, his claim must include discrimination based on ethnicity, on his different ethnic character, because he concedes he is not different racially."
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,988.473,989.294,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,996.225,1008.154,"Yes, but may I ask, he doesn't just limit it to ethnic differences, but at least the Court of Appeals ethnically and physiognomically distinctive."
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,1021.133,1025.397,"Justice Stevens, that is correct as far as the Third Circuit is concerned."
1986.85-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1030.571,1043.376,"No, but in order to prevail under the Third Circuit's theory, which we are reviewing, he would have to prove, as I understand it, that he was in a separate ethnic group and a separate group that was physiognomically distinctive from the general population."
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,1043.376,1044.598,"I think that is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1044.598,1047.52,So I mean there are two ingredients that are part of their test.
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,1047.52,1059.118,"Yes, if you treat that as a... I always get confused... as an ""and"" rather then as an ""or"" in terms of the requirement that both be present, that would--"
1986.85-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1059.118,1077.951,"And they would therefore fit into the point that Justice Scalia was suggesting earlier, that a given stock is subject to... if you are of a particular national origin which also has particular physical characteristics that make you identifiable, and then that group as a whole is subjected to discrimination, you fit this test."
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,1077.951,1085.497,"--If the reading that Justice Scalia is giving it is the appropriate, one, then I think what you say does follow."
1986.85-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1089.741,1092.643,"But see, it wouldn't necessarily cover every national origin claim."
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,1103.061,1105.713,"I suppose that might be true, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.632,1141.556,"Well, the Third Circuit wouldn't protect Germans on that basis."
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,1141.556,1142.656,It might.
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1142.656,1143.637,Well--
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,1143.637,1158.897,"I suppose it might decide or a factfinder could decide that German is an ethnic group, and that there are some physical characteristics that are uniquely enough belonging to Germans that one could end up saying they have been discriminated against under this particular test."
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1158.897,1164.09,--Or Irish.
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,1164.09,1182.092,"Same thing with Irish, I mean, presumably every ethnic group in one way or another, at least one way or another someone could end up saying they have physiognomically distinctive characteristics that fit within the stereotype of a particular ethnic group."
1986.85-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1182.092,1182.863,The Swiss.
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,1183.734,1217.555,"I mean essentially without rehashing what was said during the first argument, that essentially is our position, that there are really no precedents of the Court that would include the plaintiff here within Section 1981 that the statute itself should be read the way I have suggested that it should, that a claim here which is essentially a national origin claim does not fall within the scope of the statute."
1986.85-2169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1353.654,1361.201,"Well, do you think it is permissible, Mr. Fisfis, to go circuit by circuit on this retroactivity business?"
1986.85-2169,0,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,1361.201,1365.972,"Your Honor, obviously if the Court concludes that it is permissible, then it can be."
1986.85-2169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1523.376,1524.727,"Thank you, Mr. Fisfis."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1526.569,1557.05,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court, we are asking this Court today to decide whether Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 covers those of Arab ancestry."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1573.318,1575.71,[inaudible]
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1575.71,1576.791,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1576.791,1581.394,"Okay, you tell me how you get the word ""race"" to be relevant to the meaning of ""white person""."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1581.394,1594.433,"Your Honor, we look at the term 1866 Act was passed was that in the 1830s there was an influx of Irish and German."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.812,1626.203,Right.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1628.214,1628.835,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1628.835,1635.6,"I mean, I believe all of that, but the way to combat that would have been to use the word ""race"" in the statute."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1637.611,1638.242,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1639.641,1645.197,"So the dictionary definitions you should have given us were the dictionary definitions of ""white"" instead of the dictionary definitions of ""race""."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1645.197,1665.609,"--Your Honor, Senator Trumble, who was the author of the 1866 legislation, spoke to the purposes of the 1866 legislation and in that legislative history indicated that one of his objectives was to make sure that persons of all races and colors and previous conditions of servitude had equal rights under the law."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1665.609,1669.092,And that is the only thing you are going to rely on to get us to believe that the word--
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1669.092,1669.631,"No, that is not all, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.631,1672.184,"--that the word ""white person"" in the statute means ""race""?"
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1672.184,1683.131,"Your Honor, the concept of race was a generally understood term for the legislatures in those days to use in the sense that we now use the word ""ancestry""."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.823,1691.505,"Ms. Mitchell, I don't think you are understanding me."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1699.761,1701.323,"--That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1701.323,1702.653,So of what relevance is it then?
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1702.653,1711.207,It is relevant because this Court has indicated in several decisions that as a racial character of rights that 1981 was intended to protect.
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1734.943,1742.958,"And the only evidence that ""white person"" in the statute means ""race"" was the one snippet of legislative history you just quoted."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1742.958,1743.759,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1744.239,1747.653,"And you say later decisions of ours, which say it is--"
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1747.653,1748.154,--That is correct.
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1755.296,1758.168,--The term 1866 Act.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1758.168,1759.54,--That is--
1986.85-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1759.54,1760.742,How do you get around that?
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1760.742,1764.212,"--Your Honor, we look at the decisions of this Court."
1986.85-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1764.212,1766.015,"Well, how did this Court get around that?"
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1769.137,1769.687,"Your Honor, this Court has never addressed the issue."
1986.85-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.537,1775.899,[inaudible]
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1775.899,1784.655,"Well, Your Honor, if this Court has held that 1981 is intended to protect against racially motivated deprivals of the right to contract--"
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1784.655,1797.163,"The 1866 Act [inaudible] all citizens, all persons born here are declared to be citizens, and such citizens of every race and color--"
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1797.163,1800.186,--Are intended to enjoy equal rights under the law.
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.328,1802.627,"--Well, the word ""race"" is in the statute."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1802.627,1807.221,"That is correct, Your Honor, and if we go from that sentence--"
1986.85-2169,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1807.221,1809.352,"But what did the statue mean by ""white persons""?"
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1810.674,1815.847,"--Your Honor, the word 1966."
1986.85-2169,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1831.586,1836.219,"So ""white persons"" meant white Anglo-Saxon protestants?"
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1838.26,1854.552,"Your Honor, the term 1865 legislators, and it as this exact problem, the problem created by the Know-Nothing Party that certain legislators intended to correct under the 1866 Act."
1986.85-2169,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1860.827,1862.046,"Yes, but stop for just a minute."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1866.521,1882.799,"--In 1866, I believe that it was, for the additional reason that in 1866 immigration into this country was very severely limited to only races such as the Germans and the Irish in the east and the Chinese in the west."
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1900.772,1903.283,You are defending the Court of Appeals judgement here.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1903.283,1907.517,--I am partially defending it in the sense that they indicate--
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.517,1908.867,You mean you are not defending it totally?
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1909.638,1911.428,"--I am not defending their definition, Your Honor, for this reason."
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.17,1944.45,The test was what?
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1944.45,1952.247,--Their test is that one who is ethnically and physiognomically different may maintain a claim under 1981.
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.247,1953.556,"Yes, and you don't agree with that test?"
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1953.556,1963.693,We suggest that the proper test is that one who is of an ancestry viewed as different may maintain a claim under 1981.
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1973.379,1975.141,Viewed by whom?
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1979.084,1980.133,--Pardon me?
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1980.133,1981.835,"I am a Hatfield, and I don't like the McCoys."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1981.835,1982.765,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1982.765,1984.036,And I view all McCoys as bad.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1987.279,1990.98,"No, Your Honor, because they are not of a distinct ancestral group."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.192,1996.376,--Who decides who is a distinct ancestral... I think they are a distinct ancestral group.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,1998.218,2001.529,"--Your Honor, then you are into the subjective type of discrimination issue."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2001.529,2002.0,That is what I am trying to get at.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2003.742,2005.212,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2005.212,2011.997,--You have to know who the real McCoy is.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2014.387,2016.388,"Well, I am not, and you are probably not."
1986.85-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2027.416,2028.117,How--
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2028.117,2029.388,--the Jews have a certain ancestry.
1986.85-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2029.388,2033.201,--How easy does that ancestry word make it much easier?
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2044.987,2046.269,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2056.586,2060.899,In spite of the fact that Norway and Sweden were one country up until 1905?
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2060.899,2068.133,"--Your Honor, that makes no difference to us, and the reason is that country of origin is not a good test for that exact reason."
1986.85-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2069.345,2077.921,How about someone of Bavarian extraction suing someone of some other German area?
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2077.921,2090.749,"--Your Honor, if there is discrimination because of the ancestry of the person, if a college refuses to tenure Germans believing for whatever reason that they don't deserve to be tenured because of an ancestral--"
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.749,2097.592,What about discriminating against somebody he is a son or because she is a daughter of a felon?
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2097.592,2101.335,"--Your Honor, that is not ancestral discrimination, in our opinion."
1986.85-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2115.684,2120.968,"What if I don't like people who were born in Rhode Island, or the Rhode Island culture?"
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2120.968,2126.61,"Your Honor, I don't believe that ancestry takes into account your state as being one of the covered categories."
1986.85-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2126.61,2133.095,"If it can take into account someone born in Bavaria, why can't it take into account someone born in Rhode Island?"
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2133.095,2138.638,Because the common perception is that Rhode Island people are not of different ancestry than Pennsylvanians.
1986.85-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2138.638,2141.37,But that just answers the question by defining it.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2150.376,2159.693,"Your Honor, I don't believe that that is the type of ancestral discrimination that we want to cover under our test nor was it the type of ancestral discrimination that the 1866 Act--"
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.693,2165.035,"It may make a lot more sense than, say, Swedes and Norwegians."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2172.121,2178.615,"--Your Honor, the ancestral theory relates back to what was in the minds of the legislators in 1866."
1986.85-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2192.585,2200.439,"Ancestry means forebears, and all of these questions that have been put to you say what about this kind of forebears."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2206.802,2214.089,"Your Honor, I am trying to avoid a country of origin definition because I think country of origin is a very difficult thing."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2233.931,2239.936,"You didn't like McCoys either, and you know, that is why I picked McCoys, because they are all of the common ancestor."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2243.189,2247.133,--But they are not of the type of people that the 1866 Act was intended to protect.
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2247.133,2247.914,"--Oh, that is your second qualification."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2247.914,2249.093,That is the second--
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2249.093,2257.949,It has to be an ancestral group that the Congress in 1866 would have identified as a race.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2257.949,2261.592,"--That is certainly one workable definition, Your Honor, but then we get to the--"
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2261.592,2263.004,"Now, what does that mean?"
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2272.929,2279.113,"--We can look to the 1866 Congress usage of the term ""race"" to see what they meant."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2279.113,2280.074,I know we can.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2290.46,2291.802,That is the test that we are proposing.
1986.85-2169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2291.802,2292.563,That is the test you are proposing?
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2296.825,2311.464,"Your Honor, I think that there is enough language in the 1866 Act to suggest that those legislatures did view as separate races those coming from those discrete geographic areas which are perhaps now known as countries and perhaps not."
1986.85-2169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2311.464,2313.587,Let me just get one thing clear in my mind.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2324.544,2326.246,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2326.246,2335.332,--But you want us to in effect broaden the definition that they applied because I suspect maybe you have concern about whether your client can satisfy that element of the test.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2335.332,2336.762,"No, that is not correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.378,2346.99,I am wondering if you want to win the case.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2365.302,2368.705,"--Well, Your Honor, I believe that this Court can refine this notion of physiognomy."
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2368.705,2371.437,It isn't much of a refining.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2374.479,2377.32,"Your Honor, I reject it in part."
1986.85-2169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2419.079,2419.557,Don't worry about my father.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2422.088,2423.77,That is precisely the issue.
1986.85-2169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2423.77,2427.254,What would a resident of South Africa be classified as?
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2427.254,2435.979,"Your Honor, under the modern day classifications of race residents of South Africa are not classified at all."
1986.85-2169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2439.171,2439.909,You mean they don't exist?
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2439.909,2440.86,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2444.464,2449.727,What difference do you make between the people from Nigeria and the people from Sierra Leone?
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2449.727,2455.731,"--Your Honor, the people from Nigeria are Caucasian, because there is a portion of Caucasia--"
1986.85-2169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2455.731,2457.641,I have never seen one that looks like a Caucasian to me.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2458.783,2460.065,"--That is precisely... that is the point, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2466.029,2471.104,"Incidentally, I though Caucasians were from the Caucuses."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2471.104,2478.578,"--Your Honor, the original definition in 1854 was that it was a resident of the Caucuses Mountains between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea."
1986.85-2169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2478.578,2479.77,Well what Caucus are you from?
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2480.661,2482.392,"Your Honor, not from any right now."
1986.85-2169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2482.392,2483.861,But you are Caucasian.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2483.861,2484.752,"Beg pardon, Your Honor?"
1986.85-2169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2484.752,2486.264,But you are Caucasian.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2486.264,2492.067,I am what the EEOC has called the white European subdivision of the Caucasian race.
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2554.997,2564.054,"Well, you wouldn't mind us saying that, I suppose, as far as the Third Circuit went it was right."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2564.054,2571.119,"--If you choose to affirm the Third Circuit, Your Honor, my client would be very happy, but that is not our theory of this case."
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2571.119,2586.67,"Well, I know, but you certainly don't argue that if a person is ethnically identifiable and has these physical characteristics, that you shouldn't discrimination against him."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2586.67,2587.439,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2588.761,2590.531,"Well, you just want to argue some other case."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2599.447,2601.961,My particular concern with the Third Circuit--
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2601.961,2602.268,"Well, isn't that right, or not?"
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2602.268,2602.989,"--Yes, that is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.989,2605.721,"Well, you want to argue somebody else's case."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2605.721,2608.973,"Well, Your Honor, what I am attempting to do is to--"
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2608.973,2615.387,"So you would be very happy, I suppose, if you said we just don't reach the question of whether the statute is any broader than that."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2622.053,2624.494,--You do not have to reach that.
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2624.494,2624.924,"We just leave it open, just leave it open."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2624.924,2625.615,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2625.615,2626.715,You ought to be happy with that.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2626.715,2628.328,"Well, the issue, Your Honor, I think--"
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2628.328,2639.474,"Well, maybe you think the Third Circuit's test is so implausible that we are so unlikely to adopt it that you are trying to suggest one that would win for your client that is plausible."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2639.474,2640.256,"--Your Honor, I believe--"
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2640.256,2641.124,Maybe that is what you are trying to do.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2641.124,2652.911,"--I believe that the theory that we have suggested to this Court, the ancestry theory is one which is much more workable in the Federal District Courts as a threshold question for persons advancing a 1981 claim."
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2652.911,2653.592,"Ms. Mitchell, I--"
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2656.034,2657.566,"Part of it is, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.585,2659.186,Part of it?
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2665.13,2670.343,"Your Honor, the national origin question is a very difficult one that we need not address, first of all."
1986.85-2169,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2670.343,2674.357,"Well, isn't that what at the bottom of it all your test amounts to?"
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2674.357,2676.528,"Your Honor, I believe not."
1986.85-2169,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2692.657,2700.692,"Well, how can discrimination against Arabs because they are Arabs rather than Caucasians be anything but a national origin sort of a test?"
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2700.692,2714.42,"--Your Honor, we believe that it is a test that most properly focuses on the fact that those of Arab ancestry are, for instance, traditionally disadvantaged, viewed as different, of a different culture--"
1986.85-2169,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2714.42,2720.384,"Well, if it looks like a national origin test and sounds like a national origin test, is that what it is?"
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2720.384,2721.686,--It may be a national origin test.
1986.85-2169,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2722.517,2729.28,"And then what do we do with Jones, which says that doesn't get covered under the statute?"
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2729.28,2731.744,"--That is correct, Your Honor, but I believe that it would be--"
1986.85-2169,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2731.744,2735.054,So that is why you want to avoid calling it a national origin test.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2735.054,2735.495,--That is correct.
1986.85-2169,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2736.597,2738.547,Even though it looks like a national origin test.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2739.518,2740.85,In art it looks like national origin.
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2779.005,2783.126,"When you say were perceived to be, you don't mean by the people who committed the acts."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2783.126,2784.318,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2784.318,2784.859,You mean by society.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2784.859,2785.948,By society at large.
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2791.213,2794.943,You wouldn't have us look to modern dictionaries to figure out what is a race.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2796.906,2803.038,"Your Honor, I suggest that looking to any dictionary is going to give you 50 different answers to the same question."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2803.038,2812.896,"How do we find out whether society at large considered... I mean I think Jews is probably an easy question, but I don't know."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2823.304,2824.613,In 1866 the answer is very clear.
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2840.124,2847.287,"Now, your question regarding Justice Marshall's father leads me to believe you were here during the earlier argument."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2847.287,2848.739,"That is correct, I was."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2848.739,2869.353,What would your answer have been to the questions I was asking about whether the intent to discriminate has to be specifically directed to a dislike of the race as opposed to a dislike of some characteristic which one thinks people that race or of that whatever you want to call the group happen to share?
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2869.353,2882.75,"Your Honor, my answer to that question is that if a group such as Jews is discriminated against because of their ancestral characteristics and beliefs, they have a right under 1982."
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2897.062,2905.848,"What about the question I asked whether if I think Italians or French or you pick the racial group, I think they are sloppy and therefore I don't want to... I will not rent an apartment."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2905.848,2910.59,--Then I will sue you under Section 1982 and under Section 1981.
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.59,2910.99,It is not that I hate the French.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2913.172,2914.122,I believe that--
1986.85-2169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2914.122,2915.963,That is enough.
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2915.963,2919.295,"--you have discriminated, and it is covered under Section 1981."
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2919.295,2934.956,"But you would give a remedy to some person who discriminated against someone because he was from Sweden but the person says, well, I know the Swedes are not of a different race at all."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2939.538,2944.203,"Your Honor, whether the belief is mistaken is not at issue."
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2947.633,2960.482,"You would go back and say, well, just... you would say that, well, if that plaintiff was well advised he would know that he really is discriminating on a racial basis within the meaning of the statute."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2960.482,2963.043,--That is correct.
1986.85-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2984.398,2995.263,"Of course, it could be that there is racial retaliation or religious, violent religious conflict."
1986.85-2169,1,19632,caroline_mitchell,,2997.857,3006.611,"Well, it would be covered by 1981 or 1982 if the belief was an ancestral belief that Arabs are terrorists or that Jews are inferior."
1986.85-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3109.761,3113.011,"Thank you, Ms. Mitchell."
1986.85-2169,2,37100,nick_s_fisfis,,3116.042,3168.849,"If the Court please, I am just going to take about 30 seconds only to reply to the last matter on the remand, and may I suggest that if the court looks at the chronology of events the discharge of the plaintiff was in May of 1979, well before the statute of limitations... the two-year Pennsylvania statute of limitations would have run if that one is the... if the Court treats it as retroactive, and therefore anything that anybody may have said to the plaintiff about not doing anything and going through internal processes would not really have made any difference, because he still had plenty of time to file within the two-year period, so there is no basis for equitable estoppel in this situation, even if you believe the allegations in his affidavit that certain statements were made."
1986.85-2169,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3169.739,3170.97,"Thank you, Mr. Fisfis."
