1986.85-1708,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.509,"We will hear argument next in No. 85-1708, California versus Cabazon Band of Mission Indians."
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,61.322,75.11,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question presented in this case is whether state laws prohibiting high stakes gambling are applicable to tribal gambling operations, most of which feature bingo."
1986.85-1708,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,171.943,173.916,What do you mean by high stakes?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,173.916,178.871,"High stakes is, under California law is anything that exceeds $250."
1986.85-1708,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,190.588,192.879,That might be pretty high for you or me.
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,192.879,193.56,Pardon me?
1986.85-1708,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,193.56,195.57,That might be high for you or me.
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,195.57,204.987,"I think that... I would imagine that that is still fairly low stakes, certainly considering the type of tribal stakes that are involved here."
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,213.743,214.314,Maximum what?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,214.314,214.774,--Pardon me?
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,214.774,215.834,Per card?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,215.834,217.186,Per game.
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,217.186,218.307,Per game?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,218.307,218.786,Yes.
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,218.786,220.609,"Well, that involves only one card, doesn't it?"
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,221.19,231.606,"That is one tribal bingo game featuring one card, and the prizes, of course, vary from reservation to reservation, but some tribes... in this case--"
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,231.606,235.119,"But are you telling us you can win $15,000 in one game?"
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,235.119,236.898,"--Yes, that is correct."
1986.85-1708,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,259.855,266.137,"Does the record show how many participants there are in a game where there's a $100,000 prize?"
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,266.137,277.597,"It doesn't show that with respect to the $100,000, but we do know that the bingo parlor conducted by the Cabazon band has a seating capacity of 500 people."
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,285.06,291.114,"How much does each player have to invest in the $15,000 game?"
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,291.114,301.911,We don't have that information but I do think the record shows that the average player in one of the bingo games in Southern California spends on the average $84 per person.
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,303.243,304.392,"For the whole evening, you mean?"
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,304.392,305.003,Yes.
1986.85-1708,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,341.007,344.289,Don't the tribes claim that they regulate the games?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,344.289,349.131,The tribes claim that but in actuality we feel that there is no regulation at all.
1986.85-1708,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,363.851,373.087,"But that is true... if you think of tribal sovereignty as compared to state sovereignty, California wouldn't regulate the same way that Arizona does."
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,373.087,374.74,That's true.
1986.85-1708,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,425.434,426.455,Mr. Walston--
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,426.455,427.457,Yes.
1986.85-1708,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,427.457,433.639,"--the Interior Department does have certain guidelines for these bingo games, doesn't it?"
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,439.693,440.895,"I don't believe that is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1708,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,464.169,476.528,"Well, I suppose there is certainly no question but that the federal government has supported and encouraged the tribes to engage in these bingo operations."
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,476.528,480.171,"--I am not entirely sure that that is true, Your Honor."
1986.85-1708,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,483.373,484.112,You don't concede that?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,484.112,484.623,--Pardon me?
1986.85-1708,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,484.623,486.055,You don't concede that?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,486.055,486.603,"No, we don't."
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,516.283,527.052,"Isn't there legislation pending in the Congress now that would... federal legislation that would authorize these games and regulate them, too?"
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,527.052,538.759,"Well, there was an Indian bingo bill or an Indian gambling bill that passed the House and then passed a Senate Select Committee, but it was not approved on the floor of the House and as far as we understand--"
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,538.759,539.707,"That's because it was the end of the session, wasn't it?"
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,539.707,542.929,"--Well, yes, but there was more to it than that."
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,549.004,553.378,Would that bill have authorized the tribes to conduct these games?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,553.378,554.978,"--Yes, it would have."
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,554.978,557.412,And also have regulated how they conduct?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,557.412,561.113,"Yes, it would have provided both for authorization and for regulation."
1986.85-1708,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,584.42,587.071,Has the government filed a brief on this case?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,587.071,596.745,"--No, the federal government has not, and I think that the failure of the federal government to file a brief in this case speaks volumes concerning the ambivalence of the federal position in this case."
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,596.745,600.499,"Well, did the federal government support this bill in the Congress, the pending one?"
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,600.499,601.73,Did... I am sorry.
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,601.73,606.643,Did the Interior or any other agency of the federal government support the bill?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,606.643,609.845,"Well, I understand that the Interior Department supported the bill."
1986.85-1708,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,645.649,646.17,May I ask a question--
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,646.17,646.809,--Pardon?
1986.85-1708,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,646.809,647.75,--Mr. Walston?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,654.815,656.465,"No, I think I said the opposite."
1986.85-1708,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,656.465,668.984,"--how do you read the affidavit by Mr. Krenzke, Page 219 of the joint appendix?"
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,679.039,680.16,"Yes, I am familiar with the affidavit."
1986.85-1708,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,680.16,684.314,You think that does not represent the view of the Department of the Interior?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,684.314,704.246,"No, I... perhaps Your honor misunderstood me or perhaps I misspoke, but I thought what I said was that Interior basically supported the Indian gambling bill and supported the tribal activities here but the Justice Department apparently as far as we know feels differently, so the ambivalence in the federal position is between Interior and Justice."
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,707.859,715.944,"Isn't it true that the tribes rely on the proceeds from these games, indeed rather heavily, for support and--"
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,715.944,719.467,"Yes, that's... I think that is a fair statement."
1986.85-1708,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,756.492,767.799,"--The Ninth Circuit, perhaps not on the most strong evidence in the world, said that there had been a tradition of Indian gambling for a long time, didn't they, in their opinion?"
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,767.799,771.853,"No, the Ninth Circuit didn't say that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1708,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,821.244,823.075,May I just ask this question?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,844.549,845.551,Not in the record.
1986.85-1708,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,852.183,859.279,"Maybe I had better withdraw the question then, but you argue in your brief that that is a concern of the state of California."
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,859.279,859.809,Yes.
1986.85-1708,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,896.884,899.724,How long has this bingo been doing on?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,899.724,903.658,"Since 1983, March, 1983."
1986.85-1708,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,995.408,1004.094,"Well, I suppose nothing would prevent the Department of Interior from adopting some kind of further regulation."
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1004.094,1007.927,"That is true, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1030.132,1031.422,Has California [inaudible]?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1031.422,1033.255,Has California?
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1033.255,1035.946,Asked Interior to do something about it?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1035.946,1060.941,"California has indeed recommended passage of on of the Indian gambling bills subject to stringent regulations, and I should add that California did not recommend adoption of the bill that passed the House and that passed the Senate Select Committee because California felt, as does the Department of Justice, that that bill does not go far enough to prevent organized criminal infiltration."
1986.85-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1067.196,1076.483,"Mr. Walston, is the prevention of organized crime infiltration the only state interest in controlling gambling?"
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1076.483,1092.442,"No, the other interest, Justice Stevens, is that the success of the tribal games, as I mentioned at the outset, depends upon their illegality under California law, and that they allow non-Indians to play bingo, high stakes bingo in violation of state law."
1986.85-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1125.145,1137.233,"I understand that, but do you allege there is any other state interest in placing limits on the games as you have no more than $250 in a bingo game and a lot of other things that are illegal gambling?"
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1143.047,1148.37,"No, that is the major interest that California has in placing limits on charitable bingo."
1986.85-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1148.37,1149.872,Just to keep organized crime out?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1149.872,1172.906,"Yes, our view is that if the low stakes limits were eliminated and if charitable organizations were allowed to hire outside operators rather than conduct the games themselves, then under those circumstances organized crime may well take control of charitable bingo operations in California, but as I said, the stakes are kept low and under California law--"
1986.85-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1172.906,1179.158,"Do you think historically that has been the only basis for state prohibition or regulation of gambling, is to keep organized crime out of the business?"
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1179.158,1181.281,"--Well, I suppose--"
1986.85-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1181.281,1184.824,It has been a long time that gambling was considered contrary to public policy.
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1184.824,1186.545,--I suppose there is another element--
1986.85-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.545,1188.194,You just happened to think of that?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1188.194,1194.699,--and I suspect that what you are leading to is the possibility that the state may have some moral objections to unregulated gambling.
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1194.699,1195.901,"Protecting its citizens against their appetites, isn't it?"
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1195.901,1196.271,Pardon me?
1986.85-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1196.271,1199.494,Protecting its citizens against their appetites.
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1199.494,1200.633,"Yes, that is true."
1986.85-1708,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1202.546,1204.767,"But California allows other sorts of gambling, doesn't it?"
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1204.767,1205.127,--Yes.
1986.85-1708,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1205.127,1206.149,Such as what?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1206.149,1208.578,California allows a state lottery.
1986.85-1708,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1214.793,1215.694,And horseracing?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1215.694,1220.767,"Right, so I do not... in response to Justice Stevens' question, I am not--"
1986.85-1708,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1220.767,1222.82,It is sort of hard to get moral when you hit bingo.
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1223.19,1229.721,--I have deliberately not tried to advance a moral argument before this Court.
1986.85-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1265.576,1277.754,Doesn't Colorado or California's efforts here go beyond protecting or preventing the Indians from offering this service or marketing this gambling to non-Indians?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1280.205,1282.556,I don't quite understand your question.
1986.85-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1282.556,1287.221,What does California want to do to these bingo games?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1289.282,1291.893,Unless they are compliant with California law.
1986.85-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1291.893,1298.318,"Well, suppose the Indians said, all we want to do is have a bingo game for Indians."
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1298.318,1299.75,"Oh, for Indians."
1986.85-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1302.261,1306.435,I thought you were still insisting that you had the right to regulate them.
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1306.435,1317.799,"--I think that the factors, the elements, and the dynamics of the case would be vastly different if Indians were playing bingo on the reservation with other Indians."
1986.85-1708,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1343.528,1346.169,Even though that might attract criminal elements just as well.
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1352.234,1358.127,"--That is true, but still the balance of interest we think might indeed support that kind of tribal operation."
1986.85-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1358.127,1362.19,California law on its face would prevent that.
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1362.19,1363.501,"Well, that's true."
1986.85-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.1,1392.889,"So your argument is, well, really, this is just Indians dealing with a non-Indian situation, and if you can keep them from selling cigarettes to non-Indians you ought to be able to keep the non-Indians out of their bingo game."
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1392.889,1395.911,--I think that is essentially much of our argument.
1986.85-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.911,1397.283,What else is it?
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1397.283,1409.329,"Well, the fact that the Court did hold in Coleville that Indian tribes do not have a vested right to sell-products to non-Indians."
1986.85-1708,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1421.257,1427.582,"Well, one reason the state approves and regulates horseracing is that it gets a lot of revenue."
1986.85-1708,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1437.252,1442.035,"No, California gets money from the state lottery and the state horseracing act, but it does not get money from charitable bingo."
1986.85-1708,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1586.989,1588.719,"Thank you, Mr. Walston."
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,1590.391,1613.076,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I think we have seen a bit of equivocation on the part of the state here this afternoon."
1986.85-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1636.0,1642.174,"Well, Mr. Feldman, is that fair... if you just put a $250 limit on the game they wouldn't want to shut you down, would they?"
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,1642.174,1643.707,"--No, that is not correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1659.906,1662.409,Who are allowed?
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,1663.499,1675.237,"It is defined in terms of the state tax code if you are subject or not subject to certain aspects of California state taxes, but specific ones, and they detail the organizations."
1986.85-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1680.93,1681.231,I see.
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,1687.785,1689.916,"Well, the other point that is important here is this."
1986.85-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1714.082,1721.656,"Well, in the case of the tribe with only nine adult members I suppose the tribe also has an interest in opening it to the general public."
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,1721.656,1736.807,"Certainly the tribal interest is congruent with the state interest here, but my point is that if the tribes were to limit their games only to tribal members, regardless of how large or how small, they would be in violation of California state law."
1986.85-1708,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1736.807,1757.43,"Mr. Feldman, I guess the most obvious concern about your position in the case is the concern we would have that the tribes are marketing an exemption from state law and the analogy to the cigarette tax situation as in Coleville."
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,1757.43,1763.905,"Well, Your Honor, we think the situation here is considerably different than that presented in Coleville."
1986.85-1708,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1848.9,1853.643,Do you think the tribes could open casino gambling on the reservation?
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,1853.643,1856.204,The answer to that is clearly no.
1986.85-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1881.241,1885.342,"Well, doesn't that law say unless the state permits it?"
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,1885.342,1888.604,--There may be... there might be--
1986.85-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1888.604,1892.758,"Well, how else would there be gambling in any state with these devices?"
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,1892.758,1896.629,"--This applies only on Indian reservations, on federal reservations."
1986.85-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1908.067,1909.138,All right.
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,1909.138,1928.91,"Getting back to the question of marketing an exemption, the key element there, I think, was that the tribes were not providing what was called value generated on the reservation."
1986.85-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1946.492,1957.001,"Could I ask you, does this tribe... is this tribe required to submit any of its ordinances or laws, tribal laws to the secretary?"
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,1957.001,1960.504,Neither the Cabazon or Marango bands are required to.
1986.85-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1966.268,1970.377,"And they were approved pursuant to an authority the Secretary has, expressly has?"
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,1970.377,1970.808,Yes.
1986.85-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1984.529,1994.254,"Mr. Feldman, with reference to recreational services on the reservation, what if the services were the opportunity to consume drugs on the reservation?"
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,1994.254,2009.804,"--Well, our position is really pretty straightforward, that if the activity is prohibited by the state, then under Public Law 280 that prohibition applies equally on the reservation."
1986.85-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2009.804,2015.197,Isn't the activity of bingo at more than 250 jackpots prohibited by the state?
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2015.197,2024.544,"No, the question is what activity is involved, and in this case bingo is permitted but regulated under California law."
1986.85-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2025.425,2032.459,"You can really get into some hairsplitting about, you know, whether something is prohibited or whether it is regulated."
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2035.962,2059.376,"--I cannot deny that the test Isn't going to result in absolute clarity in every instance, but the test that has been developed and been applied by every federal court that has considered... every lower federal court that has considered this question has allowed them... first of all, it is consistent with this Court's holding in Bryan."
1986.85-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2069.704,2070.713,Did it hold that?
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2079.84,2085.744,There may be a federal law that would cover that.
1986.85-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2088.705,2101.715,"No, but I am just assuming the only... that there is a state regulation of the activity, not a total prohibition, as I presume there is in Nevada, that in that state the Indian tribes could operate unregulated under your theory."
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2101.715,2112.631,"If the state permits local option on prostitution, then yes, our view is that a tribal government is equivalent to a city or state or county government."
1986.85-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2112.631,2113.413,"No, I didn't say local option."
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2124.49,2129.585,It could go forward subject to federal and tribal regulation.
1986.85-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2129.585,2129.881,By analogy to the bingo... yes.
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2129.881,2133.395,I think there has got to be an element of common sense provided here.
1986.85-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2144.932,2145.643,"Well, let me ask you this then."
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2156.131,2157.23,Would we no longer nave what?
1986.85-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2157.721,2164.246,Would you no longer be able to operate if the Secretary of Interior had a different view about the propriety of gambling?
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2164.246,2166.427,Not necessarily.
1986.85-1708,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2179.526,2197.058,"Well, but what if we in applying the balancing test thought that that was the factor that tipped the scale, and then if, as Justice Stevens suggests, a new Secretary of the Interior had a different view, the situation would change."
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2197.058,2202.621,"Well, administrations do change, and federal policies towards Indians change."
1986.85-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2209.847,2213.227,Was your management contract required to be presented to the Secretary?
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2213.227,2219.301,"Yes, under 25 USC Section 81, contracts of this type must be approved."
1986.85-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.301,2220.252,But your ordinance wasn't?
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2220.252,2223.835,"That's correct, ordinances are not mandatorily--"
1986.85-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.835,2232.952,"So if the Secretary withdrew his approval of your management contract in order to get around that you would have to get his decision overturned in court, I suppose."
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2232.952,2234.852,--Or get rid of the management company.
1986.85-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2234.852,2240.306,"Well, in which event you would have to present another management contract, I suppose."
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2240.306,2241.327,"No, not necessarily."
1986.85-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.446,2282.253,Did the state know you were submitting to the Secretary those ordinances and the management contract for approval?
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2285.195,2288.678,--I don't think that's a matter of the state's concern.
1986.85-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2291.048,2302.486,"Well, if I wanted the best place I would suppose that they might have opposed this administrative decision to permit it, but they didn't, anyway."
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2302.486,2303.688,"--No, not that I'm aware of."
1986.85-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2303.688,2304.296,All right.
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2304.296,2309.271,"I certainly don't know what communication there may have been, but I am not aware of any such communication."
1986.85-1708,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2370.022,2379.328,"California is saying that bingo would be like sand and sagebrush but for the fact that California doesn't allow it, that it is only--"
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2379.328,2382.19,"--There is certainly nothing in the record to support that, Your Honor."
1986.85-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2457.07,2461.823,--Do you think the state has an interest in regulating the kind of disclosure that is made to prospective customers?
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2462.213,2466.965,--I think that we haven't reached that issue.
1986.85-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2508.726,2519.303,Why do people drive 70 or 80 miles then to play this game if they do that when they could just drive a couple miles to a charitable game closer to home?
1986.85-1708,1,25315,glenn_m_feldman,,2519.303,2522.253,"Well, there is nothing that indicates how far people come from."
1986.85-1708,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3491.827,3494.158,"Just a few comments, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1708,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3602.617,3603.028,Excuse me.
1986.85-1708,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3607.181,3607.932,Yes.
1986.85-1708,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3607.932,3615.176,Why doesn't that statute cover their attendance at charitable bingo within the state of California?
1986.85-1708,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3615.176,3617.239,"Well, at a lottery that is not authorized by law."
1986.85-1708,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3689.496,3699.012,"Has the Attorney General's office or the... who enforces this law, this lottery law, California lottery law?"
1986.85-1708,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3699.012,3705.466,"Mainly local law enforcement agencies, local sheriffs and police departments."
1986.85-1708,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3705.466,3707.617,I suppose they've got a lot to do.
1986.85-1708,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3711.7,3718.734,"Well, when there is a potential violation, yes, people do indeed complain, and--"
1986.85-1708,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3718.734,3721.195,"Well, I know, but whom does it make any difference to?"
1986.85-1708,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3721.195,3725.379,"--Well, I suppose the--"
1986.85-1708,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3725.379,3733.153,Whom do you think... you must have some idea who is complaining about these Indian lotteries.
1986.85-1708,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3733.153,3736.626,"--Actually, there are very few complaints about charitable bingo."
1986.85-1708,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3736.626,3740.189,This is just an energetic local prosecutor in Riverside County?
1986.85-1708,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3740.189,3743.532,Are you talking now about the tribal games or the charitable games?
1986.85-1708,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3743.532,3744.84,"No, the tribal games."
1986.85-1708,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3744.84,3745.932,"Oh, the tribal games are--"
1986.85-1708,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3745.932,3746.753,Who is complaining about it?
1986.85-1708,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3746.753,3751.556,--are opposed by a wide number of law enforcement agencies in California.
1986.85-1708,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3752.457,3754.828,"All right, but they just don't do it on their own, do they?"
1986.85-1708,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3754.828,3756.849,"--Well, they feel very strongly about it, Your Honor."
1986.85-1708,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3757.8,3761.944,"They must... a lot of them are elected, aren't they?"
1986.85-1708,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3761.944,3766.456,"--Well, they are, and when the new fellow gets elected he comes in and complains it, too."
1986.85-1708,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3766.456,3773.101,"Well, what part of his constituency is complaining?"
1986.85-1708,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3774.092,3776.564,The charities themselves are--
1986.85-1708,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3776.564,3777.372,Are really--
1986.85-1708,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3777.372,3778.303,--Yes.
1986.85-1708,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3778.303,3779.755,--There is competition.
1986.85-1708,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3781.196,3781.466,Yes.
1986.85-1708,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3785.019,3792.132,So I wouldn't think a local prosecutor would get so excited unless there might be a question of votes or something.
1986.85-1708,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3792.132,3800.129,"--Well, I... no, there is a vast opposition to charitable... tribal bingo in California, and much of the opposition--"
1986.85-1708,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3800.129,3800.689,From the charities.
1986.85-1708,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3800.689,3802.108,--does indeed come from charities.
