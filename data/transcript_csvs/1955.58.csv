1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,25.171,28.407,If the Court please.
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,824.352,830.992,I'm not sure I caught what -- in your view is irrelevant in your request to Judge Weinfeld who examined the grand jury now.
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,830.992,848.429,"We thought that if Judge Weinfeld examined the grand jury minutes, he would see there was no evidence of crime that the grand jury, in calling this inquiry, was engaged in a general dragnet inquiry as to whether somebody was a member of the Communist Party, but really, it wasn't searching for evidence of espionage and it had no evidence of espionage before it."
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,848.429,854.535,Only derived that from the minutes from what the -- the Assistant U.S. Attorney in charge told the grand jury --
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,854.535,855.748,That possibly and that --
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,855.748,856.869,-- or the witnesses.
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,856.869,864.964,"Or from an examination of Ms. Bentley's own testimony before the grand jury, which might have exposed what we think has been happening in the last 10 years."
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,865.917,872.077,"For those minutes -- assuming he had grant your motion, would– would the minutes have to be drawn over to you?"
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,872.077,879.288,"We explicitly indicated, as I remember the transcript, that while we go -- we had a right to them, we at least one of the judge to see them."
1955.58,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,890.572,892.23,Did you bring that question here?
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,892.23,893.821,"Yes, we brought the entire issue here."
1955.58,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,894.978,896.719,How -- how did you raise it here?
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,896.719,900.025,"Well, we stated -- we stated in the court below that Judge Weinfeld --"
1955.58,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,900.025,902.731,(Voice Overlap) presented in your brief.
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,902.731,903.854,We have stated in our brief.
1955.58,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,905.525,906.554,The writ of certiorari --
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,906.554,906.833,Your Honor?
1955.58,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,906.833,908.332,-- on page 5.
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,908.332,916.44,That -- may I come to that in a moment so we can check that.
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1131.338,1143.85,"Before -- before you do that Mr. Boudin, may I trouble you to help me know where I can see precisely what this witness was asked, his testimony."
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1143.85,1144.872,Of Course.
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1159.112,1167.173,"I don't -- I just want to know if -- and the order is to answer the question set forth on pages 2, 3 and 4."
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1167.173,1170.198,And all other questions relating thereto.
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1172.197,1172.613,Was that --
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1172.613,1173.792,-- to those particular questions.
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1173.792,1174.214,Was that the order?
1955.58,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1174.214,1175.09,But where --
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1175.09,1175.561,Yes.
1955.58,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1175.561,1176.758,Where -- where is the order?
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1176.758,1179.449,The order appears at page 44 of the record.
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1179.449,1181.887,"Does it say, “And all of the purpose it uses?”"
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1181.887,1194.514,"It gives us the equivalent language of –- yes, to produce evidence with -- this is on page 44, “With respect to matters on the inquiry before said grand jury.”"
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1207.033,1208.298,I don't -- at page 44?
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1208.298,1209.534,"Yes, sir, page 44 of the record."
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1214.346,1216.213,This amendment pursuant to the provisions.
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1216.213,1219.995,It begins with the word “accordingly” on page 44 of the record.
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1219.995,1220.868,"Oh, yes."
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1248.075,1249.068,I would think so.
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1252.458,1254.36,Would he -- or would he (Voice Overlap) –-
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1254.36,1255.9,Or he would be guilty of contempt.
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1255.9,1259.2,-- he would be guilty in Court of contempt if he -- what I read is that involved.
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1259.2,1263.042,I do not think that that is my -- I said I want to rest on -- I don't want to rest on that point.
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1263.042,1264.634,I think you're resting on it.
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1264.634,1266.179,I don't want to rest on that point.
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1270.526,1271.49,"Well, I'm not asking --"
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1271.49,1272.67,"Yes, I know you're not asking me that."
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1272.67,1279.541,(Voice Overlap) and I want to hear it but I just want to know what – it bares on from my point of view the function of a judge.
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1279.541,1281.433,I am not surrendering that point.
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1316.983,1319.147,But it isn't merely that.
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1325.185,1326.363,"Of course, of course."
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1326.363,1327.742,-- and it's not involved in those cases.
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1327.742,1328.984,"That's correct, sir."
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1330.411,1337.736,"And therefore, what it is that the Judge is empowered to purge by his traditional order used to be irrelevant with his (Voice Overlap) --"
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1337.736,1338.659,Your Honor is quite right.
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1351.792,1356.718,(Voice Overlap) -- neutral words that judges are filing that the immunity -- some of the immunity covers.
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1356.718,1359.131,"Yes, sir, I'll accept that modification."
1955.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1442.151,1445.198,(Inaudible) are you going to give me bill of particulars for that reasons?
1955.58,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1445.198,1452.045,"I'm going to give you -- now, I'll give you the bill of particulars, quite right."
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,3441.202,3443.698,May it please the Court.
1955.58,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4044.903,4047.596,Would you -- would you submit a memo of that to us please?
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4047.596,4053.286,"Yes, I'll be glad to, Your Honor."
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4258.552,4268.117,"Mr. Barber, I suppose you are suggesting that the presidential bargaining -- presidential bargaining business deal with this problem."
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4276.171,4279.445,The --
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4279.445,4280.644,Either just as that and I (Voice Overlap) --
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4280.644,4283.559,I think that is -- is a little bit in doubt.
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4290.054,4291.329,Yes.
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4291.329,4308.109,"Since that time, the Court so held, referring to this Wilson case but there is a more recent case which involved a pardon where a -- a sentence of death was reduced to a sentence of life imprisonment."
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4347.577,4349.591,And this is to this Court?
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4349.591,4350.376,"Yes, it was sir."
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4350.376,4354.444,"Well, it does goes often."
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4359.166,4362.148,The --
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4362.148,4365.767,Did Congress passed general amnesty statutes?
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4365.767,4376.853,The -- the statute which Congress passed after the Civil War has usually been -- often been referred to where the general amnesty statute and that was upheld.
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4382.624,4384.726,That's a different story.
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4384.726,4385.114,And -- yes.
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4385.114,4387.821,(Inaudible) except as to power of the statute.
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4387.821,4387.916,Yes.
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4387.916,4393.693,"In other words, the Congress can view on this problem by general amnesty statute."
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4393.693,4394.707,"I think it could, yes."
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4394.707,4395.939,Unless they're subject to --
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4395.939,4397.846,I suggest that this is a sort of extension of amnesty.
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4397.846,4401.605,(Voice Overlap) one of the statute they're supposed to make.
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4401.605,4402.288,I'm not sure I understand the point.
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4402.288,4419.61,(Voice Overlap) that the power of the Congress to pass at the amnesty is ambiguous to surrender to withhold history from the acceptance of the same (Inaudible)
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4419.61,4422.289,I don't -- I'm sorry I don't get this point.
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4422.289,4426.178,My question is suppose the constitutionality of that statute.
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4426.178,4426.541,Yes.
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4426.541,4431.392,And I'm suggesting that it wouldn't -- may have had power of Congress to pass that statute.
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4431.392,4431.723,"Well, if he --"
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4431.723,4433.561,I -- I suppose that general amnesty statute --
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4433.561,4433.719,He --
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4433.719,4434.075,would be (Voice Overlap) --
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4434.075,4444.21,"Yes, yes, he is heading directly into -- weigh the -- weigh the authority to go back 200 years to the origin of that authority."
1955.58,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4966.339,4973.082,You're -- you're addressing yourself right at this problem but only to the problem of statutory construction.
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4973.082,4977.811,"I'm addressing myself to the problem of statutory construction, yes, sir."
1955.58,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4977.811,4983.071,And you're going to take up the question of the constitutional power of Congress to do this or you're combining the --
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,4983.071,4994.027,Well I -- maybe we can look together at the statute and then I will state the rationale on which we rely.
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5227.675,5233.82,Congress hasn't done -- Congress has intervened between itself in the controversies of the Act and the action (Inaudible)
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5259.222,5274.153,"Let me, first, in explanation of my suggestion point to the fact that I referred to the command in the last sentence of the statute which says “But no such witness shall be prosecuted.”"
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5279.057,5297.42,"But suppose -- suppose the Congress -- suppose this statute had said in words and the court – and if the Court shall, within its discretion the Congress such application having been duly made issue at all."
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5297.42,5297.694,If it said --
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5297.694,5298.622,Could that be the problem?
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5302.017,5303.401,"Yes, I think it would present a different problem."
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5303.401,5309.985,This serious problem -- this serious problem is conferring juries upon court which the Court has no business to exercise?
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5309.985,5316.396,That is the problem which we will have to discuss for sure.
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5320.22,5338.925,"Now, I suggest for the purpose that you cannot separate, you cannot discuss (c) without discussing (a) and (b), and seeing whether what is written carries with its differences which -- which do not -- it would admit the series of questions in (a) and (b)."
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5338.925,5339.203,Yes.
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5339.203,5351.674,Is there a (c) either in the language that makes it entirely different and if you're right as ultimately that at the ministerial act that the -- the District Court is mandamus.
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5351.674,5353.389,"Yes, I should think so."
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5353.389,5356.103,What is their aim in the language?
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5378.876,5386.2,"Before embarking on that discussion, I would like to say that I wouldn't conceive for a moment that the function of the District Court would be a rubber stamp function."
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5386.2,5388.353,"By ministerial, I would draw a lot of ministerial."
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5388.353,5389.854,"Yes, sir."
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5414.845,5415.211,Well --
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5415.211,5416.3,If we look down in --
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5416.3,5418.974,-- if we know how to -- is -- the argument was made from (Inaudible)
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5418.974,5421.402,"Yes, but I – I have to point out that it is --"
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5421.402,5423.245,You have a right to say that.
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5427.91,5437.948,"Further to the same effect is the language in the fifth line from the bottom, “And thereafter, having secured the approval of the United States District Court.”"
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5487.317,5495.507,"Spare on -- spare on this aspect to recall it, Congress has given you if it's to say that he did say approval as to both."
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5495.507,5510.12,"It's fair to say he did say approval as to both and it's fair also to notice that the House Committee Report, which this Court has said from time to time, is the authority when this conflict does distinguish in a murky way between the two."
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5510.12,5513.321,"Well I -- as you know, I don't -- I still think it's murky."
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5513.321,5513.512,Yes.
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5513.512,5521.728,"So why should -- why if you have to do that kind of crab walking, at least I have to do on this two section."
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5545.344,5550.346,"Well, I'm -- I'm speculating because I have to reason from the fact."
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5748.642,5776.855,"On the other hand, if it is to contend or would have to contend that immunity extends the State, the potential state prosecution, there's another individual and just might have wanted (Inaudible) whether it's desirable to this plaintiff, the immunity and practices administrated."
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5776.855,5782.578,That is an original suggestion in the sense that I have seen no inquiry of it and I can suggest another.
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5872.192,5889.7,"Mr. Barber, you -- you have to get the Court in somehow a grip on -- on the -- in order to make a section to your sanction apart from the congressional power to overcome this intent in connection with this (Inaudible)"
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5899.9,5900.578,Of course.
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5925.546,5927.936,(Inaudible)
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5927.936,5928.401,Yes.

1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,5998.041,6004.87,I think that's -- that certainly is our position.

1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,6041.178,6050.375,"Yes, sir."
1955.58,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,6050.375,6079.456,"Do you find any inconsistency in the statute of Section (c) where it -- that no such witness shall be prosecuted that takes the defendant to enforce to on account of any transaction, matter or a thing concerning which is to tell in testifying and the latter clause nor shall testimonies so compelled we use as evidence in any criminal proceeding against him in any court?"
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,6079.456,6084.964,"On that particular question, we do have legislative history that explains it."

1955.58,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6150.998,6160.474,"While the clause was added, it might prefer only to testimony that he gave instead of the crime which he might be charged it upon."
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,6160.474,6161.284,Yes.
1955.58,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6184.294,6188.436,Even though -- even though they didn't understand anything about state courts?
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,6188.436,6190.484,"Yes sir, yes, sir."
1955.58,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6229.039,6233.254,"From your point of view then, the addition of the last clause was unnecessary."

1955.58,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6235.3,6237.795,(Voice Overlap) of caution.

1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6458.756,6465.245,"I'm bound -- I don't quite see the relevance of this because if I accept your views, it's unreviewable."

1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6466.558,6468.111,Pardon me?
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,6468.111,6469.608,I should assume not.

1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6501.994,6508.065,-- that come from such explicitness.
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,6508.065,6518.379,"Well, this is in the area of reviewability of judicial -- of administrative discretion where the discretion had been placed in the Executive Department."
1955.58,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6521.44,6524.544,What do you mean there by discretion?
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,6525.819,6526.167,Take to --
1955.58,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6526.167,6547.806,I thought -- I had understood your argument to be that Congress had delegated to the Attorney General a complete power to determine whom he could summon before the grand jury or whatever it is and that after that summon had occurred that would be a complete immunity given.
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,6547.806,6548.344,That's correct.
1955.58,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6564.148,6565.356,Of the granting of the immunity?
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,6565.356,6587.174,"Of the granting of immunity, and I'm -- my answer is that I am not prepared to say that there would be no circumstances where the Court would not have a function, would not -- under the law as we know it, would not have the power to restrain that exercise."
1955.58,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6587.174,6587.991,"In your judgment, can you --"
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,6587.991,6591.963,But that's -- that time is taking it to the most extreme case.
1955.58,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6591.963,6602.327,"In your judgment, does the statute give the Attorney General the power to delegate his power and (Inaudible)"
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,6602.327,6606.586,"I don't think so, and I don't think so."
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6656.504,6656.947,I – I suppose what you --
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,6656.947,6662.533,"The -- the question whether it could be delegated to an Assistant Attorney General, it isn't this case."
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6665.312,6675.381,I suppose what you meant of unimaginable -- the report to serve by this (Inaudible) about this case.

1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6711.545,6712.122,As you think --
1955.58,1,18345,charles_f_barber,,6712.122,6716.186,I'm not sure how far would that carry me and if I thought about it --
1955.58,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6716.186,6727.059,I should think that anybody as Attorney General once you gift or not or couldn't give any -- draw a doctrine that would -- would indicate in (Inaudible) mind as he had.
