2013.13-461,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.087,"We'll hear argument next in Case 13-461, American Broadcasting Companies v. Aereo."
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,7.82,10.622,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-461,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,41.993,43.293,Why aren't they cable companies?
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,43.293,44.695,They're not--
2013.13-461,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,44.695,49.847,I'm looking at the -- everybody's been arguing this case as if for sure they're not.
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,72.546,73.964,"--They're taking the signals, right."
2013.13-461,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,73.964,74.598,"--I'm sorry, they are."
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,99.347,101.382,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, a couple of things."
2013.13-461,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,118.243,119.26,But it just gets it mixed up.
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,129.633,130.468,"Well, no."
2013.13-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,153.75,154.25,Yes.
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,154.833,155.4,--Exactly.
2013.13-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,155.4,156.316,That isn't the question.
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,156.316,159.654,"Well, here's the other thing is I think--"
2013.13-461,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,159.654,160.67,The question is are they?
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,160.67,162.356,--I don't think they are.
2013.13-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,180.068,183.936,"But I'd still like to know the answer to the question, in your opinion."
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,220.643,227.964,"Well, I don't think they are ultimately a cable company, and we could debate that question, but it's not the question before you."
2013.13-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,231.516,236.654,"Well, perhaps we should remand it, because my reason for wanting to decide it is what I said."
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,259.77,266.089,"But, Justice Breyer, I think it's very important to -- to understand that even if they're a cable company, it doesn't make all these problems go away."
2013.13-461,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,315.754,327.578,"Is your definition -- I mean, Justice Breyer has already asked you -- said he's troubled about the phonograph store, and -- and the Dropbox and the iCloud."
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,362.751,363.27,Okay.
2013.13-461,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,363.72,378.53,"How do I -- what do I do to avoid -- what do we do, not me, but what does the Court do to avoid a definition or an acceptance of a definition that might make those people liable?"
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,378.53,379.113,--Okay.
2013.13-461,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,412.018,413.353,What if you get it through Dropbox?
2013.13-461,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,413.353,418.755,"Well, that's something else before you get to Justice Sotomayor's second half of the question, but something more along the lines of providing hardware."
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,438.568,449.626,"I think the end user would be doing a performance, but it would be a purely private performance, and I don't think the person that sold them the hardware or really anybody else, if I understand your hypo, would be involved in a performance."
2013.13-461,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,455.513,459.315,"But then it really does depend on, like, where the -- where the hardware is."
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,473.908,480.245,"Well -- and, again, I think that goes to what I was about to say, which is let's just not because, you know, we like one better than the other."
2013.13-461,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,522.222,528.978,"So you think that in my hypo, there's a performance, but it's a private performance and then you move the hardware and it becomes a public performance."
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,529.411,536.915,"--It -- it becomes a public performance on behalf of the sender, but it still would be a private performance on behalf of the receiver."
2013.13-461,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,577.226,579.844,So Roku is -- Roku is paying a license for no reason.
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,579.844,581.713,I'm sorry?
2013.13-461,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,581.713,583.863,Roku is paying a license for no reason?
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,585.832,590.385,I don't know all the details of that particular piece of equipment.
2013.13-461,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,604.709,606.161,Go to the iDrop in the cloud.
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,606.161,606.745,Sure.
2013.13-461,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,659.58,660.046,What is the difference--
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,663.382,672.62,"--Well, i was just going to -- so I think there is a very real way in which you would say, you know, at the end of the day, the car dealer's providing cars to the public, the valet parking service is not."
2013.13-461,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,673.805,677.424,Why isn't -- and I don't want to stretch it too -- but why isn't it like a public garage in your own garage?
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,696.053,699.521,"Mr. Chief Justice, that's not an implausible way to look at this."
2013.13-461,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,729.292,733.678,"--Well, the Second Circuit analogized this to its CableVision decision."
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,760.461,766.565,"I think the potential difference, and it's both the CloudLocker storage and this example, I don't think this Court has to decide it today."
2013.13-461,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,769.451,782.694,"Well, I don't find that very satisfying because I really -- I need to know how far the rationale that you want us to accept will go, and I need to understand, I think, what effect it will have on these other technologies."
2013.13-461,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,782.694,783.527,I had the same question.
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,799.12,799.536,--Okay.
2013.13-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,876.62,877.272,That's exactly our problem.
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,919.732,921.767,"Here is the way to get out of it, Justice Breyer."
2013.13-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,924.369,925.836,To the public?
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,944.348,953.473,"If all they can do is, just like the valet car parking service, is get back what they put up there, I think you could easily say that that is not to the public."
2013.13-461,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,977.688,985.258,"But what if, Mr. Clement, it's not so simple as a company that just allows you yourself to put something up there?"
2013.13-461,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,998.751,1007.79,"--That, Justice Kagan, is precisely why I'm asking you not to decide the cloud computing question once and for all today, because not all cloud computing is created equal."
2013.13-461,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1024.633,1025.366,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.13-461,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1035.774,1038.326,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-461,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1104.451,1105.018,How about Simple.
2013.13-461,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1109.487,1121.478,"--I guess I'm not familiar enough with the precise details of the operation, but just let me say in general terms there are obviously services that provide television programming over the Internet."
2013.13-461,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1177.582,1180.686,Can I ask my same question to you that I asked to Mr. Clement?
2013.13-461,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1193.743,1209.786,"I think you would have to -- you would have to know both the details of the service and you would have to be making a harder call there about how to draw the line, because I don't pretend that there is a bright line between providing a service and providing access to equipment."
2013.13-461,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1245.426,1247.444,How do we get out of the example?
2013.13-461,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1288.138,1289.455,"No, they're not--"
2013.13-461,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1289.455,1289.907,Because?
2013.13-461,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1289.907,1293.709,--Because the definition of ‶ to transmit ″ goes on:
2013.13-461,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1304.565,1305.183,Of course they are.
2013.13-461,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1314.605,1317.324,"Well, there is a separate exclusive right in the Copyright Act."
2013.13-461,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1317.324,1319.074,Of course there is.
2013.13-461,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1344.806,1345.256,No.
2013.13-461,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1389.552,1428.027,"Mr. Stewart, before you finish, Mr. Clement in his brief made the point that we would -- if we took the position that Petitioner urges, there would be an incompatibility with our international obligations; that is, Aereo's view of the public performance right is incompatible with our obligations under the Berne Convention and under -- what is it, WYCO?"
2013.13-461,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1449.373,1451.625,We haven't made that argument.
2013.13-461,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1576.539,1581.777,How do you want us to deal with CableVision -- the CableVision case in the Second Circuit?
2013.13-461,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1585.279,1604.458,"My answer would be the same as Mr. Clement's, that the reasoning of CableVision, if you really adhere to the idea that the only trans -- the only performance that counts is the individual transmission, and ask does that go to more than one person, then it's hard to see how you could rule in favor of our position here."
2013.13-461,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1645.369,1646.152,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1656.658,1658.877,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-461,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1719.333,1749.12,"I always thought, and I'll try to be careful about it, but not often enough, probably breach it like every other member of the public, that if I take a phonograph of a record and duplicate it a million times the way you're doing it, and I then go out and sell each of those copies to the public, then I am violating the Act."
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1752.239,1752.889,Well--
2013.13-461,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1752.889,1754.591,It's not logical to me--
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1754.591,1755.124,--Sure.
2013.13-461,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1755.124,1766.481,"--that you can make these millions of copies and give -- sell -- essentially sell them to the public, because you're telling the public when they want to buy it, they can call it up and hear it."
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1768.648,1772.302,"Well, your hypothetical, Justice Sotomayor, implicates the reproduction right."
2013.13-461,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1813.712,1814.429,Mr. Frederick--
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1814.429,1815.079,--to the Internet.
2013.13-461,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1815.079,1827.12,--was Judge Chin right when he said there was no technically sound reason to use these multiple antennas?
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1841.112,1846.783,"Let me -- this is a very complex question, Justice Ginsburg, and let me answer it multiple levels."
2013.13-461,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1923.616,1926.135,"But is there any reason you need 10,000 of them?"
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1939.793,1945.964,"Well, the point of the copyright laws, though, Your Honor, shouldn't turn on the number of antennas."
2013.13-461,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1965.877,1969.895,"That may well be, but it doesn't contradict the Chief Justice's question."
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1980.62,1983.822,"We understood -- yes, there is a reason, Justice Scalia."
2013.13-461,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2001.115,2001.699,"Yeah, but it's not -- it's not."
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2017.293,2020.328,"Well, some of the consumers do."
2013.13-461,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2075.749,2087.972,"Suppose -- suppose Aereo offered a service so that the viewer at home could press three different buttons, but it takes only 45 seconds, and he could get the broadcast without advertising?"
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2096.495,2099.614,"--That would probably violate the reproduction right, Justice Kennedy."
2013.13-461,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2101.964,2102.916,Would Aereo be a performer then?
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2102.916,2105.032,Aereo would not be a performer.
2013.13-461,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2128.883,2129.833,"No, the consumer makes the choice."
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2134.035,2134.735,Right.
2013.13-461,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2135.501,2138.287,I don't understand why he is the performer in one case and not in the other case.
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2138.287,2155.731,--Because the -- the action of who is a performer turns under the statute on who is making -- who is acting to make the sequence of sounds and images perceivable.
2013.13-461,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2185.501,2190.57,"Mr. Frederick, your -- your client is -- is just using this for local signals--"
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2190.57,2191.072,Yes.
2013.13-461,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.072,2191.722,--right now.
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2198.658,2199.777,Possibly.
2013.13-461,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2199.777,2202.393,Possibly what?
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2206.331,2209.616,"It can't be used for distance, but it implicates--"
2013.13-461,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2209.616,2210.549,What would the difference be.
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2215.287,2218.639,"--No, because HBO is not done over the airwaves."
2013.13-461,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2342.72,2343.253,"Mr. Frederick, would you clarify?"
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2359.331,2366.918,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, the person who sells an antenna to me at the local Radio Shack doesn't pay copyright royalties either."
2013.13-461,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2385.397,2386.915,The answer is very significant.
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2438.315,2442.751,"--Well, let me address -- I think I -- let me try to make it their problem."
2013.13-461,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2564.53,2569.584,"Just to make sure I've got -- there's no reason it's a user-specific copy, is it?"
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2575.238,2589.582,"Well, that's where the issue about replicating what happens in the home matters, Mr. Chief Justice, because if I'm in my home and I start the program two minutes in, using Aereo's technology, I missed the first two minutes, I never get to watch it."
2013.13-461,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2603.572,2609.909,"Surely, you can make a program where you have just one copy and starting it at different times."
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2612.661,2622.819,"--But that is -- that is the key distinction between video on demand and the service that Aereo provides, the kinds of equipment and technology that Aereo provides."
2013.13-461,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2645.249,2647.618,That's just saying your copy is different from my copy.
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2647.618,2648.184,--Correct.
2013.13-461,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2648.184,2669.8,"But that's the reason we call them copies, because they're the same."
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2678.973,2687.095,"It is much simpler if you're a start-up to add components, to add modules when you're starting up, ramping up."
2013.13-461,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2800.802,2807.94,"--They give the subscriber a menu, and it says you can get any of these things."
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2818.146,2825.736,"--It's no different, Justice Ginsburg, than if I'm at home and I have an antenna or rabbit ears on my TV and I know what channels I can get."

2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2841.679,2842.429,Right.
2013.13-461,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2869.163,2885.041,"Would you -- would you explain in a sentence or two, which will sound as if I'm bickering with you, but I want them to have a chance to reply, the thing that frightened me somewhat in your brief was, I think, of the cloud storing everybody's music."
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2927.384,2929.303,"I think that your argument, Justice Breyer--"
2013.13-461,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2929.303,2930.086,It's not my argument.
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2932.885,2933.269,--Let me -- okay.
2013.13-461,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2946.945,2947.479,All right.
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2948.981,2949.597,No.
2013.13-461,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2980.45,2981.868,But it should work out in a parallel way.
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2997.827,3010.385,"--But let me -- let me -- let me further answer your question about music, because I omitted a key distinction, which is that for local radio broadcasts, there is a music distribution license."
2013.13-461,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3012.821,3014.256,115(c)(3).
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3014.256,3014.723,Right.
2013.13-461,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3054.695,3066.303,"--But now you're saying that AT&T system, Netflix, Hulu, all of those systems get their content and they don't push it down to you."
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3070.84,3071.457,--Yeah.
2013.13-461,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3107.63,3114.036,"But you are feeding subscribers, legions of subscribers."
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3127.46,3127.96,Sure.
2013.13-461,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3244.937,3271.088,"Mr. Frederick, why isn't it sufficient to create a line such as the one Mr. Clement said, which said, you know, do you on the one hand supply or provide the content, that puts you in one box; on the other hand, if you are not supplying or providing the content, if the user is supplying and providing the content, and you are just providing the space, a kind of platform for them to do that and for them potentially to share the content, that puts you in another box?"
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3271.088,3278.575,"Well, Justice Kagan, I note that my friend did not reference the words of the Transmit Clause at all when he offered that distinction."
2013.13-461,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3317.2,3324.372,Why do people pay for the Aereo service if they can do the same thing all by themselves?
2013.13-461,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3324.372,3342.851,"--Because if you don't have to buy a TV, a DVR and an antenna and a sling box, which might cost you thousands of dollars, you might pay $100 to rent it, or if you want to just look at programming selectively, you pay $8 a month, it's a rental service, Justice Ginsburg."

2013.13-461,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3460.244,3461.478,Your consequences--
2013.13-461,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3461.478,3467.915,"Do you put them out of business, or do they have to go and negotiate a license with every copyright holder?"
2013.13-461,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3479.573,3489.263,"--The consequences really gets back to the Chief Justice's question, which is, if they actually provide something that is a net benefit technologically, there's no reason people won't license them content."
2013.13-461,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3495.167,3503.105,"Once you take them out of the compulsory licensing system, they're going to have to find copyright owners, who owns James Agee's pictures?"
2013.13-461,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3523.085,3535.492,"It's not a problem that should worry you because, first of all, if they need a compulsory license, maybe Congress can revisit it as it has in technologically specific ways for cable and satellite, but there is other ways to get content."
