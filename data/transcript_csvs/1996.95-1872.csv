1996.95-1872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.068,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-1872, William Strate v. A-1 Contractors and Lyle Stockert."
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,16.802,19.805,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,33.592,36.424,"Where is the reservation, Ms. McCoy?"
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,36.424,39.366,The reservation is within the State of North Dakota.
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,39.366,47.872,And the accident occurred on a State highway on the reservation?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,47.872,49.524,That's correct.
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,49.524,59.742,And what entity sets the speed limits and the regulations for driving on that State highway?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,62.082,65.705,"Yes, Your Honor, it is the State that sets the speed limit."
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,65.705,69.579,And the other rules applicable to driving on that State highway?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,69.579,73.539,Those are set by both the tribe and the State.
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,73.539,74.761,They have different regulations.
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,84.708,91.701,"At this time, Your Honor, there's never been a case that's answered any kind of conflict between the regulatory jurisdiction."
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,91.701,98.496,But the State purports to adopt rules and regulations and standards for driving on that State highway.
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,98.496,100.139,"That's correct, as does the tribe."
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,100.139,106.161,And could a State police officer be there and issue citations for a violation?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,106.161,107.692,"That's correct, yes."
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,107.692,108.263,Of the State law?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,108.263,114.798,"As can the... that's correct, as can the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs and the tribal police."
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,114.798,119.44,"And in fact, who does police that stretch of road?"
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,119.44,121.763,Primarily the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the tribe.
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.93,131.13,Right.
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,145.139,146.588,--Not if the person is a non-Indian.
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,146.588,147.028,Right.
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,149.349,149.99,That's correct.
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,149.99,151.342,Because it's a criminal procedure.
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,151.342,152.013,That's correct.
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,167.412,168.714,What's a civil traffic offense?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,168.714,170.023,"--Speeding, open container--"
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,170.023,174.017,Those aren't punishable by fine or imprisonment?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,174.017,175.847,--Those are punishable by fine.
1996.95-1872,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,193.568,195.371,One other preliminary question.
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,199.805,202.237,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.916,220.201,But the suit filed here is not a traffic enforcement suit of any kind.
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,224.054,225.446,That's correct.
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,225.446,229.206,"And could the suit have been brought in State court, do you suppose?"
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,229.206,233.49,"There's not a definitive answer from this Court as to that question, but we would concede that yes--"
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.49,235.821,You would concede that it could have been.
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,235.821,236.462,"--That's correct, concurrent."
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,238.823,248.731,Has this Court ever recognized concurrent jurisdiction in a civil context over a suit that occurs on a State highway?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,251.062,252.464,"--No, the Court has not."
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,252.464,256.136,Have we ever dealt with concurrent jurisdiction with tribal courts at all?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,256.136,256.956,Yes.
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,256.956,259.829,In the State tribal context?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,259.829,260.1,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,278.573,281.146,But the plaintiff there was the tribe itself?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,281.146,283.337,"That's correct, and here--"
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,283.337,284.587,Not a private nonmember?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,284.587,285.288,--That's correct.
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,297.87,298.3,How could that make a difference?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,301.905,302.796,That's correct.
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,328.013,332.357,Is the State highway easement considered Indian land?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,338.541,339.222,--That's correct.
1996.95-1872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,342.504,353.082,"But, indeed, the easement itself is held by the State and could be considered, I guess, State land for that purpose... the easement, State property?"
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,353.082,357.314,"--It's a State easement, a much lesser interest than a fee simple."
1996.95-1872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,357.314,363.608,"It's division of a bundle of rights, basically, the easement giving the right to use and the underlying fee being the rest, I suppose."
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,363.608,373.545,"That's correct, and it's clear that this highway crosses exclusively Indian trust land for all of 6-1/2 miles on the reservation."
1996.95-1872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,373.545,376.297,"Well, did... where does the highway end up?"
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,376.297,377.448,At the lake.
1996.95-1872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,381.39,385.544,Is it a... because... is the lake a resort?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,388.805,389.978,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1996.95-1872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,472.844,476.556,"Is there a marina of some sorts at Twin Buttes, or--"
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,476.556,494.757,"It's my understanding there are two dock sites, one at Red Buttes and one at... they're... Twin Buttes itself is about 3 miles below the lake on the highway, and the two docks, they're not really full-blown marinas, are to the left and right of that... you know, the east and west of that on the lake."
1996.95-1872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,494.757,499.302,"--But... and one gets access to those docks, as you refer to them, by the highway?"
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,499.302,505.305,"That's correct, but the highway is also used, you know... that's seasonal use."
1996.95-1872,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,517.244,521.496,Why was it important for the plaintiff to go to the tribal court?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,521.496,525.279,That was her choice of forum that she exercised.
1996.95-1872,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,525.279,526.779,Why is it important for her?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,526.779,530.893,It's important for her because she's very much a member of this reservation community.
1996.95-1872,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,575.275,586.522,"Isn't there, Ms. McCoy, some dispute about the second case that you mention, whether it meant anything more than you have to exhaust the tribal court process?"
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,592.816,596.168,"No, I don't think there's any dispute."
1996.95-1872,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,596.168,602.472,Is it not so that subsequent cases of this Court have said that about Iowa Mutual?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,602.472,610.517,"I believe that the reference there was in the plurality opinion in the Brendale case, a 1989 case."
1996.95-1872,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,622.555,638.807,"But whatever Brendale involved, it did distinguish Iowa Mutual on the basis that it was merely an exhaustion, that there was no determination that the tribe as opposed to the State had jurisdiction."
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,638.807,641.968,"And that, to the extent... I understand, Your Honor."
1996.95-1872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,700.769,702.631,"That was dicta, though, was it not?"
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,709.094,733.17,"--I think that I... with all due respect, Your Honor, I... Mr. Chief Justice, I think that it was the rule of that case by which exhaustion was to be conducted, because it gives guidance to the tribal courts and the Federal courts on that very issue, and we don't have Congress divesting this tribe's jurisdiction."
1996.95-1872,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,733.17,736.643,There's a civil tort suit on fee lands.
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,755.647,762.82,"Well, I think, Your Honor, we should distinguish between the existence of the tribe's jurisdiction, which is the issue here, and the scope of the--"
1996.95-1872,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,762.82,763.4,"Well, that's what I wondered."
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,793.323,794.204,--Not necessarily.
1996.95-1872,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,845.252,846.554,That's why my question--
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,846.554,847.353,--adjudicatory jurisdiction--
1996.95-1872,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,847.353,862.933,"--Is that clear, in an ordinary slip-and-fall tort accident in the middle of a reservation, but on fee land involving non-Indians, that those cases go as a matter of course to tribal courts?"
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,862.933,863.774,--It's not.
1996.95-1872,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,882.628,887.6,"Now, is your assertion that the tribe... you keep referring to adjudicatory jurisdiction."
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,894.385,895.587,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1872,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,895.587,900.579,"And you don't ask us to decide right here whether they should apply tribal law or not, or do you think they shouldn't?"
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,900.579,902.941,That's two questions.
1996.95-1872,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,922.535,927.21,"I don't understand your answer to that question, because it seems to me the two are tied together."
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,947.873,956.037,"--It's quite common, Your Honor, that in cases, nonresident tort, motor vehicle tort cases that the test is higher."
1996.95-1872,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,962.593,973.77,"The whole idea of the nonresident motor vehicle statute is that the... committing the act in the territory, having the accident there, there's no counting of other contexts."
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,982.837,988.53,"I think that's been the traditional rule, but more and more the State courts are moving towards a more... a significant--"
1996.95-1872,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,988.53,1002.16,"Do you have any case where an accident happened inside a forum and the forum didn't... applied some other law to the... to determine the regulating rules for that, for the conduct of the driver?"
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,1002.16,1010.928,"--The closest cases that we cite in our briefs are the Allstate v. Shutts and The Hague for... they're not particularly analogous, because they were not motor vehicle tort cases."
1996.95-1872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1012.518,1016.421,May I ask... I have two questions I want to get in before you lose your time.
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,1027.248,1028.29,--In this tribe?
1996.95-1872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1028.29,1028.619,Yes.
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,1028.619,1031.131,They follow State law.
1996.95-1872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.131,1031.852,They follow State law.
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,1031.852,1032.223,That's correct.
1996.95-1872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1033.214,1038.318,"And my second question is, how does the... how would the plaintiff get the judgment enforced if the plaintiff got a judgment?"
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,1038.318,1049.177,--In this case North Dakota has both a supreme court case and a supreme court rule of the State court that deal with enforcement of tribal court judgments when it needs to be enforced by a court.
1996.95-1872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.177,1052.679,The plaintiff would have to bring an independent proceeding in State court to get it enforced?
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,1052.679,1054.162,"I believe that's correct, yes."
1996.95-1872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1054.162,1054.402,I see.
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,1054.402,1054.933,That's correct.
1996.95-1872,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1054.933,1062.66,"If the action were brought in State court in the first place, is there any question in your mind that the State would apply State law as opposed to tribal law?"
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,1062.66,1071.015,As a theoretical matter I think there's again the argument that it's the sovereign forum's choice whether to apply its own law.
1996.95-1872,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1072.628,1074.988,"As a practical matter, though, we do know the answer."
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,1076.41,1077.949,"This tribe has no substantive body of law, that's--"
1996.95-1872,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1077.949,1087.546,"And yet if the tribal court has jurisdiction, that is a real question, isn't it, as to which body of law would be applied, for the very reason that Justice Ginsburg raised."
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,1099.147,1100.148,"--That's correct, yes."
1996.95-1872,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1100.148,1100.399,All right.
1996.95-1872,0,36276,melody_l_mccoy,,1136.393,1142.017,"I think that's right, and it's also buttressed by the fact that in this case both of the parties happen to be citizens of North Dakota."
1996.95-1872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1145.199,1146.401,"Thank you, Ms. McCoy."
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1186.839,1189.41,"It is true, Justice O'Connor, that in Iowa Mutual--"
1996.95-1872,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1189.41,1190.462,Yes or no?
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1190.462,1195.455,"--I believe the answer is probably yes, although this Court has not specifically addressed that issue."
1996.95-1872,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1195.455,1200.44,I thought it was quite unclear whether any subsequent challenge could be made.
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1200.44,1204.681,I think if a challenge goes directly to the scope of the tribe's jurisdiction--
1996.95-1872,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1204.681,1205.032,No.
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1208.675,1212.919,"--Well, choosing its own law in the course of adjudication is a form of exercising jurisdiction."
1996.95-1872,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1212.919,1218.451,"Well, suppose the jurisdiction question were decided in favor of the petitioner."
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1240.71,1252.048,"I think the answer to that question is yes, and the reason the answer to that question is yes is because as a matter of comity among sovereigns it is important for there to be a Federal review of a tribal exercise of--"
1996.95-1872,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1252.048,1258.603,"Well, but there's no case, is there, holding that yes, sure, you can have subsequent review in another jurisdiction?"
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1258.603,1261.574,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor, but that case has not yet arisen before this Court."
1996.95-1872,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1261.574,1271.671,"But it certainly could... would be unthinkable in a sister State context, that a second State could second-guess the first State's choice of law in a collateral attack."
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1276.413,1276.954,That is true.
1996.95-1872,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1288.102,1291.024,But Congress hasn't done that for tribal court judgments.
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1291.024,1295.166,"--That is correct, Justice O'Connor, Congress has not passed a statute giving this Court appellate jurisdiction."
1996.95-1872,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1295.166,1297.719,And a choice of law question isn't necessarily due process.
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1307.695,1312.397,"That is correct, Justice Kennedy, but there are in fact important Federal constraints on a forum's choice of its own law."
1996.95-1872,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1322.705,1349.473,"--As you said it held in Allstate, but Allstate, some might have regarded the homing instinct of that State court as exorbitant, and yet this Court held that it didn't violate due process for the State to prefer itself, so it seems to me that Allstate proves that at the very least this Court has been extraordinarily indulgent to choice of law decisions made by a forum."
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1351.753,1361.09,"--Well, in the subsequent case, Justice Ginsburg, of Phillips Petroleum v. Shutts this Court did in fact invalidate the choice of Kansas law as the rule of decision--"
1996.95-1872,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1361.09,1365.792,Certainly not as to an accident that happened within a reservation.
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1376.982,1378.932,"--I think that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.95-1872,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1398.757,1404.1,"Mr. Nuechterlein, if this is a problem, I suppose it's a problem that only takes a Federal statute to solve, right?"
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1404.1,1405.081,"That is correct, and I--"
1996.95-1872,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1405.081,1417.958,"I mean, if the question is, has... do the current Federal statutes leave it to the tribal court to decide the case, and perhaps leave it to the tribal court without any review in Federal courts to decide what substantive law to apply--"
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1417.958,1420.111,--I think Congress has spoken to that consideration.
1996.95-1872,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1420.111,1425.434,"--That's their issue, and if you're wrong about getting out of tribal court, Congress can solve that problem by passing a statute."
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1425.434,1444.116,"That's correct, and I think it's also significant in that regard that in 1993 Congress based the Indian Tribal Justice Act, which commits essential Federal resources to the development of tribal courts on the premise embraced by this Court in Iowa Mutual that tribal jurisdiction over events arising on a reservation presumptively does lie in tribal court."
1996.95-1872,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1444.116,1447.919,"Yes, but what sense does it... I mean, suppose there is room in the cases to go either way."
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1509.449,1520.518,"As an initial matter, Justice Breyer, we believe that both the State and the tribe have concurrent jurisdiction over this sort of suit in the same way that adjoining States often have jurisdiction over accidents--"
1996.95-1872,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1520.518,1521.219,I'm not talking about jurisdiction.
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1536.318,1542.272,--I think actually the approach that best saves resources is the one adopted by this Court in Iowa Mutual for the following reason.
1996.95-1872,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1568.081,1569.833,How is that present here?
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1569.833,1581.681,"--The... no one... no court has yet addressed whether that's present here, and it's my point that it should be the tribal court in the first instance that determines whether or not that fact-specific inquiry is, indeed, satisfied."
1996.95-1872,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1581.681,1606.666,"Well, how about if it goes to trial in the tribal court and the tribe chooses to use as the jury all the friends and relatives of the victim, and they say, yeah, she's really been injured, and we're going to give a heck of a verdict here, and they do, and suppose other errors that might amount to a due process violation in a Federal or State court obtain."
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1613.772,1615.415,"I think that's not quite accurate, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-1872,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1615.825,1617.075,What would be the mechanism--
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1617.075,1618.316,"--Well, in this case, for example--"
1996.95-1872,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1618.316,1618.707,--for a subsequent challenge?
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1618.707,1633.618,"--In this case, it's my understanding that A-1 has no assets on the reservation, so to enforce the tribal judgment the prevailing litigant would have to go to State court and persuade that court that the underlying tribal proceedings comported with the rules of comity that are applicable to the enforcement of the foreign judgment."
1996.95-1872,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1633.618,1635.44,And would those questions be open--
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1635.44,1636.121,"Yes, they would, Justice--"
1996.95-1872,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1636.121,1636.552,--on enforcement--
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1636.552,1637.273,"--Yes, they would."
1996.95-1872,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1637.273,1637.734,--in North Dakota?
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1637.734,1638.953,"Yes, they would."
1996.95-1872,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1638.953,1644.927,Why is it leaving open the possibility of such a difficult and elaborate proceeding?
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1661.95,1673.848,"I think this Court's... Justice Souter, I think this Court's precedents recognize that the tribe would always have jurisdiction not just to regulate conduct but also to adjudicate disputes in cases where the tribe has a particularized interest."
1996.95-1872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.543,1684.268,Do we really want to slice the onion this many ways so far as practical effects are concerned?
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1684.268,1693.425,"--I think that whenever we recognize that there are a variety of sovereigns within our Nation, whether they're States or Indian tribes, jurisdictional issues will arise."
1996.95-1872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1695.217,1697.909,"It seems to me the least desirable, is what you propose."
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1706.704,1711.295,"--I think that the best rule is, in fact, that one, and this is the reason why."
1996.95-1872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1719.213,1719.693,Yes.
1996.95-1872,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1719.693,1721.726,That poses a threat to the integrity of the tribe.
1996.95-1872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1731.136,1733.427,"Thank you, Mr. Nuechterlein."
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,1734.749,1738.672,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-1872,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1769.553,1780.251,"So the result would be different if the accident had occurred inside the reservation, on a reservation road, not a road on which the State had a perpetual easement?"
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,1780.251,1784.645,"Not necessarily, Your Honor, not in an incidence involving two nonmembers of the tribe."
1996.95-1872,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1784.645,1804.028,"So then you're not relying on, as Justice Souter spoke, this case could be... could be described as a State highway case, and that would be the end of it, but I think you're telling us now that... that even if it occurred on a reservation road, there would not be tribal jurisdiction."
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,1804.649,1805.31,"Your Honor, yes."
1996.95-1872,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1848.603,1856.25,"But they're... they're... when they cross the line from, say, North Dakota into Montana, they're going from one jurisdiction into another."
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,1859.683,1861.536,"Your Honor, I think it makes a great impression."
1996.95-1872,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1870.395,1873.456,Maybe they should recognize tribal sovereignty as well.
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,1876.688,1879.751,"--Well, no, Your Honor; I believe that there are limits on tribal sovereignty."
1996.95-1872,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1882.035,1882.893,Why is it--
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,1889.889,1890.41,"No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1872,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1896.093,1910.294,"Well, how is it different, when you go to Maine from Massachusetts, you know, very few people know, but you have to go through New Hampshire?"
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,1939.605,1940.556,--That's correct.
1996.95-1872,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1940.556,1947.54,"Here, however, I think, underlying some of your argument are two suggestions."
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2003.967,2007.011,"Justice Souter, those are two significant reasons, I agree with that."
1996.95-1872,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.104,2016.095,"Well, all those reasons are very interesting, as are our prior cases."
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2024.141,2024.75,There are treaties--
1996.95-1872,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2024.75,2026.393,--What is the text that we're talking about--
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2026.393,2027.254,"--Your Honor, there... there is--"
1996.95-1872,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2027.254,2027.835,--to decide this question?
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2027.835,2033.511,"--There is no specific text, in the sense of a statute, that addresses this question."
1996.95-1872,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2063.6,2067.463,--some of the same questions that Justice Scalia is raising.
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2086.158,2093.172,"--The... the... in answer to your first question, yes, Justice Kennedy, the Congress could create this jurisdiction if it chose to do so."
1996.95-1872,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2105.501,2112.977,"Well, with reference... the answer to your first question... then there would be no constitutional impediment to the exercise of tribal jurisdiction?"
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2112.977,2121.325,"The constitutional impediment would be that this... the Constitution recognizes two sovereigns, the United States and the States."
1996.95-1872,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2131.079,2140.646,"Well, let's put it this way, there would be no due process violation in subjecting the... your client to the jurisdiction of the tribal court?"
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2140.646,2142.108,"Yes, Your Honor, there would be."
1996.95-1872,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2142.108,2144.148,"Well, then, why did you say that Congress could authorize it?"
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2144.148,2149.204,"Well, Your Honor, I... I think that Congress certainly he is... my client is a citizen of the United States."
1996.95-1872,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2159.953,2164.334,"Well, you're not challenging the concept of Indian tribal sovereignty, surely?"
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2164.334,2165.155,"No, I'm not, Your Honor."
1996.95-1872,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2165.155,2168.267,"I mean, this Court, in many decisions, has recognized that."
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2172.711,2176.001,"No, we are not questioning the concept of tribal sovereignty--"
1996.95-1872,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2176.001,2180.806,"Well, then, are you asking us just to make a general choice of law rule as to what's wise?"
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2184.95,2198.02,"--The controlling doctrine is the Montana case that was decided by this case, which provides the limitations, or at least addresses the limitations, on tribal sovereignty and the exceptions to those limitations where nonmembers are involved."
1996.95-1872,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2198.02,2200.972,But that was regulatory sovereignty and then that was legislative sovereignty.
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2200.972,2207.256,"It was... it was legislative, but the sovereignty of a tribe, whether it's legislative or adjudicative, comes from the same place."
1996.95-1872,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2227.699,2232.712,But may I go back to a... to an answer... to a question from Justice Kennedy?
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2263.282,2264.063,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1872,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2264.063,2264.594,Okay.
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2264.594,2266.947,And also potentially to the manner in which those courts are--
1996.95-1872,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2266.947,2267.158,How could you raise that?
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2274.501,2292.752,"--Well, Your Honor, that would be a difficult problem, because the Court's Santa Clara Pueblo decision seemed to indicate that the... the issues of the Indian Civil Rights Act with respect to due process will not be reviewed except in habeas corpus proceedings."
1996.95-1872,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2304.741,2319.553,"But why wouldn't it operate... Ms. McCoy, I think, told us that, as a practical matter, to enforce a judgment of this nature rendered by the tribe, you'd have to go into State court, bring a fresh proceeding, to enforce that judgment."
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2346.159,2354.555,"There would be, in this instance, a comity provision, pursuant to the North Dakota rule with respect to enforcement of this tribal judgment."
1996.95-1872,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2357.547,2362.071,"But you say that's fortuitous, just because there happens to be no property on the reservation that could be seized?"
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2362.071,2362.602,--Correct.
1996.95-1872,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2362.602,2372.349,"But, you know, the same situation exists if it's a suit between two Indians or, I assume, a suit between one Indian and a person off the reservation."
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2390.14,2391.61,"No, I don't think we do--"
1996.95-1872,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2391.61,2395.644,"If we're content with that rule for Indians, why... why can't we be content with it for non-Indians?"
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2395.644,2399.397,"--Your Honor, because Indians are members of the tribe."
1996.95-1872,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2403.831,2408.055,"And I'm a Virginian, but Virginia can... can deny me due process just as well."
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2408.055,2410.696,"I would argue that it can't, Your Honor."
1996.95-1872,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2410.696,2411.327,I... I just don't think that's--
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2411.327,2413.648,"I mean, you could challenge it if Virginia did."
1996.95-1872,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2426.006,2429.008,"--happy family, and never deprive one another of due process--"
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2429.008,2430.678,"Your Honor, I would hope that--"
1996.95-1872,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2430.678,2436.943,"--right, and think it's some... I don't know... bucolic, pre-nature regime there?"
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2451.233,2455.347,"--Well, Your Honor, that question, I guess, has not been answered by this Court, with respect to non-Indians."
1996.95-1872,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2455.347,2456.769,"Well, let me ask a related question."
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2465.735,2466.927,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1996.95-1872,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2470.11,2474.103,Where... where would I... where would I... where could I properly look to find these accounts?
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2478.276,2478.807,"--Yes, there is, Your Honor."
1996.95-1872,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2497.809,2500.762,"Well, that's... I don't mean to belittle that case, but that is one case."
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2501.443,2501.773,"--Yes, there--"
1996.95-1872,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2501.773,2505.664,--Do we have any... any documentation of a generalized problem?
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2505.664,2516.242,"--Well, Your Honor, as far as documentation, other than... there are other cases that I'm aware of, where due process violations are occurring in tribal courts with respect to nonmembers--"
1996.95-1872,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2516.242,2520.915,"Well, can I... is there a law report or something that I can read to find these examples?"
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2520.915,2523.996,"--There... there are some law review articles on the subject, Your Honor."
1996.95-1872,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2530.151,2547.774,"Mr. Ward, do you agree that if we take what Justice Souter suggested might be a rule of the road here... that is, if it's an interstate highway, it's a State highway, then the State... this case belongs in State court and State law will apply."
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2556.659,2557.34,--That's true.
1996.95-1872,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2557.34,2559.363,Just stay on the good roads; you've got nothing to worry about.
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2560.641,2562.244,That's... that's true.
1996.95-1872,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2573.823,2583.29,"How does it normally work with... I mean, this notion of splitting adjudicatory jurisdiction for... from legislative or regulatory jurisdiction is rather interesting."
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2614.841,2615.842,"--No, Justice Breyer."
1996.95-1872,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2615.842,2616.58,They go to the State court?
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2616.58,2616.991,"Yes, they do."
1996.95-1872,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2616.991,2629.759,"And are you aware of any instances in which tribal courts took jurisdiction over these simple slip-and-fall, normal contract disputes on the houses or farms of the people who hold their land in fee?"
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2629.759,2631.101,Involving nonmembers?
1996.95-1872,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2638.618,2641.268,"But, Mr. Ward, here's a question of concurrent jurisdiction."
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2665.783,2666.634,--That's correct.
1996.95-1872,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2666.634,2666.964,"Well, why is that?"
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2668.336,2669.726,Why did she choose?
1996.95-1872,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2669.726,2693.303,"--Why, if in fact there is adjudicatory authority in... over, say, this... if this is equivalent to fee and there is adjudicatory authority of the tribal court over people who hold their title in fee, then why couldn't the tribe, if it wished to, say that you have to go to the tribal court whether you're related to somebody who's a member of the tribe, whether you're not?"
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2693.303,2697.567,"Your Honor, the tribe could, assuming that the other party was--"
1996.95-1872,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2697.567,2700.418,"So, in fact, then I think the issue in this case... there are two issues."
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2721.678,2725.341,"--Well, Your Honor, this is not fee land, because this land was--"
1996.95-1872,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2725.341,2727.582,"If you say ""not"", then they win, I think."
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2729.843,2730.524,--I... I'm sorry--
1996.95-1872,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2730.524,2735.335,"--Montana talked about fee land in the sense of other people owning it, not the tribe owning it."
1996.95-1872,2,38421,patrick_j_ward,,2735.335,2736.247,"--Well, you confused me."
