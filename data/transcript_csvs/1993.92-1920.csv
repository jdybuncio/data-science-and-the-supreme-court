1993.92-1920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.229,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 92-1920, Karen Livadas v. Lloyd Aubry, California Labor Commissioner."
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,13.511,16.242,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,152.59,166.862,"The Labor Commissioner, Mr. McCracken, never defended the policy on the basis that people who aren't covered by collective bargaining agreements really need more help from the State than people who are covered by collective bargaining agreements?"
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,166.862,177.708,"No, it was never defended on that basis, only on the basis that the Labor Commissioner felt that it was necessary to take this position in order to avoid problems of labor law preemption."
1993.92-1920,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,178.67,183.022,Could he properly have defended it upon the grounds that... hypothesized by the Chief Justice?
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,183.022,200.434,"--I don't believe so, because the... in this case the question is whether or not a decision can be based upon the exercise of Federal rights, in this case the right to select a collective bargaining representative and have a collective bargaining agreement."
1993.92-1920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,209.26,214.183,"Well that's, at any rate, something you don't have to bite off, I take it."
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,214.183,217.776,"No, we don't, because it never was raised as a defense."
1993.92-1920,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,223.289,249.726,"Mr. McCracken, you twice emphasized that there was no dispute about the amount due in this particular case, but the respondent does emphasize... and I'm looking at page 42 of the brief... that this is an example of a class of cases, and that in some such cases, at least, there would be a dispute about the amount."
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,273.863,275.225,Yes.
1993.92-1920,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,342.879,349.354,"So what it boils down to is you're saying every time you look to Federal law for an answer to a question that arises in a State law action, you don't have preemption."
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,349.354,350.643,That's correct.
1993.92-1920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,353.905,355.997,"Well, is that what you're saying?"
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,366.384,378.732,"--In the case of termination pay we believe that is absolutely correct, that what would happen here is that the question of whether or not payment had been made on time would always be open for State law to resolve."
1993.92-1920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.308,390.67,But the two questions are connected.
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,396.226,398.266,"Yes, Justice Scalia, that is true--"
1993.92-1920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.266,399.836,You can't separate the two questions.
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,399.836,402.299,"--In that hypothetical case, that would be true."
1993.92-1920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.808,404.39,And what would happen in that hypothetical case?
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,404.39,406.38,--We believe that what would happen is--
1993.92-1920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,406.38,406.901,Preempted or not?
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,406.901,407.973,--It would not be preempted.
1993.92-1920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.973,411.486,Even though it involves an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement?
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,411.486,415.547,The Labor Commissioner would not be interpreting the collective bargaining agreement.
1993.92-1920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,453.882,456.724,So long as there's an arbitration agreement in the collective bargaining agreement.
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,456.724,459.836,Either an arbitration agreement or some other dispute resolution mechanism.
1993.92-1920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,459.836,461.178,Or some other mechanism.
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,475.196,483.49,"The... in cases such as this, there is no reason for anyone to resort to that process because there was never any dispute under the agreement about what was due."
1993.92-1920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,483.49,485.181,"Well, I'm not talking about cases like this."
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,499.981,502.805,"Well, I think, Justice Scalia, that's taking it to far."
1993.92-1920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,503.324,506.506,"I think it is, but you tell me why it is?"
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,506.506,522.166,"--Because I think what the Court was saying in Lingle, especially its description in footnote 12 of how to resolve these problems of interplay between the two systems, is that there are many occasions in which it is necessary to get data from the collective bargaining process."
1993.92-1920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,567.836,574.129,"May I ask, supposing you have a case in which there is no collective bargaining agreement but there is a dispute as to the amount due?"
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,583.246,593.784,"I believe, Mr. Justice Stevens, that what happens is that the Commissioner looks at the employer's payroll records to determine the answer to that question, the same as the--"
1993.92-1920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.784,598.287,"And if the player... the employer has underpaid him, as a based on that, then there's a penalty imposed."
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,598.287,613.325,"--If what has happened is that the... that question, whether there's 2 hours' pay missing, the Commissioner would investigate to see whether the 2 hours were worked and whether the 2 hours were paid, and then would find that there was underpayment, as a matter of fact."
1993.92-1920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,613.325,614.377,And then impose the penalty.
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,614.377,615.337,Correct.
1993.92-1920,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,615.337,617.57,But the penalty can't be imposed unless it were willful.
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,617.57,618.038,Yes.
1993.92-1920,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,618.038,621.35,"If the employer had a good faith doubt, there would be no penalty."
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,621.35,627.184,"Well, the test under California law, Justice Kennedy, is whether the nonpayment was intentional."
1993.92-1920,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,631.889,634.09,"So if he had a good faith doubt, there would be no penalty."
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,634.09,638.324,That's a matter for the Commissioner to determine as a matter of State law.
1993.92-1920,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,682.353,698.081,"Yes, but it might bear on how these two acts or how these two conflicting sovereignties bear upon each other in a case where, as Justice Scalia put it, the collective bargaining agreement is not clear."
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,698.081,711.611,"Yes, I can see how it might, because the degree of the employer's good faith would be, in turn, somewhat conditioned by the merits of its argument under the collective bargaining agreement that a certain amount was not due."
1993.92-1920,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,769.648,777.913,"Is it true that, as a practical matter, there's very little occasion to have a difference of opinion as to the amount owed?"
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,777.913,778.815,Yes.
1993.92-1920,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,813.316,834.601,"Suppose we go back to Justice Kennedy's original question, and suppose the California law is clear that these sections, 201 and 203, don't apply to people whose unit is covered by a collective bargaining agreement but only for the particularly needy workers who don't have a collective bargaining agreement governing their employment relationship."
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,839.116,842.458,"--No, I'm afraid I can't agree, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-1920,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,854.913,857.865,Then you'd say it was a violation of section 7.
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,857.865,860.908,"Yes, a violation of section 7 redressable through section 1983."
1993.92-1920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,885.595,893.181,"Well, supposing there's an election held by the Labor Board and a group of employees at a plant vote not to have a collective bargaining agreement."
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,913.084,926.172,"We say, Mr. Justice... Chief Justice, that there is no way the State can take that exercise into account either way, so that if employees had voted not to be represented by a union, that the State could not--"
1993.92-1920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,926.172,929.323,It seems like an extraordinarily broad doctrine.
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,937.54,940.001,"--No, we don't see that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,959.556,962.046,"Mr. McCracken, would you clear up one thing for me."
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,973.033,976.576,"She could proceed, herself, in court, to enforce the claim."
1993.92-1920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,976.576,981.398,"And if she did proceed in court, would her attorney's fees be assessed against the employer?"
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,981.398,982.159,"Yes, if she won."
1993.92-1920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,982.159,983.21,I see.
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,983.21,987.204,"On the other hand, if she lost, the employer's attorney's fees could be assessed against her."
1993.92-1920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,987.204,988.133,"Oh, I see."
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,988.133,1001.834,"So there's... in addition to the lack of familiarity most workers have with the law and legal processes and the intimidation that many of them feel when approaching that institutions, there is also a good deal of risk, downside risk to an employee who peruses a claim on her own."
1993.92-1920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1001.834,1005.504,She has a find a lawyer who's willing to take a case involving 3 day's pay too.
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,1005.504,1012.609,"Yes, to begin with, and a lawyer who's prepared to advise her that she might end up owing more than she sought."
1993.92-1920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1019.064,1044.819,"Mr. McCracken, can I... I don't want to eat up too much of your time, but coming back to the Chief Justice's question about whether Golden State has any equal protection flavor to it, is it your contention that even the most rational of bases for treating union employees and nonemployees differently will not suffice to avoid running afoul of Golden State."
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,1054.458,1055.446,Justice Scalia--
1993.92-1920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1055.446,1057.389,--By reason of their collective bargaining agreement?
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,1057.389,1082.624,"--Justice Scalia, I think that in that particular example of arbitration services, the State would not be able to... would be entitled to do that because, in that case, the... you would be running directly into section 301 preemption, given the... how important arbitration is to section 301 and how Federal law completely governs the question of what is arbitrable and how it shall be arbitrated."
1993.92-1920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1140.724,1142.555,"Thank you, Mr. McCracken."
1993.92-1920,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,1142.555,1143.046,--Thank you.
1993.92-1920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1143.046,1144.876,"Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you."
1993.92-1920,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1144.876,1153.221,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1369.793,1373.436,"Mr. Stewart, that's easy for you to say."
1993.92-1920,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1414.733,1423.86,"Well, if the mistake is simply that he reasonable believed that what he was doing is legal, that amounts to a claim of good-faith immunity which has no application to official capacity suits."
1993.92-1920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1454.788,1460.913,"Well, this case is easy, but the Commissioner is going to have to decide what he's going to do in the future, if he loses this case."
1993.92-1920,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1467.347,1477.465,"Well, clearly this Court may reach cases in the future in which a State official has operated on the basis of a preemption theory which was reasonable at the time, but turned out to be wrong."
1993.92-1920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1489.414,1494.355,"I understand, but just tell me what we do in the future when he was reasonable but wrong, what happens?"
1993.92-1920,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1494.355,1499.939,"I... with respect, Your Honor, I don't think I'm authorized, on behalf of the Government, to take a position on that."
1993.92-1920,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1520.432,1530.47,"Would you say, then, there was a basis for a reasonable belief for the cases in which the amount due requires interpretation of the collective bargaining contract?"
1993.92-1920,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1530.47,1547.52,"Well, if there were a situation in which the employer paid upon termination and the dispute was whether the employer had paid all the wages due, we think that'd be a different sort of case, because it would be a necessary step in Ms. Livadas' claim for penalties."
1993.92-1920,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1547.52,1553.705,"Well, would it be the kind of case about which Justice Scalia inquired that you are unprepared to answer?"
1993.92-1920,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1562.05,1573.546,"We think, in that context, the arbitrator... the Labor Commissioner would be entitled at least to defer his proceedings until the arbitration processes had run their course."
1993.92-1920,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1590.038,1606.009,"You're telling me that deferral of the Labor Department coming in, this... the position here is if it requires interpretation of the collective bargaining contract, then the Department of Labor, California Department, never comes into the picture at all."
1993.92-1920,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1606.009,1625.231,"Well, what... again, what we think is unreasonable about the California Labor Commissioner's policy is that it applies even when there is no dispute as to whether the CBA has been breached, even where all parties agree that the wages due under the contract have been paid and the only question is whether an independent State law duty to pay them at the time of termination--"
1993.92-1920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.231,1626.061,"Well, we understand that."
1993.92-1920,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1643.164,1644.033,--First of all--
1993.92-1920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1644.033,1644.904,Or not authorized.
1993.92-1920,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1644.904,1646.096,"--Not authorized, that's correct."
1993.92-1920,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1646.096,1657.392,"Mr. Stewart, you're here as an advocate, and you're perfectly free to disclaim any responsibility for the Government supporting your view, but I think you are obligated to answer questions about hypotheticals."
1993.92-1920,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1657.392,1664.776,"I am here only in my capacity as an assistant to the Solicitor General, and I--"
1993.92-1920,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1664.776,1668.459,You're here because leave was granted you to argue pro had vice.
1993.92-1920,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1668.459,1672.632,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.92-1920,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1672.632,1674.553,Answer the question.
1993.92-1920,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1674.553,1679.195,I have been told that I'm not authorized to represent on behalf of the United States.
1993.92-1920,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1679.195,1684.221,Very well.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,1688.892,1690.944,Thank you.
1993.92-1920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1803.409,1809.474,"Yes, but that section you've quoted to us reads... the provision... the sentence from Posner reads:"
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,1813.146,1813.807,It would--
1993.92-1920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.807,1815.229,--But there's no controversy here.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,1817.45,1829.977,"--I suggest, Your Honor, that in our estimation, under California law, the controversy arose as to... the controversy in issue here is what is the penalty which must continue."
1993.92-1920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1854.203,1857.696,"Well, excuse me, is that penalty provided by the collective bargaining agreement?"
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,1857.696,1859.977,--The penalty is found in the collective bargaining agreement.
1993.92-1920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1883.792,1884.233,You really have me confused.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,1885.915,1886.634,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-1920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.634,1888.927,And not by the collective bargaining agreement.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,1888.927,1890.177,"No, the penalty--"
1993.92-1920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1890.177,1892.979,"So all you have to know what the wages... is what the wages are, right?"
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,1892.979,1894.0,"--Yes, Your Honor, but--"
1993.92-1920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1894.0,1898.291,"And if the parties agree about the wages, there is no controversy and this sentence doesn't even come into play."

1993.92-1920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1910.33,1916.363,You will always presume that there is a controversy concerning the collective... that involves the collective bargaining agreement.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,1923.669,1937.758,"--Your Honor, we feel that in order to... under the State law, in order for us to take and decide this particular issue, we would have had to applied the collective bargaining agreement, the terms of the collective bargaining agreement."
1993.92-1920,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1947.665,1952.608,"Well, what would you have done if there were no collective bargaining... what if she was a nonunion employee, how would you find out the--"
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,1952.608,1957.099,We would go to the contract of employment between the employer and the employee.
1993.92-1920,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1957.099,1959.981,"--Supposing it's an oral... you know, just an oral... at will oral contract, what do you do?"
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,1959.981,1963.043,"Well, just as another other trier of fact would do, Your Honor."
1993.92-1920,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.082,1980.685,Your opponent has more or less represented to us that normally there's no big deal about figuring out how much is correct.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,1981.546,1982.077,"No, Your Honor."
1993.92-1920,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1987.821,1988.743,In most cases there is a dispute about the amount.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,1988.743,1989.902,There is a dispute as to the amount.
1993.92-1920,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1989.902,1990.613,In most cases.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,1990.613,1993.224,"In most cases, yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1920,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1993.224,1994.526,In this case there was not.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,1994.526,1997.909,In this case as far as we know there was none.
1993.92-1920,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1997.909,2009.347,"Well, the court of appeals opinion certain says in... I presume it's correct, unless there's some reason to dispute it, that Livadas does not dispute the amount of the check."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2009.347,2016.942,"Livadas does not... Ms. Livadas does not dispute the amount of the check, Mr. Chief Justice, but we don't know what Safeway would have done--"
1993.92-1920,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2016.942,2020.094,"Well, but Safeway sent her the check, so presumably they don't dispute it."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2020.916,2032.243,"--Well, as a matter of fact, even they had... even Ms. Livadas had a problem in determining what exactly her final pay was."
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2032.243,2033.284,But she's not disputing that.

1993.92-1920,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2054.445,2055.025,--Okay.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2067.956,2069.706,"--Not on the record, Your Honor."
1993.92-1920,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2069.706,2073.039,"Well, not on the record and that's what courts go by, is the record."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2073.039,2073.87,"I understand, Your Honor."
1993.92-1920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2121.081,2146.329,"Mr. Cadell, I... it seems to me that even if we adopted a rule, which might be a reasonable rule, that the State can treat these matters in the generality so that it need not be the case that every single... every single dispute in which it does not provide assistance is one in which there would have been preemption."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2174.736,2179.601,"--Justice Scalia, we looked at it from the point of view that we would have to."
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2186.815,2199.013,"Mr. Cadell, the position... your position about what California law is is less than clear to me, and it seems to have somewhat shifted, so let's go back to the first base."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2213.151,2216.113,"--They're... yes, Your Honor, that would be true."
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2216.113,2222.828,"And those are mandatory provisions that must be paid to every worker, is that so?"
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2222.828,2230.525,"That would... subject to the provisions of section 203, that it would be willful, a willful failure to pay."
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2230.525,2247.424,"So we're only talking about who enforces, then, whether the wage earner... if she's under a collective bargaining agreement, she will have to come to court on her own, but if she's not under a collective bargaining agreement then she gets the Commissioner to take care of her claim?"
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2247.424,2251.656,"Justice Ginsburg, I think you narrow it too far, if you will."
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2274.233,2278.575,"Well, let's take her case where there's nothing to interpret in the collective bargaining agreement."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2288.531,2299.258,"Well, Your Honor, number... I would disagree with your categorization that the right to the 203 penalties is guaranteed."
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2299.698,2301.972,If there's... if there was willful.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2323.725,2342.888,"Your Honor, it's our position that we would... one would have to look to apply... under California law, and this is a California Statute, the Labor Commissioner was following California procedural rules and that's the procedural rules which were given to us."
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2345.459,2351.693,"But I'm trying to find... before we get to the procedure, is the substantive right of all workers the same?"
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2370.456,2376.861,"--I'm not so sure that in California, that the substantive right would be clear across the aboard."
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2376.861,2388.378,"Well, please tell us what the substantive right of the employees... what their substantive rights are, because we'll get terribly confused if we don't even know what California's position is on that."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2388.378,2389.78,"I understand, Your Honor."
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2401.308,2402.71,"Well, let's start with 201."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2402.71,2418.621,"There... all right, the right to be paid in a timely manner, that right... that right exists, but that right may be enforced, by the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, by other means than by the penalty under section 203."
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2418.621,2425.964,"But the substantive right is enjoyed by persons, whether they're under a collective bargaining agreement or not."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2429.518,2431.128,"That's not quite so, Your Honor."
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2437.662,2440.314,Do they... do any of them turn on collective bargaining versus--
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2440.314,2440.785,--None of them.
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2440.785,2441.225,--Okay.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2441.225,2442.765,None of them turn on collective bargaining.
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2442.765,2457.995,"Then the substantive right in 203 to a penalty in the event of a willful failure to pay is any distinction as far as the substantive right, made on the basis of collective bargaining agreement or not."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2457.995,2459.177,"I believe there is, Your Honor."
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2506.528,2520.596,"Well, let's say that it isn't necessary because there's no dispute about... the check for the wages due on firing are paid, and the employee says that's the right amount, now I just want 3 extra days' worth."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2520.596,2530.765,"Your Honor, I think what this... what that would mean is that the Supreme Court of the United States would be called upon to interpret California law."
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2534.705,2540.95,"I'm just asking you what... you to tell me what the California law is, not for the Court to interpret it."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2550.106,2551.856,--Yes.
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2551.856,2558.481,"But I'm trying to learn from you what California law is, and I've not yet grasped it."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2558.481,2560.524,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1993.92-1920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2596.786,2599.978,"Mr. Cadell, let me ask you a practical question."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2646.538,2648.621,"As a practical situation, Your Honor."
1993.92-1920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2648.621,2650.131,"As a practical matter, would it be implementable?"
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2650.131,2651.483,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1993.92-1920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2651.483,2652.672,Why not?
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2652.672,2663.5,"Because I believe that... I believe this Court is looking at the term ""dispute"" as emanating... as being the word of the claimant."
1993.92-1920,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2695.571,2708.939,"But, surely there must be something short of a full administrative hearing that would enable you to find out whether the person's claim as to what rate they were being paid per hour is or is not disputed by the employer?"
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2708.939,2710.972,"--Your Honor, our--"
1993.92-1920,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2710.972,2712.0,"Well,--"
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2712.0,2713.252,--Procedure--
1993.92-1920,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2713.252,2720.588,--Are you telling me there is... that if someone comes into you and says I was making $8 bucks an hour at Safeway.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2720.588,2721.217,--Right.
1993.92-1920,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2721.217,2731.705,"That the next step would be a full-fledged administrative hearing, even though perhaps Safeway, if it were contacted, said... would say, yes, she was making $8 an hour?"
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2731.705,2733.726,"Well, we would--"
1993.92-1920,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2733.726,2735.705,Can't you answer that question yes or no?
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2735.705,2736.697,--Yes.
1993.92-1920,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2750.746,2753.057,"Well, maybe that's one of the problems here."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2764.687,2773.212,Our procedures involve a letter to the employer outlining the fact that a claim has been filed.
1993.92-1920,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2809.776,2811.639,I take it you have process to require them to show up for the hearing.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2811.639,2816.862,We send out the notice of the hearing.
1993.92-1920,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2823.395,2825.348,"Well, but do you have process?"
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2828.38,2838.735,"We could subpoena them in, Your Honor, but we find that that would be less than effective, because we'd have to go out and serve subpoenas."
1993.92-1920,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2839.747,2841.927,"Wait, but you have... you have no process to require them to answer."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2841.927,2843.93,"--No, no."
1993.92-1920,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2873.758,2878.072,Does your customary notice specify the amount claimed?
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2878.072,2879.454,Yes.
1993.92-1920,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2879.454,2885.706,"So that if they're... if the employer would recognize that it's probably correct, they would not answer and that would be the judgment in that amount, or something like that."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,2885.706,2889.208,"If that were so, Your Honor, yes."
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3015.102,3021.357,But that's... that's... I have had a problem understanding what California law is apart from preemption.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,3057.341,3065.265,"--I think, Your Honor, that Ms. Livadas has no case through the Labor Commissioner."
1993.92-1920,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3078.972,3080.164,So you say that Federal--
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,3092.423,3093.122,"I believe that's right, Your Honor."
1993.92-1920,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3093.122,3105.2,"I don't understand why that is true under California law, because under California law the Labor Commissioner's disability turns on the existence of a dispute, and you don't even find out whether there is a dispute."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,3124.073,3126.143,"But that's under California law, Your Honor."
1993.92-1920,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3126.143,3126.594,That's right.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,3126.594,3127.455,Yeah.
1993.92-1920,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3127.455,3133.31,And you have been telling us that under California law you are precluded from doing what this particular claimant wants.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,3133.31,3134.001,Yes.
1993.92-1920,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3134.001,3140.456,"And I don't see why this record even establishes the predicate, under California law, for the position that you're taking?"
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,3140.456,3161.687,"Your Honor, I think if there was an error in interpreting the California Supreme Court and it's application... and whether or not the application would apply in this particular case, it's a question of California law."
1993.92-1920,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3163.579,3188.675,"Well, it's a question of California law, but it puts you in the position, it seems to me, of taking across the board... in every case, without determining the existence of a dispute or not, it puts California in the position of running afoul, I would suppose, of the... of footnote 12 in Lingle, which attempts to draw the line between what it is appropriate for a State to do and what it is not appropriate for a State to do in terms of Federal labor policy."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,3188.675,3200.382,"--But we look at footnote 12 in Lingle, Your Honor, as drawing the outside boundaries of where the State may go as far as preemption is concerned."
1993.92-1920,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3213.032,3217.313,"So 229 preemption is not coextensive, in your view, with 301 preemption."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,3217.313,3218.966,"--No, it's not."
1993.92-1920,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3225.551,3227.19,Let me ask you this.
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,3233.556,3236.217,"No, I don't believe they can, Your Honor."
1993.92-1920,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3252.008,3255.688,"Could they provide that the remedy is not to take it to the Labor Commissioner, but to arbitrate it?"
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,3255.688,3257.551,"Yes, they could do that as well."
1993.92-1920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3257.551,3263.996,"Mr. Cadell, your... I don't know what your authority for your description of California law is."
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,3282.168,3292.744,"Your Honor, in the citation on Howard... I don't have my... you'll see where Howard is citing from Posner v. Grunwald."
1993.92-1920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3297.556,3298.427,And the quote--
1993.92-1920,2,26728,h_thomas_cadell_jr,,3298.427,3300.027,"--It's at page 22, Your Honor."
1993.92-1920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3300.027,3301.6,--The quote from Posner says
