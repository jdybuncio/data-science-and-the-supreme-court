2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,9.039,24.031,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress squarely addressed and unambiguously answered the first question in this case when it enacted the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934."
2008.07-526,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,116.375,122.279,"What about a poster that says ""Give blood now""."
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,122.279,125.247,"Pardon me, Justice Breyer?"
2008.07-526,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,125.881,127.683,"They put up a poster that says ""Give blood now""."
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,127.683,131.468,"Well, it is--"
2008.07-526,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,131.468,133.151,It doesn't mean when it was printed.
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,133.151,134.753,"--Of course, of course, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,248.026,257.984,"What about -- what about the additional definition in section 19 of ""tribe"", which is not limited the way the first sentence is?"
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,257.984,262.62,"--But it says, Chief Justice Roberts, it says ""Indian tribe""."
2008.07-526,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,387.167,400.61,"Doesn't it have to be correct because in -- in section 19 it says that the term ""Indian"" means, among other things, all other persons of one-half or more Indian blood."
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,408.997,410.032,The -- the -- yes.
2008.07-526,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,453.709,455.142,What sort of -- excuse me.
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,459.613,468.802,"Well, the use of the word ""tribe"" in that question is -- is causing me a problem momentarily."
2008.07-526,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,468.802,469.119,Pardon me.
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,477.907,482.192,"Well, there were all sorts of Indians who were not under Federal jurisdiction."
2008.07-526,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,521.334,527.155,"Were there, then -- were there persons of Indian descent who were not under Federal jurisdiction?"
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,527.155,528.007,Yes.
2008.07-526,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,528.557,532.209,"What -- what kind of persons would those be, persons without a tribal affiliation?"
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,532.209,532.825,--Yes.
2008.07-526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,613.379,622.885,"My understanding -- maybe I've got this wrong, but there was not then, as there is now, a list of tribes that are recognized and under Federal jurisdiction."
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,627.087,633.408,"Well, what the Interior Department did was, in compliance with the statute -- was to set about and create a list."
2008.07-526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,642.513,653.254,"But I guess the point is that, given the weight that you are placing on the word ""now"", you would think there was some clear way to say who was recognized before then and who was recognized after that."
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,668.331,670.633,"--Well, there was a relatively sharp distinction."
2008.07-526,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,706.639,710.341,But we're told that that -- that effort was ridden -- ridden with mistakes.
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,744.764,745.214,Yes.
2008.07-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.91,821.062,"Of course, I suppose if the phrase"
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,837.191,840.142,"--Well, what -- what -- I think I understand your question."
2008.07-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,844.444,844.911,Yes.
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,868.21,872.862,The only way the statute makes sense is to construe 19--
2008.07-526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,872.862,873.178,No.
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,885.303,891.908,"--Chief Justice Roberts, what -- it was intended -- members of Congress had to think the word ""now"" meant something."
2008.07-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1000.844,1005.765,"Mr. Olson, can I ask you a kind of a -- maybe it's too obvious -- preliminary question?"
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1009.867,1010.268,--No.
2008.07-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1013.103,1019.341,"Section 19 defines the term ""Indian"", but there is no definition of what an Indian tribe is."
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1019.341,1024.543,"--It refers, in the second-to-last sentence of section 19 or 479,"
2008.07-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1032.082,1036.903,"See that -- that word isn't limited by time or date, is it?"
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1036.903,1039.286,"--Well, the word ""Indian"" is, if you accept the word--"
2008.07-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1039.286,1043.623,"Well, but the word ""Indian"" -- it says the word ""Indian"", in the last sentence,"
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1049.277,1051.812,"--Well, that just simply, I submit, defines the word ""adult""."
2008.07-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1051.812,1053.495,Where -- where were you reading from?
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1054.347,1063.12,"We were reading from section 479, which is at page 15a of the Carcieri brief."
2008.07-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1063.12,1065.103,I'm looking at the Government brief.
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1065.97,1066.955,Yes.
2008.07-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1072.49,1074.192,--That's what's causing me confusion there.
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1081.529,1083.048,"--Well, I'm happy to do it either way."
2008.07-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1090.452,1092.235,Thank you.
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1092.235,1118.852,"And I think -- but nonetheless, Justice Scalia, for the purposes of this, it is quite clear that if you were a member of Congress in 1934 reading this statute and seeing the words 1934."
2008.07-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1123.923,1131.945,"--Mr. Olson, am I not correct that the membership in the tribe is just one category of persons who are included in the broader definition of the term ""Indian""?"
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1131.945,1133.812,"--There are three categories, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1133.812,1137.414,And one of the them is members of the tribe.
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1137.414,1137.933,Yes.
2008.07-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1137.933,1143.587,Another is one who -- Indians who have attained the age of 21 years.
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1163.048,1169.035,"Well, if you take the word ""Indian"" out, but the word -- the phrase is ""Indian tribe""."
2008.07-526,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1239.715,1245.618,"Do you think -- do you think the meaning of that -- the words specifically that were added were ""now under Federal jurisdiction""."
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1264.616,1265.566,Yes.
2008.07-526,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1265.566,1274.138,"And it's recognized in 1976, but then they go back and they say, well, was it under Federal jurisdiction in 1934?"
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1292.699,1293.333,No.
2008.07-526,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1296.618,1298.42,"Well, I'm saying I'm agreeing with you on the meaning."
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1304.724,1308.109,--There's no question that this tribe would not qualify--
2008.07-526,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1308.109,1308.709,--No.
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1308.709,1310.161,--and there's no contention that it would.
2008.07-526,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1315.049,1323.136,"They wouldn't qualify for two reasons -- A, they weren't recognized; and B, they weren't, in 1934, under Federal jurisdiction?"
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1323.904,1325.754,"--Both, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-526,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1327.772,1342.032,"Because I suppose that what the Government wants us to do is put in two commas: The Indian as used in section -- a person of Indian descent, comma, who are members of any recognized Indian tribes, comma, now under Federal jurisdiction."
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1349.02,1349.786,That's correct.
2008.07-526,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1350.722,1351.805,Even if they were recognized later?
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1351.805,1355.507,"--They can be recognized later, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-526,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1364.862,1370.366,"You don't agree that ""recognized later"" complies with this statute in your case."
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1370.366,1388.597,"No, because here's what Congress said: In each one of those 15 cases, Congress said -- the statute, including section 5 and 19, which is what we are talking about here, ""shall hereafter apply"", ""shall hereafter apply"", ""shall be hereby extended"", ""hereby"", ""hereby extended""."
2008.07-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1393.299,1396.834,"Mr. Olson, let me just make sure I get this off my chest, and then I'll be quiet."
2008.07-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1402.438,1404.189,What section are we talking about -- 19?
2008.07-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1405.389,1406.308,--in this Act.
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1417.664,1420.366,"--No, but it says the word ""Indian""."
2008.07-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1420.366,1420.899,No.
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1427.221,1430.089,"May I read this, Justice Stevens?"
2008.07-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1430.089,1430.606,Yes.
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1430.606,1436.577,"""The term ""tribe"" wherever used in this Act shall be construed to refer to any Indian tribe. """
2008.07-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1436.577,1437.127,Right.
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1437.127,1437.977,"So, the word--"
2008.07-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1437.977,1443.981,"""Organized band, pueblo, or the Indians residing on one reservation. """
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1443.981,1460.391,"--I submit that, for purposes of construction of the statute and using the word consistently, the word ""Indian"" modifies tribe, the word ""Indian"" as defined, that's consistent with the purpose, that's consistent with the legislative history."
2008.07-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1462.276,1466.994,"The word ""Indian"" does not modify the word ""tribe"" as used in the third sentence."
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1468.112,1476.452,"--Well, I think you and I must be reading a different thing because the sentence that -- the sentence that defines the word ""Indian"" says"
2008.07-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1477.552,1487.824,"I'm saying for purposes of getting the meaning of the word ""tribe"", just look at the sentence defining that term, and that doesn't refer to any time limit."
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1487.824,1492.128,"--But it does include the word ""Indian"", which does have a temporal limitation."
2008.07-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1498.966,1500.984,It doesn't limit it to Indian tribe.
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1508.654,1528.485,"--Well, I think that the construction of the statute, including the way this Court read it in 1978, the history, the purpose that it was intended to accomplish, the use of those words throughout the statute which are consistent, all supports the proposition that it had meant Indian tribes recognized and under Federal jurisdiction."
2008.07-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1528.485,1532.622,"I assume that you think ""Indian"" modifies ""organized band"" and ""pueblo"" as well."
2008.07-526,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1532.622,1533.172,Yes.
2008.07-526,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1538.007,1539.109,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1543.728,1553.202,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The text of the Indian Reorganization Act supports the Secretary's action here for three independent reasons."
2008.07-526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1577.818,1581.77,"So -- so the statute reads the same whether ""now"" is in there or not?"
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1586.423,1589.375,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1608.17,1612.907,So you're saying the only way that makes sense is to read it as if it weren't there.
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1612.907,1626.232,"--Ironically, Your Honor, I think the Congress added the term ""now under Federal jurisdiction"" to the Act, yes, to make clear that it -- it was a contemporaneous application of the term."
2008.07-526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1633.32,1657.186,"I'm not sure he was, because when I looked through that whole thing it seemed to me what they were worried about -- Senator Thomas was worried about remnants of tribes, and they were talking about an example of the Catawba Indians in South Carolina, and they had a discussion about that; and then it seemed everybody on the committee agreed that these Catawba Indians should not be included if they were only one quarter Indian."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1712.939,1715.455,"Well, the colloquy is certainly not clear, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1717.824,1718.843,I thought it was fairly clear.
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1718.843,1728.532,"--I -- I think the best reading of it is that Commissioner Collier is addressing Senator Wheeler's concern, not the earlier concern about the Catawbas, because he says ""Senator Wheeler"" --"
2008.07-526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1730.651,1736.555,"Yes, but they -- I mean, Senator Wheeler was worried about the Catawbas."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1744.042,1745.225,My memory of it--
2008.07-526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1745.225,1746.077,I'll go back to it.
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1746.077,1748.362,--My memory is that it was a different Senator who was concerned about the Catawbas.
2008.07-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1748.362,1751.145,Where -- where was this interesting conversation?
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1756.966,1758.734,"Well, I think it was at a hearing, Your Honor."
2008.07-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1758.734,1759.834,"It was at a hearing, oh."
2008.07-526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1759.834,1762.336,"You learn a lot at hearings, actually."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1762.336,1790.622,"But if I could, going back to the text, Justice Scalia, the text of the Act independently support the Secretary's reading for three reasons, the third being that even if one reads 18, 1934, the definition by its terms is expressly inclusive, setting forth the category of people that the Secretary must include but not limiting the Secretary to--"
2008.07-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1790.622,1791.705,He can include anybody else?
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1802.913,1804.449,--I think that would be a more--
2008.07-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.449,1807.734,"Very strange statute, just leaving it up to him to do whatever he wants."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1807.734,1816.055,"--I think the proper way of reading, as this Court said, definitions that start with ""shall include"" is that they are illustrative examples of a general group."
2008.07-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.055,1818.59,So -- so there is no limitations.
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1822.792,1829.279,"No, Your Honor; I think an illustrative example of a general class, it would be persons listed like the listed person."
2008.07-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1842.371,1851.894,"That's -- that's a very strange reading of ""shall include"" when you're dealing with a word that does not itself have any solid content."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1880.295,1882.33,"Well, it doesn't do that, Your Honor."
2008.07-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1906.629,1908.398,"Ms. Maynard, would you clarify one other thing for me?"
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1921.372,1922.323,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1927.292,1933.446,"So that is an expansive definition of the term ""Indian"", right?"
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1933.446,1934.465,The descendants.
2008.07-526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1942.987,1947.856,"Oh, so you're applying now, when you're talking about who is of Indian descent--"
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1947.856,1949.225,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1949.225,1958.331,"--Indian descent of those in 1934, but not when it's determining -- in other words, you say the Indian descent as of when?"
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1958.331,1963.115,"Descendants who were on June 1st, 1934."
2008.07-526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1971.138,1971.638,"Oh, I see."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1971.638,1972.756,--rather than the definition now.
2008.07-526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2021.071,2024.773,What do you do about United States v. John?
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2038.366,2043.818,"--Well, that's obviously dicta in the context of the decision, but I think in fact the addition of the brackets shows that it's ambiguous."
2008.07-526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2046.702,2053.208,"Well, but it -- it may have shown it's ambiguous, but it shows how -- shows how we resolved the ambiguity."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2053.208,2059.612,"Well, the Court wasn't resolving the meaning of the first definition in John, so I don't think the Court was resolving anything."
2008.07-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2063.814,2067.366,"It's pretty clear what the Court thought it meant, though, isn't it?"
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2076.372,2078.674,"--It's certainly not a holding, Justice Scalia--"
2008.07-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2078.674,2079.307,I agree.
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2079.307,2083.175,--that the text unambiguously forecloses any other reading.
2008.07-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2083.175,2083.542,I agree.
2008.07-526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2083.542,2083.959,What do I do about--
2008.07-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2083.959,2086.627,"It suggests that it's not very ambiguous, I think."
2008.07-526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2086.627,2108.706,"--What do I do about the fact -- I was looking this up -- Collier and Felix Cohn, the world's authority on Indian law, both write at the time: this means under Federal jurisdiction in 1934; and they write it and they rewrite it and they rewrite it."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2117.979,2128.287,"Well, apart from the Collier memo, which I would like to address, the Secretary when administering this Act has uniformly, since the beginning, applied the definition that applies today."
2008.07-526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2128.287,2148.7,"I could only find one instance, which is that Biloxi tribe, where the -- something, you know, the ones in Louisiana -- aside from that instance, I have not found one other instance that is inconsistent with the words 1934."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2148.7,2149.483,I don't know--
2008.07-526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2149.483,2150.95,"If you want to list them, I'll look them up."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2150.95,2153.835,--I don't know that the Secretary has ever undertaken to make such a list.
2008.07-526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2176.268,2187.159,"I believe that's organized or recognized, because what they did in several cases, I found, like the one, the Stillaquamish or whatever, they said, yes, we recognize them now."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2207.204,2214.893,"My understanding is that the Secretary interprets ""recognized"" and ""under Federal jurisdiction"" to not have much difference with respect to tribes."
2008.07-526,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2221.38,2229.402,"That, seems to me, not to help you, because if they are the same, then that would apply to both."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2242.043,2243.079,--And possibly you could.
2008.07-526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2263.743,2268.861,This is -- we are talking about an extraordinary assertion of power.
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2295.262,2303.551,"Well, there is -- there is a competing presumption there that I think is -- Chief Justice Roberts, which is that Indian statutes are interpreted to the benefit of the Indian."
2008.07-526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2305.236,2306.77,"Well, how do we know which one of them benefits the Indian?"
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2313.573,2317.358,"--Well, the Indians are the ones who made the request to have the land taken into trust."
2008.07-526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2321.977,2330.666,What are the plans the Indians have of doing with the land once it's determined to be Indian land subject to trust of the Federal Government?
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2330.666,2338.522,The administrative record reveals that HUD loaned the -- or granted the tribe money to build housing.
2008.07-526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2338.522,2342.724,"Yes, of course, the use of that land would not be limited to housing, right?"
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2346.461,2349.996,"According to the administrative record, there are some HUD restrictions on the land."
2008.07-526,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2375.744,2393.692,"The Chief Justice's question, and I was going to put the same question to Mr. Olson, is whether or not there is -- is some canon of construction, some principle of Federalism which makes us be very cautious before we take land out of the jurisdiction of the State."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2401.328,2402.63,"--Well, you've said--"
2008.07-526,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2402.63,2405.665,"--Or have we said the opposite, that there is no--"
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2405.665,2412.569,--Here I think it's very clear that the purpose of section 5 was to allow the Secretary to take land into trust for Indians.
2008.07-526,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2412.652,2423.258,--But is there any overriding principles about which we must be most cautious before we interpret the statute as depriving the State of the ownership and jurisdiction of this land?
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2427.643,2435.148,"--I don't know -- I don't know standing here and, Petitioners haven't cited anything for that principle in their brief, although they suggest -- of that."
2008.07-526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2453.193,2455.46,"Of course, your friend on the other side says the exact opposite."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2481.527,2486.331,"Well, the historians brief, I think, makes a good case that that's not the right view of history."
2008.07-526,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2528.622,2542.299,"As you read the statute, Ms. Maynard, the words ""now under Federal jurisdiction"" could be deleted and the statute would mean the same thing that you're urging."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2546.517,2558.909,"Well, I think, as I was saying earlier, I think the colloquy was -- reveals that what they were trying to do was make the statute fluid so that it would apply at the time of application contemporaneous move with the times."
2008.07-526,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2566.514,2573.651,"Well, there may -- there may not be, but let me on that score, take you back to an answer that Mr. Olson gave."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2610.693,2614.561,"--I'm not certain enough to say, Justice Souter."
2008.07-526,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2617.18,2619.215,"Well, tell us what you want us to do."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2619.215,2631.023,"I mean, you know, if the Court is going to take that view of the statute, then I suppose a remand is preferable to let it be worked out."
2008.07-526,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2632.44,2640.795,"In any case, you are not here to represent that, in fact, we may assume that there was no jurisdiction over the tribe at the time of the passage?"
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2640.795,2647.382,"You know, I just don't know that it's ever been looked into from that perspective, especially if one draws the difference--"
2008.07-526,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2647.382,2656.84,"Well, if it hasn't -- if it hasn't, then you're not in the position to make the representation that Mr. Olson -- I think Mr. Olson's answer suggested would be a correct one."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2656.84,2666.446,"--I believe that the Secretary's interpretation from the beginning, as I suggested before, has -- has understood recognition and under Federal jurisdiction at least with respect to tribes to be one and the same."
2008.07-526,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2684.674,2686.424,I'm sorry.
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2702.802,2704.452,--Which wasn't worked out?
2008.07-526,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2704.452,2715.443,"Well, you were -- you were saying that the -- that a distinction simply had not been drawn at the BIA level, I guess, between jurisdiction and recognition."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2728.184,2729.201,"Well, I think there--"
2008.07-526,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2729.201,2729.917,Would you agree?
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2729.917,2738.607,"--Well, if the Court limits its view to the one definitional example in the IRA, then perhaps a remand is certainly preferable to a reversal."
2008.07-526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2747.145,2758.703,"I wouldn't know that that's so, because the -- the question I ask myself on that is: Were I in Congress, is this the kind of thing I would have delegated to the Secretary to decide."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2790.841,2797.911,"--Even if you think, Justice Breyer, that 18, 1934, there are two other--"
2008.07-526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2797.911,2799.661,I'm not -- I'm not saying it unambiguously means it.
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2818.575,2832.732,"--Well, I think that one -- if one can't tell from the text in Chevron and other principles, that you allow the Secretary, in light of his understanding of the purposes of the statute, the plight of the Indians, contemporaneous things, to decide what the statute means."
2008.07-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2852.379,2854.248,Can I ask you a question?
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2924.258,2924.992,--I agree.
2008.07-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2938.566,2954.594,"I'm interested -- I'm interested in the Secretary's conclusion that recognized ""tribe"" and ""tribe now under Federal jurisdiction"" are one and the same; that the words are used redundantly."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2969.354,2971.37,"Well, I think maybe I didn't--"
2008.07-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2971.37,2976.924,"""Recognized tribe under Federal jurisdiction"", that, to me, means two different requirements."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2976.924,2985.797,--I think it can capture tribes that were previously recognized but that either disband or become -- become not -- not vibrant.
2008.07-526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3001.006,3002.658,"I have difficulty with the ""tribe"" thing."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3053.758,3055.293,"Two points, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3060.578,3061.613,"Well, there is one thing."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3074.421,3075.021,But in--
2008.07-526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3075.021,3081.86,"And now we have assumed a tribe that has no such members because ""Indian"" has a special definition."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3081.86,3091.216,--But later on in Section 5 it says we can take land in trust on behalf of an Indian tribe or an individual Indian for whom the land is required.
2008.07-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3091.216,3097.37,"I don't -- I don't understand how you say that -- that the term ""tribe"" has no limitation to Indians."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3107.392,3110.928,"Well, we have to graft on to the last clause where -- Indians residing on a reservation."
2008.07-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3117.949,3123.068,"Well, it's -- I mean circular definitions are nothing unusual in the legislation that Congress comes up with."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3123.068,3127.555,--But it -- that may be so but it doesn't unambiguously foreclose the Secretary's interpretation here.
2008.07-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3131.174,3133.543,What meaning -- what meaning do you think the sentence has when it says:
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3141.565,3142.699,--This Court had interpreted--
2008.07-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3142.699,3145.601,How can you interpret that not to be limited to Indian tribes?
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3145.601,3156.924,"--In Montoya this Court had interpreted in an earlier statute the term ""Indian tribe"" and ""organized band"" to mean a distinctly Indian community that shared political, ethnic, and cultural attributes."
2008.07-526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3156.924,3157.975,An Indian -- an Indian community.
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3161.812,3166.347,But the definition of Mr. Chief Justice.
2008.07-526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3171.834,3174.453,"Well, if it does it four times, you ought to give effect to it at least once."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3192.515,3193.365,"Well, the--"
2008.07-526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3193.365,3194.284,It's a defined term.
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3194.284,3197.318,"--Yes, and I grant you that it may graft on to the last clause."
2008.07-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3201.287,3208.959,It just describes the subcategory of Indian tribes who -- for whom members can qualify even though they don't have half blood.
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3214.411,3222.434,"Well -- but if you look broadly at the Act, Justice Stevens, there are provisions that are meant to address tribe issues and tribal issues."
2008.07-526,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3233.14,3235.408,"Then Collier, himself, would have been wrong."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3274.3,3279.418,"As we -- I discussed earlier, I don't agree with your reading of the colloquy."
2008.07-526,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3344.194,3359.804,"Of course if we just -- I'm sorry to jump back to the other provision, but if we disagree with your interpretation and Congress thinks we are wrong they can pass another one of these 15, 16 provisions that they have that says this tribe is -- is recognized now."
2008.07-526,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3359.804,3360.656,They could.
