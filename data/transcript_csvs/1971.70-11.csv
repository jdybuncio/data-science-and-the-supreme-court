1971.70-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,33.986,"We will hear arguments in number 11, Chevron Oils Company against Huson."
1971.70-11,0,34786,lloyd_cyril_melancon,,40.817,44.703,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-11,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,230.201,237.166,"May I ask if that point, did you or did you not argue laches in the Fifth Circuit?"
1971.70-11,0,34786,lloyd_cyril_melancon,,237.166,238.898,"We did not, Your Honor."
1971.70-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,256.247,257.879,That was a two-year --
1971.70-11,0,34786,lloyd_cyril_melancon,,257.879,258.43,One year.
1971.70-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,258.43,259.248,-- One-year limitation?
1971.70-11,0,34786,lloyd_cyril_melancon,,259.248,263.874,It was the same as the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act which is one year.
1971.70-11,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,314.025,316.456,"But the admiralty, it was not the Admiralty Act?"
1971.70-11,0,34786,lloyd_cyril_melancon,,316.456,317.083,That is right.
1971.70-11,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,342.802,352.317,"This thing, (Inaudible) the District Court’s jurisdiction is invoked as a Federal question?"
1971.70-11,0,34786,lloyd_cyril_melancon,,352.317,353.252,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-11,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,353.252,355.003,It is the diversity?
1971.70-11,0,34786,lloyd_cyril_melancon,,355.003,357.087,"Well, there is diversity between the parties."
1971.70-11,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,357.087,361.526,"I know it is, but that is a really Federal question (Voice Overlap) under the land of --"
1971.70-11,0,34786,lloyd_cyril_melancon,,361.526,366.58,"Yes, because they sued under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the --"
1971.70-11,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,366.58,370.269,"Did the Federal covered that, governed by Federal Law?"
1971.70-11,0,34786,lloyd_cyril_melancon,,370.269,373.749,"Tried in Louisiana Court, in the Federal Court in Louisiana."
1971.70-11,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,373.749,381.882,"And they have -- even if you bar a state law as Rodrigue or the statute says, it is still federal law?"
1971.70-11,0,34786,lloyd_cyril_melancon,,381.882,384.331,That is right.
1971.70-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,614.706,630.565,"There is some verbal controversy in the briefs that you and your brother filed as to whether or not this Louisiana period of limitation is a period of correction or whether it is a prescriptive right, does that --"
1971.70-11,0,34786,lloyd_cyril_melancon,,630.565,632.228,"We would confess error, Your Honor."
1971.70-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,632.228,635.108,Does that go to any of the basics of the issue?
1971.70-11,0,34786,lloyd_cyril_melancon,,635.108,635.817,"No, it does not."
1971.70-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,943.423,946.853,You will undertake to be as brief as your friend.
1971.70-11,1,41362,samuel_c_gainsburgh,,953.769,960.536,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-11,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,988.296,995.114,"Well, in addition to Rodrigue, I suppose he also has statutory language, does he not?"
1971.70-11,1,41362,samuel_c_gainsburgh,,995.114,995.452,He has that. (Voice overlap)
1971.70-11,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,995.452,1005.011,The statutory language is explicit that civil and criminal law of each adjacent state as the effective date of the subtracted are declared to be law of the United States?
1971.70-11,1,41362,samuel_c_gainsburgh,,1005.011,1011.209,"This is explicit language to be sure, Your Honor."
1971.70-11,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1011.209,1019.771,Judge Brown said do not let literalism prevent or emote on sound with the host?
1971.70-11,1,41362,samuel_c_gainsburgh,,1019.771,1029.832,"I think there, perhaps is more than a little merit to Judge Brown’s observation in this particular case."
1971.70-11,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1278.359,1279.465,May I ask --
1971.70-11,1,41362,samuel_c_gainsburgh,,1279.465,1279.763,Sure.
1971.70-11,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1279.763,1281.33,-- it is not particularly relevant.
1971.70-11,1,41362,samuel_c_gainsburgh,,1287.268,1295.355,"I think that the record, Your Honor, will disclose that plaintiff, the much time is slightly two years."
1971.70-11,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1347.505,1351.157,"It is a typical disk syndrome, is it not?"
1971.70-11,1,41362,samuel_c_gainsburgh,,1351.157,1370.263,"No, this is the review of the maritime law that a person who can show these things and who had shown these things is entitled to have his day in court and to have the defendant’s legal liability tested for it, but not under the Louisiana law."
1971.70-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1370.263,1374.757,Is this all together that Rodrigue be considered?
1971.70-11,1,41362,samuel_c_gainsburgh,,1374.757,1377.976,"Yes, it does, literally."
1971.70-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1377.976,1387.931,Do you also claim that Rodrigue is inconsistent with the Lands Act?
1971.70-11,1,41362,samuel_c_gainsburgh,,1387.931,1415.601,"Your Honor, our position is that the Rodrigue decision places an interpretation on the Lands Act which is inconsistent with the general admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of this Honorable Court and an interpretation which is not necessary to bring about the results that Congress apparently intended."
1971.70-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1420.137,1438.423,"You would say, though you are really saying that the admiralty law, if you really treated, particularly dealing with platform, vessels and people working on them as a seaman and at least have the admiralty law available to them?"
1971.70-11,1,41362,samuel_c_gainsburgh,,1438.423,1457.616,"Yes, Your Honor, but I would not particularly would seize upon the opportunity to suggest that it is not necessary to treat these high seas structures as vessels in order to make the man aboard them seaman, having them seaman is not problem."
1971.70-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.616,1461.279,(Voice Overlap) as I understand you say the admiralty law did apply not the law of the state?
1971.70-11,1,41362,samuel_c_gainsburgh,,1461.279,1479.827,"The general maritime law in the tort area would serve, I respectfully submit to this Court, would serve to achieve the ends that Your Honors attributed to Congress in Rodrigue, namely the maximum protection of the offshore worker."
1971.70-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.827,1481.043,What do you do with the language?
1971.70-11,1,41362,samuel_c_gainsburgh,,1482.991,1484.037,"It certainly is, sir."
1971.70-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1484.037,1486.11,And you either win or lose?
1971.70-11,1,41362,samuel_c_gainsburgh,,1486.11,1487.416,That is correct.
1971.70-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1487.416,1489.843,And so what do you do?
1971.70-11,1,41362,samuel_c_gainsburgh,,1507.633,1533.993,"I will respectfully suggest, Your Honor, again that the Congress said that they did not intend to treat them as vessels and we submit and have attempted to support our submission in our brief that it is not necessary that the presence of a vessel is not indispensable to maritime jurisdiction, and therefore, we believe that this situation is no different."
1971.70-11,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1659.773,1661.574,Except the statutory language?
1971.70-11,1,41362,samuel_c_gainsburgh,,1661.574,1672.908,"Except the statutory language, which the Fifth Circuit had interpreted as intending to apply maritime law to these platforms."
1971.70-11,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1844.982,1849.777,(Inaudible) briefly now.
1971.70-11,2,34786,lloyd_cyril_melancon,,1849.777,1878.822,"There is a serious issue, Mr. Justice Brennan, in connection with the plaintiff’s accident and the delays that involved that had not been presented, but simply to touch on them very briefly, the record does establish and show in the appendix that there is a serious dispute as to whether this man ever had an accident on the date alleged because his superior contends that they were working at Long View, Texas on this date and he knows that no accident happened."
1971.70-11,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1880.771,1881.881,That does not help us one way or the other (Voice Overlap)
1971.70-11,2,34786,lloyd_cyril_melancon,,1881.881,1886.277,"No, that is right, but just to clarify that point Mr. Justice Brennan raised."
1971.70-11,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1956.69,1957.351,Thank you gentleman.
