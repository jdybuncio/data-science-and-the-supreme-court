1982.82-276,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.934,We will hear arguments first this afternoon in Dirks against the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,11.602,15.274,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.82-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.551,224.58,"Mr. Bonderman, we are dealing here, I guess, only with the activities of Mr. Dirks in those few days before he went to the SEC."
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,224.58,229.701,"--That is correct, Justice O'Connor, from the 7th of March until the 26th of March."
1982.82-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,229.701,235.713,Why shouldn't he have gone in the first place to the SEC and then gone ahead and done all of the things that he did?
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,235.713,237.558,"Well, there are two answers to that."
1982.82-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,249.148,254.21,"Well, but I suppose you could argue to us that it should be a defense that he reported it to the SEC."
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,255.52,258.518,"--That brings me to what I suppose, perhaps, should have been my first."
1982.82-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,270.404,274.681,But isn't it his obligation to go as a broker/dealer to the SEC?
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,279.369,286.602,"--Well, the answer to that is, I would say first, if he has an obligation to go to the SEC at all--"
1982.82-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,286.602,289.098,"Does he ever, in your view, have an obligation?"
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,289.098,306.42,"--I believe not, but I believe that that is not material here because under the facts present what he had was a rumor, an unverified allegation, perhaps more than a rumor, but certainly less than fact, of the sort that goes on in the market all the time."
1982.82-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,319.476,340.327,"Well, if you would assume for purposes of answering the question that his obligation as a licensee to be a broker/dealer does obligate him to go to the SEC with the information, then could you agree that he ought to go there first?"
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,340.327,353.651,"--I think the answer to that is no because I believe that Mr. Dirks did, in fact, go to the SEC himself although Secrist told him on the 19th of March that Secrist had gone to the SEC... That turned out to be inaccurate."
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,396.694,397.552,Is this in the record?
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,397.552,398.133,--Yes it is.
1982.82-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,437.943,452.766,"But, I suppose, the SEC as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, though, found that the information he had during the days before he went to the SEC was material specific in detail?"
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,452.766,470.461,"Well, the answer to that is in part, yes, although what the Commission really found was at least and the Administrator alleges the same thing... at least, forgetting what happened earlier on, at least by the weekend between the 23rd and 26th he had such information."
1982.82-276,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,506.992,508.415,Before you go on with that--
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,508.415,508.977,"--Yes, sir."
1982.82-276,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,508.977,524.22,"--when a citizen, a private citizen, goes to the SEC as they sometimes go to the FBI, Department of Justice or a newspaper, are there any regulations first that could guarantee them anonymity?"
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,534.437,537.777,"The answer to both questions is, as far as I know, there are none."
1982.82-276,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,537.777,540.652,"They go at their own risk, then, don't they?"
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,540.652,541.603,I believe they do.
1982.82-276,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,590.148,612.59,"Now, on the other side of this equation, if it is an equation, I am not sure, if a person, an analyst, a securities analyst has clients who depend upon him, would he be at risk for a malpractice if he had information and did not give it to them?"
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,612.59,613.292,Well--
1982.82-276,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,613.292,617.167,Is there any malpractice suit that has reached that area yet?
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,617.167,631.912,"--One of the defenses raised by the persons to whom Dirks gave information and who traded... and let me just regress for a second to say, Dirks told literally a hundred people about this, some of whom bought, some of whom sold, some of whom did neither."
1982.82-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,741.867,747.723,Could Mr. Dirks and his firm have traded in the stock on their own during that interval of time?
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,747.723,754.002,"Well, the answer to that is I think there is an argument that they could, and I think there is an argument that they could not."
1982.82-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,754.002,755.269,What is your position?
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,757.921,778.882,"My position is that if those members of the court in Chiarella who expressed the view that misappropriation of information is grounds under 10b-5 and 17(a) for violation, and the information came to Dirks on the theory that he was going to disseminate it."
1982.82-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,820.429,837.202,"Would your... If the information that Mr. Dirks had received were merely adverse but not indicating criminal conduct, would Petitioner have been liable as a tippee for the failure to disclose?"
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,837.202,839.031,I think the answer to that is probably yes.
1982.82-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,839.031,839.904,Clearly yes.
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,839.904,840.953,That is correct.
1982.82-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,962.902,987.344,"But, if you are right, and if there is no accompanying obligation on Mr. Dirks to go right away to the SEC and disclose the information, then that would build an incentive to people who might uncover this information to continually, selectively disseminate it and to extend that time as long as possible to maximize their profits."
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,987.344,990.935,"Well, let me answer that this way, if I might, Justice O'Connor."
1982.82-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1019.395,1023.863,"Well, but if you are right, it might be done in the future for others."
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1023.863,1035.121,"--If, in fact, someone uses it to line their pocket in a direct sense, I think we have a different case, and, indeed, maybe can have a different rule."
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1094.585,1099.159,Would the sanction put on Dirks apply to anybody else who is not a broker/dealer?
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1099.159,1111.559,That depends if you believe that Judge Wright's single-judge opinion creating a broker/dealer duty to the whole world which he announced was breached.
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1117.51,1119.464,How about non-broker/dealers?
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1119.464,1123.57,--It would apply to anybody else who has an ethical standard of special care.
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1124.4,1126.428,"Well, what if The Wall Street Journal had published the information?"
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1126.428,1127.177,--I am sorry?
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1127.177,1129.879,What if The Wall Street Journal had published the information?
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1129.879,1136.474,"Well, if the question is whether they would now have a privilege against the libel laws, I do not think they would."
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1136.474,1136.786,"No, no, no."
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1139.987,1145.126,I think even the SEC would admit that publishing it in The Wall Street Journal makes it public.
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1151.217,1153.841,"But, that is using inside information."
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1158.135,1160.198,As I understand the SEC--
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1160.198,1164.273,"--Well, if Dirks had put out a big flyer and handed it out in a supermarket, would he had been any better off?"
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1164.273,1176.175,"--No, because the SEC takes the position and did take the position here, in fact, the administrative law judge said it was a position ""of great merit""."
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1185.327,1190.263,Could the SEC have got after some of Dirks' tippees--
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1190.263,1191.137,--They did.
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1191.137,1194.807,--who are not broker/dealers or anything else?
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1194.807,1195.558,They did.
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1195.558,1201.759,"So, anybody who was a tippee using inside information is subject to SEC sanctions?"
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1201.759,1205.632,"Yes, because the theory... The SEC has taken a walk on--"
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1205.632,1208.068,"Including a newspaper, I suppose?"
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1208.068,1213.286,--If the newspaper traded or someone used it to trade and it was not making it public.
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.22,1218.8,"Well, what about Dirks, I said."
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1236.351,1243.18,"--That is not public disclosure because the persons who do not go by Broad and Wall, for example, people trading in Seattle, Washington never find out about it."
1982.82-276,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1273.119,1288.238,"What if the SEC's basis for assertion of authority is the broker/dealer relationship, what action could they take to enforce this same sort of obligation against someone who is not a broker/dealer and who, therefore, is not subject to disciplinary proceedings?"
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1288.238,1292.158,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is not the SEC's position."
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1306.277,1307.354,It applies to everybody.
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1307.354,1315.071,Their view is that anybody who gets any information from inside the company automatically... that is the other half of Judge Wright's opinion--
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1315.071,1316.584,You are stuck with that?
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1316.584,1319.083,"--Well, automatically has a duty to disclose."
1982.82-276,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1320.175,1328.501,"Well, perhaps this question should be better put to you opponent, but how would the SEC propose to enforce that duty against someone who is not a broker/dealer?"
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1328.501,1332.844,--They would propose to sue them in a federal court.
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1338.199,1338.983,What would they sue for?
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1338.983,1346.321,--They would sue for aiding and abetting violations of 10b-5 by someone who traded.
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1348.962,1350.603,What would they ask for?
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1359.708,1362.235,--There is a tremendous damage liability.
1982.82-276,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1395.209,1397.459,May I ask you one question here about your theory.
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1418.17,1435.393,"Well, I think, in fairness the answer is not quite because what our theory has been is that under Chiarella looking at the majority concurrence and dissents, there should no liability for information where there is no breach of a duty."
1982.82-276,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1435.393,1438.911,"Well, in the case I posit, under your view, there is no breach of a duty."
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1440.845,1442.128,"Well, the answer to that--"
1982.82-276,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1442.128,1443.532,He has got information.
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1454.357,1456.12,"--I agree with that, and we do argue that."
1982.82-276,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1460.698,1463.292,"No, if the heart of your argument is no duty--"
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1463.292,1464.134,--That is correct.
1982.82-276,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1464.134,1467.492,--then is seems to me it applies in that situation as well as this one.
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1467.492,1468.883,That is the heart of our argument.
1982.82-276,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1498.417,1504.696,"If that is the test, why wasn't it a misappropriation to... even if he got only one indirect commission out of it... to that extent?"
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1506.334,1518.816,"I do not think so because everybody recognized that, and at least Secrist planned, if that is what it could be called, was that Dirks would do exactly what he did do, which was tell everybody in sight, which was not simply clients."
1982.82-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1524.311,1526.202,But not the SEC.
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1526.202,1531.092,He had reason to believe that the SEC knew... reason which was accurate.
1982.82-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1539.916,1554.176,"I guess I still do not understand what would be the matter with a rule that said, the broker/dealer can discharge his obligations, if there are any, by telling the SEC and then going ahead and doing whatever he wants because he has made it public."
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1555.907,1569.607,"That argument is inconsistent, as I understand it, both with the SEC's position and with the entire underlying basis for the development of the law being that it is nonpublic."
1982.82-276,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1599.251,1600.093,In the hearsay file.
1982.82-276,0,20574,david_bonderman,,1601.719,1603.311,--That is exactly where it is.
1982.82-276,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1612.462,1623.912,Mr. Gonson.
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,1623.912,1629.083,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.82-276,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1673.752,1676.17,Was anybody at SEC censured?
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,1676.17,1679.294,Was anybody at the Commission censured?
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1856.394,1868.559,I take it your position is it would not have made any difference to the SEC if he had gone to The Wall Street Journal first then the SEC and then to his clients.
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,1868.559,1869.682,"--Well, the point of the case--"
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1869.682,1871.683,"Would it make any difference to you, or not?"
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,1871.683,1875.805,--The question is whether the information should become public.
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1882.224,1889.13,"Well, I will just ask you again, what if... just leave The Wall Street Journal out... Suppose he had just gone to the SEC and then went ahead and did what he did."
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,1891.863,1893.455,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.843,1905.309,"So, it would not have satisfied his obligation under the law to go to the SEC first?"
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,1905.309,1905.886,--That is correct.
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1922.974,1924.678,Maybe it never will be.
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,1924.678,1928.098,"--Well, it may very well be."
1982.82-276,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1939.313,1949.384,"Well, of course, your ordinary analyst... He makes his living by analyzing rumors and that sort of thing, doesn't he?"
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,1951.541,1970.533,The Commission pointed out in its opinion that it views the role of analyst as very important and said that they perform valuable functions in putting forth their analytical skills in evaluating data and then putting them together in what has sometimes been referred to as a mosaic.
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.292,2023.917,How does Dirks make anything public?
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2031.992,2037.693,"He could have gone to the New York Stock Exchange, which he did not do."
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2039.097,2042.786,What would he have done at the New York Stock Exchange?
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2042.786,2043.769,--Pardon me?
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2046.44,2047.423,"Well, they may not have either."
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2050.016,2050.468,--That is correct.
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.077,2052.593,So how could he do it?
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2052.593,2058.014,"It may be that he could not do it, Your Honor, but that if he could not do it, then he could not trade on it."
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.997,2064.589,"The only way he could do it if he traded himself, he should tell his customers."
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2066.024,2067.322,--If there is a way for him to do that.
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2068.009,2076.817,"What if he insisted to his clients, now, look, before you unload this bad stock, you should tell the person that you are unloading it on that it is bad."
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2076.817,2080.534,"--That is the principle, Your Honor, yes, exactly right."
1982.82-276,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2091.125,2098.624,"Well, I am just not clear, then, what your response is to Justice White about what Mr. Dirks could have done to make it public."
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2100.87,2102.386,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-276,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2112.817,2114.006,"And, if it were not published, then what could he do?"
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2114.708,2120.035,"--If it were not published and it otherwise did not become publicly available, then he could not have traded on it."
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2120.035,2121.252,That is your position.
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2126.095,2128.08,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-276,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2128.08,2139.307,"Mr. Gonson, suppose Dirks had not been a broker/dealer and still the information had come to him and he passed it on."
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2146.572,2155.832,"Well, to take the first part of your question, Your Honor, the SEC could have, I do not know whether it would have, could have instituted an injunctive action--"
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.832,2158.94,Against this non-broker/dealer?
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2158.94,2160.219,--Against the non-broker/dealer.
1982.82-276,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2174.356,2182.322,"Suppose Mr. Dirks had told only Mr. Lawson of The Wall Street Journal and Mr. Lawson had kept the information, would Dirks be liable?"
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2182.322,2184.323,"I am sorry, Your Honor, I did not quite catch your question."
1982.82-276,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2184.323,2188.024,Let's assume that Dirks was not a broker/dealer.
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2203.345,2208.624,"Your Honor, that would... Your Honor is constructing a chain of what we refer to as tippees--"
1982.82-276,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2208.624,2210.294,Would Dirks be liable?
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2213.558,2226.727,"--Dirks would be liable if, as we have in the facts in this case, he received information from a person he knew as an insider and the insider wanted him to transmit that information to others so others could sell."
1982.82-276,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2228.414,2233.144,Even though Lawson himself owned no stock--
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2233.144,2236.299,If Lawson traded on the basis of that information.
1982.82-276,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2236.299,2238.393,"--Well, he told his friend."
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2241.703,2254.526,"The chain goes as far, Your Honor, as persons who know that they receive information from an inside source and intend or reasonably expect either that they or the person they told it to will trade on it."
1982.82-276,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2258.382,2260.96,"So, each member of the chain would be liable?"
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2262.398,2263.1,"Yes, if they knew."
1982.82-276,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2263.1,2265.335,"Well, yes."
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2265.335,2270.724,"Otherwise, all kinds of devious arrangements could be made to bypass the effect of these laws."
1982.82-276,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2291.169,2295.743,Did Secrist want to make a private profit or was he just interested in exposing it?
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2295.743,2299.803,"So far as the record shows, Secrist was just interested in exposing."
1982.82-276,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2322.014,2335.226,Does the SEC take the position that a broker/dealer has an obligation to disclose to the SEC evidence of criminal conduct that the broker/dealer learns of?
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2335.226,2338.478,"Your Honor, the SEC did not take that position in this case."
1982.82-276,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2338.478,2341.383,"Well, does it take that position generally?"
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2341.383,2347.818,That the broker/dealer has an independent obligation to report crime to the SEC?
1982.82-276,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2349.019,2353.69,To report anything uncovered in the area of criminal activity.
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2355.312,2356.798,"I am not aware that it has taken that position, Your Honor."
1982.82-276,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2356.798,2362.312,Not as part of the duties of the licensee or professional obligations of the licensee?
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2362.312,2363.388,So far as I am aware.
1982.82-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2363.388,2372.602,"Do I correctly understand, the SEC does not place any reliance on his status as a broker/dealer at this stage of the proceeding, other than for the discipline purpose?"
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2372.602,2373.538,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2380.273,2397.092,"Your theory would be exactly the same if it were a non-broker/dealer, and is it not correct that if the same case arose in the future, it would be, in your view, it would subject the person who passed on the information when he should not have to a liability of around $17,000,000?"
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2397.092,2399.747,--In a private action?
1982.82-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2399.747,2400.278,Yes.
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2400.278,2402.481,Assuming the requisites for liability--
1982.82-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2402.481,2403.167,These facts.
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2403.591,2405.182,--for a private action were met.
1982.82-276,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2418.804,2427.926,"--Well, does it follow from your answer that if Blundell, the reporter, had done everything that Dirks had done, that he might be liable?"
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2427.926,2434.313,"--If Blundell knew everything that Dirks knew and himself traded, the answer is yes, Blundell would be liable."
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2437.39,2441.792,"But, he would not be liable if he put it in the paper?"
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2441.792,2443.621,--He would not be liable if he put it in the paper.
1982.82-276,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2451.228,2463.723,"What if it is a reporter for the Albuquerque Journal instead of The Wall Street Journal, does publishing in the Albuquerque Journal about, say a New York Stock Exchange traded security count as disclosure in your book?"
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2463.723,2470.297,"It may... Yes, Your Honor, it may be adequate disclosure if, in fact... It probably would be."
1982.82-276,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2475.812,2482.011,Most individuals do not have access to a wire service that they can just go to their office and start typing out a message.
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2482.011,2484.105,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2501.021,2503.829,"May I ask one other question, please."
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2519.107,2523.494,"That raises the question, Your Honor, as to whether that information was material."
1982.82-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2565.897,2576.067,"But the duty arises when the information becomes material, and, of course, you are not entirely sure when it is material until you get the additional information, I guess."
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2576.067,2582.081,"--Well, the question of materiality is a question, I suppose that you should probably assess at the time--"
1982.82-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2582.081,2583.5,That is what triggers the duty?
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2583.5,2585.563,"--That is correct, the materiality of the information."
1982.82-276,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2585.563,2591.124,"Mr. Gonson, we are not giving you much of a chance to argue you case, but there are so many interesting questions."
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2613.21,2615.02,"No, he did not, Your Honor."
1982.82-276,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2615.02,2616.006,He did not.
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2616.006,2619.082,"No argument made by... no duties to share-holders, not to the corporate--"
1982.82-276,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2619.082,2622.362,If he had finally concluded five years later that he had a guilty conscience.
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2635.277,2639.368,--By virtue of the fact that he knew the information for a long time?
1982.82-276,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2639.368,2640.823,Yes.
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2652.302,2654.205,"Well, that raises a number of questions, Your Honor."
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2681.136,2692.83,Would an obligation that Dirks' clients owed to their buyers have anything to do with inside information?
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2695.786,2696.784,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2696.784,2702.548,"So, they may have a duty, an independent duty under 10b--"
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2702.548,2707.406,"Their duty, Your Honor, is derivative of Secrist's duty in this case."
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2707.406,2708.576,"--Well, why is that?"
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2719.355,2723.539,"Your Honor, this case is about Secrist's duty as an insider--"
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2723.539,2725.414,I understand that.
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2725.414,2727.208,--and persons who stand in his shoes.
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2727.208,2744.062,What could... Suppose a holder of Equity stock who gets ahold of some inside information and decides to sell his stock because he does not think it is worth what it should be and he sells it.
1982.82-276,1,37945,paul_gonson,,2751.904,2756.244,"Are you speaking of whether the company has a right of action, Your Honor?"
1982.82-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2756.244,2756.65,Yes.
1982.82-276,2,20574,david_bonderman,,3494.63,3499.692,"If I might make a few brief points in my remaining time, I would like to answer Justice White's questions."
1982.82-276,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3518.839,3524.853,"Dirks could get off the hook by making the whole thing public, in which event, everybody would go down together."
1982.82-276,2,20574,david_bonderman,,3524.853,3527.04,--Except Dirks could not make it public.
1982.82-276,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3531.1,3532.535,"Well, suppose it was printed."
1982.82-276,2,20574,david_bonderman,,3532.535,3541.905,"--If The Wall Street Journal had, in fact, published it, which it refused to do, I would believe that the SEC would have said, okay, thereafter it is public."
1982.82-276,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3543.126,3545.938,Then everybody could take his chances?
1982.82-276,2,20574,david_bonderman,,3545.938,3549.278,"--That is right, but the truth is that Dirks, remember, did not trade."
1982.82-276,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3554.964,3556.668,Let me ask you one other question about your theory.
1982.82-276,2,20574,david_bonderman,,3562.335,3563.368,I think so.
1982.82-276,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3563.368,3564.289,Why?
1982.82-276,2,20574,david_bonderman,,3564.289,3569.958,"Because I believe it is not us, but the SEC is confused as to whom Mr. Secrist has a duty."
1982.82-276,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3593.698,3607.304,"What if he tried to tell The Wall Street Journal just as Dirks did, and The Wall Street Journal would not publish and then he said, well, the only way I can get this into the public is by selling and causing the market to fall and cause an investigation, would he still be liable?"
1982.82-276,2,20574,david_bonderman,,3607.304,3608.349,--I think that is a tough case.
1982.82-276,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3624.654,3628.342,"No, but if he had traditional inside information, he would be in the same position."
1982.82-276,2,20574,david_bonderman,,3628.342,3634.214,"But, that is because there would have been a breach of duty supposedly in making that information available."
1982.82-276,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3643.6,3652.315,"Well, their argument is that the duty to refrain or disclose was something that imposed on Secrist, he violated that and the person to whom he disclosed had the same duty."
1982.82-276,2,20574,david_bonderman,,3653.002,3655.86,--The problem with their theory is that it is obviously wrong.
1982.82-276,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3700.374,3701.264,"Thank you, gentlemen."
