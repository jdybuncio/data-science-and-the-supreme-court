1967.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,14.005,No.54 United States Petitioner versus R. B. Rands et al.
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,69.673,74.329,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,314.668,319.305,"Well, was there any evidence at all of whether the value for -- as to port site?"
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,319.305,322.889,There was an offer of proof after the district judge's ruling.
1967.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,334.202,336.031,Quite very large for a port site?
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,336.031,343.8,"It's a -- as far as I can tell, it's not entirely clear but both facts weren't litigated but I think it's something like 30 acres."
1967.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,360.636,365.479,What is the value of the land that it has -- from the judgment?
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,365.479,371.453,"The combined judgment covering both tracks of 260 acres is $9,000."
1967.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,371.453,372.325,"$9,000?"
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,372.325,374.568,"$9,000 somewhat."
1967.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,374.568,380.934,And the land -- I understand this land has since been leased or was leased before that?
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,380.934,382.873,It has subsequently been sold --
1967.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,382.873,383.395,Pardon?
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,383.395,402.175,"It has subsequently been sold together with several thousand other acres to the State of Oregon by the United States, the United States reserving an easement to flow so that this land can be underwater as far as the Federal Government is concerned."
1967.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,411.147,417.077,Is there anything there would indicate what the rental value of this particular piece of property is?
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,417.077,431.806,"Well, there is this evidence -- this offer would have to be tested and I don't know whether it was an offer made in light of the Government's project already underfoot."
1967.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,456.155,457.348,30 acres?
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,457.348,461.296,"Something like 30 maybe 50 acres, something like that."
1967.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,554.558,559.635,"That port site value, what area do -- would you include?"
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,571.779,579.266,"Well, we were willing to -- we were willing and more or less to agree that anything they said was a port site."
1967.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,582.888,590.852,"Yes, by port site, do you include this -- I understand this was made an industrial park where --"
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,590.852,590.995,Well --
1967.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,590.995,600.429,-- suppose where industries could buy in the land and put up industries barely close to the port and so forth as a --
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,600.429,600.72,"Well, let me be --Do you think"
1967.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,600.72,606.598,the Government -- made the Government have that to develop the water way?
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,606.598,607.151,Well I'm not clear.
1967.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,614.931,615.793,"Well, there is a difference --"
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,615.793,617.987,Potentially -- yes sir.
1967.54,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,631.253,640.573,"Well, I thought the Federal Government would have transferred the land to Oregon for the condition on it that this land would be used as a port site or it can revert for United States."
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,640.573,648.775,"Well, this and the several thousands or 2,000 other acres were to be developed for industrial and port purposes."
1967.54,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,662.108,678.097,"Well, it seems to me that if you are going to cover this land so that it would have no value as a port site, wouldn't have any value as of -- as in a -- as land on which you operate a port.If you're going to cover it up well that's the easy answer to the United States against the -- this case."
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,681.187,682.731,"Well, it had so --"
1967.54,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,682.731,689.901,It seems to me with the United States so as the State of Oregon you either use it for a port or you got to give it back to us.
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,696.839,697.17,"Right,"
1967.54,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,697.17,698.135,It's another question.
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,698.135,709.031,"I suppose what the United States is stating to Oregon is, that you use this entire track on the portion of which is going to be underwater, as a port site to the extent that it can be utilized as a port site."
1967.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,714.128,719.301,"And the fact that it -- that some of it was used as an industrial park, it doesn't mean there won't be a port there."
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,721.129,733.647,"Absolutely, I gather that's a very -- the substantial reason for having."
1967.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,813.578,838.775,"Aren't there two possible constructions in the term port site on that it's a port site without reference to what the United States did to the stream and two, that it's a port site in terms of the U.S. development of the stream and which you are talking about here."
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,838.775,847.707,"Well, I take it and there I think in fairness their offer of proof indicates that it had historically been used as a landing before any (Voice Overlap) acts --"
1967.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,847.707,859.572,As I understand that but the value that it had as a historic landing might be considerably less than its value as a port site after the U.S. development.
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,859.572,861.98,I think that's right.
1967.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,865.59,869.815,"Yes, but what is it theoretically and conceptually?"
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,883.967,890.156,I think by traditional rules they were -- it was the port site value before the John Day project.
1967.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,890.156,890.424,Yes.
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,890.424,898.229,"But after sec -- projects that could be regarded as separate by Bonneville, Grand Coulee, whatever else we might bear on."
1967.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,898.229,899.122,Why is that?
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,909.515,922.785,"Well, my understanding is that to take it out of the navigational context, the Government doesn't pay enhancement resulting from the very project of these -- for the taking."
1967.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,929.137,931.006,Was that the rule of law?
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,931.006,931.79,I think --
1967.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,931.79,931.834,(Inaudible)
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,931.834,933.173,-- this Court has decided that.
1967.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,933.173,933.643,I beg your pardon.
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,933.643,937.087,I think this Court has so held in a fair number of cases.
1967.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,937.087,947.565,That you do pay thinking of counting the incremental value from government projects except for the one that led to the taking?
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,947.565,954.918,I think it would -- it lead to impossibility if you didn't say that because you'd think -- begin to worry about the value of having the military.
1967.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,954.918,957.428,But I'm not sure that --
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,957.428,962.604,I don't think that's the question that any court here has reached nor that this Court has to reach now.
1967.54,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,962.604,971.561,Does the record show any tonnage of wheat rather than (Inaudible) passes through this area where the port is located?
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,971.561,975.904,I don't think it shows anything in very mathematical terms.
1967.54,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,992.504,995.051,Where does it (Inaudible)?
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,995.051,1003.453,It is at some points how busy it is at this particular juncture where navigation has been so much more difficult than lower down.
1967.54,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1408.674,1416.517,"But it is limited to a navigational servitude whatever that might be, isn't it?"
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1416.517,1418.484,That's right.
1967.54,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1425.684,1426.662,I know.
1967.54,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1426.662,1435.25,Does someone who wants to develop a port on a stream like this have to have a permit from the Federal Government?
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1435.25,1445.734,"The rules as I understand it are that until the Corps of Engineers establishes a harbor line, you have to get permission to build anything."
1967.54,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1464.125,1473.384,"Would the United States within its navigational servitude have the right to say of a port should not be located at this point, at point A but rather at point B?"
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1473.384,1474.493,Unquestionably.
1967.54,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1475.425,1485.325,"So if the United States decided that there should be a port on this area but at point B, there will not be one at point A, this land would've had no value as a port site."
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1485.325,1486.437,I think that's right.
1967.54,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1498.54,1506.515,But there's no riparian right to use the water for a port -- leaving and coming to land.
1967.54,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1506.515,1507.881,Absolutely not.
1967.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1615.15,1619.912,Mr. Parks.
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,1619.912,1625.005,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1720.367,1731.011,But the value that you're talking about is a value as an enhancement which flows from the use of water in some way maybe not in the flow but in the use of it.
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,1731.011,1731.884,"Oh, yes of course (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1731.884,1736.845,We're not just talking about enhancement from location.
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,1762.774,1764.221,"I think this necessarily follows, --"
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1764.221,1764.314,Yes.
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,1764.314,1765.911,--Mr. Justice White.
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1919.025,1920.904,What statute was it condemnable?
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,1920.904,1922.61,It was condemned on the Rivers and Harbors Act.
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1923.633,1926.254,Is there any standard of value in the Rivers and Harbors Act?
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,1928.28,1930.527,"Its fair market value, yes sir."
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1930.527,1936.531,"Well, there's no doubt that between private parties, this land could've been bought and sold at a --"
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,1936.531,1937.536,Substantial.
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.536,1940.35,-- considerably enhanced price because of its value as a port.
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,1940.35,1941.606,No question about it Your Honor.
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1941.606,1952.515,"So a -- but you aren't arguing but -- and but United States -- even if it has a fair market value in the private market as a port site, the Government is arguing what, that a --?"
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,1952.515,1957.167,It's arguing that it can take it in not pay one cent for the value as a port site.
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.167,1959.994,Because it's constitutionally entitled to do that?
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,1965.899,1967.532,Apparently not if they give it away.
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.678,1979.954,"I know but if they say, ""We will pay the fair market value of the land"", then the issue becomes what is fair marketing -- what its fair market value mean in the intent of Congress."
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,1979.954,1981.137,That is correct.
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.572,1988.738,And they constitutionally been able to exclude the port site value but did it?
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,1988.738,1991.014,We contend it did not.
1967.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2013.848,2016.319,"Mr. Parks, could you speak a little (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2016.319,2016.887,I'm very sorry.
1967.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2016.887,2021.43,-- more direct into the microphone please.
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2021.43,2028.672,"After having received the conveyance, the State of Oregon then in turn lease the lands to the Boeing Company."
1967.54,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2160.271,2169.174,Did you have wharves and docks at this port site before flooding?
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2169.174,2171.61,"We did not at the time of taking, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1967.54,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2171.61,2173.427,Was it developed at all?
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2173.427,2175.536,It had been used historically and there was a whole landing there at one time.
1967.54,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2175.536,2180.622,"Well, was it developed at all as a port?"
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2186.802,2187.933,Not at the time of taking.
1967.54,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2188.913,2190.936,"Well, had there been historically?"
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2190.936,2192.583,Yes sir.
1967.54,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2192.583,2195.678,And how long ago had they existed?
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2195.678,2199.023,"Around the turn of a century, as near as we can tell."
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.023,2204.802,Also the state (Inaudible) on this land for port development purposes?
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2204.802,2206.674,"Yes, they -- they've secured an option from us only --"
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2206.674,2208.425,"For $50,000?"
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2208.425,2208.863,Sir?
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2208.863,2210.219,"For $50,000?"
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2210.219,2211.635,"Well, it -- roughly around that figure."
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.78,2235.293,Have they paid the Government 17 for it?
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2235.293,2236.253,Sir?
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.253,2242.581,Had they -- had the -- how much did Oregon pay the United States for the land?
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2242.581,2245.351,"Approximately for this section, $20 an acre, essentially what --"
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2245.351,2247.47,"$17,000?"
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2247.47,2248.703,Somewhere around there sir.
1967.54,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2564.002,2579.569,"But suppose that the -- beginning of a century, you'd have -- or assume we have assumed that after this technology permitted, it had on this land a wheel that forgives the electric power."
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2591.773,2592.98,No sir.
1967.54,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2592.98,2594.412,But for -- what's the difference?
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2609.588,2615.23,"I think the essential difference is -- differences I should say, plural or two."
1967.54,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2644.037,2647.145,"Well, that can be argued both ways."
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2647.145,2649.931,Unfortunately I can't.
1967.54,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2649.931,2655.375,Unfortunately.
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2655.375,2663.893,"At first blush, it might seem rather unusual that the Submerged Lands Act would deem to apply to this case at all."
1967.54,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2663.94,2680.017,"Well, is that your answer to me that you distinguish between the established doctrines to distinguish where the established doctrine about non-compensability of power sites, hydroelectric power sites."
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2695.801,2697.25,"No sir, I would hope not."
1967.54,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2713.34,2726.549,"Well, that -- it seem to be a fortiori but where a riparian right such as the port site where riparian right such as port site is taken over."
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2741.179,2742.427,"Oh, I have this answer, sir."
1967.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2990.724,2993.887,I thought they were involved in the Virginia Electric Case.
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,2996.856,2999.22,"They were fast land values, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1967.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2999.22,3001.378,Agriculture and timber values and the --
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3001.378,3002.163,Yes sir.
1967.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3002.184,3004.679,-- those were the value of compensation in that case.
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3004.679,3009.466,And of course the Court disallowed any fast land values attributable to the waterpower or production (Voice Overlap) --
1967.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3009.466,3011.448,To their riparian nature of the land?
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3011.448,3014.642,I should have stated that no other fast land values of a riparian --
1967.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3014.642,3014.697,(Inaudible)
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3014.697,3015.739,-- of riparian nature (Voice Overlap) --
1967.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3015.739,3016.384,I understand.
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3016.384,3018.885,I beg your pardon.
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3230.142,3242.79,Well here -- I guess -- suppose your argument would be to the conclusion wholly commentary to what the counsel for the Government should involve (Inaudible).
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3254.75,3255.328,He could be --
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3255.328,3258.066,"And your riparian owner, he should develop a port there."
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3260.123,3261.403,"No sir, I'm not saying that."
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3264.714,3275.942,"Well, what -- how could you say that the Submerged Lands Act (Inaudible) riparian owners, that is port facilities or (Inaudible)?"
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3275.942,3276.086,No.
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3292.191,3299.944,All I am trying to say is (Inaudible).
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3299.944,3300.283,They could even do that.
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3300.283,3303.337,"(Inaudible) by someone else, suppose to do it."
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3303.337,3303.544,They could even do that.
1967.54,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3303.544,3304.388,They could do that?
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3304.388,3304.639,Yes sir.
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3304.639,3308.834,"What that really means there is, the Government still owns the water, right?"
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3308.834,3309.566,Yes sir.
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3309.566,3312.462,And that they could control the use of it.
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3312.462,3313.625,It could control the use of the water.
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3313.625,3317.585,And your value -- you're talking about perhaps on the use of the water.
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3317.585,3318.932,I don't see it that way Your Honor.
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3319.186,3321.917,(Inaudible)
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3321.917,3323.171,"I -- like I said so, I could mean to."
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3323.171,3332.667,"(Inaudible) without the use of the water, the value you're talking about is (Inaudible)."
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3332.667,3333.804,"Yes sir, that is correct."
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.668,3342.635,I know but what's a port site?
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3342.635,3345.167,It's a site located next to navigable waters.
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3345.167,3350.602,"Oh, well, it's not a port site though except from the assumption that you can use the water."
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3350.602,3351.486,"Undoubtedly correct, sir."
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3353.954,3360.994,This really comes to the Submerged Land Act (Inaudible).
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3360.994,3370.454,"Well if we are to believe what the Attorney General's brief says, they're interested in seeing that the Federal Government retains its control over navigable waterways."
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3379.621,3397.782,"Well, you know, if they take it that all the United States (Inaudible) you don't have a water and we can control the -- and then the value you're talking about rest on the use of the water but you don't own the right to use the water."
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3411.269,3413.995,"I have said -- I have agreed that they -- under their power of control, they could do that."
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3413.995,3422.979,"Well, what is it then that you and the (Inaudible) but that wouldn't give you a right for compensation."
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3422.979,3426.712,May I call the Court's attention to the Gerlach Livestock Case.
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3445.953,3447.347,And what (Inaudible)?
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3447.347,3449.535,As irrigation water.
1967.54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3469.531,3474.847,(Inaudible)
1967.54,1,16705,alex_l_parks,,3474.847,3479.233,"Yes sir, considerably."
1967.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3479.233,3481.421,Mr. Rifkind.
1967.54,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3481.421,3483.958,"Mr. Chief Justice, please the Court."
1967.54,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3531.533,3537.213,What other statutes -- does that make any reference to another statute (Voice Overlap) --

1967.54,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3540.177,3541.766,The law of condemnation.
1967.54,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3544.203,3552.786,"(Inaudible) generally applicable, the condemnation statute which -- under which the Government concedes the declaration of (Inaudible) etcetera?"
1967.54,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3552.786,3555.836,There are provisions for expediting the taking and so on.
1967.54,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3555.836,3559.411,(Inaudible)
1967.54,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3559.411,3567.567,"As far as I know at the moment, they all simply referred to the constitutional standard or have always been assumed to refer to that standard."
1967.54,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3567.567,3571.46,"You mean, it expressed that there's no such -- that they shall be paid the fair market value (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.54,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3571.46,3571.902,That's right.
1967.54,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3571.902,3572.818,-- anything like that?
1967.54,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3572.818,3579.584,There's nothing like that as far as I know just compensation.
1967.54,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3583.97,3592.296,"Well, if the -- why would they (Inaudible)?"
1967.54,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3592.296,3593.426,That's all I can say.
