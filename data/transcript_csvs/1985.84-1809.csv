1985.84-1809,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.474,We will hear arguments next in the Federal Trade Commission against Indiana Federation of Dentists.
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,31.369,43.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves a conspiracy by Indiana dentists to refuse ex-rays requested by group dental health care insurers."
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,207.301,211.753,"That was the extent of their boycott, wasn't it, just not providing the ex-rays?"
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,211.753,213.039,--That was the extent of the boycott.
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,221.561,224.512,They didn't refuse to serve patients that were covered by these health plans?
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,224.512,226.196,"No, they would continue to serve patients."
1985.84-1809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,330.699,339.905,"Ms. Tiffany, the Commission refused to find that it had the result of diminishing competition among insurers, did it not?"
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,339.905,343.424,The Commission declined to find that it diminished competition among insurers.
1985.84-1809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,343.424,360.801,"The Commission seems to have conducted a sort of abbreviated rule of reason analysis here, not really doing a full-blown inquiry into the economic effects of the boycott, as I understand it."
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,360.801,361.635,That's correct.
1985.84-1809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,379.53,386.501,Do you think an abbreviated rule of reason analysis is justified?
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,386.501,390.404,--I don't believe we would refer to it as an abbreviated rule of reason.
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,537.334,549.308,"Well, is there something in this record that indicates that furnishing these ex-rays would be a step to contain costs?"
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,549.308,551.475,The cost containment--
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,551.475,553.926,Did the Commission make any findings about that?
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,553.926,562.716,--The Administrative Law Judge made a finding that the cost containment efforts were generally... in general experience were effective ones.
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.734,566.351,"Well, with respect to the ex-rays."
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,566.351,569.52,--The ex-rays were needed to do the cost containment.
1985.84-1809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,580.594,583.613,Did the Commission uphold that finding?
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,583.613,614.251,"The Commission basically took the position that it really wasn't necessary to establish one way or the other that the cost containment efforts were in fact effective in this particular case, rather, that the insurance companies were entitled to give an innovative cost containment effort a chance to operate, which they did not have here, and in fact that was one of the difficulties of getting evidence in Indiana, because right about the same time the insurance companies started the alternate benefit programs, the boycott began."
1985.84-1809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,638.532,640.568,How widespread is this practice?
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,640.568,644.02,You mean throughout the country or in Indiana?
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,693.001,705.075,"Well, that may be a desirable goal or policy, but you were going to get around to saying how that restrains competition."
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,705.075,705.844,--Yes.
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.844,714.532,"I mean, how their conduct restrains competition, even if it maybe isn't in the public interest in terms of cost containment."
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,714.532,719.751,"Well, there were several effects on competition, several ways that competition was restrained."
1985.84-1809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,728.074,728.54,"I know, but--"
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,730.792,735.113,The competition among the dentists was certainly both for dollars and for patients.
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,748.504,755.241,"Well, is that an injury to competition?"
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,755.241,757.61,When the cost of insurance--
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,757.61,766.382,When the patient can't find a dentist who will send his ex-rays in?
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,769.417,773.885,"--The competition was... yes, in fact I believe it would be a restraint on competition."
1985.84-1809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,778.539,798.151,"Ms. Tiffany, Judge Fairchild's concurring opinion, he didn't join Judge Coffey's opinion, he says pretty clearly that no evidence was developed on the validity of an assumption that a dentist's policy of refusal of cooperation has any significance in competition among dentists, and the FTC decision fails to analyze the proposition."
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,800.853,804.405,"Yes, we do disagree with his opinion, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-1809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,804.405,811.227,"It seems to me that the two... talks about, you know, this is the battle for cost containment and this is the big picture."
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,817.731,826.254,In the Professional Engineers case there was a restraint that dealt with bidding.
1985.84-1809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,869.533,876.87,But how about the failure of the FTC to make a finding that it affected competition among insurers?
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,876.87,877.57,The--
1985.84-1809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,877.57,883.341,Aren't you just trying to come in the back door with something the FTC refused to let in the front door?
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,883.341,886.126,--That really would be a very secondary finding.
1985.84-1809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,910.324,919.882,"Now, what the FTC declined to find was that the dentists' concerted action reduced competition among insurers."
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,929.822,930.905,"Oh, no, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-1809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,947.199,949.066,Who is the buyer here?
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,954.47,956.972,The buyer is really a bifurcated one.
1985.84-1809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,960.357,962.043,What is the product here?
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,973.183,973.633,No.
1985.84-1809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,973.633,974.533,Is that the product?
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,974.533,975.283,"No, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,975.283,975.885,No?
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,975.885,978.152,The product is dental services.
1985.84-1809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1004.12,1017.212,I would have thought perhaps the product was the advice or evaluation services that insurers provide in competition with dentists.
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1017.212,1029.77,"There certainly is an element of the insurer providing a second opinion, if you will, to the patient, and that was a loss to the patient, not having the benefit of this second opinion."
1985.84-1809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1034.222,1037.674,"Well, maybe it is just a product effect, not a price effect."
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1037.674,1038.876,--I think that's right.
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1055.92,1060.806,Among dentists?
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1062.174,1064.258,The--
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1064.258,1073.216,"That is all they really find, is, it resulted in reducing or eliminating competition among dentists as to their policy of dealing with third party payers."
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1073.216,1074.382,"--Yes, the--"
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.382,1075.949,"That is what they really focused on, isn't it?"
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1075.949,1080.536,"--That is correct, Justice White, and they had substantial evidence to reach that conclusion."
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1099.414,1102.483,"Well, spell that out a little."
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1123.063,1123.565,Absolutely.
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1123.565,1132.053,Because the word would get around that here these hardnoses won't really cooperate with my insurance company?
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1132.053,1136.588,"Absolutely, Justice White, and there is evidence in the record to support that."
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1149.062,1152.716,"Well, the Commission could have said a little more than it did, it seems to me."
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1152.716,1162.905,"--Justice White, in hindsight, we all perhaps could be more clear, and so, too, the Ccmmission, but the evidence is there, and it is there in the record, and it is referenced in the Commission's opinion."
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1162.905,1171.428,"One of the rules around in agencies, and I take it the FTC is an agency--"
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1171.428,1171.928,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1171.928,1175.88,--One of the administrative rules is that you explain what you do.
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1175.88,1176.263,That is correct.
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1176.263,1177.632,Adequately.
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1177.632,1178.498,And the Commission--
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1178.498,1181.283,Whether there is evidence in the record or not.
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1181.283,1194.043,"--The Commission did explain what it did, perhaps not as crystal clearly as it could have, but the explanation is there, and moreover the evidence is there to support the conclusions that the Commission reached."
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1245.892,1249.511,To whom do the ex-rays belong?
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1252.094,1258.533,--I believe under Indiana law they are accessible... Indiana law has been revised since then.
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1260.8,1273.024,If the... would the dentist have broken some ethical rule if the patient had directed him to send the ex-rays to the insurer and he had refused?
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1273.024,1278.244,Only one that was constructed by the Indiana Dental Association pursuant to this boycott.
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.85,1296.39,"Well, I know, but if a patient comes in and says, I want the ex-rays you took of me, will the dentist give it to him?"
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1296.39,1298.908,Under Indiana law they now are required to give them to the patients.
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.908,1299.425,Now.
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1299.425,1299.877,Yes.
1985.84-1809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1299.877,1300.577,Were they?
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1300.577,1303.479,I think at that time the law did not address it one way or the other.
1985.84-1809,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1308.098,1327.544,"Does not the dentist have a professional interest in maintaining the ex-rays, at least by copy, in case he is conceivably sued for malpractice later, and he needs the ex-rays to defend himself?"
1985.84-1809,0,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,1327.544,1356.946,"That is absolutely correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and the record shows that the insurance companies were sensitive to that, indeed, in some instances, in trying to negotiate a plan that would be more acceptable, had agreed to do a double pack ex-ray, where the pack would take two ex-rays at the same time, allowing the dentist to have one copy and sending the other copy in to the insurer, and the insurer was willing to pay for the extra cost of that type of ex-ray pack, which was not really very substantial in any case."
1985.84-1809,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1549.906,1554.309,Very well.
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,1555.725,1565.783,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, contrary to the theme of the Commission, this case should not be viewed as a crusade to lower dental costs."
1985.84-1809,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1666.649,1683.325,"Well, the Commission at least said that no elaborate analysis was necessary to define the market, that this group spanned the state, and it was the state that was the relevant market."
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,1687.846,1694.383,"Well, that's right, they spoke briefly to market power, and attributed the market power of Indiana Dental Association--"
1985.84-1809,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1694.383,1707.56,"They spoke briefly to the definition of the market, the geographical market, anyway, and certainly there wasn't much question about what the product market was, is there?"
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,1707.56,1708.876,"--Well, I am not certain."
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1729.656,1733.258,"Mr. Graham, can I ask a kind of preliminary question?"
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,1747.868,1751.589,"Well, I believe the Commission stated that they were applying Sherman Act principles."
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1751.589,1759.725,"I notice they cited some Section 1 cases, but the section of the legal discussion is all under the rubric of Section 5."
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,1762.241,1777.018,"Well, no, and I believe the Seventh Circuit proceeded under the same theory I am, that the Commission stated they were employing Sherman Act principles, anticompetitive... antitrust principles, and that is how the case was analyzed by the Commission."
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1777.018,1783.055,Do you think it is necessary to find a Section 1 violation in order for there to have been a Section 5 violation?
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,1783.055,1783.957,"Yes, I do."
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1912.29,1914.659,Do you think that is a necessary element of their case?
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,1914.659,1918.778,It is if they are trying to analogize this to a price case.
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1919.896,1924.431,In a price case would it be necessary to show that there was an impact on price?
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,1924.431,1927.199,--Especially--
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1927.199,1930.068,"If you prove an agreement to fix price, do you have to prove anything more?"
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,1930.068,1946.697,"--If you demonstrate... I think if you demonstrate price-fixing, you are at least... you are either probably in a per se rule or, if it exists, some kind of truncated rule of reason analysis, which apparently they are touting now."
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1946.697,1952.434,It is part of your submission that they must prove an impact on price in this case?
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,1952.434,1961.873,"If it is a price case, or as if they are saying that we can apply somewhat of a truncated rule of reason now."
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1967.693,1970.728,Did they prove an impact on price in Professional Engineers?
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,1970.728,1975.216,I think Professional Engineers was an absolute ban on competitive bidding.
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1978.834,1981.62,But did they prove an impact on price?
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,1981.62,1983.686,"--Well, I don't think they necessarily had to, because--"
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1983.686,1985.922,But you think they have to in this case?
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,1985.922,1987.44,--In a rule of reason case I think they--
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1987.44,1995.094,"Well, whatever you call this case, do you think it is an essential ingredient of the Commission's case that they prove an impact on price in this case?"
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,1995.094,1999.046,"--Well, or other anticompetitive effects."
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2001.681,2003.383,"Of course, they claim they did."
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2003.383,2004.9,I know they claim that.
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2004.9,2009.769,But what I am really trying to find out is whether you think they had to prove an impact on price.
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2009.769,2019.142,"No, I don't think it was... had anything to do with this case, because this case is not a price case."
1985.84-1809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2153.581,2161.604,Why shouldn't an insurance company at least have a backup diagnosis of its own if it is going to pay the bill?
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2161.604,2170.542,"--Well, I don't think that our clients have ever had any problem having an insurance company do that, if they do it properly."
1985.84-1809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2181.748,2189.421,"Well, now, your opposing counsel said that these dentists assisting the insurance companies didn't use just the ex-ray."
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2189.421,2191.539,"Well, I beg to differ."
1985.84-1809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2224.177,2238.152,"Why can't an insurance company say, all right, we don't have as much time as the dentist to spend on these individual cases, we have got to process them, we are going to make our backup judgment just on the basis of ex-rays?"
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2238.152,2249.31,"Because... that would be fine if they were just trying to decide what their limits were on a particular case, if it is a $50 case or a $100 case."
1985.84-1809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2266.337,2268.789,You can't say that is not cost containment.
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2268.789,2272.825,I don't think it contains costs.
1985.84-1809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2284.466,2290.137,He is probably not going to opt to have treatment done if the insurance company won't pay for it.
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2290.137,2291.253,That is true.
1985.84-1809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2305.046,2308.098,"Well, but how can you say the diagnosis is improper?"
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2308.098,2315.187,"Because the work rule, the evidence at trial was uncontradicted."
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2330.114,2333.865,"Yes, but that is a proper diagnosis for prescribing treatment, isn't it?"
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2344.623,2354.579,"No, but if you decided that there is a treatment that is adequate based on a very poor and medically unsound basis--"
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2354.579,2357.014,"Well, adequate for determining what they will pay for."
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2360.316,2369.422,"--They have a right to determine what they are going to pay for, but they don't have a right to indicate that there are other treatments."
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2369.422,2374.957,"Can't they say, the reason we won't pay for a gold filling is because we think a plastic filling is cheaper and that that is adequate?"
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2376.159,2377.959,"Not on the basis of an ex-ray, they can't."
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2386.698,2394.787,"Who should determine... do you think they must, there is some legal rule they have to say whatever the doctor... for whatever the dentist thinks is appropriate?"
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2394.787,2395.553,--No.
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2404.059,2412.415,"They thought the insurance company ought to send a dentist out and review the files on every patient, and the insurance company said, that would be much more expensive, and will run up the cost of insurance."
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2414.301,2418.836,"--If the insurance company is going to diagnose, I think they ought to do it properly."
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2418.836,2422.105,Even though it is a more expensive way and the cost of insurance would go up.
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2422.105,2425.39,"Well, that was never established."
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2425.39,2433.578,"Well, I think there were findings to the effect that the processing method of going to the office by individual dentists would be a good deal more expensive."
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2436.78,2440.099,There was evidence that it costs $10 a patient to do that.
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2452.659,2455.628,And that's why they didn't want to supply the ex-rays.
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2455.628,2458.313,They supplied everything but the ex-rays.
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2463.884,2471.788,"Would you tell me again, just so I have it, why did the... what was the purpose of this refusal to supply ex-rays, in a nutshell?"
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2473.755,2477.857,Because the insurance companies were making diagnoses.
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2477.857,2482.178,They didn't want the insurance companies to engage in unethical practice of dentistry.
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2482.178,2485.213,It was a second opinion based on an ex-ray.
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2485.213,2493.403,"Is that the basic reason, they thought it was... the insurance companies would be unlawfully engaged in the practice of dentistry if they cooperated?"
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2493.403,2501.69,"That's right, and that concern is evidenced additionally by the Indiana State Board of Dental Examiners since at least 1974--"
1985.84-1809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2501.69,2508.913,Didn't the dentists submit a narrative explanation of what work they were proposing would be done?
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2508.913,2510.229,--The dentist would--
1985.84-1809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2510.229,2514.649,And isn't that available to the insurance company to review?
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2514.649,2516.782,"--Yes, they did that openly."
1985.84-1809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2516.782,2519.868,So they aren't relying just on the ex-ray at all.
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2523.938,2539.115,"Yes, but the narrative is not... it goes much farther than that in making a diagnosis, and I believe the Indiana Federation of Dentists work rule delineates what all the experts indicated was true."
1985.84-1809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2553.107,2559.011,"But from what you have said, there was more supplied to the insurance company than just the ex-ray."
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2574.771,2581.175,And the evidence was that that was not sufficient to effect another diagnosis.
1985.84-1809,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2581.175,2586.495,"Well, what else would they get by going to the dentist's office?"
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2586.495,2587.762,There is--
1985.84-1809,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2587.762,2591.483,Which was acceptable to the Indiana group?
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2591.483,2594.049,"--Well, they could have all the diagnostic aids."
1985.84-1809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2618.216,2624.637,"Well, you don't propose that the insurance company has to physically examine the patient, surely."
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2624.637,2636.594,"--No, all I propose is that they not diagnose unless they know what they are doing, and that is what the Federation of Dentists have contended."
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2636.594,2641.063,"May I follow up with just one question on that, Mr. Graham?"
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2659.091,2660.093,"Well, I believe so."
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2660.093,2665.531,"But weren't they willing to do that, supply everything else they wanted except the ex-rays?"
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2665.531,2669.916,"In the office, along with an oral examination."
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2669.916,2673.435,Was it the dentists who insisted on having an insurance company person come to the office?
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2678.271,2680.04,"They did that, yes."
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2680.04,2686.694,Why didn't that raise exactly the same ethical problem as sending in the ex-rays without more material?
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2686.694,2689.312,Because it was a narrative on a claim form.
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2694.614,2703.537,"In both instances the insurance company was trying to decide whether to pay the claim, wasn't it, whether it had the ex-ray or not?"
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2703.537,2707.191,"No, they were trying to decide what treatment was--"
1985.84-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2707.191,2708.674,What treatment they would pay for.
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2708.674,2714.178,"--The cheapest treatment that they decided was adequate, is what they were doing."
1985.84-1809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2732.239,2736.21,Has this sort of a boycott by dentists spread to other states?
1985.84-1809,1,17642,bruce_w_graham,,2738.877,2746.566,"There was similar concerns in the state of Texas and, I believe, Pennsylvania."
1985.84-1809,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3025.38,3026.53,Very well.
1985.84-1809,2,36796,marcy_jk_tiffany,,3027.832,3031.118,"Unless there are further questions from the bench, Mr. Chief Justice, I do not."
1985.84-1809,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3031.118,3031.551,"Thank you, counsel."
