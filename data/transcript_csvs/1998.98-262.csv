1998.98-262,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.728,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 98-262, Bill Martin v. Everett Hadix."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,10.117,13.831,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,57.569,64.212,"Mr. Casey, some of the fees in this case are not... reasonable fees to prevailing party."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,77.211,78.733,That's correct.
1998.98-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,78.733,91.891,"The attorneys' efforts undertaken in... do the courts have the power to do that, to sort of hire, you know, a private marshals force to... to see that their injunctions are being complied with?"
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,97.166,100.118,My understanding is that it is a common practice.
1998.98-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.878,118.237,"Oh, I now it monitors compliance, but--"
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,121.64,123.783,--The State pays for it.
1998.98-262,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,123.783,124.993,--Why is that?
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,124.993,145.615,The court has in one case determined after trial and in another case by consent decree that there has been constitutional violations sufficient to require the defendant to make... to rectify the constitutional violations.
1998.98-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,146.797,148.087,"Well, that's fine."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,170.023,170.323,--Your Honor--
1998.98-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.323,175.608,--that you can hire attorneys to... to oversee the... the prisons for... for the court.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,175.608,184.094,"--The States have objected loudly and long against that practice, and now in the PLRA, Congress has directed its attention to it."
1998.98-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,184.704,197.461,"Well, that... that feature colors my whole view of this case, and I'm... I'm worried that... that how I come out in this case is... is going to be dependent on a... on a practice that I'm not sure is even... is even authorized."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,200.713,202.415,"--Not in this case, no."
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.415,204.918,Would you give us a little more background?
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,211.562,212.141,That's correct.
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.141,219.266,In both cases is there still an ongoing monitoring or has one of them been concluded at last?
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,219.266,221.798,"We filed a supplemental brief a few weeks ago, Your Honor."
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,247.383,253.968,"Well, now on... on that one, do we have an issue remaining as to attorney's fees for monitoring in the Glover case--"
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,253.968,255.12,Yes.
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.12,258.962,--post PLRA and until the termination of the suit?
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,258.962,259.723,Yes.
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.466,271.23,And... and the Hadix suit is one where there is still an ongoing monitoring?
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,271.23,272.04,Yes.
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,272.04,275.492,And there's been no petition to end that one?
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,275.492,277.773,There have been.
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,290.864,293.505,"Now, one other housekeeping sort of question."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,303.27,313.327,The mechanism for attorney's fees in these cases was that each 6 months the plaintiffs' attorneys would submit a request for attorney's fees.
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,319.912,321.191,"Well, I asked a pretty simple question."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,326.845,327.446,--That's correct.
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,327.446,331.479,Has the State paid the attorney's fees up to that date?
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,331.479,336.473,There is a period of 4 months where we are challenging.
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,363.663,367.225,"So, the answer is that the State has not paid everything."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,367.225,368.177,--That's correct.
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,370.538,371.289,Up to the effective date.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,371.289,371.539,Correct.
1998.98-262,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,371.539,377.564,Would you tell how long each of these two cases has been going on?
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,377.564,382.539,One was filed in 1977 and the other in 1980.
1998.98-262,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,382.539,385.231,"So, they were cash cows, in effect, weren't they?"
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,385.231,390.442,"They were, indeed, Your Honor, and the Sixth Circuit stated that in one of its opinions, which we've quoted in the brief."
1998.98-262,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,392.904,398.717,"Well, the record before us of the extent of the violations of the injunction... we don't know that."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,419.302,421.873,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.98-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,430.791,432.961,May I ask just one other question?
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,444.899,451.803,"For an award which has not been liquidated and finalized, we believe that the PLRA would apply."
1998.98-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,451.803,452.754,I see.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,452.754,456.717,We... we are not seeking to reopen old--
1998.98-262,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,456.717,457.529,"I understand that, but I just--"
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,465.554,466.055,--Yes.
1998.98-262,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,466.055,473.868,"Somebody who knew nothing about it would say, I guess they mean that the cap applies to people for future work, and it doesn't apply for past work."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,486.039,486.92,"Oh, yes."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,486.92,487.571,--lest it be thought the--
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,487.571,488.82,Some of it is--
1998.98-262,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,488.82,495.085,"--I mean, I assume you're not going to object to that part of it, but the... the common sense... what I think is the common sense of it."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,495.836,508.494,"--Well, as... as this Court has told us in Landgraf, you first look to see if Congress has made a clear statement about its intention, and to do that, you first look at the text of the statute and the legislative history."
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,508.494,513.086,"--Well, the statute here doesn't say anything about what is supposed to happen."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,523.594,530.59,We believe that the text of the statute does clearly show Congress' intent that it apply to pending cases.
1998.98-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,552.495,554.826,"Of course, the word brought was not in that statute."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,554.826,556.237,That's correct.
1998.98-262,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,601.116,617.197,"And yet, there is another section that does state it is to be retrospectively applicable, and this section that we're dealing with conspicuously does not contain any such explicit instruction."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,617.197,626.393,"Section 802 of the PLRA was an amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C. 3626."
1998.98-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,683.499,689.232,"Well, I don't understand the principle you're espousing, that all procedural things... I don't understand."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,701.511,705.144,--That is one of the factors the Court identified in Landgraf.
1998.98-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,705.144,725.687,"I thought that... that the distinctive feature of 802(b)(1) is the fact that it says it shall apply with respect to all prospective relief whether such relief was originally granted or approved before, on, or after the date of enactment of this title."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,736.333,740.867,Section 802 is... is not at issue here.
1998.98-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.578,744.03,"No, but that's the section we're comparing it with."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,747.322,747.773,--Yes.
1998.98-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,747.773,754.318,And it seems to me the explicit statement was necessary in 802 to make it clear that 802 was retroactive.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,754.318,754.909,That's correct.
1998.98-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,754.909,759.583,"That is, it applied to matters before the date of enactment of this title."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,759.583,760.513,That's correct.
1998.98-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,760.513,764.196,You don't assert that 803 applies to matters before the date of this title.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,770.579,774.192,We say it applies to all awards made after the effect of the statute.
1998.98-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,774.192,774.761,Right.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,778.714,780.006,"That is our contention, yes, Your Honor."
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,780.006,806.974,"Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that I don't think the... the text really answers the question so that we have to go to step two in... in the retroactivity analysis and ask sort of the Justice Story questions which in this case I guess would be the question whether the act imposes a disability with respect to completed acts as of the date of its enactment."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,855.835,858.396,Yes.
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,858.396,859.768,Or... that's... that's your position.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,859.768,860.377,Yes.
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,860.377,876.929,Why shouldn't... why shouldn't the... the analysis be that we're talking about the real world here and the... the fee arrangement was the fee arrangement which the... which the lawyers and the court had at the time they began their work?
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,925.83,933.396,Our position is that the plaintiffs and their attorneys do not have a reasonable expectation in a particular rate.
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,933.396,934.365,"Well, why don't they?"
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,934.365,934.876,The most that they--
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,934.876,938.608,"I mean, why... that's... I know that's your position, but why... why don't they?"
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,947.855,949.496,"--Well, I disagree with that, Your Honor."
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,954.788,963.026,Have... have any of those changes been retrospective in the sense of applying to work previously done before the change was announced?
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,963.026,971.231,"Every 6 months plaintiffs submit a bill for their expenses, and at that time they say what they want their fee to be."
1998.98-262,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,971.231,975.893,"So, in effect, every... every award of fees is for work previously done."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,975.893,976.884,Correct.
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,976.884,989.984,"Yes, but did... did they argue about the amount of the work they've done and whether they have earned the fee, or did they argue about the... the terms upon which they will be compensated for work done once the amount of work is determined?"
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,996.236,1002.8,They submitted a... a bill for fees for January 1 through June of '96.
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1012.647,1013.577,Has that happened--
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1020.351,1020.662,Yes.
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1020.662,1021.723,--in hourly rate?
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1025.637,1026.308,That is... that is--
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1026.308,1026.888,But that hasn't--
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1062.632,1064.052,--I don't believe there have been any instances like that.
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1064.052,1064.863,"Well, then why--"
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1064.863,1065.273,But there--
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1065.273,1077.141,"--isn't the actual expectation that... that we should bear in mind when we're doing a retroactivity analysis, the expectation that, in fact, there... there was at least a floor?"
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1086.577,1089.95,--Our position is that that floor is subject to change.
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1089.95,1092.131,"Well, I know that's your position, but why?"
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1102.897,1103.468,Of course.
1998.98-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1104.517,1114.645,"By... and every time it increases the fees beyond the fees that it gave the last time around, I suppose it is disappointing the expectations of the defendants, isn't it?"
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1114.645,1115.186,--That's correct.
1998.98-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1115.186,1116.486,And that's perfectly okay.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1116.486,1117.237,Yes.
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1117.237,1118.359,"Well, maybe on your analysis--"
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1127.223,1128.044,That's... that's correct.
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1128.044,1130.125,Have you ever objected to an increase in the fees?
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1130.125,1130.536,Yes.
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1130.536,1131.164,Yes.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1134.026,1134.877,That's correct.
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1134.877,1141.172,"And by a parity of reasoning, I suppose it would not be proper to... to decrease retroactively."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1141.172,1143.893,"If, for example, the economy went into a depression--"
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1143.893,1145.885,"Well, isn't that... is my logic correct?"
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1145.885,1160.046,"--If there was a... if there was a decrease in the prevailing market rate of attorney fees, then the plaintiffs in one of their 6-month cycles would be entitled to a lesser amount than they received the preceding cycle."
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1160.046,1160.995,"Well, why?"
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1160.995,1169.311,"Because under their view, the prevailing market rate would have... instead of being 150 dollars an hour, say it was 100 dollars an hour."
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1169.311,1177.687,"Well, so you're... you're saying that the only arrangement... that the only expectation ever expressed was whatever the market rate is you'll get."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1177.687,1180.138,Under... under 1988--
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1180.138,1180.749,"If it goes up, you get it."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1181.197,1181.978,--That's correct.
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1181.978,1182.368,--yours goes down.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1182.368,1183.069,That's correct.
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1183.069,1186.443,"Now, what about... and I'm not sure that this really is to the point, but I want to explore it."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1219.512,1223.285,"For a particular fee cycle, yes."
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1223.285,1223.766,Okay.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1225.078,1228.558,"I don't believe for the future, no."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1230.721,1231.711,Which was past.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1231.711,1232.632,Which was past.
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1232.632,1234.482,So that it was never forward looking.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1234.482,1235.614,It's my understanding.
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1243.639,1248.362,"Now, let me go back to my question and I won't... I won't occupy your whole argument."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1269.698,1270.699,On the date of the award.
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1270.699,1271.5,--not any specific amount.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1271.5,1272.589,Yes.
1998.98-262,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1272.589,1272.89,Okay.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1285.749,1293.703,I don't think it was articulated in those terms in front of the district court.
1998.98-262,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1304.77,1313.586,"Are... are you saying that in light of the statute, amounts previously awarded are now known to be unreasonable?"
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1313.586,1315.799,We are not--
1998.98-262,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1315.799,1322.873,"Or put it another way, would it be unreasonable to award more than the statutory amount?"
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1334.291,1334.87,--Yes.
1998.98-262,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1337.602,1339.314,--But isn't there a range of reasonableness?
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1339.314,1350.982,"--Of course, and what we are saying is that all the plaintiffs are entitled to is a reasonable fee on the date of the award, and that reasonable fee changes."
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1350.982,1354.856,I would have thought... I would have thought that you'd look at when the work was performed.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1371.836,1373.155,We do take that position.
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1373.155,1378.498,"I thought you said it turned on the date of the award, regardless of when the work was performed."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1378.498,1380.12,The court has specified--
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1380.12,1381.352,That's what I heard you to say.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1382.782,1393.14,--The court has specified two issues: one for work performed before the date of the PLRA and one for work performed after the date of the PLRA.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1393.14,1393.501,Well--
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1393.501,1396.773,We say that the date of the award is the operative date.
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1396.773,1408.131,"--Yes, but what I'm saying to you is I would think a line could be drawn saying it depends on when the work was performed, and if it was performed after the effective date, the statute applies."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1411.113,1417.667,The statute applies to all awards after the effective date of the statute regardless of when the work was performed.
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1419.387,1420.619,"That's your view, yes."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1420.619,1421.25,That's correct.
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1421.25,1424.362,And I think one could make an argument for a different approach.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1424.362,1431.505,I think a stronger argument can be made for work performed after the date of the statute.
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1431.505,1432.887,Let me ask you one more thing.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1445.645,1447.887,"They would need the court's permission, but yes, they could seek it."
1998.98-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1447.887,1448.518,"Yes, but that's possible to do."
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1448.518,1453.814,"Yes, yes."
1998.98-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1453.814,1456.095,Excuse me.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1468.333,1478.089,"They were the plaintiff class counsel from the beginning of the lawsuit, and I don't believe they could unilaterally just withdraw at this point."
1998.98-262,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1482.732,1484.852,They would... do they have court appointments?
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1486.264,1486.535,--No.
1998.98-262,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1486.535,1487.714,--They did not have court appointments.
1998.98-262,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1487.714,1488.235,No.
1998.98-262,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1505.897,1508.869,"Very well, Mr. Casey."
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1512.441,1517.794,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-262,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1534.154,1538.899,The date of the enactment or the effective date of the act?
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1538.899,1541.109,"--Up through April 26th, 1996."
1998.98-262,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1541.109,1545.373,"The fees have been paid, contrary to what counsel has just told us."
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1545.373,1545.684,Yes.
1998.98-262,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1553.427,1563.074,"So, in your view, the only thing at issue is fees earned, if you will, after the effective date of PLRA?"
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1563.074,1569.809,"--Absent this Court ruling that defendants, which they sought to come back and get those fees back, yes."
1998.98-262,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1576.935,1580.618,Did they pay them because the district court required them to?
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1583.54,1584.549,They did contest them.
1998.98-262,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1588.884,1594.016,"Yes, but it was not a voluntary payment and then they sought to get it back."
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1594.016,1594.766,That's correct.
1998.98-262,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1594.766,1596.957,They didn't pay until ordered to do so by the court.
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1596.957,1598.159,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.98-262,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1600.29,1601.341,Excuse me.
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1616.061,1619.704,--It is true that they have paid all those monies.
1998.98-262,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.704,1620.185,Wait a minute.
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1623.337,1623.727,Correct.
1998.98-262,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1623.727,1628.64,"They have paid them, but are they still able to contest them procedurally?"
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1628.64,1630.399,I don't know the answer to that question.
1998.98-262,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1630.399,1632.7,Didn't they challenge that in the Sixth Circuit?
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1632.7,1636.654,"They challenged it in the Sixth Circuit, but the Sixth Circuit ruled that they had to pay it."
1998.98-262,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1649.814,1653.604,Why did the subsequent opinion address it if it had been paid under the earlier opinion?
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1653.604,1670.638,"Because the original opinion dealt with a time period way before the passage of the act from June 1995 through December 1995, which the court, because they contested some other matters, didn't hold a hearing and get around to awarding until after the passage of the act."
1998.98-262,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1707.21,1711.563,"Ms. LaBelle, let me get at least myself straight."
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1730.355,1732.388,I think that it's not before the Court--
1998.98-262,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1732.388,1733.006,And why is that?
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1733.006,1746.817,"--Mr. Chief Justice, because they paid all of those fees, did not contest them, did not... did not contest them at the time of paying it, did not say we retain the right, and in fact, did not seek in their petition for review before this Court to review that matter."
1998.98-262,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1746.817,1750.22,So... go ahead.
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1751.749,1752.63,Yes.
1998.98-262,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1752.63,1759.486,Why did they not seek to pursue that matter if it's included in the questions presented?
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1761.376,1767.751,"It's not in their cert petition, Your Honor, and this Court then issued them the two questions splitting the matter."
1998.98-262,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1767.751,1768.68,It's our fault.
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1788.034,1798.589,"And, Your Honor, I think that there's a good reason actually to include both in this Court's inquiry because I do not think that the statute, by the language of the statute itself, allows for the distinction."
1998.98-262,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1800.77,1805.395,"Let me just be sure I get... you do tell me this in the record, the fact that they were paid before."
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1805.395,1809.686,"I do not know if it's in the record, Your Honor, in the joint appendix."
1998.98-262,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1821.624,1822.205,I see.
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1826.609,1827.27,"Yes, it's certainly--"
1998.98-262,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1827.27,1828.159,--into the portion you sent to us?
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1828.159,1828.87,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1998.98-262,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1857.127,1864.614,"So, your... your position then is... is you reject all of the previous positions that have either been suggested from the bench or by... by your opponent."
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1868.946,1873.099,"--I think that's correct, Your Honor, to an action brought after the passage of the act."
1998.98-262,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1893.972,1895.452,"Well, we didn't say that in Landgraf."
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1911.955,1913.203,"--I think that's true, Your Honor."
1998.98-262,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1930.166,1933.078,But this is procedural a fortiori.
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,1961.926,1974.705,"But I think, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, what we're talking about here is that the way these cases were filed were based upon a reliance on the act that existed at that time and which this statute amends."
1998.98-262,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1997.329,1998.01,"Well, only if you win."
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2011.428,2018.224,"That's correct, Your Honor, but that is exactly the balancing act that goes on when a case is filed."
1998.98-262,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2021.646,2030.322,But it's a good deal less certain than the kind of reliances that... that we typically say cannot be upset by future legislation.
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2053.947,2056.609,"--Well, I want to distinguish two things."
1998.98-262,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2075.101,2077.632,The court can bind Congress that way for the future?
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2086.378,2094.493,"That the Congress, Your Honor, can say that... that that... that fees worked... Congress can say that, Your Honor, but I don't think they said it in this act."
1998.98-262,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2125.293,2137.572,"The reason they did it in 802, as I suggested earlier, was... was that 802... they had to say it because they... they said whether the relief was originally granted before the date of enactment."
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2141.343,2143.504,--Well--
1998.98-262,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2143.504,2146.518,And he just says all orders entered after the date of enactment.
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2162.107,2167.119,--Or what will be covered is three things because I don't think you can separate the act.
1998.98-262,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2199.453,2200.501,But you're saying they cannot do that.
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2215.722,2217.923,--That's correct.
1998.98-262,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2218.784,2219.335,The statute... yes.
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2236.235,2254.507,"The... I think that if you go by the language of the statute, it doesn't allow parsing the statute in that manner because it speaks in terms of any action brought by a prisoner who is incarcerated, the court... fees shall not be awarded except to the extent that."
1998.98-262,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2262.602,2269.207,But it's a very simple line to draw and certainly could be I think on the face of the statute.
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2272.87,2277.392,"--I think that it is a simple line to draw, Your Honor, but I don't think Congress drew that line."
1998.98-262,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2278.864,2281.885,"It was the line the district court drew, though, wasn't it?"
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2281.885,2297.266,"--The district court drew that line, Your Honor, finding that not that the statute's wording provided that, but that there would be a retroactive... an impermissible retroactive effect if you got past the congressional intent--"
1998.98-262,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2297.266,2303.49,"Well, how... how is it retroactive if you say it applies to work performed after the effective date?"
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2305.451,2315.817,"--I think because what we're looking at is what is the conduct and what is the triggering event here, what is the event you look at for purposes of determining whether it has that kind of effect."
1998.98-262,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2315.817,2322.482,"Well, how could... how could attorney's fees at an hourly rate be applied on any basis other than work performed?"
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2322.482,2332.109,"Because the attorney fees... first, the attorney fees are only provided if you prevail in a litigation that you've filed under the prior act."
1998.98-262,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2333.749,2349.019,"Yes, but we're over the point of getting paid for the litigation, and we're talking I think only about these endless monitoring arrangements, these open-ended, ongoing monitoring arrangements."
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2350.501,2361.928,"--In this case you're talking about the monitoring arrangements, but certainly if it's allowed to apply, it will apply to cases in which have not yet prevailed and which work has performed."
1998.98-262,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2381.51,2387.724,"If you have a trial court that said, you know, counsel, we've been working with this case for 2 or 3 years."
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2402.023,2416.793,"Because I think that it does unsettle expectations and disrupt and injure the client in a way that it should not, in the sense that what the attorney may do in that case, who has committed to the client to represent them, is withdraw."
1998.98-262,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2417.534,2422.456,"Well, except the attorney never had the expectation that he would get anything more than a reasonable fee."
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2422.456,2426.48,--But this does not provide for a reasonable fee now.
1998.98-262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2431.222,2431.703,Well--

1998.98-262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2459.235,2463.705,"--Yes, yes, but I mean, your point... the issue, I would have thought, was not retroactivity."
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2472.073,2473.503,--I think--
1998.98-262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2473.503,2479.818,"And normally you'd think it does apply to future work in pending cases, but... but you produce some reasons why not, and that's what I want to hear."
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2479.818,2480.859,--I think it's true.
1998.98-262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2489.923,2501.703,I don't think you'd be making this as a set deal... years ago we decided initially what all the future rates would be... if tomorrow they come along and they double the... the base rate for the... for the defendant.
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2512.168,2536.626,"Well, I think that in some sense this is a flip side of Landgraf in which the Court said there that although it was just potential, that you could not tell... you could not grant or extend a potential benefit to... to the plaintiff, a right of compensation, that had the potential of extending the liability of the defendant after the case had been filed."
1998.98-262,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2544.5,2549.041,But you're... you're not just... you're talking again about secondary or tertiary conduct.
1998.98-262,1,21112,deborah_labelle,,2559.559,2566.755,"--Well, I think you're talking about, Mr. Chief Justice, more than compensation of the attorneys, both... for two reasons."
1998.98-262,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3287.504,3296.493,"My understanding is that every 6 months, they submit a bill and they ask to be paid at a certain rate for that work which was performed in the past."
1998.98-262,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3296.493,3300.314,"And the order does not say, moreover, this rate will continue for the next 6 months."
1998.98-262,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3300.314,3300.985,Correct.
1998.98-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3303.676,3321.908,"Is there any indication here that Congress focused specifically on what I'd call prison litigation, long, ongoing cases, 20-year cases, 15-year cases, as compared to just an ordinary case where a prisoner says I'm being held under bad conditions, one person, one time, et cetera?"
1998.98-262,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3321.908,3322.94,Yes.
1998.98-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3336.938,3344.452,Do you have any empirical data on... on how many old cases there are hanging around forever as compared to the number of new that are brought from year to year?
1998.98-262,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3344.452,3346.425,--I don't know.
1998.98-262,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3346.425,3347.374,No is the answer.

1998.98-262,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3363.215,3374.231,Is it correct that the theory on which the cases go on so long is that the plaintiffs contend... maybe their wrong... that the violations of the Constitution have not been terminated?
1998.98-262,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3374.231,3375.783,--That's correct.
1998.98-262,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3375.783,3380.486,And the district court must find that to be true in order not to terminate the litigation.
1998.98-262,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3380.486,3381.548,That's correct.

1998.98-262,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3435.503,3436.673,Correct.

1998.98-262,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3469.414,3473.488,The orders of the court are included in the joint appendix.
1998.98-262,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3479.061,3481.664,--But they're all in the same--
