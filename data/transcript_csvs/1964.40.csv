1964.40,0,36332,maury_maverick_jr,,14.851,18.711,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,514.126,516.322,"Mr. Stanford was there during the time, (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.40,0,36332,maury_maverick_jr,,516.322,518.4,He -- his wife was there at beginning.
1964.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,531.502,532.955,And this lasted for five hours?
1964.40,0,36332,maury_maverick_jr,,532.955,534.208,"Five hours, yes sir."
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,2733.629,2738.896,If it please the Court.
1964.40,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2776.733,2781.507,But the Nelson case was a state prosecution?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,2781.507,2782.498,Under?
1964.40,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2782.498,2782.535,(Inaudible)
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,2782.535,2782.623,For --
1964.40,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2782.623,2785.967,Or by -- for sedition against the federal government?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,2785.967,2786.608,Yes sir.
1964.40,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2786.648,2787.398,Isn't that right?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,2787.398,2797.438,"That was made clear in Uphaus when they said, the opinion made clear -- this is Uphaus, that a state could proceed with prosecutions for sedition against the state itself."
1964.40,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2853.708,2867.095,"Except you do have here some federal statute that purport to cover sedition against the nation, sedition against the state, and sedition against the units of state government."
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,2867.095,2876.527,"Yes sir, but this statute, both of these Texas statutes attempt to cover both the United States and Texas and its subdivisions."

1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,2899.566,2900.021,"No, sir."
1964.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2926.514,2933.866,"And since there you get in -- there you get into an area that wasn't covered by Uphaus against Wyman at all, that is the First Amendment area."
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,2933.866,2940.006,"Yes, but he has challenged the statute -- the search on the general invalidity of the whole scheme."
1964.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2940.006,2942.608,I understand it now you're addressing yourself to preemption.
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,2942.608,2942.934,Yes sir.
1964.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2942.934,2944.681,But there are other issues in this case.
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,2944.681,2945.036,"Yes, sir."

1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3057.985,3058.287,Yes sir.
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3058.287,3058.816,-- the search warrant was issued?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3058.959,3060.382,"Yes sir, it was."
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3060.501,3061.51,Is that in the record --
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3061.51,3061.589,As to the --
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3061.589,3062.335,-- as to the facts?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3064.125,3065.551,This is a magistrate's hearing.
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3068.168,3068.604,"Well, that's --"
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3068.604,3069.911,"Now, I'll --"
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3069.911,3070.371,What is it (Voice Overlap) --
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3070.371,3070.467,I'll tell you this sir.
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3070.467,3071.728,Where could we find --
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3071.728,3072.48,This was --
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3072.48,3078.798,Where can we find in the record where that was known to the magistrate before you issued the warrant?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3078.798,3086.084,"The only thing in the record is the affidavit at 70, the application at 71, and the warrant at 72."
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3086.084,3090.503,"Alright now, any of those things that you've just been reading is in those documents?"

1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3209.387,3209.87,No sir.
1964.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3228.475,3249.736,"Well, outside of this man's personal property and records such as his Blue Shield and Blue Cross, and his marriage certificate and his driver's license and the title to his home and so on, outside of that, all that was seized there -- and you tell me if I'm wrong, were commercially published literature (Inaudible) -- published commercially and --"
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3249.736,3249.961,No.

1964.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3251.637,3254.62,Am I correct or am I wrong?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3254.62,3265.783,His personal items were seized with the file cabinet which contained records which began with a record of the Gus-Hall Benjamin Davis Defense Committee.
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3325.988,3328.46,What significance do the cards have --
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3328.46,3328.6,It was just --
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3328.6,3329.57,-- the names of people?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3329.57,3332.53,Just index cards with names of people.
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3341.594,3342.531,They're just names of people.
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3342.531,3347.648,"Yes sir, just names of people around the United States that don't have any particular significance."

1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3389.873,3395.669,-- that were possessed or unlawfully used in violation of the Act?

1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3396.602,3405.01,"Now, how was they -- could you tell me with reference to which Section of the Act the officers were --"

1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3405.818,3408.287,-- operating under Section 9.
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3408.287,3414.395,"Well, I know what Section 9 but all that -- that refers again to a violation of the Act."
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3449.62,3451.686,I do not know sir.
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3451.686,3454.898,"Well, how could he live up to the search warrant --"
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3454.898,3455.265,I do --
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3455.265,3459.654,-- without knowing what violation he is talking about?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3459.654,3460.187,The Assistant (Voice Overlap) --
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3460.187,3467.628,I'm not saying it has to be in the search warrant (Inaudible) but I -- I would think that before you could seize a book by C. Wright Mills --
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3467.628,3487.544,"He stated in the -- he stated in his testimony that his information was that when they had an official meeting of the Communist Party, that this man would bring certain books and items from that he would tell them what they -- that he used this as material and demonstrate to them the Communist Party line."
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3517.096,3521.892,He was just looking -- were there any saying that the Communist Party have used in this operation?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3521.892,3531.627,He was looking for a material which was similar to the fact material that he said that he had been shown by informants as being used in these session (Voice Overlap) --
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3531.627,3533.056,Why was that seizable?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3536.264,3542.861,There's a Texas statute sir that makes it seizable under Section 9 if that statute is valid.
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3542.861,3543.126,"Well, I know."
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3573.129,3575.881,But it specifically points out books and materials (Voice Overlap) --
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3575.881,3577.205,Used in violation of the Act.
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3577.205,3578.764,-- used in violation of the Act.
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3578.764,3583.22,"Alright, what's the violation of the Act in materials that are passed out of the Communist Party brief?"
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3583.22,3591.081,"Well, any -- well, the Act prohibits the -- the Act prohibits everything from membership on (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3591.081,3593.159,It prohibits the actual existence in operation.
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3593.159,3601.919,"It actually prohibits the existence and operation of the party data print -- it prohibits membership, advocacy, assistance of it, and on and on."
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3601.919,3602.46,"So, if they handed out --"
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3602.46,3603.562,It prohibits --
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3603.562,3622.722,"If they handed out -- your position is that if a Communist Party meeting in connection with its proceedings, they handed out copies of the New York Times or the Washington Post or the Washington Star for its members to read and call the attention to certain items in it, those papers are seizeable as part of the operations of the Party, that's your position."
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3622.722,3630.406,I realized that sounds like a ridiculous conclusion but the --
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3630.406,3633.396,"Well, the search warrant just says concerning the Communist Party."
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3637.11,3639.737,Yes.
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3640.966,3645.645,"Then, do you had any -- that the officers had just that kind of authority to seize, didn't they under the (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3645.645,3645.901,Yes sir.

1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3646.814,3649.599,"Yes sir, they did."
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3649.599,3655.517,On what theory did you seize -- Mr. Justice Black's dissenting opinion?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3655.517,3656.859,"Well, I wasn't in charge of the seizure --"
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3656.859,3657.413,"No, I did not --"
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3657.413,3657.685,"-- Your Honor, and I don't --"
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3657.685,3659.393,I didn't asked you (Voice Overlap) --
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3659.393,3663.039,"I didn't even know Mr. Justice Black's dissenting opinion was in there, in fact --"
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3663.039,3663.168,I know --
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3663.168,3663.542,-- I don't even know --

1964.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3667.959,3669.579,"And you still have it, I understand."
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3669.579,3670.113,"Yes sir, I have --"
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3670.113,3670.711,What -- under what theory?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3670.711,3671.626,-- all of the items that was --
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3671.626,3674.558,Under what theory do you support that?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3674.558,3677.865,"I don't have any theory from which I can support that Your Honor, as you can (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3677.865,3678.501,Alright.
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3688.219,3689.915,Certainly not.
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3689.915,3698.267,Are there any of it that would be illegal to -- for an individual to possess?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3698.267,3699.469,I don't think so sir.
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3708.197,3710.243,"Alright, would a man -- would he make --"
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3710.243,3718.46,"But I assume if their books printed in any area of the world are distributed in the United States, they're not illegal to own under ordinary circumstances."
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3718.46,3728.294,"Would you say you're not familiar with this material, how about the men who executed this part?"
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3730.593,3738.588,They testified that they had been shown the material that was used in the Communist Party who made this -- their informants.
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3742.571,3744.234,What items?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3744.234,3746.045,Samples of this type of literature --

1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3747.339,3749.088,What items have they seen?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3749.088,3751.559,"I do not know sir, the record does not reflect."
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3751.559,3754.053,How do you know then that it's the same type?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3754.053,3755.238,I do not know sir.
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3755.238,3755.271,Did they read all --
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3755.271,3757.92,"The man who had seen it made the seizure, sir."
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3757.92,3760.265,Did they read all these books?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3760.265,3762.397,"Sir, I assumed that they didn't read all the books."
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3763.399,3764.816,But how would they know then?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3767.148,3773.165,"I assume they took it by the titles and by whoever wrote the items, I assume."
1964.40,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3773.165,3780.419,Were there any dissenting opinions that were not seized.
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3780.419,3781.378,I don't know sir.
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3827.727,3833.518,"Well, you don't -- I gather that in the court below, the big argument was raised --"
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3833.518,3833.677,No sir.
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3833.677,3835.686,-- nor was the validity of the underlying statute.
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3835.686,3838.034,"Yes sir, the validity of the statute was raised."
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3838.86,3841.652,What's raised up here (Inaudible) was it?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3841.652,3842.278,Sir?
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3842.278,3846.433,I mean the validity of Section 9 was raised but not the validity of the --
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3846.433,3854.437,They raised by conditional supplement -- they filed a supplementary brief yesterday or the day before and challenged the validity of our Act.
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3854.437,3854.991,Here?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3854.991,3855.576,Yes sir.
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3855.576,3858.132,Should not under -- the type of matters (Inaudible)?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3858.132,3866.787,"No sir but I think if you will look at the application they made for the return of the documents, they challenged the validity of the entire Act should be (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3866.787,3868.924,The -- that they -- and would that (Inaudible) by the Texas Supreme Court?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3868.924,3870.175,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1964.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3881.204,3884.16,And the Texas Supreme Court just said --
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3884.16,3887.062,This case has never been in the Texas Supreme Court.
1964.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3890.695,3895.048,You mean the only judicial determination was by a single judge --
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3895.048,3895.432,Yes sir.
1964.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3895.432,3895.532,-- in Barrett County?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3895.532,3897.366,By a single judge in Barrett County.
1964.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3897.366,3897.566,Yes.
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3897.566,3902.303,And from that -- under the Texas law that judgment is final.
1964.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3902.303,3902.341,Yes.
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3902.341,3904.5,It cannot be appealed.
1964.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3904.5,3909.184,Do you think the validity of both the state statutes are properly an issue here?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3909.184,3924.861,Well I think certainly the validity of the second state statute and no doubt the validity of Section 9 and probably the validity of the first because they constitute one scheme of legislation covering one particular phase that they both have to be read together.
1964.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3941.554,3944.202,Both the statutes are referred to in the affidavit?
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3944.202,3944.642,Yes sir.
1964.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3944.931,3945.436,"Oh, I see."
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3945.436,3952.106,-- referred to in the affidavit as the grounds from the search warrant and both were considered by the court who made the determination.
1964.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3952.417,3953.449,So you say they made it both here.
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3953.783,3953.788,Yes sir.
1964.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3953.788,3954.426,-- of both of them --
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3954.426,3955.104,"Yes sir, I think --"
1964.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3955.104,3955.228,-- is properly --
1964.40,1,29080,james_e_barlow,,3955.228,3962.423,-- that both of -- I think both of them are properly before you for consideration.
1964.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3968.603,3970.948,Mr. Phillips.
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,3970.948,3974.768,May it Please the Court.
1964.40,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4077.532,4082.957,"Well, what you're saying in effect is that what was seized here was evidence to be used at a criminal trial, is it?"
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4082.957,4085.289,"No sir, I'm saying that it can be --"
1964.40,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4085.289,4085.627,The law has been clear.
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4085.627,4094.47,-- an instrumentality of the crime itself if it's used in that manner because part of Communism is not all action.
1964.40,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4112.627,4122.725,"Generally, when we talk about instrumentality as we talk about dynamite and firearms and narcotics, contraband."
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4122.725,4123.416,That is correct.
1964.40,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4126.698,4127.274,Yes.
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4127.274,4131.6,There are other things that depend on the manner in which they are used.
1964.40,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4144.446,4157.247,"On the records of an illegal business or something else again that the profit and loss ledger of a gambler violating the Federal Wagering Stamp Act or something, that's something else."
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4165.872,4167.938,That's correct in themselves.
1964.40,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4177.051,4182.997,"And the law is pretty clear, the constitutional law is pretty clear isn't it that you can under constitution seize mere evidence (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4182.997,4183.801,That is correct.
1964.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4200.675,4202.544,Why wouldn't -- I gather your point.
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4216.611,4219.724,I think -- I wouldn't go that far.
1964.40,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4222.253,4224.853,"In other words, the book has to be one that has ideas?"
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4224.853,4227.086,That is correct.
1964.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4227.086,4227.656,And that is the --
1964.40,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4227.656,4229.861,"Well, then you're in real trouble."
1964.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4229.861,4240.379,Why shouldn't there have to be -- why shouldn't there have to be some kind of a judicial hearing as to the (Inaudible) these books in order to take out the circulation a book with ideas in it?
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4240.379,4251.941,Because ideas such as abstract ideas this Court has held can be expressed and it is not in violation of the First -- it would be in violation of the First Amendment to suppress it.
1964.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4282.92,4292.892,"Well, you might be able to make that -- take that thing after a trial, but why should we able to take books out of circulation just on probable cause?"
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4297.172,4301.448,Could be a question as to what he was using and how he was using it.
1964.40,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4321.338,4326.951,"Well, was there any proof of that kind."
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4326.951,4328.007,There has -- there is none in --
1964.40,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4328.007,4334.71,I mean at the -- then he -- of the -- at the magistrate's hearing after the warrant issuance.
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4334.71,4338.802,I do not know that the record reflects anything definitely in that regard.
1964.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4338.802,4347.861,"Well then -- then aren't you -- seriously, aren't you up against the propositions that markets and quantity of books do."
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4348.182,4348.889,And in that case --
1964.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4348.889,4355.098,-- take out of circulation without some connection with something that -- within -- the kind of what you're talking about assuming --
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4355.098,4355.341,Other --
1964.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4355.341,4357.389,-- that would give it justification.
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4357.389,4357.417,Our --
1964.40,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4357.417,4362.807,"How can you do this; how can you issue a warrant, for instance, some showing of something like that --"
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4362.807,4363.128,Well other than --
1964.40,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4363.128,4365.83,(Inaudible) with ideas embodied in books?
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4365.83,4373.994,Other than the information from the informants to the effect that were -- that these books were used in the teaching of Communist place.
1964.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4373.994,4374.579,"Well, yes."
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4403.674,4407.509,I believe the record will reflect that the informants say that they were used in that --
1964.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4407.509,4409.581,With these particular books by name?
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4409.581,4410.861,"Not by name, no sir."
1964.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4410.861,4414.997,"Well, how do you know what they were -- the informant was talking about?"
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4414.997,4429.489,Other than that the man -- or the man who made the search were exhibited -- stated that they were exhibited copies of certain books that were used and they have picked purportedly that type book up or that book up.
1964.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4429.489,4432.229,Type of book.
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4432.229,4433.54,Other than that --
1964.40,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4433.54,4455.5,"How do you (Inaudible) distinguish this from the quantity of books or they had seven books before the magistrate and the basis of that as I recall it, he said they could pick up 52 other titles, and we said that wasn't enough, the First Amendment wouldn't allow that kind of thing in a seizure procedure, now how does this --"
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4455.5,4466.335,"Certainly in a situation regarding pornographic books, the test of course would be the book itself what it contained."
1964.40,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4467.879,4475.991,"I know, but as I recall it, what the element there is that even on the basis of seven published by the same publisher which couldn't have the --"
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4475.991,4476.512,You mean --
1964.40,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4476.512,4478.738,-- which would pick up about 39 other titles.
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4478.738,4483.281,"There, the other titles."
1964.40,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4483.281,4488.779,"And this one, how this was different?"
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4488.779,4499.011,Back in -- only again say -- that only insofar as they are used as instrumentalities otherwise I could give no answer.
1964.40,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4499.011,4508.589,"Oh, I noticed here that you took the book entitled, “A Catholic Speaks on Cuba” by the Fair Play for Cuba Committee."
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4530.94,4531.824,No sir.
1964.40,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4531.824,4537.009,"Well, what -- how do you distinguish that from any other books?"
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4537.009,4537.935,"There again, I think --"
1964.40,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4537.935,4561.432,"If it's used for that purpose as you say, that's the principal thing that enables you to take these things, so how do you distinguish the Bible from this document itself, “A Catholic Speaks on Cuba” and obviously he speaks as a Catholic in favor of the Cuba situation?"
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4561.432,4580.416,"Other that in -- in the particular book, favoring the Cuban situation which I have not read and can't speak on with authority, I would state it again it would be in the manner and the doctrine stated anything how it was used in relation to the Communist Party as a whole and the advancement of the party."
1964.40,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4580.416,4587.695,"Well, had anybody read these books before they were taken?"
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4587.695,4592.069,I can't answer that sir.
1964.40,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4592.069,4603.279,Did the people who took them ever vouched for the Communist character of them after they were taken as a result of their reading?
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4603.279,4606.566,"Other than what appears on the record before the Court, they have been Mr. --"
1964.40,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4606.566,4607.763,(Voice Overpal)
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4607.763,4609.967,They have been in Mr. Barlow's possession.
1964.40,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4609.967,4616.784,"Well, he read that somebody had told him and showed them these were books that were pro-Communist and then they take all of these."
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4629.017,4651.611,"I do not believe that issue was tried in the court below or that they did go in to that matter, because normally in the State of Texas, those matters are raised at the time of the trial if should a criminal charge be filed."
1964.40,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4651.611,4671.84,"I suppose under the logic of your argument, at least as I understand it, the Holy -- the Bible could have been seized if there were reasonable ground to believe that that was being used as a instrument of Communist meetings to advocate the overthrow of the government of Texas by force and violence."
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4683.676,4683.884,Well --
1964.40,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4683.884,4690.756,"I quote -- my Brother White, the Washington Post and the Washington Star, if subject to a showing that this is being used for this criminal purpose."
1964.40,2,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,4690.756,4711.274,"In the manner which it was being used, a ledger -- if a ledger, an innocent ledger from the publishing house that anyone can buy in a bookstore could be considered an instrumentality of crime I think there again it would go to the method of use."
1964.40,3,31696,john_j_mcavoy,,5958.853,5963.555,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
