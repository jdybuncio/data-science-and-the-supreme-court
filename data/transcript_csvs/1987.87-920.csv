1987.87-920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.987,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-920, Natalie Meyer v. Paul K. Grant."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,10.856,14.241,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,125.831,130.301,What qualifications does he have to have under state law?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,130.301,132.251,To be a petition circulator?
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,132.251,135.619,"Right, for that august function?"
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,135.619,148.777,"Well, the only qualification that he needs is to be a registered elector which in Colorado means that he must be a resident of the State of Colorado, and actually registered to vote."
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,148.777,154.58,Can he be a convicted felon?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,154.58,168.09,"If he is a registered elector, then even if he is a convicted felon, yes, he can be permitted to conduct the petition circulation."
1987.87-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,168.09,173.994,"I suppose he could also be at it if he had been convicted of election fraud, too."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,173.994,176.011,If he is allowed to vote.
1987.87-920,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,186.883,200.542,"Mr. Knaizer, there is, I take it, a state law in Colorado prohibiting and making a criminal offense the use of forged signatures on these initiative measures?"
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,200.542,201.292,That is correct.
1987.87-920,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,205.53,214.802,And there is a requirement that every person signing the initiative measure must be a qualified voter?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,214.802,219.771,Every person signing the initiative must be a registered voter; that is correct.
1987.87-920,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,298.04,311.598,Does the form of the initiative circulation require the circulator to verify under oath that everyone signed in his presence?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,311.598,317.953,"Yes, the voters who are signing the petition don't have to sign an affidavit."
1987.87-920,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,317.953,319.72,"No, but the petition circulator has to."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,319.72,320.655,The petition circulator must--
1987.87-920,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,320.655,331.677,And it would be a criminal offense to falsely swear that people had signed in the circulator's presence if that were not the case.
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,331.677,335.581,"--It would be a criminal offense to falsely swear, that is true."
1987.87-920,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,378.008,384.912,Are there any other states that have this particular provision prohibiting the use of paid circulators?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,384.912,395.803,"There were, but the courts have fairly frequently repealed, or not repealed, but declared the statutes to be unconstitutional."
1987.87-920,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,395.803,401.087,Do you know of any other state presently that makes use of the initiative which has such a law?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,401.087,403.489,I believe Washington may.
1987.87-920,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,412.729,425.887,"The election in question here, the initiative measure was for a constitutional amendment having to do with removal of motor carriers from the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission?"
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,425.887,426.237,That's right.
1987.87-920,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,428.572,431.107,And the election has long since passed.
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,431.107,433.274,"The election has long since passed, that is correct."
1987.87-920,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,433.274,438.027,"Has that provision ever been enacted, the change, the proposed change?"
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,438.027,440.212,"Oh, the deregulation."
1987.87-920,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,441.229,442.914,And is it still an issue?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,445.533,447.2,"Well, no."
1987.87-920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,471.582,483.575,"Mr. Knaizer, was there some basis for the legislature singling out petitions that were circulated by people who were hired to do it as opposed to volunteers?"
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,490.329,490.562,Yes.
1987.87-920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,502.87,510.643,"Well, you described the problem as being the fact that the circulators did not really pay any attention to who was signing."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,521.581,525.318,--There was no legislative history that I could find at the time.
1987.87-920,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,560.223,561.658,Could you spell out those abuses?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,561.658,564.443,"Well, the abuses that were--"
1987.87-920,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,564.443,566.01,You speak generally of abuses.
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,567.612,567.879,--Okay.
1987.87-920,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,612.691,617.495,"Isn't that true with respect to volunteer solicitors, too?"
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,617.495,624.082,There has been no indication at least in Colorado that it was true.
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,630.97,632.705,Don't you think it's more likely to happen.
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,671.53,688.174,"Well, I would think that the opposite in fact may be true, because the volunteer, at least conceived under the Colorado law, really has an interest in getting the measure on the ballot, and wants to make sure the measure stays on the ballot."
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,705.053,708.088,You think he doesn't care if it's grown out?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,711.39,712.607,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear the last part."
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,712.607,717.278,It seems unlikely to me that a paid circulator would not care.
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,741.457,744.325,It's really both.
1987.87-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,770.226,792.073,"May I ask if it's a violation of the statute for a person to say ask his son or daughter to go around the neighborhood getting signatures of the people that the family knows, and then the person who makes the affidavit says, to the best of his or her knowledge, these signatures are registered voters and so forth."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,793.674,796.876,"No, if the daughter was a registered elector--"
1987.87-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,796.876,798.293,"No, the daughter is not."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,811.869,812.986,--That would violate the statute.
1987.87-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.986,827.246,"Because it just says... as you read and describe in your brief, you say they sign an affidavit saying that each signature is a signature, to the best of their know, is the person whose name it purports to be, and that to the best of their knowledge and belief each person is--"
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,827.246,829.431,"Well, really what that is geared to is the--"
1987.87-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,829.431,831.967,"--But I do not think the statute requires that you witness the signatures, does it?"
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,831.967,838.454,"--Well, there was... I believe in that same Brownlow v. Wunsch case, there was an... well, that was before--"
1987.87-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,838.454,839.521,"Well, that was before that was enacted."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,839.521,845.375,--But there hasn't been any case that interpreted that particular statute.
1987.87-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.13,858.082,"No, in the circular it says, to the best of my knowledge and belief, he is registered."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,858.082,858.617,--Right.
1987.87-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,858.617,861.902,"So I assume normally what happens is you meet somebody on the street and you say, are you a registered voter."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,863.919,868.14,"No, our belief is that sending your daughter out would violate the statute."
1987.87-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,890.22,894.79,"Of course, that is the safest, but I am not sure the language of the statute commands that."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,894.79,898.842,"Well, that is the way the Secretary has interpreted it over the years."
1987.87-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,898.842,900.794,"Now, how has it been interpreted?"
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,903.229,904.896,"No, in fact--"
1987.87-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,904.896,906.348,Have there been many cases interpreting the statute?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,906.348,909.05,"--One, but not interpreting this particular provision."
1987.87-920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1012.866,1018.503,"But a paid elector has to meet... a paid circulator has to meet that requirement, too, doesn't it?"
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1018.503,1020.253,--A paid circulator has to meet that requirement.
1987.87-920,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1086.147,1087.964,What would happen if you gave him lunch money?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1087.964,1090.516,"In Colorado, you can't do that."
1987.87-920,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1092.301,1094.251,Can't give them anything.
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1094.251,1097.07,"No, he is not... in Nebraska, for instance,--"
1987.87-920,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1097.07,1098.372,He couldn't get bus fare either?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1098.372,1100.255,"--Couldn't get bus fare either, that's correct."
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1100.255,1116.416,"Whereas you do have an impartial adjudicator of the petitions if the person is not being paid, but is a zealous, fiery-eyed proponent of the legislation that is being proposed."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1123.57,1126.205,I'm not sure it's as black and white as that.
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.724,1128.491,Is it even gray?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1147.019,1154.708,"--Well, the experience in Colorado was in fact that paid petition circulators weren't as careful about the collection of signatures."
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.708,1157.243,I thought you said before there was no evidence as to--
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1157.243,1160.028,"No, there was evidence... there was an evidence of fraud."
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1165.766,1171.253,--Was there evidence that they were more careless than the fire-eyed zealots were?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1171.253,1177.038,"There was evidence that... well, there was no evidence regarding the fiery-eyed zealots."
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1179.607,1184.894,"That they were careless, but then everybody may have been careless as far as the legislature knew."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1184.894,1188.179,"Well, as far as the legislature knew everybody wasn't careless."
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1190.298,1191.999,Why was not everybody careless?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1200.403,1207.426,"There wasn't evidence that when the proponent obtained it, they were all okay."
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1211.544,1216.715,"When you say more, there was evidence that it was abused."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1228.423,1230.09,There wasn't any that was in that case.
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.09,1231.958,So the only evidence really was that it was abused.
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1231.958,1232.824,That's correct.
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1232.824,1237.461,And we don't know whether it was any more abused by the paid circulators or not.
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1237.461,1238.511,That's correct.
1987.87-920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1238.511,1245.384,Would you say in this particular case the abused did result from the activities of paid circulators?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1245.384,1248.503,The abuse did result from the activities of paid circulators; that is correct.
1987.87-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.378,1287.728,"Well, what about the fund raising cases?"
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1291.246,1292.282,Okay.
1987.87-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1301.888,1321.682,"Well, I know, but the cases... the cases don't say that because the circulator or the fund raiser not only advocates but takes money, that he isn't protected by the First Amendment."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1321.682,1323.651,--That's correct.
1987.87-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1323.651,1328.138,"Taking the money is like getting the signature, isn't it?"
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1331.407,1335.359,"If you look at it in that context, that's correct."
1987.87-920,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1380.721,1391.796,"Well, but they also have to express the point of view of the people seeking the change particularly to get a signature on an initiative."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1400.151,1400.901,Speech--
1987.87-920,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1400.901,1417.779,"Political issues, and issues of public concern, and what's at stake here is whether the person putting this measure, proposing to put it on the ballot can expend money to have that message carried to the voters?"
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1417.779,1425.952,--The people in Colorado can expend money in any fashion to bring that message to the voters.
1987.87-920,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1431.023,1437.176,"Well, they want to spend it on paying people to offer to voters the petitions."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1437.176,1445.263,"--The people who circulate the petitions can't speak, they cannot be paid."
1987.87-920,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1484.573,1498.065,"Counsel, when the petition circulator accosts somebody on the sidewalk and says, are you a registered voter, and the man says, yes, how does he verify that?"
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1498.065,1502.119,He just takes the word of the registered elector.
1987.87-920,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1502.119,1503.952,"Well, what's the difference whether he's paid or not?"
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1503.952,1512.658,"Well, the elector also has certain other functions other than to verify that it's a registered elector."
1987.87-920,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1524.632,1526.682,Nobody verified that he's a voter.
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1526.682,1528.751,Nobody verifies that he's a voter.
1987.87-920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1528.751,1550.514,"The problem of my own experience in that sort of work is not that a lot of people from New York would sign this petition in Colorado, but that a circulator is going to open up the phone book and just write a bunch of names and addresses out of the phone book in kin do phony handwriting that nobody... that no one ever signed."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1552.699,1554.318,That's part of the evil.
1987.87-920,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1565.424,1569.745,"But there are forgery statutes out there making it what, a felony?"
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1569.745,1577.231,"There are forgery statutes which makes it a classified felony for the... yes, a classified felony, that's correct."
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1577.231,1616.725,"Mr. Knaizer, I am frankly not bowled over by the more significant danger of the paid circulator as opposed to the volunteer circulator, but you made another argument in your brief which was that the initiative after all is a device that was a product of the populist era, and it was directed against monied interest and it's contrary to the whole spirit of the thing to have the monied interests running the initiative."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1621.027,1622.962,"Well, I think it's an underlying argument."
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1637.639,1653.982,"--Don't the monied interests do better in the legislature than they do in the... you know, I mean don't the money interest have full-time lobbyists at the legislature and isn't it better to be able to use a little bit of money to counteract that through an initiative?"
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1653.982,1655.783,It depends on the issue.
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1665.472,1667.408,Where were the monied interests in this case?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1667.408,1669.11,"In this case, there weren't monied interests."
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.11,1669.893,There weren't?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1669.893,1670.993,As far as we could tell.
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1670.993,1675.18,The trucking industry that's regulated in the state was sort of neutral on this?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1680.149,1681.834,I'm just speaking from the record.
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1681.834,1683.417,"Oh, I see."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1683.417,1688.071,And I have to admit from the record that we couldn't tell.
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1688.071,1690.69,What was the group that was circulating the petition?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1692.14,1692.973,I'm sorry?
1987.87-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.973,1694.225,Was it Libertarian Party?
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1694.225,1701.462,"Well, actually it was the corporate side, as I understand it, of the Libertarian Party, something called Coloradans for Free Enterprise."
1987.87-920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1719.904,1723.141,"Well, I had raised my eyebrows."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1725.074,1725.441,Okay.
1987.87-920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1725.441,1731.628,"Again, my own experience is that a lot of the trucking industry wouldn't have been at all happy with the deregulation."
1987.87-920,0,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,1737.715,1741.269,What I would like to do is to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
1987.87-920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1741.269,1743.519,"Thank you, Mr. Knaizer."
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,1745.137,1750.891,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.314,1944.349,"Mr. Danks, do you pay them by the signature?"
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,1944.349,1950.82,Were we going to... I don't know the answer to that question.
1987.87-920,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1973.769,1983.541,"Well, Mr. Danks, do you concede that there is a valid state interest in regulating the conduct of petition circulators?"
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,1983.541,1988.028,For purposes of preventing fraud?
1987.87-920,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1991.48,1993.849,And the purposes that the state is urging.
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,1998.92,2010.542,"I concede that there is a valid state interest in having petitions that do not contain forged signatures, and I concede that there is a valid state interest in having a modicum of support."
1987.87-920,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2010.542,2020.416,"And if there were some regulation to the effect that you couldn't pay them by the number of signatures obtained, would you say that might be valid?"
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2020.416,2021.633,It might be valid.
1987.87-920,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2052.471,2057.357,Could the state require paid petition circulators to be licensed?
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2057.357,2060.209,I believe they could.
1987.87-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.92,2094.148,"Well, you may not accept yourself the notion that pay encourages a violation of the law, but let's assume that the legislature thought that it did."
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2101.536,2105.855,"Justice White, you wrote on that point, I believe, in Monroe."
1987.87-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.628,2123.901,"Well, but even if there is a problem like the legislature identified, that doesn't mean that you lose the case."
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2131.757,2142.962,"I believe I would agree that they have to show there is a compelling state interest, and that they have a heavy burden to meet that this is the most exacting, or the easiest way to meet their problem."
1987.87-920,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2185.057,2187.707,And your position was that it was designed to prevent fraud.
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2187.707,2190.961,"Well, we were struggling to find out what their interest was."
1987.87-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.731,2227.218,"Mr. Danks, I am a little concerned about your response to Justice O'Connor's last question."
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2279.936,2281.903,I see the point you are raising.
1987.87-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2281.903,2283.638,Your group will be spending a lot more money.
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2283.638,2285.888,All right.
1987.87-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2327.381,2330.833,That's fine.
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2338.772,2340.355,"No, sir, I am not."
1987.87-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2340.355,2350.163,May I ask you what the state interest the state relied on in the trial court was if it wasn't fraud?
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2350.163,2353.282,They argued two points.
1987.87-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2448.089,2456.944,"Mr. Danks, is there any reason why you think this same issue is going to arise between you and the state in the future?"
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2456.944,2461.932,"Well, the issue of deregulation is still a lively topic in Colorado."
1987.87-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2490.849,2502.388,"You mean by pursuing it, undertake another initiative?"
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2502.388,2505.323,"Yes, that is within the realm of possibility."
1987.87-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2541.548,2547.852,"Mr. Danks, may the state forbid paying people to sign?"
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2547.852,2552.638,May the state--
1987.87-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.638,2568.599,"You go around, a person collecting signatures goes around and is in the neighborhood, and acquaints a person with what the issue is, and says, by the way, $5.00 if you sign."
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2568.599,2572.651,"--Yes, the state statute... no, you can't pay someone to--"
1987.87-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2572.651,2576.269,"Well, is it legal for the state to forbid that?"
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2576.269,2582.359,"--Yes, I'm sure that it's also in the constitution, although now that you ask--"
1987.87-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2582.359,2590.279,"Well, I know that it may be, but I just wondered if it would be constitutional to forbid paying a person to sign."
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2590.279,2597.618,"--Yes, I think... in other words, would it be constitutional under the First Amendment, not just under our Colorado Constitution?"
1987.87-920,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2623.686,2637.759,"Well, what if a circular just goes out and offers $2.00 to everyone who will sign if you are a registered voter and otherwise qualified, can the state prohibit the offering of money for perfectly good signatures?"
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2637.759,2649.234,"I believe it can, because the goal is to have 5 percent of the people sign, and by signing they are stating that they want this issue on the ballot."
1987.87-920,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2649.234,2660.109,"Well, presumably if they sign, they are doing whatever the state says they should do to have the issue on the ballot, but they are also getting two bucks for it."
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2660.109,2668.965,"Well, they may be, but then you have a factual issue as to whether they signed it for the $2.00 or in order to get it on to the ballot."
1987.87-920,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2668.965,2675.619,So you say the state could prohibit the payment of money to people as a consideration for their signing.
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2675.619,2679.654,"Yes, and then we get into a balancing test I believe as well."
1987.87-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2710.708,2716.196,"Mr. Danks, I'm sorry to come back to this, but it's a point that's very important to me."
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2734.573,2735.523,He was at that time.
1987.87-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2735.523,2736.34,At that time.
1987.87-920,1,44457,william_c_danks,,2736.34,2742.477,"Nancy Bigbee, one of the Plaintiffs, is a transportation lawyer, and that's a very important issue to her."
1987.87-920,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2785.273,2788.558,"Thank you, Mr. Danks."
1987.87-920,2,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,2790.994,2794.112,I would just like to make a brief comment.
1987.87-920,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2833.035,2836.855,You still say as of now fraud is the purpose.
1987.87-920,2,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,2836.855,2841.007,Fraud is--
1987.87-920,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2841.007,2843.759,I mean is fraud in or out of the case as of now?
1987.87-920,2,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,2843.759,2845.711,"--I'm sorry, I didn't hear that."
1987.87-920,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2845.711,2847.378,Is fraud in or out?
1987.87-920,2,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,2847.378,2851.782,Fraud is in as an underlying purpose.
1987.87-920,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2879.449,2880.967,Isn't that fraud or not?
1987.87-920,2,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,2880.967,2883.134,"--Not necessarily, and that's the distinction."
1987.87-920,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2883.134,2884.086,That's the whole point.
1987.87-920,2,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,2895.311,2896.927,Let me see if I can make the distinction again.
1987.87-920,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2903.748,2904.333,"--Yes, you may."
1987.87-920,2,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,2904.333,2910.987,The petition circulator may be in a position where he decides to pass the petition around.
1987.87-920,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.987,2911.387,Yes.
1987.87-920,2,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,2911.387,2914.022,And he doesn't see who signs it.
1987.87-920,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2914.022,2919.593,But you say that he is supposed to witness the signatures.
1987.87-920,2,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,2919.593,2920.259,He is supposed to witness--
1987.87-920,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2920.259,2926.846,"And if he turns in his certification representing that he did, isn't that fraud?"
1987.87-920,2,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,2926.846,2931.314,"--Well, that is fraud, but I was talking about the signature of the electors themselves."
1987.87-920,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2931.314,2931.614,Okay.
1987.87-920,2,36173,maurice_g_knaizer,,2931.614,2932.206,Thank you.
1987.87-920,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2932.206,2934.831,"Thank you, Mr. Knaizer."
