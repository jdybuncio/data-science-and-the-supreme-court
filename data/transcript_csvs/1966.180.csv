1966.180,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.645,"Number 180, Norman See, Appellant, versus City of Seattle."
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,11.435,12.835,May it please the Court.
1966.180,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,81.942,83.738,It says anything except dwellings?
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,83.738,85.05,Except dwel -- dwellings Mr. Chief Justice.
1966.180,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,85.05,86.957,Well --
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,86.957,97.466,"Appellant, Mr. See was convicted under 8.01.140 which appears at page 11 of the record."
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,295.171,298.154,Did any -- did anybody live in this building?
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,298.154,299.2,"No, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,299.2,300.102,Or occupied it in?
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,300.102,301.086,No.
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,301.086,302.753,Except that employee?
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,302.753,304.054,Correct.
1966.180,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,304.054,307.344,Was there anything in this building as the record show?
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,307.344,308.9,The record does not show.
1966.180,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,308.9,310.962,For all we know it might have been a vacant building?
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,310.962,313.225,"It might have been vacant, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1966.180,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,313.225,316.934,And would your position apply to that even if it is vacant?
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,316.934,317.993,Yes.
1966.180,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,317.993,318.599,You mean this --
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,318.599,318.788,Well --
1966.180,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,318.788,324.303,Even if it were a vacant building?
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,324.303,332.656,My position would be that the -- that if the owner of the building did not want to admit entry that a warrant would be required whether or not it was --
1966.180,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,332.656,332.899,And it's on --
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,332.899,335.449,-- it subsequently turned out to be vacant or not.
1966.180,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,335.449,338.616,That's solely because of the factor of ownership though.
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,338.616,339.336,That's correct.
1966.180,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,358.33,368.155,"Suppose this was a -- open business for people who'd come and go, would you still say they have no right to go in and inspect it?"
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,368.155,370.938,I think a distinction would have to be made between this case and that.
1966.180,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,397.628,405.687,"Suppose they had the books that they were -- in the part of the building that's open to the public, do they have the right to seize those books without a search warrant?"
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,405.687,407.032,"No, I don't think so."
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,414.426,415.884,Books with the effects under the Fourth Amendment?
1966.180,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,415.884,417.162,That's correct.
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,417.162,418.108,Wouldn't it?
1966.180,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,418.108,419.384,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1966.180,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,445.865,458.254,"Well, suppose this were an open field and you have an inspection statute, does the -- does the Fourth Amendment apply that?"
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,458.254,460.738,To an -- to an open pasture field?
1966.180,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,460.738,461.214,Yes.
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,463.593,464.509,As the Hester case maybe?
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,464.509,472.264,"Well, you -- you do -- push me further than I thought I was going to have to go."
1966.180,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,521.283,523.284,"Now, how does that differ?"
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,523.284,539.263,"Well I -- unlike my colleague in Number 92 feel that the key identifying phrase for my part would be that there must be one a -- a reasonable plan, a reasonable inspection plan of one sort or another --"
1966.180,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,539.263,544.639,"Well, and that suppo -- suppose I don't know what this ordinance, if I administer that, I gather nothing, that's what --"
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,544.639,544.976,That's right Mr. Justice.
1966.180,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,544.976,546.207,-- you said.
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,559.994,562.324,I would say that -- that that would be sufficient.
1966.180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,579.655,601.049,"Well, Mr. Dorsen, what if you have this particular statute but you have an administrative arrangement, a set of regulations issued by the health people saying where every year we do -- we do -- and it turns out that this inspection in this case was a routine annual inspection according to the plan."
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,601.049,611.087,"Well, I think that if the inspector showed up without a warrant the individual would be entitled to say to the inspector “Go to the magistrate and present these facts to the magistrate.”"
1966.180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,617.071,618.59,And you would say he could get this warrant?
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,618.59,619.048,He would.
1966.180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,642.313,650.127,"Well, I take it -- I take it, if there was a warrant before him that the warrants could issue on the complaints on specific cases?"
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,650.127,650.943,That's correct.
1966.180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,672.945,673.803,Would you -- would you agree with that?
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,675.14,676.993,"Yes, in certain situations."
1966.180,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,683.702,704.052,"Well, I gather Mr. Dorsen that essentially what you're saying is that something less than a showing in a criminal case would suffice a part of that it's absolutely essential if -- if the proper entry demand of that there be the intervention of a judge before someone enters."
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,704.052,713.227,"That's our position and we -- we -- in urging it to the Court, Mr. Justice Brennan, we do not feel that anyway we're subverting the inspection process."
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,713.605,714.601,"Well, that's -- aren't you --"
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,714.601,715.37,-- quarterly.
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,715.37,726.304,Aren't you -- aren't you not only subverting but cheapening and degrading the values of the Fourth Amendment when you say that the reasonable cause could be shown just by the desire to make a spot check?
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,726.304,726.356,"No, I don't --"
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,726.356,732.259,"Those periodic inspections, certainly, you can't do that of the -- under the Fourth Amendment?"
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,732.259,733.323,"Not in the criminal case, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,733.323,733.84,No.
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,735.459,735.683,That's correct.
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,735.683,736.392,-- by this Court under the Fourth Amendment.
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,736.392,740.098,And this is -- and this Mr. Justice Stewart is a different kind of a case.
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,740.098,740.713,Certainly is.
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,740.713,744.303,And it's a kind of a case where there's a different showing the facts upon which the warrant could issue.
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,744.303,747.172,"Something -- something other than probable cause, is that it?"
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,747.172,748.772,A different type of probable cause.
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,764.482,768.66,"Well, it's seems to me that if you can just show, we haven't inspected this place for a year."
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,775.245,776.863,I would not say so.
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,790.749,796.511,"Well, now with -- it was just a spot check, a periodic random spot check be a reasonable plan."
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,800.874,802.119,"Yes, I would think it would."
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,802.843,805.47,Just to keep -- kept precious random spot check.
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,805.47,808.157,I would call it a -- a rational spot check.
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,808.157,808.796,And be easily --
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,808.796,822.123,"That is a sound way of ensuring against fire hazards which is what the ultimate purpose of the inspections system is, it would seem to me that that would be a reasonable way go about it and not “unreasonable” under the words of the Fourth Amendment."
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,909.732,917.569,"If the Fourth Amendment requires nothing more than a -- an automatic rubberstamp on a piece of paper, we're not talking about it very much in this case, are we?"
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,917.569,925.395,"Well, I -- I certainly agree with that but I don't think, I'm suggesting -- I don't mean to suggest that that's all of this, a rubberstamp."
1966.180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,931.604,947.825,"Well, Mr. Dorsen what if there's a legislative judgment in the statute or in an ordinance that says -- that says ins -- inspect every year because we think within the period of a year that enough can happen to a dwelling that requires inspection."
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,957.279,959.007,It would not be enough without the warrant.
1966.180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,959.095,960.371,"No, I mean -- that's what I mean."
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,961.809,963.068,I think it would be.
1966.180,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,963.709,973.694,"And the fact here is, as long as the plan is as you call it that was a -- your real answer is that there has to be a judicial intervention that that's with the Fourth Amendment?"
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,973.694,975.645,That is -- is our position Mr. Justice.
1966.180,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,998.268,999.429,What if it was Abel?
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,999.429,1000.07,Pardon me?
1966.180,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1000.07,1002.862,What would you do if the Court's decision in Abel?
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1002.862,1003.933,In Abel.
1966.180,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1010.024,1014.595,"No, I mean on this point of judicial intervention the Court's there as I recall it find --"
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1014.595,1021.267,I -- without having --I haven't studied that case very frankly in the same way I have this.
1966.180,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1024.178,1026.31,But there -- there of course because there was the need in that.
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1026.31,1030.976,That is correct.
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1066.132,1077.187,"Well, it seems to me if the problem would be really if -- if somebody comes to your door under the warrant you have very little choice about whether or not you would let him in."
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1086.724,1087.122,"Well, the importance --"
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1087.122,1092.526,"Then you can say, “I'm sorry, I'm not going to let you in until you show me that you are a member of the Fire Department.”"
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1092.526,1094.438,"Well, of course that again is a serious problem."
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1111.04,1135.955,"Not if I say, if somebody comes to your house with a warrant which you say can be -- as I understand you can be issued by a magistrate at simply upon the showing of the Fire Department that we're making a random irrational spot check of various building in the city, and this is one of the buildings and then the warrant issued and you show up at that building and that person hasn't got any choice but let you in."
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1135.955,1136.317,Well --
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1136.317,1137.51,He has a duty to let you in then.
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1137.51,1138.902,That's correct.
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1138.902,1143.167,Whereas if the -- at any time of the day or night and no matter how convenient it may be for him.
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1143.167,1168.08,"Well, this -- that -- that point is of course raises it seems to me the second central issue here and that is, that no matter how one feels on the question we're now discussing, the ordinance in this case points of as shortly as any that I have seen the kind of unlimited at large authority that some municipalities are prepared to attempt to invest their inspectors with."
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1184.936,1195.776,"Well, my -- my question was this, that if you're right that all that's required is a warrant then you come with a warrant and the person has a duty as you say to let this man in if he has a warrant --"
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1195.776,1195.962,"Well, there --"
1966.180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1195.962,1200.237,"-- whereas under the existing statute without a warrant, it would seem to me, he has no such duty."
1966.180,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1206.674,1209.998,I don't think if I understand this word means correctly.
1966.180,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1244.74,1248.545,Very well.
1966.180,1,16643,a_l_newbould,,1251.332,1256.731,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3073.164,3073.294,I will -- I will --
1966.180,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3073.294,3074.071,-- Dorsen.
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3074.071,3075.46,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1966.180,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3135.206,3146.023,"Mr. Dorsen, I suppose your argument would lead to our requirement that a meter reader would have a search warrant to come in and read the water meter."
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3148.354,3150.553,Yes.
1966.180,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3150.553,3157.001,"And the -- the search warrant, in order to get a search warrant how -- would you have to allege as simply that you haven't read the meter in a month?"
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3157.001,3157.951,That's right.
1966.180,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3158.317,3161.031,What possibly is then is the purpose of the warrant?
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3161.031,3173.334,"Well, I can answer that fast very easily by saying that some people who are searching, some people who are inspecting, may be doing it arbitrarily, may be doing it as part of harassment."
1966.180,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3208.674,3209.615,"Well, that has nothing to do with probable cause."
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3209.615,3210.523,Right.
1966.180,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3210.523,3212.283,That has to do with the householders' convenience.
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3212.3,3212.543,"Well, that's true."
1966.180,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3212.543,3222.717,-- suggested to you that the -- the present statute from the point of view of householders' convenience gives much preference to a warrant because a man armed with a warrant can come in despite the householders' inconvenience.
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3222.717,3223.739,That's correct.
1966.180,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3235.503,3242.456,"Will the meter readers, for example, have a right to enter your house?"
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3244.606,3248.954,"I'm not sure, actually the water meters that I've seen sometimes are on the outside of the house and not in the dwelling --"
1966.180,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3248.954,3251.688,"In New York, I gather, you don't have them?"
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3251.688,3252.631,Not the water.
1966.180,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3252.631,3265.045,"That's for water, -- but I'm-- I'm hypothesizing a city water system where the meter itself usually belongs to the water company but it's located inside the -- the four walls a house."
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3265.045,3271.046,"Well, the direct answer to your question is that the man knocks on the door and says, “I'm the water inspector.”"
1966.180,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3271.046,3271.459,Yes.
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3271.459,3272.065,And I want to see --
1966.180,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3272.065,3273.398,Then he presents is credentials and (Voice Overlap).
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3273.398,3274.727,And he presents his credentials.
1966.180,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3281.303,3282.565,"Well, we're not talking about breaking into house --"
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3282.565,3291.064,"Well, breaking in any scheme or putting the man in terrible criminal conviction for not admitting him which was happen to Mr. See in this case."
1966.180,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3291.064,3314.445,"Mr. Dorsen, suppose the inspector had known the magistrate, sworn that there was a local ordinance or statute which permitted him to make periodic inspections in the interest of safety, would you think that would be sufficient ground to issue a search warrant?"
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3314.445,3320.615,"I think he -- the way I -- I would answer that question, Mr. Justice Black, is you would have to say something one step more."
1966.180,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3325.812,3327.417,I suppose you said that.
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3327.417,3333.798,I think the -- the last thing that he might have to say is what the plan was?
1966.180,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3333.798,3334.362,What the what?
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3334.362,3337.277,What -- what the plan of inspection was?
1966.180,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3348.645,3352.12,Do you think he'd have to say anything about it's being a wooden frame house?
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3352.12,3352.494,No.
1966.180,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3354.594,3381.886,"Another way of what I'm asking is that, do you think that in order to get a search warrant, it is sufficient to rely upon the judgment of the legislative body that periodic to the inspection one each year or two each year are necessary, and that in order to comply with that part, that that's our law, the inspector must now be allowed to inspect in this house."
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3381.886,3382.099,Well --
1966.180,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3382.099,3388.321,Would that in your judgment authorize a search warrant?
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3388.321,3389.596,"Well, I'm not -- I'm not certain."
1966.180,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3397.075,3397.275,Yes.
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3397.275,3397.632,-- to that kind.
1966.180,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3397.632,3399.576,Well I -- I'm assuming that.
1966.180,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3399.576,3401.066,I thought you'd said yes to this particular --
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3401.066,3401.709,I had -- had (Voice Overlap) --
1966.180,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3401.709,3403.427,-- case before this?
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3403.427,3408.01,I had said yes and I -- and now reconsidering it.
1966.180,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3408.01,3431.622,"Now, assuming that to be the case, why would an ordinance which permitted the search -- search without a warrant but on the probable cause that -- creation of the periodic right to search, to inspect why would an ordinance be invalid?"
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3431.622,3432.47,"Well, I think that --"
1966.180,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3432.47,3439.826,Which did the same thing that would be done in case of the issuance of the search warrant.
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3439.826,3478.031,"Well, I don't think I would -- I would draw a distinction between that but I do think that the inspector would have -- I think that the key element is the fact that the person who wants to gain entry must go to the magistrate and swear that he is conducting the inspection pursuant to this plan and that he -- and that he give in -- in the warrant the -- the essential facts and I -- I, how far you'd -- you'd go for specificity, how far you'd require him to show that for example this plan was a plan relating to a specific neighborhood and defining the neighborhood and defining --"
1966.180,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3478.031,3480.443,But it's just limited to the city.
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3495.018,3496.852,I would permit the search in that case.
1966.180,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3496.852,3499.077,But well if that's the case.
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3512.601,3527.66,I would say it is not invalid but I -- but the citizen is still entitled to the protection he gets by having the inspector go to the magistrate and affirm that the inspections taking place is part of that plan.
1966.180,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3527.66,3537.547,Why would he be if all he has to swear is precisely the facts upon which the legislation obeys?
1966.180,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3537.547,3566.133,"Well, it's impossible that the inspection was not taking place pursuant to that plan and the fact that he is prepared to swear to it and affirm that this is part of the plan for fire inspection of this community or -- or a neighborhood, is a protection of the citizen, that the -- that the individual is being kept, that the -- that the inspector is being kept from the inside of the premises without -- with what -- on the facts you've presented Mr. Justice Black, seems to me a reasonable administrative plan for assuring that fires will not take place."
