1993.93-141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.437,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-141, West Lynn Creamery v. Jonathan Healy."
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,44.9,49.244,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-141,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,71.54,88.451,"Mr. Rosenbaum, I'm wondering if... if all we have in the order was the requirement that there be paid an assessment on all liquid milk sold in Massachusetts, would that be a Commerce Clause violation?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,88.451,93.243,"If the assessment were to go into the general revenues of the State, Your Honor, is that the assumption I'm to be making?"
1993.93-141,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,94.044,94.785,Nothing more than that.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,96.976,103.31,"--If the assessment goes to the State and not to the farmers, that would not be a violation of the Commerce Clause, because that would simply be a tax."
1993.93-141,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,103.31,118.17,"Not... if all we had was not an assessment, but just money appropriated by the State to give to Massachusetts dairy farmers to help them, would that be a Commerce Clause violation?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,118.17,123.993,This Court said in the New Energy case that ordinarily a subsidy will not be a violation of the Commerce Clause.
1993.93-141,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,132.068,132.849,Presumably that's okay.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,137.151,137.402,"Yes, pre--"
1993.93-141,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,137.402,140.704,And we've never held that's a violation of the Commerce Clause.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,140.704,147.358,--Presumably money appropriated from the general revenues of the State of Massachusetts going to Massachusetts dairy farmers would be constitutional.
1993.93-141,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.358,154.802,"Well, if both of those acts can be constitutional, then what makes it unconstitutional when you put them together, in your view?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,154.802,164.369,"Well, this Court held in New Energy explicitly that merely because a State could achieve its goals through a subsidy did not mean other methods of achieving that goal would be constitutional."
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,220.807,229.181,"Well, that purpose would not be invalidating so long... you... I think you've said... so long as the subsidy were applied in some other way, right?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,229.181,230.133,The... the only way--
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,230.133,238.468,"I can... I can want to protect or... or compensate Massachusetts dairy farmers for their inefficiency if I want to, right?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,238.468,244.401,--I believe the only method by which that should be permitted is if it's a direct subsidy from the general revenues of the State.
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,244.401,244.912,All right.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,255.85,257.122,"No, Your Honor, that's not my point."
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,257.122,257.332,That's not?
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,257.332,258.384,"I'm assuming, in this--"
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,258.384,259.083,Why wouldn't that do it?
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,259.083,270.931,"--Well, because I'm assuming... because, in that hypothetical, if the money were still being raised through the assessment on milk processors, running it through the general revenues would not make a difference."
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,281.398,281.949,Oh.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,281.949,283.498,Because the effect would be the same.
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,283.498,286.671,You... you can't tax milk processors separately?
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,290.424,294.296,"Milk processors or of course subject to the same taxes as anyone else, but if the--"
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,294.296,295.629,But you can't pick that out?
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,297.498,305.835,--You... you could not single out milk processors for a special tax and simultaneously provide the proceeds of that tax to the dairy farmers.
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,305.835,308.748,"No, no, not the proceeds of the tax, the tax goes into general revenues."
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,325.307,336.895,"If the processors are being subjected to a tax different from other people similarly situated, I think that is still bad, because, in essence, you're still providing the same sum of money that you would be providing under this scheme."
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,336.895,340.278,They're not being... they're not being taxed from other... differently from other people similarly situated.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,342.348,342.929,Well--
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,342.929,344.529,"I mean, taxes are imposed that way."
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,351.936,356.676,--But the impact of such a regime would be the same as the pricing order... and let me turn--
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,356.676,358.97,"So, you are complaining about a subsidy then?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,360.119,360.4,--I--
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,360.4,363.943,--You... you acknowledge that taxing milk processors alone would be okay.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,371.927,377.771,--You can tax milk processors as you would tax any other businessman involved in business in Massachusetts.
1993.93-141,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,394.872,397.743,"Suppose you just did it in a separate time period, two different acts."
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,413.195,413.786,"--Well, I think--"
1993.93-141,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,413.786,421.49,"I thought your position was that that... that you were, at least not... that your argument here was not dependent upon that being unconstitutional."
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,421.49,424.272,--My... my argument is certainly not dependent upon that being unconstitutional.
1993.93-141,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,424.872,427.303,"So, could you distinguish that from what we have before us?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,427.303,427.694,--Well--
1993.93-141,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,427.694,433.528,"Why... why isn't it, as one of the briefs said, that's just a matter of form?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,433.528,437.18,"--Well, I do believe that would be unconstitutional."
1993.93-141,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,513.659,517.953,"Well, I thought the assessment was on all milk from any source."
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,517.953,519.482,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.93-141,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,519.482,524.227,It just so happens that a high percentage of the milk is purchased from out of State.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,524.227,526.128,The assessment is on milk of any source.
1993.93-141,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,539.268,556.199,"Well, do you take the position that if all we had before us was an assessment on the sale in Massachusetts of all liquid milk from any source, that that would be a violation of Baldwin... that it would fall under the Baldwin principle and be invalid?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,556.199,558.581,"--If the assessment... no, Your Honor."
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,588.239,595.723,"But you say that if they both, impose that tax and also subsidize Massachusetts producers, then it becomes bad?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,595.723,596.574,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,596.574,602.848,What if they only subsidized Massachusetts producers in two-thirds of the amount that they... that they garner from this tax?
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,602.848,605.099,"That would, of course, be a different case."
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,620.851,621.312,"Well, I--"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,621.312,622.34,I think a bright line--
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,622.34,627.776,"--I don't want to have to play two-thirds, four-fifths and whatnot, which makes me think, if it comes out of general revenues, it's okay."
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,635.11,640.553,--I don't think that that would be the appropriate point to draw the line in your hypothetical.
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,640.553,644.456,But assume that I'm... I'm stupid... and that's... that's how I feel about it.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,646.766,649.308,"Well, there is a difference between general revenues and this scheme."
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.113,672.135,Or the elderly and children.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,672.135,672.533,--Or the elderly.
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,672.533,673.405,And that it happen every year.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,673.405,675.365,And that would happen on a regularized basis.
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,675.365,676.757,"So, you'd pay a political price for it?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,676.757,678.198,You would pay a political price for it.
1993.93-141,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,678.198,690.065,"Mr. Rosenbaum, isn't there another... and maybe I'm just missing something here... but it isn't merely whether it's out of general revenues or not, but, rather, whether the computation of the amount of the subsidy is dependent upon the amount collected from all the dealers?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,690.065,690.575,Yes.
1993.93-141,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,690.575,694.868,"That's the key, isn't it, rather than... it doesn't matter whether you fund through general revenue or have two separate bills."
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,700.322,701.614,I think you would have a different case there.
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.738,709.819,"So, four-fifths is okay, so long as it isn't tied to the other one?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,709.819,712.911,"I'm not certain, Your Honor, that any percentage is okay."
1993.93-141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,724.879,730.022,"Well, why is it key that it's this precise correspondence that you talk about?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,730.022,732.623,There is precise corres--
1993.93-141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,732.623,732.903,I know.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,734.624,736.997,"--Your Honor, I don't believe it would be critical."
1993.93-141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,736.997,739.298,I thought in your answer to Justice Stevens you said it was.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,739.298,750.345,"Your Honor, what I was suggesting was that if there were so little correlation between the two that they could be viewed as wholly separate, then perhaps at that point this Court would find it to be acceptable."
1993.93-141,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,758.45,765.034,But isn't... isn't it because the correlation is directly to a source of revenue which is not subject to political responsiveness within the State?
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,766.744,769.726,"Your Honor, I believe that is certainly a key to our argument."
1993.93-141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,773.55,789.261,"Well, why is it any concern of this Court interpreting the Commerce Clause as to whether the milk commissioner in Massachusetts or the... what do you call it, the general court, the body that passes laws... makes the decision?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,794.243,796.595,"--It is a matter of State law, Your Honor."
1993.93-141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,801.81,806.871,We ought to somehow fuse those into our Commerce Clause analysis?
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,806.871,822.333,"--Well, Your Honor, this Court has recognized that a State... recognized explicitly in the New Energy case... that a State could achieve, at times, the same goals of protecting its in-state citizens through a subsidy that it might also be able to achieve through an unconstitutional restraint on interstate commerce."
1993.93-141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,861.717,867.233,But... but that would happen whether it was done by the Massachusetts legislature or by the milk board.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,867.233,880.691,"Well, if... if we are talking about monies coming from the general revenues of the State, then there in fact is no regulation being placed upon the transaction between processors and out-of-state farmers."
1993.93-141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,891.847,892.317,But you--
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,892.317,896.451,That transaction... the price of that transaction is wholly unaffected.
1993.93-141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,896.451,905.107,"--But in answering Justice O'Connor's question, I thought you said that simply a levy on the processors, without any ensuing subsidy, would be unobjectionable?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,905.107,913.923,"If the levy were what I would think of as being a pure tax, a dollar tax, going to the general revenues, there would not be any unconstitutionality there."
1993.93-141,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,964.617,971.269,"Well, I have difficulty putting your case into the Baldwin framework."
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,999.95,1004.161,"Your Honor, Baldwin was limited to sales taking place in the State of New York."
1993.93-141,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1006.891,1007.232,No.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1023.204,1024.753,"--Yes, but--"
1993.93-141,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1024.753,1025.835,And that is not this case.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1025.835,1027.877,"--Well, I think it is this case."
1993.93-141,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1042.965,1045.679,"Well, that's only for purposes of the... of the subsidy, not for the tax."
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1045.679,1054.324,"Well, if all the milk in the Baldwin situation had come from New York, there would be no triggering of that statute, either."
1993.93-141,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1099.122,1112.812,"Well, in that... in that connection, is it any part of your case... perhaps it is not... but is it any part of your case that the invalidity of this scheme is triggered by the fact that it, in effect, piggy-backs off a regional milk-pricing scheme?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1112.812,1124.011,"Well, we do think, Your Honor, that it's clear that the purpose, of course, of the Federal order system is to establish a minimum price to be paid to farmers in that region."
1993.93-141,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1128.742,1131.935,"Not only does it upset, but it... it uses it as a formula, as a base."
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1131.935,1133.394,--Yes--
1993.93-141,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1133.394,1135.567,And that seems to me somewhat suspect.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1135.567,1136.128,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1144.904,1155.75,"Would you say the same about a State income tax law which used the Federal income tax return as the form, and then computed the State income tax on the basis of that?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1155.75,1156.862,"No, Your Honor, I don't think so."
1993.93-141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1158.292,1158.843,What's the difference?
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1158.843,1168.718,"--Well, I don't think this... because this is a system devised to upset the competitive relationship between farmers in Massachusetts and in other States--"
1993.93-141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1168.718,1172.711,Are you saying that it's preempted by the Federal system?
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1172.711,1173.102,"--No, Your Honor."
1993.93-141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1175.133,1177.657,"Well, then, what is your response to Justice Kennedy?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1186.75,1188.633,I think that's probably a fair way to put it.
1993.93-141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1188.633,1189.364,"Well, what does that mean?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1189.364,1203.242,"Well, what it means is that it makes clear... makes perfectly clear what the State of Massachusetts is up to... namely, they are not happy with the minimum price that their farmers receive under the Federal Government system."
1993.93-141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1215.04,1217.481,"But it does no more than perhaps show motive, is that what you're saying?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1217.481,1220.313,"--Well, it shows motive, plus it ensures the effect."
1993.93-141,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1236.103,1241.387,"So, without the Federal minimum, it would just be a less-efficient mechanism of doing what it's doing, for the State to do what it's doing?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1241.387,1243.738,"Well, a State could come up with the same--"
1993.93-141,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1243.738,1248.312,"The... the Federal minimum gives the scheme a great potency, which it would not otherwise have--"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1248.312,1248.931,"--Yes, that... that's--"
1993.93-141,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1248.931,1251.064,"--A potent effect on the market, which it would not otherwise have?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1251.064,1251.404,--That's correct.
1993.93-141,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1336.73,1340.851,It was not clear to me why you have the motive to prefer one truck over the other.
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1340.851,1346.315,"Your Honor, we would... what... what we are losing here is two things."
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1450.613,1455.386,"But you... you acknowledge that they... you acknowledge that that's perfectly okay, so long as they do it by a general subsidy."
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1465.093,1465.594,It... it is a--
1993.93-141,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.594,1468.065,"So, you're just complaining about the tax, really?"
1993.93-141,0,41957,steven_j_rosenbaum,,1468.065,1469.577,"--No, I believe it's more than that, Your Honor."
1993.93-141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1492.762,1495.153,"Very well, Mr. Rosenbaum."
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,1496.602,1498.975,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1600.312,1604.546,"You're saying Massachusetts is not doing anything worse than what the Federal Government is doing, right?"
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,1604.546,1605.886,"I'm sure that's true, Your Honor."
1993.93-141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1605.886,1612.591,The same thing... the Federal Government just... just isn't giving enough of a subsidy to inefficient producers to carry the Massachusetts people.
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,1614.854,1619.657,"Well, we believe that the Federal system allows us the flexibility to do this."
1993.93-141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1629.614,1633.064,The theory of the Commerce Clause is not that you can't subsidize inefficiency.
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,1646.154,1651.226,"Well, I disagree with it to the extent we are talking about subsidies, Your Honor."
1993.93-141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1667.878,1673.192,"So, what about the sales tax hypothetical that your... your colleague put to us?"
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,1683.337,1685.03,If we're talking about a true rebate.
1993.93-141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1685.03,1685.49,Okay.
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,1693.585,1696.156,"Well, it's not because we call it a subsidy."
1993.93-141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1748.791,1752.464,I don't know what you mean when you say there's no chance that they're going to pass it along.
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,1753.793,1757.866,"Well, the farmer is greatly restricted in reducing price."
1993.93-141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1772.986,1777.679,"He doesn't use it to reduce price, he uses it to increase sales."
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,1788.418,1792.86,"Well, we believe that the farmer is able to survive because of this."
1993.93-141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.401,1794.842,I have no doubt about that.
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,1794.842,1795.109,--Excuse me?
1993.93-141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1795.109,1796.301,I have no doubt about that.
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,1800.804,1806.957,"Well, yes, but the dormant Commerce Clause does not enact free market principles."
1993.93-141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1837.759,1845.523,"You're saying that the dormant Commerce Clause, Mr. Wilkins, does not enact Herbert Spencer's social status?"
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,1845.523,1847.826,"I think that would be a good way to put it, Your Honor, yes."
1993.93-141,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1866.348,1886.7,"Well, on that point... and I'm not sure it determines anything under the Commerce Clause... but I assume that if the proposition had to go before the legislature every year, of whether the State should be paying out so much cash to dairy farmers, that might be tough sledding."
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,1909.447,1915.03,"Well, it would be an easy sell, but only because we would have misrepresented what we are doing."
1993.93-141,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1934.763,1948.921,"Yes, but the practical effect here is that 90 percent is coming from out of State, and... and milk sold from out of State is contributing the bulk of the money that's being recycled in-state to local farmers."
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,1948.921,1950.914,"--We don't view it that way, Your Honor."
1993.93-141,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1965.974,1969.354,"Well, if I were a legislator up there, I think I'd found a way."
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,1969.354,1972.647,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't... I don't think it would be accurate."
1993.93-141,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2011.122,2035.498,"And do you think that we could, consistent with our precedence, write in this opinion that any State that wishes to impose a discriminatory tax may do so by imposing a neutral tax and then rebating all in-state payors their share of that tax?"
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,2035.498,2036.51,"No, I do not, Your Honor."
1993.93-141,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2036.51,2038.109,Why is this case any different?
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,2038.109,2039.782,Because this is not a rebate.
1993.93-141,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2054.561,2058.185,Does formalism count... would formalism count for everything here--
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,2058.185,2059.454,"It doesn't count for everything, Your Honor."
1993.93-141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.679,2448.67,--I didn't understand it to be that.
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,2457.957,2459.629,Perhaps that's their argument.
1993.93-141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2479.943,2497.734,"I hate to... maybe you've answered this, but you're saying that if they have a trust fund which is supported entirely by revenues from members of an industry, both in-state and out of State, and then the proceeds of the trust fund are distributed entirely to the in-state members of the industry, that that's strictly a matter of State business?"
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,2497.734,2506.59,"If the people who receive the funds are at the same level of competition, if they're all... if they're in competition with each other, I think that would be unlawful."
1993.93-141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2506.59,2506.981,Oh.
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,2506.981,2524.752,"If they are not in competition, if they're at a different level of the industry, particularly here, where there are many reasons why there is... not even a reason... no basis for reaching a pass-through question, then there is in fact no protectionism, because competitors are not being treated unalike, except... except--"
1993.93-141,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2524.752,2533.176,"Well, what... what if there is a pass-through, and the effect is to let the Massachusetts dairy farmers sell their milk more cheaply than out-of-staters?"
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,2539.989,2544.104,"--Well, ultimately, a subsidy could have that effect."
1993.93-141,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2545.496,2549.486,"And if it did, what's the result?"
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,2549.486,2553.911,"--Well, this... this gets into, I think, what is a very knotty area."
1993.93-141,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2581.046,2584.809,"Well, why do you say that inquiry isn't required here?"
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,2584.809,2596.066,"Well, because we never get to the point of the pass-through, given the Federal minimum price, given the farmers' need to dig themselves out from... from debt and to invest."
1993.93-141,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2596.647,2604.254,You don't think there are local dairy farmers in Massachusetts that can lower their prices because of this subsidy?
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,2604.254,2608.014,"--Certainly, they can't do it significantly because of the Federal minimum price."
1993.93-141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2636.134,2648.002,"But you do admit, Mr. Wilkins, indeed, it's the whole purpose of the law that some dairy... some dairy farmers in Massachusetts stay in business, who otherwise wouldn't be able to stay in business?"
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,2648.002,2649.311,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1993.93-141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2649.311,2654.045,"And that deprives out-of-state farmers of an opportunity to sell more milk, doesn't it?"
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,2654.045,2656.797,"Not necessarily, Your Honor, given the--"
1993.93-141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2656.797,2657.198,It doesn't?
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,2657.198,2657.639,"--Well, no."
1993.93-141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2658.477,2661.92,"You mean when a dairy farmer goes out of business in Massachusetts, the people of Massachusetts stop drinking as much milk?"
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,2661.92,2662.651,No.
1993.93-141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2675.759,2680.213,It doesn't seem to me it makes any difference whether they can raise their price or not raise their price.
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,2693.53,2703.848,"--Well, we're... to the extent we keep people in business, we're only affecting opportunities by reason of paying a subsidy, by reason of our spending program, which is... is therefore not a--"
1993.93-141,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2703.848,2704.709,That's... that's a different argument.
1993.93-141,1,21695,douglas_h_wilkins,,2708.821,2710.163,"--That is a different argument, yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2896.846,2899.128,"Thank you, Mr. Wilkins."
