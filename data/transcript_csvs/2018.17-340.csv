2018.17-340,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.32,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-340, New Prime versus Oliveira. Mr. Boutrous."
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,7.32,19.04,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The First Circuit held that independent contractor agreements are contracts of employment and, therefore, they were exempt from the Federal Arbitration Act."
2018.17-340,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,68.44,89.72,"How about the word ""work"" -- ""worker"" in the very clause? Shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce. Congress didn't use the word ""employees"" if it meant employees."
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,93.44,93.6,But it --
2018.17-340,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,93.6,98.48,"Shouldn't that inform what it meant by ""contract of employment""?"
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,98.48,99.52,"I think it does, Your Honor."
2018.17-340,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,111.08,111.24,No.
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,120.8,128.12,"It's -- Your Honor, it's a residual clause that follows contracts of employment of any other class of worker."
2018.17-340,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,128.12,134.12,"But what we're trying to decide is what employment -- ""contract of employment"" means."
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,145.24,160.92,"Well, Your Honor, I think, as we have -- have argued, the fact that the railway -- railroad employees is also -- is mentioned right before that, seamen, which are traditionally common law master-servant employees, demonstrates the --"
2018.17-340,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,160.92,177.8,"Well, except your adversary has pointed out that under the Seamen Act, it covered people who were not contracts of -- seamen are not just people who are employees; it also is the tugboat operator who's on the boat guiding it."
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,181.36,197.96,"But Congress, just five years earlier in the Jones Act, defined seamen under the Jones Act as actions in the course of their employment, and as employees, this Court's Chandris decision also uses the common law definition of substantial connection."
2018.17-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,197.96,225.52,"What -- what do you make of the other side that says in the seamen category, the -- the ship's surgeon, the pilot qualify as seamen who are outside the Federal Arbitration Act, even though they're independent contractors, not common law employees?"
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,225.52,229.72,"Justice Ginsburg, I think the -- the physician example is a good one."
2018.17-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,268.76,272.76,More narrow in the sense that it was limited to transportation workers?
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,272.76,276.72,"In -- in that case, yes, Your Honor, that was -- that was the issue."
2018.17-340,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,312.08,332.28,"Well, you keep in your brief -- and the other side raises this concern -- you -- you quickly shift the discussion of -- of contracts of employment to whether or not there's an employee/employer relationship. And simply because someone would be considered or not considered an employee doesn't necessarily answer the question of whether it's a contract of employment."
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,350.24,383.04,"It's absolutely true, Your Honor, there are many different definitions of employment out there, but as I said, the Court's decision in National Mutual Insurance Company versus Darden, which we've cited, and in the Community -- Community for Creative Non-violence versus Reid case, which Darden cites, says that Congress -- we're going to assume that when Congress uses ""employee"" in Darden but in Reid the Court used ""employment"" and said when those terms are used by Congress, we -- we -- we assume Congress intended for the ordinary terms to be used. And here --"
2018.17-340,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,383.04,399.0,"Except the problem is that we don't really assume that because the other side has prevented us -- presented us with multiple cases, many of them in which we've used ""contract of employment"" to mean employees and independent contractors. It's all contextual, isn't it?"
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,399.0,409.2,"Not really, Your Honor. Most of the cases, the vast -- I'll give them this: They did a -- they did a good job of cataloguing haphazard, in passing, uses of ""contract of employment"" where it wasn't an issue."
2018.17-340,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,416.6,444.52,"Well, what do we do about the fact that, less haphazardly, your -- your colleague on the other side has documented that back in 1925, which is when the statute was enacted, and I think you'd agree that we have to interpret it as a reasonable reader would have at that time, didn't necessarily distinguish between independent contractors and employees with the degree of care that the law has subsequently come to use. And maybe even that your own client doesn't use."
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,468.6,470.2,"A couple things, Justice Gorsuch."
2018.17-340,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,505.16,507.48,But other treatises didn't?
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,507.48,508.92,"We cited another treatise, Your Honor."
2018.17-340,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,508.92,516.04,But other -- you're not -- you're not denying other treatises -- other treatises didn't treat them differently?
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,516.04,521.6,"Well, they didn't really -- to the extent they addressed the issue, the distinction was well established, Your Honor."
2018.17-340,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,584.36,587.84,Can you address the gateway question? Who decides this?
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,587.84,605.88,"Your Honor, we believe that the Court's cases like Rent-A-Center and First Options and that talk about whether you have a valid delegation clause, in the first instance, the issue goes to the arbitrator because the parties agree to -- to arbitrate issues concerning what's arbitrable."
2018.17-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,631.72,677.76,"But if Section 1 puts an entire category, even if you say it's a narrow category, outside the arbitration act entirely, it's exempt from the Federal Arbitration Act, then how can you use the arbitration act? The delegation clause would never come into play because agreements that fit the description, contracts of employment, they're outside the Federal Arbitration Act. That can't -- you can't use the Act to enforce any arbitration."
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,677.76,680.2,"Yes, Your Honor, that -- that's Respondent's argument."
2018.17-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,733.08,743.12,"I thought the -- the trial handler was supposed to determine whether this was an independent contractor and, therefore, outside the Section 1 exemption?"
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,743.12,747.16,"Exactly, Your Honor. And -- and our point is that's the really merits of the case."
2018.17-340,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,771.96,804.6,"Mr. Boutrous, you -- you moved nicely to the merits, but just so we haven't ignored where we've moved so quickly in response to Justice Ginsburg's question, and I share the same concern, so perhaps you can help me. Before a court can do anything, issue an order under Section 4 compelling arbitration, that's what you want, is an order from the district court compelling arbitration, I would have thought it would have had to satisfy itself that it had the power to issue such an order. And Section 1 has this carve-out."
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,822.44,834.88,"I -- I -- I think, Your Honor, I have to say that is another analogy. And it's -- and it's one that -- it's another way the Court could go. But, here, the -- the presumption's kind of been flipped on us."
2018.17-340,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,921.92,929.96,"Now, but just so you -- saying that the arbitrator will decide arbitrability, there are different degrees of arbitrability."
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,959.68,960.8,"It is a different thing, Your Honor."
2018.17-340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,988.6,1004.52,"Well, the -- the reason that it's different is that when you decide whether parties have agreed to arbitrate arbitrability, is there an arbitration clause or not, you're looking to their intent in a contract document."
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1089.64,1089.88,Yes.
2018.17-340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1089.88,1092.76,"It's hard to do with Circuit City, I grant you."
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1093.48,1095.16,"I was about to say that, Your Honor."
2018.17-340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1095.16,1096.4,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course."
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1105.84,1111.96,"Well, Your Honor, and I do think if we look at the -- the dissent in Circuit City, was making the point that this was about labor statutes."
2018.17-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1128.76,1176.88,"What about the argument that the independent contractor status here was a sham, that it was a label rigged to make this person appear on the face, as you said, an independent contractor when, in fact, the -- the -- New Prime calls all the shots, the -- whether you label this driver an independent contractor or an employee, he is subject to New Prime's control as to a lot more than just the result of the work?"
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1176.88,1178.16,"Yeah, Justice Ginsburg --"
2018.17-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1178.16,1188.44,"That argument, that this person, this is a -- a phony label and, in fact, this person is an employee, not an independent contractor?"
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1188.44,1190.84,"We disagree, obviously, on the merits."
2018.17-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1215.04,1230.36,"But he was told it's your -- he was -- he was told by New Prime's representative, you could be one or the other, but it's to your benefit if you elect the independent contractor format."
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1230.36,1232.6,"But -- yes, Your Honor, that's what he alleges."
2018.17-340,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1277.64,1278.08,On this --
2018.17-340,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1278.08,1281.72,"Counsel, did I understand -- I've been pondering your answer to the question I asked a while ago."
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1286.32,1310.24,"Your Honor, we -- we think that the -- that there's a -- as we've argued, that this falls within Rent-A-Center, maybe one step beyond, but if the Court were to rule that independent contractor agreements are not contracts of employment, but we need a court, either this Court or the district court to decide that, as I said, we trust courts too to make that determination."
2018.17-340,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1310.24,1311.0,"Well, I must have missed it."
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1319.04,1320.6,That -- that is the first question presented.
2018.17-340,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1368.36,1398.08,"Is there any other area of law where we take the party's label, ""employee"" versus ""independent contractor,"" and give it binding effect? I -- I -- I thought, for virtually every other purpose in tax law, labor law -- I just don't know another area where we take the form of the contract as dispositive of a legal issue, of whether you're an employee or an independent contractor?"
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1398.08,1400.2,"Your Honor, I -- I -- I can't think of one."
2018.17-340,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1424.24,1434.6,But that only gets you as far as letting the arbitrator decide whether the arbitrability clause controls.
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1438.36,1439.72,"But -- but, Your Honor, in --"
2018.17-340,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1439.72,1446.08,"-- to the merits question, whether he was an employee or an independent contractor entitled to more pay or not."
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1446.08,1448.36,"And -- and, Your Honor, I -- I hear what you're saying."
2018.17-340,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1467.56,1469.4,I don't want to argue the merits.
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1473.64,1473.76,Yes.
2018.17-340,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1473.76,1474.56,You argued to the court --
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1474.56,1475.08,Yes.
2018.17-340,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1475.08,1477.52,"-- and lost on that, on at least the arbitrability."
2018.17-340,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1477.52,1477.84,Yes.
2018.17-340,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1514.32,1524.12,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Bennett."
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,1524.12,1534.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It's black-letter law that statutes are interpreted according to their ordinary, common meaning, not now but at the time they were passed."
2018.17-340,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1627.56,1650.4,"Does the concept of a -- a contract of employment involving a class of workers -- and Justice Sotomayor focused on the term ""workers"" -- a class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce, apply to all independent contractors who are engaged to perform some type of work?"
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,1650.4,1655.8,It would apply to all independent contractors who are engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.
2018.17-340,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1670.68,1679.16,So anybody who's involved? It doesn't -- there are no distinctions among the -- the types of independent contractors who might be covered?
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,1679.16,1679.92,"No, Your Honor."
2018.17-340,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1683.04,1686.16,For that -- but anybody who does work is a worker?
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,1686.16,1686.6,Correct.
2018.17-340,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1749.56,1751.76,May I -- may I go back to Justice Alito's question --
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,1751.76,1751.88,Sure.
2018.17-340,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1751.88,1752.96,-- and just give you a hypothetical --
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,1752.96,1753.16,Sure.
2018.17-340,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1753.16,1769.64,-- and say whether your argument includes this too? So suppose that Amazon contracts with FedEx or UPS to ship all its products and they want to send their disputes to arbitration. Does that fall within the Act or does that fall within this exemption?
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,1769.64,1771.08,It would not fall within the exemption.
2018.17-340,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1792.44,1793.0,So -- so --
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,1793.0,1793.2,Sorry.
2018.17-340,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1793.2,1794.6,-- just give me a little bit more on that.
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,1794.6,1794.88,Sure.
2018.17-340,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1794.88,1800.64,"In -- in every case, we have to figure out whether a worker is involved or a company is involved?"
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,1800.64,1801.36,That's correct.
2018.17-340,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2054.2,2054.56,But what of the --
2018.17-340,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2054.56,2056.64,"Well, I understand -- Justice, please."
2018.17-340,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2056.64,2074.36,"What of the Petitioner's argument that, forget about the FAA, that a court has inherent authority to stay a proceeding pending utilization of an alternate dispute resolution mechanism chosen by the parties?"
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,2074.36,2082.88,"Your Honor, as this Court has repeatedly explained, courts have a duty to exercise the jurisdiction that Congress has granted them."
2018.17-340,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2118.04,2121.88,"Well, I understand your friend on the other side not to care about that."
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,2122.2,2127.96,"That -- that is how I understood the argument as well, that's correct. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,2127.96,2130.52,And I just want to -- yes?
2018.17-340,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2130.52,2155.52,"Well, while we have you here, you -- you -- in response to Justice Alito and Justice Kagan, you raised a very interesting point about the difference between workers and companies. And similar to the kind of question we have here presented between employees and independent contractors, there are going to be fact issues in either circumstance where a district court's going to have to sort them out. Courts disagree over how summary those procedures should be."
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,2186.96,2206.92,"Your Honor, at first blush, you could look at the contract, and it would only require factual -- any sort of factual inquiry, if there was a dispute about it, you know, say the contract was a subterfuge or the contract doesn't say anything at all. And in the few cases where this has come up, I believe courts have resolved it largely on declarations."
2018.17-340,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2226.84,2238.52,"So is it safe to say that we have at least common ground on one thing, maybe a few things today, but at least on this, that the proceedings may not be limited to the form of the document before us but should be summary in nature?"
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,2238.52,2240.0,"Yes, I agree with that, Your Honor."
2018.17-340,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2241.0,2248.16,"What do you mean by -- what do you mean by ""a company""?"
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,2248.16,2250.92,I mean anything that is not a real person.
2018.17-340,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2254.56,2256.0,A corporation would be a company?
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,2256.0,2256.16,Sure.
2018.17-340,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2256.16,2258.24,What if it's a sole proprietorship?
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,2258.24,2273.84,"Then the question would be what did the parties contemplate, that the person who owns the proprietorship would perform the work himself? And if that's true, then it would be an agreement to perform work of a transportation worker. If that's not true --"
2018.17-340,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2273.84,2292.88,"So some independent -- I thought you said all independent contractors would fall within this, provided that they were engaged in foreign or interstate commerce in the sense relevant under the FAA. But now I think you're -- are you modifying that? So are you modifying that?"
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,2292.88,2295.44,"Yes, Your Honor, I'm sorry, I misunderstood the initial question."
2018.17-340,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2305.72,2313.92,"So, if they're businesses, what does that mean? I mean, I've got you on corporations, but beyond that, are we getting into a difficult area?"

2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,2321.64,2353.52,"I think it's easiest to approach the question from the other direction, which is to say, was this -- did the parties contemplate that the person with whom they agreed would personally perform the work? And, if so, then it would be an agreement to perform work with a transportation worker. If the parties didn't contemplate that the person who agreed to do the work would personally do it, then it wouldn't fall within the exemption. And so we don't need to decide the exact definition of business; solely just is this an agreement for someone who is engaged in commerce to personally perform the work."
2018.17-340,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2353.52,2357.24,But to take one -- an opposite extreme from UPS or FedEx --
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,2357.24,2357.52,Sure.
2018.17-340,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2357.52,2371.28,"-- you know, suppose it's like Joe Smith Truckers, and Joe Smith Truckers is Joe Smith and his brother, and -- and the contract was with Joe Smith workers, and he says ""my brother will do the work."""
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,2371.28,2382.24,"So, if -- if the parties contemplated that the brother would do the work -- if the brother -- if the brother is the one suing, he's likely not bound by the arbitration agreement at all because he won't have been the one to sign it."
2018.17-340,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2421.24,2441.28,"It sort of sounds like what you're saying is that if the person is a real independent contractor, then the person is outside of -- is -- is outside of the exemption, but if the -- if the entity is not a real independent contractor, which is your argument here regarding Mr. Oliveira, it's different."
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,2441.28,2468.16,"I -- I'm saying if there are individual workers who are independent contractors, and we know there were such workers in 1925 as now, there are individuals who are independent contractors, even if they're bona fide independent contractors, they would be covered within the scope of the exemption. What I'm saying is if there's an agreement that's not of a specific person, a worker, to perform work, then they're outside the scope. And I want to quickly address one point that Prime said."
2018.17-340,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2531.76,2567.68,"Suppose you win on the issue of arbitrability, the court says ""I'm going to decide whether the exemption applies,"" but then you lose on the issue of the interpretation of the exemption, the court says ""it doesn't apply to an independent contractor, Mr. Oliveira's an independent contractor; therefore, I'm going to order arbitration."" Would the arbitrator then be bound by the determination that he is an independent contractor for purposes of applying the Fair Labor Standards Act?"
2018.17-340,1,63035,jennifer_d_bennett,,2567.68,2569.64,"No, Your Honor, for two reasons."

2018.17-340,2,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,2657.36,2676.28,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to start by saying we agree with Mr. Oliveira's position that a determination that this was an independent contractor agreement and, therefore, could go to arbitration would not bind the arbitrator. Then we'd go to the merits. Since counsel left off with the language and history of the statute, let me just go back to the statute."
2018.17-340,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2748.76,2756.24,"Was it Coppage v. Kansas, shall not join a union? Was that the contract at issue?"

2018.17-340,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2778.88,2789.68,"But the kind of contract that was involved in Coppage v. Kansas was outlawed by the -- the National Labor Relations Act, wasn't it?"
2018.17-340,2,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,2789.68,2794.08,"Your Honor, the -- I don't know, Your Honor, on that point, but --"
2018.17-340,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2794.08,2797.04,Or Norris-LaGuardia before that?
2018.17-340,2,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,2797.04,2813.56,"But -- but the -- the -- the reason we cite it, Your Honor, is that it was well established what a contract of employment was. And -- and -- and the -- the other point I wanted to make was on the alternative dispute resolution provisions that Circuit City talked about."
