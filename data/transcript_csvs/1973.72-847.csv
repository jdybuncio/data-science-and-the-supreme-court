1973.72-847,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,52.245,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-847, Memorial Hospital against Maricopa County."
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,57.091,60.296,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,201.997,206.656,"Mrs. Schroeder, is Memorial, as I know, it’s nonprofit, is it a private hospital or public?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,206.656,207.118,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,207.118,207.725,Right.
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,207.725,216.985,And I’m here representing Mr. Evaro and that hospital because the private hospitals in Arizona have a very real concern in the enforcement of the statute.
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,216.985,221.251,"And the other case involved Maricopa County Hospital, doesn’t it?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,221.251,221.563,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,221.563,223.257,And that’s a public hospital?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,223.257,227.869,"That is the county hospital operated at public expense, yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-847,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,227.869,242.355,"Mr. Schroeder, I suppose what you’re saying there is that if the county can't take this indigent patient on, then the private, not for profit hospital has to because he’s not going to be denied health care?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,242.355,242.863,That’s true.
1973.72-847,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,260.723,262.172,This is a county measure.
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,274.672,275.119,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-847,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,279.367,280.146,He has to be a resident.
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,280.146,290.288,"He has to be a resident of the county, so that it bars all those like Mr. Evaro who travel from one State to another as well as those who move within the State of Arizona."
1973.72-847,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,302.76,303.682,May I just ask one more question about Memorial?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,303.682,305.943,Yes.
1973.72-847,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,305.943,312.961,"If in fact he had been taken in, the expense of his care would not have been born by the county, would it?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,312.961,326.981,"Your Honor, the statute does provide that if the county is unable to provide care at the county hospital, that it can reimburse private hospitals, provided that they meet the residence requirement."
1973.72-847,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,341.351,344.689,"For purposes of this case, let me see if I get it clearly."
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,354.145,359.99,"Well, it could’ve been accepted at the county hospital because he wasn’t eligible for treatment at county expense."
1973.72-847,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,359.99,371.176,"But when the private hospital gets into the picture, it’s only as a surrogate for the county, on your theory, is it not so?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,371.176,385.342,"Well, what happened here, Mr. Chief Justice is that because he did not meet the residence requirement, the private hospital which cared for him was not entitled to reimbursement by the county."
1973.72-847,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,385.648,389.228,And he first applied to get into a county hospital?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,389.228,400.594,"No, he was referred to the private hospital, but had he gone to the county hospital, the county hospital would’ve told him that unless you can pay your bills, you can't -- we can't treat you here And he would have to go elsewhere."
1973.72-847,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,400.594,406.008,All you’re trying to show is that it’s just as if he applied to the county hospital and then turned down?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,406.008,412.072,"Yes, except that it happened, so he went to a private hospital which did give him treatment at considerable expense."
1973.72-847,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,412.072,417.682,"Well, of course, all these questions were dressed up as a question of state action?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,417.682,426.814,"But, Your Honor, this -- I don’t think there can be a serious question here with the statute imposing this requirement and enforced in this manner."
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,448.524,452.03,"Well, I gather there’s no question, but for the residence requirement --"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,452.03,452.505,There is no question.
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,452.505,454.651,-- this hospital would have been reimbursed --
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,454.651,455.036,That is correct.
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,455.036,458.12,-- by the county for the services given?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,458.12,459.22,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1973.72-847,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,464.607,470.665,"And in that -- in doing that, it would be acting in effect as an agent or surrogate to the State, that’s your theory?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,470.665,471.519,Yes.
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,613.003,621.69,"But it recognizes also that there’s a difference that Shapiro dealt with travel between states, and this is travel within the state between counties, isn’t it?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,621.69,630.336,"Well, the restriction here is broader than the restriction in Shapiro because it hits at both travel within states and travel from one State to another."
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,633.173,633.972,Intrastate?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,633.972,635.322,"Interstate, Your Honor."
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,636.023,637.265,"Oh, I see."
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,637.265,640.349,-- the appellant here moved from New Mexico to Arizona.
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,640.349,642.898,"I guess, you just said that earlier."
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,642.898,662.655,"Now, I think that the difference -- that the fundamental importance of medical care can be seen in the fact that while Congress was willing to tolerate a year residence requirements in the area of cash assistance, it required that they could not stand in the area of medical care."
1973.72-847,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,722.96,741.556,"Mrs. Schroeder, could Maricopa County impose a simple residence or domicile requirement so as to exclude a transient from coming at the Maricopa County Hospital and getting non-emergency medical care, say for pre-existing hernia?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,741.556,744.59,"Your Honor, that is not this case --"
1973.72-847,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,744.59,745.685,I realize that.
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,745.685,755.278,"The similar restriction, distinction, classification among residence based on the time that they’ve been there would not be present."
1973.72-847,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,763.326,768.82,"Under your theory of the law, on which side would that fall?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,768.82,778.666,"Well, the -- our position is that we cannot distinguish as between residents based on the length of time that they have resided."
1973.72-847,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,788.907,795.672,"And how do you distinguish Starns against Malkerson, a Minnesota resident tuition case?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,795.672,811.788,"Well, Your Honor, that case and there have been several others that have determined that in the area of tuition for higher education that we’re dealing with fundamentally different thing."
1973.72-847,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,840.23,844.025,"Well, could we translate that into a medical arena."
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,861.166,873.669,That form of discrimination as between residents based solely on the fact that they just moved would be discriminatory and would have to be -- there would have to be a compelling reason for having it.
1973.72-847,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,873.669,882.289,"But of course, in Starns, they required a one year residency requirement before you could get non -- before you get resident tuition at Minnesota."
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,887.137,887.526,Pardon me?
1973.72-847,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,891.025,892.341,Yes.
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,892.341,928.432,"Certainly, we recognize, this Court has affirmed Starns but let me, if I may, simply quote to you from what the Starns opinion itself says which is that, in distinguishing the area of fundamental necessities, welfare, medical care from hospital to -- from tuition, it says that, “Shapiro involved the immediate and pressing need for preservation of life and health for persons unable to live without public assistance.”"
1973.72-847,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,941.383,944.968,But do you think it was a matter of distinction or of emphasis?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,965.628,968.832,"In this particular area, it’s difficult to think of one."
1973.72-847,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1071.889,1080.152,"Well, are you saying that carcinoma is necessarily always an emergency case?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1080.152,1087.012,"No, I’m saying within this statute, it is not an emergency and therefore care is denied."
1973.72-847,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1087.012,1090.974,"Well then, are you saying that carcinoma is always a nonemergency case?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1090.974,1098.068,"No, I am -- I don’t know for what purpose this emergency exception was put in."
1973.72-847,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1107.842,1112.216,"Normally, that would be a medical determination, is it not?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1112.216,1118.125,It is a medical determination but it -- but it’s not always made by a medical doctor.
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1149.828,1152.497,"Mrs. Schroeder, what was the statute in Vaughan?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1152.497,1153.287,"What was, I’m sorry?"
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1153.287,1155.36,What was the statute in Vaughan?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1160.434,1162.469,"That was a -- yes, a mental health."
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1162.469,1164.068,Was that a residence requirement?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1164.068,1165.286,"Yes, it was."
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1175.647,1179.124,We affirmed that that was unconstitutional?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1179.124,1181.589,"Yes, you affirmed the District Court’s decision that that was unconstitutional."
1973.72-847,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1181.589,1183.469,Do you feel that’s rather close to this?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1183.469,1184.188,I certainly do.
1973.72-847,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1193.331,1197.824,Did the three-judge Court on this statute rely on the laws?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1197.824,1200.037,They went the other way around.
1973.72-847,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1215.953,1217.88,So this would have been a fortiori case?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1217.88,1218.387,Yes.
1973.72-847,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.387,1223.65,"Well, Valenciano, the Court in Valenciano ended in the same court, the same three judges?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1223.65,1224.546,No.
1973.72-847,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.546,1225.487,A single judge?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1225.487,1231.606,It was a single judge and who get in the mental health case and he did not participate in the Valenciano case.
1973.72-847,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1231.606,1235.68,Which is it?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1235.68,1243.964,The Court has raised the question of interstate versus intrastate travel.
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1243.964,1247.716,"Vaughan was at three-judge court below, wasn’t it?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1254.51,1255.61,[Voice Overlap] Pardon me?
1973.72-847,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1256.19,1257.467,But it was a different Court though?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1257.467,1258.804,"It was a different Court, yes."
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1260.354,1261.286,Yes.
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1261.286,1264.776,I -- there we have two Three-judge Court decisions.
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1295.682,1298.872,"Well, I take it, if this were county to county case, you would still be here?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1298.872,1303.664,"Yes, we certainly would and we point out that in Dunn versus Blumstein, the voting rights case."
1973.72-847,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1313.81,1322.907,"Well, I suppose this all could have read on impeding interstate travel?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1322.907,1324.666,The local residence requirement?
1973.72-847,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1324.666,1325.128,Yes.
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1330.222,1331.531,So that’s exactly what we have here.
1973.72-847,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1333.614,1338.839,"Well I know, I understand that, but so the case is from intrastate travel case?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1338.839,1339.354,"No, it is not."
1973.72-847,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1339.354,1340.161,Not at all?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1340.161,1340.545,No.
1973.72-847,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1340.545,1341.597,Necessarily?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1341.597,1343.254,"No, it is not."
1973.72-847,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1389.818,1391.944,These funds -- are these funds county funds exclusively?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1391.944,1393.63,"Yes, they are."
1973.72-847,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1393.63,1394.883,None of them State funds?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1394.883,1400.015,"I can't tell you, Your Honor, whether there are no State funds but they are principally raised by county revenues [Voice Overlap]."
1973.72-847,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1400.015,1406.15,[Voice Overlap] I suppose the State Court was concerned with the inter-county relationships --
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1406.15,1409.088,"That may have been what the concern was. Yes, but the effect of the statute --"
1973.72-847,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1409.088,1412.029,Maricopa County has about half the population of the State?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1412.029,1413.48,That’s correct.
1973.72-847,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1413.48,1415.198,About a million people or more in Maricopa County?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1415.198,1416.363,Approximately a million.
1973.72-847,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1433.324,1436.743,Some of the -- how many counties in Arizona is there?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1436.743,1437.155,Ten.
1973.72-847,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1437.155,1437.505,Fourteen.
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1437.505,1438.994,Fourteen.
1973.72-847,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1438.994,1440.986,Are there any that don’t have any hospital?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1440.986,1441.753,"Yes, there are."
1973.72-847,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1464.033,1478.651,"Mrs. Schroeder, I take it from what you just say that if the State is not completely disabled from burdening the right to travel, but it depends largely on what interest it advances for doing so?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1478.651,1480.289,Yes.
1973.72-847,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1480.289,1489.67,But then -- and the nature of your argument then is based on travel rights stated in Shapiro and it isn’t an Equal Protection claim?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1489.67,1515.686,"Well, I think that the two have to be read together to a certain extent because in Shapiro, the Court said that because the classification was such that it discriminated against those who had only recently come into the State as opposed to those who have been there longer that that kind of a classification could be justified only on a basis of a compelling interest."
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1534.534,1540.904,"Mrs. Schroeder, suppose we have a non-indigent, not an indigent here, would you still be here?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1540.904,1542.253,If we had a non-indigent?
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1542.253,1546.176,A non-indigent.
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1546.176,1551.588,"Under the -- they would not be seeking a medical care, I presume."
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1551.588,1558.75,I expect this – does the statute preclude the county from taking a non-indigent?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1558.75,1567.356,"We are here because the statute classifies indigents into two categories, those who have been in the State more than a year and those who have been in the State less than year."
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1567.356,1568.099,"Yes, but how about someone --"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1568.099,1569.432,We would be here on a different case.
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1569.514,1574.203,Aren’t state facilities available to non-indigents at all?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1578.605,1580.27,The county hospital?
1973.72-847,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1585.647,1596.513,"You mean, if I came -- if I haven’t been a resident of Arizona for a certain length of time, if I could pay, I could get into the county hospital, say for some special treatment?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1596.513,1598.687,I’m not -- I believe that that is true.
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1620.624,1630.391,"Well, I gather looking at the statute on its face, this applies, this residence requirement apparently applies only to an indigent because --"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1630.391,1630.884,Yes.
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1641.162,1644.504,"Well, the answer to our question is to the non-indigent, you wouldn’t be here under the statute?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1644.504,1645.725,We wouldn’t be here on this case.
1973.72-847,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1646.716,1649.121,May I ask you one question to see just how far this goes.
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1671.932,1684.924,"Mr. Chief Justice, the answer has to be that if a person moves to the State of Arizona, makes that his residence then he cannot be denied the care simply because he only recently moved."
1973.72-847,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1706.61,1716.26,"In the Chief Justice’s hypothesis, Mrs. Schroeder, I take it that perhaps one might assume if the man lived in Toronto, that he was not a citizen of the United States, would that make any difference?"
1973.72-847,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1716.26,1721.748,Or would it make a difference if he were a resident of the State of Washington?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1721.748,1730.522,"As this statute is drawn, I believe that it is not limited to people who come from outside of the United States to the United States."
1973.72-847,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1730.522,1733.782,But would it make any difference for the man’s constitutional rights?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1744.319,1748.482,"No, that right wouldn’t extend."
1973.72-847,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1764.589,1767.154,"Well, if Mr. -- going back to my hypothetical."
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1777.133,1778.094,No.
1973.72-847,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1778.094,1779.189,You wouldn’t at all.
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1786.544,1791.239,"Well, I don’t have to answer in this case because we have a resident."
1973.72-847,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1814.121,1820.026,But then you client is willing to take on these out of State indigents without complain?
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1820.026,1825.815,"Well, there are problems in treating indigents."
1973.72-847,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1843.679,1847.216,"Well, doesn’t that also impinge upon the right to travel?"
1973.72-847,0,36674,mary_m_schroeder,,1847.216,1848.426,"Yes, it does."
1973.72-847,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1929.547,1930.945,Mr. Carter.
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,1930.945,1934.151,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.72-847,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2046.526,2058.322,"As opposed to -- Mr. Carter, well, do you agree with this argument, would we have to depart or retreat from something they serve in Shapiro?"
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2058.322,2068.938,"No, Your Honor, I don’t believe that that is necessary because as I read Shapiro, you said that there must be a compelling State interest to justify the imposition of a penalty."
1973.72-847,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2114.18,2121.619,You are however conceding that the applicable standard is that of the compelling state interest?
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2121.619,2121.97,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-847,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.297,2148.942,You say this is more like this welfare benefit which is the rational basis test until a medical need becomes acute?
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2148.942,2150.33,Yes.
1973.72-847,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2236.104,2265.793,"When you gave us that 13% cost, you mean someone has calculated that the non-residents, that is persons you regard as ineligible for this care if embraced in the program would raise the cost 13% or does the 13% a total of all indigent care of those entitled to it in your view or was not?"
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2265.793,2300.314,"Mr. Chief Justice, at the time that the brief was filed, we calculated that the cost of furnishing non-emergency medical care to residents of the State who were indigent but had not resided in the State for one year would be 13% of the amounts presently budgeted for furnishing medical care to the indigents who have lived in the State for one year."
1973.72-847,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2304.754,2310.271,None of those figures compare with the additional cost in Shapiro?
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2310.271,2311.607,I don’t know Mr. Justice --
1973.72-847,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2311.607,2315.796,Because as I have ever to say my argument was made --
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2315.796,2325.53,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I don’t know whether they’re larger or smaller but I think that the standard against which they have to be measured is different."
1973.72-847,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2408.911,2412.737,Well is cancer not an emergency?
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2412.737,2431.536,"Mr. Justice Marshall, what is an emergency and what isn’t is defined in the statute as a condition threatening life or limb, but in practical application, an emergency is whatever the doctor at the emergency receiving room wants to call it."
1973.72-847,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2441.772,2449.988,"But can the doctor, if you are resident -- can the doctor say, “you don’t need treatment and not treat you”?"
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2449.988,2461.954,"Mr. Justice Marshall, we operate as a part of the hospital an emergency receiving room which is open without question to anybody who comes in, regardless of any condition of residence --"
1973.72-847,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2461.954,2473.399,"But what if the doctor says, I think, that patients should be hospitalized, does the hospital have any discretion as to taking that patient or not?"
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2473.399,2480.628,The doctor is an employee of the hospital and therefore the hospital on simple theory of agency would be bound by his decision.
1973.72-847,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2480.628,2486.699,You mean all the physicians are members of the hospital staff?
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2486.699,2487.018,The --
1973.72-847,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2487.018,2488.735,I am talking about the private physician?
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2488.735,2490.052,"Oh,no, Your Honor."
1973.72-847,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2494.278,2497.283,You would decide whether they needed treatment or not.
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2497.283,2501.793,"Our own doctors would, that’s correct, who are hospital employees."
1973.72-847,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2512.117,2522.042,Doesn’t that (Inaudible) difference of treatments and the horrible thing you said that were involved in Shapiro in cancer?
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2522.042,2529.942,"Well, I [Attempt to Laughter] understand what you say."
1973.72-847,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.705,2623.13,"Well, would you say that the three-judge Court that decided that case, decided Valenciano had thought that Vaughan was controlling?"
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2623.13,2629.222,"Mr. Justice White, I don’t whether the exact three judges were the same, but I agree that Valenciano --"
1973.72-847,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2629.222,2630.784,"well, assume it was, it was?"
1973.72-847,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2630.784,2633.376,"We just looked at it, the same three judges?"
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2633.376,2637.641,I agree that Valenciano is directly contrary to the holding of the Court --
1973.72-847,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2637.641,2643.566,Well that Court thought that their own previous decision was controlling?
1973.72-847,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2643.566,2648.436,After our affirmance it’s noted in out opinion in Valenciano?
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2648.436,2671.852,"I would still offer to the Court the fact that in the Vaughan case, the statute empowered the Superintendent of the State Hospital to take the recently arrived patient in his hospital and put him or her on a public conveyance back to the state that he came from."
1973.72-847,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2691.304,2697.017,"You mean, this doesn’t in a few words, so I would compose (Inaudible)?"
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2697.017,2700.298,"Well, they put him on a railroad train and ship him out of town."
1973.72-847,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2700.298,2702.255,"That’s it, isn’t it?"
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2702.255,2715.627,"It is a direct, physical invasion of this individual autonomy."
1973.72-847,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2788.313,2793.88,"Starns was a little different, at least as explained in Vlandis against Kline, was it not?"
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2828.673,2832.282,"No, there is none whatsoever."
1973.72-847,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2839.594,2840.118,Bona fide --
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2840.118,2841.426,Bona fides of the residents --
1973.72-847,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2841.426,2842.03,Right.
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2842.03,2861.107,"-- but another one offered and the one that I would offer in this case is simply a determination that in this rather more limited benefit, the State could reasonably decide to extend it to those who have already contributed to the economy of the State by paying taxes and living there."
1973.72-847,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2934.598,2946.538,"Well, under Shapiro and perhaps some other cases, it wouldn't make any difference whether it were one year or 30 years, would it, on the principles enunciated?"
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2946.538,2947.231,That’s correct.
1973.72-847,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2947.231,2955.406,There is no time factor to test the good faith elements is non-permissible?
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2955.406,2966.03,"As I read Shapiro, the State is entitled to find out whether they are or may be entitled to find out whether a person is in fact a resident."
1973.72-847,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2966.03,2967.483,And might have enough time --
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2967.483,2971.871,But it may not impose a durational residence requirement which could threaten his existence --
1973.72-847,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2971.871,2972.612,Or impose a --
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2972.612,2973.517,As a means.
1973.72-847,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2973.517,2979.483,Or impose a fixed arbitrary time for the purpose of that determination?
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,2979.483,2992.705,"I am not offering because of Shapiro and because of Dunn, I am not offering the convenience of ascertaining residence as a justification for the statute in this case."
1973.72-847,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3046.364,3048.768,They don’t get any federal money?
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,3048.768,3060.145,"Mr. Justice Marshall, we get a great deal of federal money for our health services department but most of it is earmarked for specialized programs which do not have a durational residence requirement."
1973.72-847,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3176.003,3194.86,"Mr. Carter, the -- am I correct, however, into saying that the practical result of your position is that the care of Mr. Evaro and others like him is placed upon the private nonprofit facility?"
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,3194.86,3206.041,"The practical result of my position is hard to measure, Mr. Justice Blackmun because it varies with the facility that a particular county has."
1973.72-847,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3224.442,3231.069,"That’s getting to be -- it doesn’t matter how much money you get these days, that’s true?"
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,3231.069,3235.447,Mr. Evaro could’ve been admitted to the hospital but he would have got a bill.
1973.72-847,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3239.407,3248.963,But it does mean that the Maricopa -- that the Memorial Hospital has to take care of Mr. Evaro free of charge?
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,3248.963,3260.029,"It does mean that there are some cases where the voluntary hospitals are extending care to people who would not, who would be eligible, but for the durational residence requirement."
1973.72-847,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3260.513,3266.414,But does this not been have a destructive effect upon the financial integrity of these institutions?
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,3266.414,3273.089,"To the extent that this occurs, it causes the cost of that to be passed on to the private patient."
1973.72-847,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3273.178,3286.04,"But I suppose the -- I suppose some of those hospitals or most of them are required to do some indigency work or they lose their status, their tax status?"
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,3286.04,3287.026,"Well, they’re required."
1973.72-847,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3295.452,3296.089,Yes.
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,3296.089,3309.928,I would also like to point out that the county hospital rather than the voluntary hospital in Maricopa County takes the bulk of the people who are ineligible but can’t pay.
1973.72-847,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3318.018,3318.19,Thank you.
1973.72-847,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3318.19,3330.566,"But let me follow through, they would also have to take all the indigents in Arizona that are not residents of Arizona, the private hospital would?"
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,3330.566,3339.35,"Well, Mr. Justice Blackmun, if you’re sick and broke, somebody’s got to take care of you and in Phoenix, it’s the county hospital that usually does."
1973.72-847,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3339.35,3349.089,"Yes, isn’t it better for the municipal facility to do this than for the private facility in which has other indigent claims upon them, if it’s worth its salt?"
1973.72-847,1,44195,william_j_carter_iii,,3349.089,3352.04,"I agree and in practice, this is what occurs."
1973.72-847,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3358.226,3359.32,"Thank you, Mr. Carter."
