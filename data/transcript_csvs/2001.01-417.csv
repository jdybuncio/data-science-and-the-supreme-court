2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,9.371,16.14,Mr. Goldstein.
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,16.14,23.406,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: This is a case about the right to take an appeal.
2001.01-417,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,80.498,87.39,"Can I test your thesis that u are bound by a judgment, you are a party to it?"
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,115.049,118.515,"Justice Scalia, I think it depends on what we mean by bound."
2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,145.636,162.975,"You say that the judgment operates directly upon the class member, as if we are talking about some sort of physical thing, but how is that operation on the class member different from, say, what might be res judicata or collateral estoppel in some other case?"
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,162.975,174.493,"Mr. Chief Justice, the difference is that while you can have an application of collateral estoppel or res judicata that extinguishes a right to pursue an action, what I'm talking about here and let me put it in very practical terms."
2001.01-417,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,214.904,219.279,You are bound because a judge determined that you had an adequate representative.
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,246.483,251.769,"Well, that's a good entry into the purpose and function of Rule 23(e)."
2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,271.747,274.143,"Well, Rule 23 what?"
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,274.143,275.629,23(e).
2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,275.629,276.289,And where do we find that?
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,276.289,282.233,"That would be in the appendix of the Council of Institutional Investors, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,282.233,283.635,It's not in your brief?
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,283.635,285.205,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,285.205,291.271,Whereabouts in the Constitution of Institutional Investors?
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,291.271,294.615,(A)(4) of the appendix to that brief.
2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.615,295.152,Thank you.
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,295.152,297.92,And I'll read it very briefly for the Court's benefit.
2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,382.831,388.488,"But do you agree that you must intervene in the district court, or do you say you don't even do that?"
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,388.488,393.689,"Mr. Chief Justice, we say we do not have to do that, that there is nothing about this Court's precedents--"
2001.01-417,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,393.689,394.553,Why not?
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,449.538,451.274,"--Well, let me, there are two parts to the question."
2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,474.309,476.166,"Where are you reading, where are you reading from?"
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,476.166,480.624,--I'm going to read from (a)(3) in the carryover to (a)(4) of the same appendix of the Council--
2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,480.624,481.489,And where are you starting on (a)(3)?
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,481.489,486.113,"--At the bottom of the page D, orders and conduct of actions."
2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,612.058,614.371,What if the court grants your motion to intervene?
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,614.371,617.631,"Mr. Chief Justice, then you haven't accomplished anything either."
2001.01-417,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,621.263,625.35,"Could we, could we go back just one step."
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,629.975,630.634,Yes.
2001.01-417,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,630.634,637.982,"And I thought that your basic argument was whatever your status is in the district court, that's what your status is on appeal."
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,664.088,664.814,Yes.
2001.01-417,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,744.132,745.434,You have gained something.
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,768.263,770.242,"--Justice Breyer, let me draw a distinction."
2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,797.296,805.454,"Well, what discretion would the district court have if your theory is right, Mr. Goldstein, that an objector doesn't even have to intervene?"
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,814.37,817.714,"Well, I believe that under the language of the rule--"
2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,817.714,818.457,Of what rule?
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,818.457,823.37,"--Of subsection D, and let me return to the introductory clause, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,849.915,852.265,So you are saying that I am reaching out and bringing you into the case in spite of the fact you haven't moved to intervene?
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,852.265,853.713,"--I apologize, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,883.184,890.986,How does he give jurisdiction over people that are simply on the outside; they are not parties; all they are doing is objecting?
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,890.986,891.608,"I apologize, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.01-417,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,903.535,904.072,Okay.
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,914.02,915.385,"Well, no."
2001.01-417,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,924.877,926.569,How... how can... I'm lost.
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,928.964,935.28,"Justice Souter, that is our fundamental point, is that, let me just distinguish again with the Court whose position is what."
2001.01-417,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,941.141,964.093,"No, but you are suggesting it as an alternative to Justice Breyer's suggestion that maybe to avoid chaos, you ought to have discretionary intervention, permissive intervention, and if you've got to avoid the chaos, then I assume the judge has got to be able in effect to limit what some parties objecting can do in favor of what other parties, letting other parties objecting speak."
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,964.093,966.322,"--Justice Souter, I agree with you."
2001.01-417,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,983.412,990.265,"Mr. Goldstein, I was very surprised to hear you say you agree with Justice Souter when he used the word permissive intervention."
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1001.699,1005.414,"--Justice Ginsburg, I didn't focus on that word in Justice Souter's question."
2001.01-417,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1005.414,1007.932,I retract my adjective.
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1007.932,1010.161,And so that's quite right.
2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1065.396,1068.739,"Under your theory, any objector can appeal, I take it."
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1068.739,1070.309,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1070.309,1074.684,"And no matter how complicated the case in the district court, they don't have to intervene."
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1076.829,1078.399,But it has never happened.
2001.01-417,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1138.214,1154.948,"How, in the Second and Third Circuits has, has the procedure been you can object, everybody lets you object, but you can then appeal without having intervened?"
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1154.948,1158.769,"In excess of several decades, Your Honor, and it stretches in the Ninth Circuit back to 1979, for example."
2001.01-417,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1183.289,1198.233,"Will your rule hold for certiorari petitions as well, so if, let's say, a named class member takes an appeal, but then the class petitions for certiorari, that any non-named class member can petition for certiorari?"
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1198.233,1199.143,"No, Justice Kennedy."
2001.01-417,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1210.121,1211.774,"Well, but your rule is that you are a party."
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1211.774,1214.125,"You are a party to the case, to the district court's judgment."
2001.01-417,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1221.721,1227.211,But under your philosophy you are a party to the court of appeals because you are bound by the judgment.
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1227.211,1228.326,"--No, Justice Kennedy."
2001.01-417,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1262.794,1276.047,"What you are saying then is not that he ceases to be a party, that the nonobjecting class member ceases to be a party in the court of appeals, but the nonobjecting class member has waived the right to be separately represented by himself, isn't it?"
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1276.047,1276.79,Yes.
2001.01-417,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1276.79,1277.245,Yes.
2001.01-417,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1277.245,1286.654,"And the objection, of course he couldn't petition for cert because all he can do, he can't question anything else in the case except his objections to the settlement."
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1288.407,1288.966,That's right.
2001.01-417,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1403.85,1410.553,"Well, what's wrong with the Government's position, which is you have the right to intervene for purposes of appeal?"
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1431.054,1432.373,Because the judge already knows that.
2001.01-417,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1479.101,1483.642,"The advisory committee could solve this either way, couldn't they, the Rules Committee?"
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1483.642,1484.963,It actually could.
2001.01-417,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1490.99,1491.444,"Well, why hasn't it?"
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1492.93,1500.732,"--I think there is one good reason and that is that the advisory committee goes through, in cycles, of course, it revisits particular rules."
2001.01-417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1516.336,1518.111,"Very well, Mr. Goldstein."
2001.01-417,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1518.111,1519.392,"Mr. Gold, we'll hear from you."
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1519.392,1544.489,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The well settled rule that we begin from and that the Petitioners accept is that only parties to a lawsuit or those that properly become parties may appeal an adverse judgment.
2001.01-417,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1611.091,1617.761,"But couldn't any member of the class say judge, you looked like a representative."
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1641.705,1672.003,"The... to the extent that that is your point, and you move to intervene to replace the representative party, that's a motion that has to be dealt with."
2001.01-417,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1683.437,1691.982,"Mr. Gold, may I go back to the statement, you said something, you moved to intervene."
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1700.072,1700.898,--But that wasn't--
2001.01-417,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1700.898,1706.183,"And that, you come in and object and you say I object to the settlement."
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1711.096,1720.013,"--Well, but you are not saying that the representative is not adequate to represent you for purposes of the settlement."
2001.01-417,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1728.491,1733.675,"Well, then let me put it in your terms, and I'm reading from page 30 of your brief."
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1765.71,1784.879,"In... in the sense, Your Honor, what we are saying is not that the class representative in fact has not properly and adequately represented the class."
2001.01-417,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1823.417,1837.263,"But Mr. Gold, if he is challenging the representative's fee, I think he is, which often is what the minority member of the class objects to, the large fee that the class representatives, the lawyers get."
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1840.013,1851.364,"I'm not arguing that there is not a ""difference of opinion"" or conflict."
2001.01-417,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1852.85,1858.339,"Well, you are certainly not arguing that the lawyer adequately represents the person who is objecting to his fee either, are you?"
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1858.339,1861.312,--No.
2001.01-417,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1926.41,1931.157,"That was somebody who was not a member of the class, right?"
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1931.157,1931.983,That is correct.
2001.01-417,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1931.983,1940.983,"Here you are talking about members of the class and even in this case, people who are made to be members of the class even if they don't want to be because they can't opt out."
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1940.983,1951.841,"Well, they are the members of the class but they are not parties to the lawsuit."
2001.01-417,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1953.448,1954.191,They don't want to be.
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1964.101,1974.708,--There is no argument here that you made a deal and the lawyers are getting the lion's share.
2001.01-417,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1978.135,1979.471,But we're are not dealing with the merits of it.
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2029.693,2040.384,"--I don't understand the Government to argue that the motion must be granted, and I'll--"
2001.01-417,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2040.384,2043.978,"Do you understand the Government to say it is intervention of right, not permissive intervention?"
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2043.978,2052.643,"--It's intervention of, of right, but not automatic."
2001.01-417,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2144.304,2144.675,I'm sorry.
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2199.766,2252.771,"--You would, you have a right to intervene, but your... what you are doing if you seek to intervene to take an appeal is to proceed on behalf of the class and to invalidate and have vacated the, the settlement agreement which is not an agreement which either cuts your COLA, the trust, having acted--"
2001.01-417,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2252.771,2265.486,"The, the Government as I understand it says yes you have a right to intervene and you have a right to appeal to the limited extent that you are contesting the settlement."
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2271.347,2271.819,--No.
2001.01-417,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2385.32,2392.007,"--Mr. Gold, that's not the standard that applies to the right of a class member to participate in the district court proceeding, is it?"
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2392.007,2401.972,It isn't... it is; it would be the standard for a class member to intervene as--
2001.01-417,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2401.972,2402.615,To intervene.
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2409.674,2420.698,"--He has an absolute right to participate in the, in the fairness hearing."
2001.01-417,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2436.385,2442.534,"But he has that right, whether or not the district court may view his objections as colorable or frivolous."
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2442.534,2445.218,"--That is true, Your Honor."
2001.01-417,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2492.501,2494.175,And to have the court rule on the objection.
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2494.175,2494.835,--No.
2001.01-417,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2497.314,2500.491,"Oh, you don't think that, they can file an objection, the court doesn't have to rule on?"
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2500.491,2501.151,No.
2001.01-417,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2505.033,2510.727,Even approving the settlement in the face of an objection is the ruling that the objection is without merit.
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2514.897,2515.368,--No.
2001.01-417,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2606.374,2617.332,"--You disagree with anything the government said in its brief about the objector has a right to intervene, he can do so even after judgment within the time allowed?"
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2617.332,2652.276,"We think definitely that an objector or even a class member who hasn't participated in the objection process can intervene to take an appeal and to forward the objections made in the objection process by anyone, but we think that--"
2001.01-417,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2652.276,2654.384,Then you are disagreeing with the Seventh Circuit.
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2667.387,2684.477,"--Well, the Government... neither, I don't believe the Seventh Circuit has passed on the, the propriety of intervention after judgment."
2001.01-417,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2687.01,2689.323,It has.
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2689.678,2695.167,"--that only parties can... no, they said that you can intervene after."
2001.01-417,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2695.167,2695.538,--No.
2001.01-417,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2707.715,2708.542,"Well, the Government doesn't take that position."
2001.01-417,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2712.357,2713.827,"Thank you, Mr. Gold."
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2716.343,2729.364,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2001.01-417,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2743.92,2759.895,"Is that a purely formal disagreement, or are there some distinct practical advantages that you can tell us to your rule so that the district judge, I assume, can give some shape and direction to the appeal?"
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2760.638,2764.929,There is a practical significance to this process.
2001.01-417,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2814.713,2823.712,"Beyond the determination that they are members of the class, are there any further purposes served by the intervention rule you propose?"
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2823.712,2825.57,Whether or not there is stale claim.
2001.01-417,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2854.111,2856.712,You think under Petitioner's view that person would be able to appeal?
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2856.712,2860.799,"That's my understanding of Petitioner's view, without having given the district court any opportunity, or the attorneys who are representing that person at that point, to address this concern is part of the fairness hearing."
2001.01-417,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2860.799,2876.735,"Well, what is the practical difference?"
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2880.861,2881.398,Yes.
2001.01-417,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2881.398,2881.975,All right.
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2895.721,2895.787,"They don't have to be there physically, in person, but there is motions practice in district courts, and a district court would decide whether or not they want someone there in person or not."
2001.01-417,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2905.259,2910.543,"Well, why cannot the same thing be accomplished by saying flush out your objection?"
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2910.543,2911.165,--There is two answers to that.
2001.01-417,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2963.382,2971.389,"Ms. Millett, I would be very impressed with the argument you are making now about having the thing run neat and tidy, but for two things."
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3018.367,3031.083,"--Concrete evidence of pandemonium, no, there is no concrete evidence that intervention is a difficult barrier in the five circuits that have required... in fact, the seven circuits that require this intervention motion."
2001.01-417,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3055.824,3056.55,When was Felzen?
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3058.591,3060.737,--It was... I'm sorry.
2001.01-417,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3083.854,3085.9,Felzen was three years ago.
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3086.355,3087.015,I'm sorry.
2001.01-417,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3104.476,3113.681,"--May I ask you, because your time is so limited, could you tell us what is the difference between your view of this case and Mr. Gold's view of this case?"
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3113.681,3127.222,"--I think, well, putting aside, we think there is more, we don't think that the objectors are parties but we are somewhat more sympathetic to the notion that they have the same interests as quasi parties, I think, than Mr. Gold is."
2001.01-417,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3142.621,3155.457,"May I ask you under your view of the requirement of an intervention for purposes of appeal, could the district judge in this case, in response to the intervention motion that was actually filed, have granted that relief?"
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3155.457,3157.854,The intervention for purposes of appeal?
2001.01-417,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3157.854,3158.158,Yes.
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3158.158,3164.579,"Could it have, I guess the district court would have had the power contingently to reserve judgment."
2001.01-417,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3206.894,3208.419,But you could deny it in court.
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3234.591,3239.976,The district court never said that they can't intervene for purposes of appeal because they were never--
2001.01-417,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3239.976,3242.477,"--It denied the motion to intervene, which had many parts."
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3242.477,3244.539,"--Well, it just said to intervene."
2001.01-417,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3249.164,3256.595,"So, should not the proper ruling have been yes, you can intervene, but only for this limited purpose, instead of saying motion denied?"
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3256.595,3267.656,"--Well, I think if this Court would adopt the rule and recognize that limited intervention for purposes of appeal is appropriate in this context, district courts will know that that's an option and be able to address it or raise it with attorneys."
2001.01-417,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3270.174,3279.545,"This district judge certainly thought that his wording on the objection, he twice said if you don't agree, appeal it."
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3283.632,3285.573,--He said that.
2001.01-417,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3297.212,3303.611,"Do you disagree with the Seventh Circuit, which would require the motion to intervene to be made prejudgment?"
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3303.611,3307.576,--If that's how one reads... I assume you are talking about the Navigant opinion?
2001.01-417,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3307.576,3307.986,Yes.
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3307.986,3316.409,"I think there is a prior opinion and I'm sorry, the name, escapes me from, which Judge Easterbrook also wrote, which we think adopted our position."
2001.01-417,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3316.409,3317.524,"Thank you, Ms. Millett."
2001.01-417,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3317.524,3318.1,Thank you.
2001.01-417,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3318.1,3320.329,"Mr. Goldstein, you have five minutes remaining."
2001.01-417,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3383.283,3387.741,"Is that still before us, I mean, the denial of the intervention motion?"
2001.01-417,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3387.741,3388.977,I don't think that was properly raised.
2001.01-417,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3388.977,3391.844,"Mr. Chief Justice, let me explain why I disagree."
2001.01-417,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3413.663,3418.122,"But that's not, I don't think a fair interpretation of the question that you have presented."
2001.01-417,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3420.556,3426.295,"--Justice Kennedy, the reason we used that formulation is because it's the formulation that the Fourth Circuit used."
2001.01-417,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3427.865,3430.094,"Well, we'll decide that another time."
2001.01-417,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3430.094,3431.496,--I understand.
2001.01-417,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3441.361,3445.243,"Well, we take it the question you presented and your petition for certiorari, that's what we granted."
2001.01-417,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3445.243,3446.291,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.01-417,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3461.385,3463.281,"Why is it, has there been a problem the other way?"
2001.01-417,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3466.048,3467.739,"--But they don't, Justice Breyer."
2001.01-417,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3606.316,3607.596,"Thank you, Mr. Goldstein."
