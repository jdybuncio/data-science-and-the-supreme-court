2008.07-636,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We'll hear argument next in Case 07-636, Kennedy v. The Plan Administrator for DuPont Savings and Investment Plan."
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,9.885,40.731,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As this Court has confined consideration of the matters before the Court to certiorari issue number 5 concerning qualified domestic relations orders, or QDROs as they are called, I will confine my argument to arguing that the Fifth Circuit erred in holding that the only way a divorcing spouse can waive the right to pension benefits is by executing a QDRO."
2008.07-636,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,47.293,56.508,You did in your reply brief address the plan question?
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,56.508,58.333,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-636,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,82.841,97.52,"The problem is that is that if you, even if we hold for you on that issue, you could still lose on the plan documents rule, right."
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,97.52,136.538,"Well, Your Honor, I think that instead this Court might choose well to follow what the concurrence said in the recent LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg case, emphasizing that where the court of appeals below has not passed on the central issue of a case and where most of the fire that the one party is responding to comes from amici, that it is appropriate to remand the case to that court so that that court may pass on the central issue, especially in the situation where, as here, the Fifth Circuit did not even mention the plan document's role, but based its decision solely on a misinterpretation of the QDRO language."
2008.07-636,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,179.363,186.658,"At the end of your argument, could you just spend a minute because my state of mind is I'm sorry we limited it."
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,189.047,189.874,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-636,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,189.874,191.2,And I'm tempted to try to decide it.
2008.07-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.803,208.804,"We know what's going to happen on remand, though, don't we?"
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,211.88,213.647,The Fifth Circuit already has case law.
2008.07-636,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,226.499,232.185,"But again as a preliminary matter, am I on the same page with Justice Ginsburg?"
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,245.977,248.165,"I do not believe so, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-636,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,248.165,257.067,"Because the plan does contain a procedure for designating some other beneficiary, including the spouse."
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,260.02,315.836,"Well, Your Honor, there was that provision for invoking another beneficiary and we only pointed out that indeed three days after the divorce, and consistent with his ex-wife's waiver of any right, title, claim and interest in this 401(k) plan in specific, and that was the very first item of the things that he retained as the plan participant in that divorce decree, he did in fact designate his sole daughter Kari Kennedy as his sole beneficiary in a change of form plan for one part of this very complex series of multiple plans -- of plan retirement benefits where he said that he would give -- that she would be his sole beneficiary; and the form there that DuPont drafted for him said that it invoked and superseded any and all prior designations, and was not limited to that one particular part 6 pension and retirements plan."
2008.07-636,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,375.561,379.499,Or he might have -- he might have decided that he didn't want to revoke that one.
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,390.087,394.571,"Your Honor, I might -- I might, if I would, just offer an explanation."
2008.07-636,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,418.327,426.414,"Well, because he could -- he could have -- despite her waiver, he could have named her as the beneficiary of that plan and that would have controlled."
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,426.414,448.642,"Well, Your Honor, the way I see it is that his attorneys who were advising him and guiding him through this process, they were acting, we must assume, in complete awareness of Texas and Fifth Circuit law; and the Fifth Circuit had just ruled some six weeks before in a case involving voluntary divorce decree waivers that such a waiver was enforceable."
2008.07-636,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,450.064,451.608,I'm sorry; six weeks before what?
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,451.608,455.34,--Before the divorce decree in the Brandon v. Travelers International case.
2008.07-636,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,479.631,481.613,"Well, but how does the plan know that?"
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,481.613,504.042,"The plan knows that, as here, when the court-appointed fiduciary, the executrix Kari Kennedy makes the plan aware of that on April 26, 2001, via fax and delivery, which is acknowledged by their plan administrator, Mary Deneen that's coming in, and there you have a copy of the divorce decree served on DuPont months before they make a payout."
2008.07-636,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,535.733,544.869,"But the plan terms say that if you want to change the beneficiary, here's how you've got to change the beneficiary; and we are going to pay the beneficiary until it's changed."
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,544.869,557.317,"--Well, Your Honor, I would also say that the plan forms here at page 48 of your joint appendix, and 49 -- I ask this Court to scrutinize these two provisions because they are critical to the outcome of the case."
2008.07-636,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,580.651,584.867,I would have thought your friend on the other side would be quoting that language.
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,584.867,597.299,"--Well, Your Honor, I like to bring a fresh insight to the -- to the -- to the Petitioner's argument here because I see that language and we say it is not in effect."
2008.07-636,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,618.231,620.477,"But that's -- that's a bit of a stretch, isn't it?"
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,627.836,639.063,--But it's not in effect at the time that it comes to be decided because their plan administrator Mary Deneen has a copy of the divorce decree with the knowing voluntary waiver.
2008.07-636,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,655.104,657.027,"Well, of course, that was the point of my earlier point."
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,659.117,659.492,Yes.
2008.07-636,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,659.492,677.925,"That just indicates that this would have been a different case if the provision of the plan that said there shall be no assignment, which is quoted in the Fifth Circuit thing, was the only provision in the plan; but when you look through this in retrospect, there are means for participants and beneficiaries to make a change, and they weren't followed here."
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,677.925,678.361,Well--
2008.07-636,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,678.361,680.284,And I understand that you say in effect they were.
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,690.013,701.82,"--Your Honor, we submit that people all the time in situations like this may believe that a knowing voluntary waiver which has received the approval of the majority of the Federal appellate courts and the State courts is good enough."
2008.07-636,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,763.125,765.106,It's in the opinion of the company.
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,787.848,819.196,"--And that's the first step in the analysis, Your Honor, because the second step is all of this Supreme Court case and all of the substantial expenses that this estate out of Jasper, Texas, has had to pay from the very beginning could have been avoided had they paid over to Kari Kennedy, a court-appointed executrix who would have taken that money in and would have been bound by the rules of the probate court to handle it as a fiduciary to consider Liv's claim that her voluntary waiver was not voluntary, to pay the creditors first, rather than get stuck with the tax liabilities, which happened here."
2008.07-636,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,838.749,841.154,We can't decide this case based on sympathy to DuPont.
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,853.259,855.992,The problem--
2008.07-636,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,855.992,857.568,We have the same question before us.
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,857.568,859.178,"--The QDRO question, Your Honor?"
2008.07-636,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,859.178,859.693,Yes.
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,859.693,881.386,"Yes, and that's why we say that if you look carefully at -- excuse me, but it's 29 U.S.C. section 1056(b) through (k) -- you look at the specific language, and I am asking this Court to adhere to the specific written terms of the ERISA statute because those require a transfer to an alternate payee."
2008.07-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,890.822,891.212,Sorry.
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,895.552,902.084,"--Respondents' brief, Your Honor, and you will find it specifically on pages 14A and 15A, in the appendix in the back."
2008.07-636,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,912.469,913.592,What do you want me to read here?
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,913.592,923.013,"Specifically, Your Honors, pages 14A and 15A of the Respondents' appendix, where he has actually given us all of the QDRO statute at 1056."
2008.07-636,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,981.615,982.941,I'm not sure I'm getting this argument.
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,996.562,1007.258,"--Your Honor, the way pension planners understand it is that you use a QDRO for a transfer of benefits, not for a bare waiver."
2008.07-636,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1027.297,1033.513,"All you're saying is that you couldn't effect a bare waiver through a QDRO, but why does that prove your case?"
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,1035.014,1035.935,--We think that--
2008.07-636,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1035.935,1043.118,A QDRO could have been used to direct the payment to someone else other than the ex-spouse.
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,1043.118,1056.161,--With respect to her waiver that would have required him in advance to decide who he would have transferred what alternate payee he would transfer way back at the time of his divorce in 1994.
2008.07-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1067.061,1068.671,That's not your point.
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,1077.324,1078.604,I agree--
2008.07-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1078.604,1085.164,"And your point is this has been no assignment or agency, so we don't need the QDRO exception."
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,1089.3,1092.44,--I completely agree with that analysis.
2008.07-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1092.44,1096.468,So whether he could have done a QDRO or not is in your view irrelevant.
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,1113.602,1116.191,"That's exactly our position Your Honor, yes."
2008.07-636,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1162.299,1166.83,"Well, of course you only think the Solicitor General is right so far to a certain extent."
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,1166.83,1167.844,To a certain extent.
2008.07-636,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1167.844,1177.262,"Then you throw them under the train because you don't -- you certainly don't think they are correct by saying, look, the only way you can do this is by modifying the plan."
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,1217.449,1218.76,"Well, Your Honor, let me address that."
2008.07-636,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1316.095,1318.856,I must have missed -- where did Watergate come from.
2008.07-636,0,20836,david_a_furlow,,1319.281,1327.213,"Just putting in context the intentions of the 1974 Congress, which was concerned about participants and beneficiaries."
2008.07-636,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1340.304,1341.084,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-636,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1351.596,1367.978,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit decided this case on the grounds that ERISA's anti-alienation provision forbids a divorcing spouse from relinquishing an interest in his or her ex-spouse's pension plan benefits unless the waiver takes the form of a qualified domestic relations order."
2008.07-636,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1394.592,1399.388,"Well, are the provisions of page 49 of the appendix consistent with the statute?"
2008.07-636,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1399.388,1402.715,"Indeed, Your Honor, we think that they are."
2008.07-636,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1417.724,1422.879,Did the Court of Appeals give short shrift or overlook that point?
2008.07-636,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1422.879,1431.532,"Well, the Court of Appeals determined that it need not reach this point because it decided the case on different grounds; namely, the anti-alienation grounds."
2008.07-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1439.464,1448.944,"Well, we -- I mean, we could have -- you know, we should have thought of that when we limited our -- our grant of certiorari to the -- to the one question on which you agree with the Petitioner."
2008.07-636,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1461.176,1469.451,"Well, for several reasons, Your Honor, we think it would be appropriate for the Court to answer both the plan documents question as well as the anti-alienation question."
2008.07-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1478.198,1488.508,Do you know any other case in which we have explicitly declined to accept a question and then have used one of these other back doorways of -- of answering it anyway?
2008.07-636,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1488.508,1489.413,I--
2008.07-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1489.413,1490.333,I don't know of any.
2008.07-636,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1491.912,1494.599,"--I'm -- I'm not sure that I know of any either, Your Honor."
2008.07-636,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1494.599,1495.255,"Well, could we do this?"
2008.07-636,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1525.791,1533.052,"Well, Your Honor, I think it would be possible to -- to either order for the briefing on the issue or to grant the question now at this juncture."
2008.07-636,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1539.611,1541.237,"You see, I want to be fair to them."
2008.07-636,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1548.154,1551.934,"--Well, Your Honor, that is an important consideration."
2008.07-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1579.094,1584.669,--Did -- did we recognize in earlier cases that beneficiary designations are plan documents?
2008.07-636,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1584.669,1591.17,"Well, Your Honor, I think the question of whether beneficiary designation forms count as plan documents, is a little bit beside the point."
2008.07-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.014,1632.793,"Again, assuming there has been a change of beneficiary designation, and, of course, the argument you're confronted with is: I haven't changed anything."
2008.07-636,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1642.118,1657.344,"Well, in this case there is a conflict then between the wishes of the participant, who by all accounts would have chosen not to change the beneficiary designation, and that of the beneficiary."
2008.07-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1672.9,1686.6,"Well, I think it's a harder question than you make it; and I, for one, have not gone into it as deeply as I would like to, principally because we rejected that -- that question."
2008.07-636,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1686.6,1697.86,"Well, again, Your Honor, we think it would be appropriate for the Court to go on to address that question because the issues have been fully aired both in the Fifth Circuit and in the briefing in this Court."
2008.07-636,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1706.295,1718.352,"Am I right in understanding that there is a fairly sharp circuit split on that question, even that majority of the circuits are contrary to the Government's position?"
2008.07-636,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1718.352,1719.288,--That is correct.
2008.07-636,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1738.061,1739.702,And which circuits are on the other side?
2008.07-636,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1739.702,1747.902,"There are a number of them including the Fifth, the Seventh, the Third."
2008.07-636,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1809.91,1812.955,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,1825.042,1833.322,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In light of the Court's questions, I want to begin with the plan documents argument and first the procedural question of whether it's properly before the Court."
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.141,1853.233,Do you know of any case in which we've done this--
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,1853.233,1853.717,I do.
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1853.717,1856.154,--rejected the question and then decided it?
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,1856.154,1864.073,"I apologize if it's not in the brief, but a case I could find was called Piper Aircraft versus Rayno 454 U.S. 235."
2008.07-636,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1875.226,1875.678,"No, no."
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1885.205,1886.441,That's what I'm asking.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,1886.878,1889.108,I'm not sure of the answer to that.
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1889.108,1891.857,You are sure of the answer.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,1893.032,1899.979,I think Piper is at least a first cousin if not a direct sibling of the issue that we've got here.
2008.07-636,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1908.102,1920.472,"I guess you agree that it's a question of which the circuits have split, so presumably there are good arguments on both sides, and it's one that your friend hasn't had a full opportunity to brief here."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,1924.375,1927.405,"--Well, actually I think the Court will be confident if it looks into it."
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.931,1946.539,It would be the classic case but for the fact that we had rejected that question.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,1952.054,1952.693,--And I agree.
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1969.407,1979.12,Can we expect that to happen in future cases when we turn down a question and amici and people come in and brief the question anyway and then ask us to decide it?
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,1979.12,1979.915,--I wouldn't think so.
2008.07-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1984.884,1989.162,I think there is a question of the way it was phrased.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,1997.004,2000.596,"--I would be loathe to make that suggestion, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2041.657,2043.345,Undoubtedly we should have granted it.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2043.345,2047.764,"Well, in the fullness of time, the Court can now revisit that."
2008.07-636,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2054.057,2056.885,Would you like to argue the question that is here?
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2056.885,2057.745,--Yes ----
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2103.99,2105.46,Where would I find the latter?
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2111.551,2119.721,"I don't find this all that pleasant reading, but it's on page 21A of the statutory appendix to the red brief."
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.721,2120.423,21A?
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2120.423,2121.219,21A.
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2219.931,2223.506,"Well, that doesn't make too much sense, does it, where all that happens is it's just waived."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2278.295,2281.169,"--You've covered a lot of ground, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2282.467,2285.263,The argument is against you and I would like to hear what you have to say.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2285.263,2286.199,--And I appreciate that.
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2297.929,2307.767,"No, it also goes to the question of who is the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2307.767,2308.94,--If there were no--
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2308.94,2322.246,"If there was a waiver and there had been no order, your friend's contention is by traditional common law, the person who would have been entitled to it would have been his client."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2322.246,2324.012,"--On the contrary, Justice--"
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2324.012,2326.215,"I mean, I don't see how this language helps you."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2329.195,2330.01,--I don't believe so.
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2338.118,2338.523,--Right.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2338.523,2339.818,If there had been no order--
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2339.818,2341.287,If there had been no order--
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2341.287,2343.237,--then there wouldn't have been any waiver by Liv.
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2349.967,2350.22,"--Oh, I see."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2350.673,2351.203,--in the decree.
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2351.78,2352.108,I see your point.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2358.386,2363.09,"--I'd hesitate to speak for him, but I think the language is--"
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2363.09,2363.729,I got you.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2363.729,2369.102,"--quite clear, and that's why this is a more straightforward analysis than the waiver under anti-alienation."
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2370.428,2370.869,I see.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2370.869,2374.289,But this is really very straightforward and dispositive.
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2392.076,2394.451,"I'm -- I didn't follow, I'd have to admit."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2416.943,2417.426,No.
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2419.942,2420.41,Okay.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2446.648,2447.943,"Well, I think it does, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2447.943,2449.055,"I know you do, and that's what I need to ask."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2449.055,2450.334,It doesn't say anything about where it goes.
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2454.881,2455.677,I'm sorry.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2469.781,2470.374,Yes.
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2470.374,2473.45,"Now, you think that includes the giver, the payor?"
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2473.45,2473.872,No.
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2473.872,2475.95,"Well, that's where this goes if you waive it."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2475.95,2482.726,"I don't believe so, because the ""if there had no order"" clause refers to the domestic relations order, a divorce decree."
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2482.726,2486.194,You say the waiver is in the order?
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2486.194,2486.599,Yes.
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2486.599,2489.364,"And without the order, there has been no waiver."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2489.364,2490.132,That's correct.
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2491.848,2493.879,We'll have to see whether your friend agrees with that.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2495.845,2498.314,--That's what made horse races.
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2546.168,2556.089,What if they had agreed to the waiver apart from -- apart from the -- from the domestic relations order?
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2566.316,2567.99,I don't think so.
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.567,2576.799,"Well, if it's an alienation, but his point is that a waiver is not an alienation."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2576.799,2577.127,Right.
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2587.999,2593.119,What about some other waiver that's -- that's not in connection with a -- with a domestic relations thing?
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2609.394,2611.832,"--Well, first of all, that would run squarely into the plan document's argument."
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2611.832,2612.207,Ah.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2615.626,2619.623,"If it's not a marital dissolution context, then QDRO wouldn't apply one way or the other."
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2621.999,2627.028,"Yes, but you would still -- the plan would still have to make some inquires, wouldn't it?"
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2627.028,2631.509,"--Not -- well, just on -- not getting to the plan documents."
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2631.509,2631.806,Yes.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2632.683,2635.073,It would be a different case.
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2645.396,2646.02,Sure.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2646.02,2651.33,"It's a commonplace in these benefits issues, and these are high-volumes operations."
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2673.744,2674.68,I'm five minutes behind.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2677.321,2677.867,--Okay.
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2677.867,2678.335,Okay?
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2679.992,2689.876,"It didn't want the plan administrators to have to try and divine the intention of the parties, didn't want the plan administrators to have to hold a factfinding hearing before it could pay plan benefits."
2008.07-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2701.45,2719.412,"Before you do, leaving the plan -- the beneficiary designation, you say that the plan administrator is not required to give effect to a waiver that conflicts with the beneficiary designation."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2738.546,2741.167,I believe it must follow the beneficiary designation.
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2823.571,2830.54,"Let me go back for a second because, while I got it five minutes late, if I have it right, I still don't see why Congress would have done it literally."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2876.769,2878.676,"--I don't think the issue -- I mean, a lot depends on the wording."
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2878.676,2880.349,I can understand an antialienation provision.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2892.998,2895.045,"Two things: One, we think that purpose does apply here."
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2915.974,2916.302,--I see.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2916.302,2919.082,"That's the first and, I think, most important answer."
2008.07-636,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2958.004,2960.877,"Well, why -- why do they have to worry about that?"
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2979.041,2980.289,It's not necessary.
2008.07-636,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2985.007,2993.13,"But another alternative is that all you can -- you can cross out this name and put in another, or you can go to court, get this, qualify it as a QDRO, file it with the plan."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,2994.893,2996.191,--They wouldn't have to.
2008.07-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3072.457,3080.624,"But isn't -- isn't the problem that it must be an indirect arrangement, and what you are arguing for here is an indirect effect."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3104.929,3105.756,"Well, we think it is."
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3132.605,3133.385,"Well, that's -- that's the point that troubles me."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3153.33,3154.738,"Well, that's back to the disclaimer, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3154.738,3158.314,The only person who acquires it -- the only entity that acquires it is the estate.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3158.314,3160.595,"Yes, that's right under the default rule."
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3165.575,3169.619,Does he acquire it from a participant or beneficiary?
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3169.619,3170.84,He acquires it from the beneficiary list.
2008.07-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3170.84,3182.117,I thought the -- the notion is it's as though the -- it's as though the devise to the person refusing it had never occurred.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3187.678,3195.499,"Well, there is no gift tax payable if it's a qualified disclaimer, and it won't be in a divorce case because there will be consideration and that prevents a qualified disclaimer."
2008.07-636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3200.811,3216.085,"You made the contention now -- and I think you have it in your brief -- that if you get something in return for a disclaimer, then the disclaimer is not effective."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3228.299,3236.547,"--The -- it's -- under the Gift Tax Code Justice Ginsburg, section 2518 defines a qualified disclaimer, which means you don't pay gift tax on it."
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3262.615,3267.517,"Is the -- is the wife -- I'm thinking of the Chief Justice's question, too."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3276.638,3278.214,--In her own pension?
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3278.214,3283.869,"Suppose she's married for 40 years to Joe Smith, Joe Smith earns a pension and then he wants a divorce."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3286.415,3290.583,"Well, I think under section 1055 there's a right to different annuities."
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3294.084,3296.049,Does she get some of the money he saved?
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3296.049,3297.114,"Yes, she's entitled to it."
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3297.114,3301.423,So it's not exactly that you could have just changed the beneficiary.
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3303.829,3305.28,After the divorce she is not entitled.
2008.07-636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3307.608,3314.729,"But in the divorce proceeding she's going to get some of the money, which is now Justice Ginsburg's point, to which she is entitled."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3318.008,3319.646,"Right, I think that's right."
2008.07-636,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3319.646,3322.395,"Not, not obviously."
2008.07-636,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3332.405,3337.264,Once she is a nonspouse she is no longer entitled to those benefits under ERISA section 1055.
2008.07-636,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3337.264,3339.7,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-636,3,20836,david_a_furlow,,3342.419,3343.121,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2008.07-636,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3430.193,3432.034,"They look at it and say, is this a QDRO?"
2008.07-636,3,20836,david_a_furlow,,3438.531,3447.293,"Well, Your Honor, it's more interesting than that, actually, in that if you look to page 68 of the joint appendix you'll see Mary Dineen, the administrator, was saying, quote:"
2008.07-636,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3480.782,3484.482,Was this waiver only part of the divorce decree?
2008.07-636,3,20836,david_a_furlow,,3486.186,3492.76,"--Well, this waiver was the part in which Liv Kennedy waived all right so that he retained all of his--"
2008.07-636,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3492.76,3494.476,That's not separate and apart from the divorce decree.
2008.07-636,3,20836,david_a_furlow,,3494.476,3496.009,--It was not separate and apart.
2008.07-636,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3526.277,3531.822,"Do you have anything more to say on the plan document, the plan document issue than what you've said here."
2008.07-636,3,20836,david_a_furlow,,3531.822,3537.414,"Oh, I could come up with lots of things."
2008.07-636,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3540.397,3541.115,Okay.
