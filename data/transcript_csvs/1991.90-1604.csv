1991.90-1604,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.956,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-1604, Dan Morales, Attorney General of Texas, v. Trans World Airlines."
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,11.406,13.908,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1604,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.112,177.449,"Well, Mr. Gardner, we have to decide, I guess, what it is that the language that Congress used means, and it chose to use language that preempts, federally preempts state laws relating to rates, routes, or services."
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,180.234,181.584,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1604,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,191.389,204.266,"Well, it would have been easy enough for Congress to have used the language of preempting state law determining rates or setting rates or something of that kind, but it didn't."
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,215.741,238.654,"--Yes, Your Honor, we urge the Court not to apply the same interpretation precepts to the Federal Aviation Act as this Court has indeed applied in the ERISA context, for the very simple reason that ERISA was a very broadly preemptive law because its prime scope was in essence for the Federal Government to occupy the field of regulation of employee benefit plans."
1991.90-1604,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,296.459,310.452,"Well, can you say that advertisement of airline rates and fares does not relate to airline rates and fares?"
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,312.987,313.987,--That's not really the question.
1991.90-1604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,327.83,341.222,"Well, suppose in this case that the State of Texas or some other state had passed a statute containing all of the prohibitions and guidelines set forth in the guidelines that you issued here."
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,343.84,352.112,"As long as those guidelines did not regulate the rates, routes, and services, and I would say they would not, I would think that statute would be valid."
1991.90-1604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,352.829,355.664,"Well, you have to take that position, don't you?"
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,355.664,356.514,--It is convenient.
1991.90-1604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,388.052,391.837,"But I'm troubled about what, the same thing Justice O'Connor asked you."
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,404.311,407.097,"But the guidelines, Your Honor, I mean, it's essentially a false issue."
1991.90-1604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,415.868,436.799,"Well, in order to test that proposition I think we're entitled to inquire as to how far your principle leads, and it seems to me that you simply must take the position that a state could enact a statute which incorporated all of the guidelines that the Attorney Generals' Association issued here."
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,436.799,437.632,"--Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.488,449.607,"Your position goes even further than that, as I understand it."
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,460.897,461.631,I would not assert--
1991.90-1604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,461.631,462.683,It relates to advertising.
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,464.716,467.485,--I do not believe that the state under the current law could do so.
1991.90-1604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.587,472.122,"Why is that, even though it only relates to advertising and does not relate to rates?"
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,472.122,479.359,"--The state consumer protection law, Your Honor, prohibits any industry, not the airlines, and that's one important point."
1991.90-1604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.834,496.487,So you abandon your argument that the mere fact that it does not relate to rates is dispositive of this case?
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,496.487,497.604,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor?"
1991.90-1604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.604,508.645,It seems to me if you're going to take that position you must abandon the argument that the mere fact that it relates to advertising demonstrates that it does not relate to rates.
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,508.645,509.528,"Well, as I said earlier--"
1991.90-1604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,509.528,516.15,It can relate to advertising and relate to rates by reason of the fact that it relates to advertising.
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,516.15,519.102,"--It would require a two step bootstrapping argument, and--"
1991.90-1604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,519.102,529.892,But you acknowledge that that two step bootstrapping argument is valid with respect to a law that prohibits the advertising of airfares.
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,529.892,531.094,"--No, Your Honor, I am--"
1991.90-1604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,531.094,531.428,No you don't?
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,538.647,542.033,"--My argument is focused on what the State did do here, Your Honor."
1991.90-1604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.661,568.417,"Aside from the First Amendment, what is your position on a state law that says no airline rates shall be advertised?"
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,568.417,573.588,"I would say that the state could do that, and Congress could then act to prohibit that action."
1991.90-1604,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,575.022,582.86,"Mr. Gardner, did the district court in its injunction refer in terms to the NAAG guidelines?"
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,582.86,585.878,"--No, Your Honor, although the airlines advise the Court that they did."
1991.90-1604,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,594.751,598.036,Which would be general fraud statutes and that sort of thing.
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,598.036,603.34,"--The way we read it, Your Honor, it's any statute, whether it's a criminal statute, a licensing statute."
1991.90-1604,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,621.818,623.337,Where is the injunction?
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,630.943,632.776,I apologize for not having it handy.
1991.90-1604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,632.776,635.395,Is that 8(a) of the appendix to the petition for certiorari?
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,635.395,636.847,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1991.90-1604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,722.869,728.523,"Could states, after the act was passed, regulate intrastate carriage by airlines?"
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,728.523,730.057,"No, Your Honor."
1991.90-1604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,730.057,746.984,"But then the act goes beyond merely undoing what the CAB had been doing, because when the CAB was in effect the CAB regulated interstate fares and the states were entitled to regulate intrastate fares, right?"
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,746.984,747.534,Absolutely.
1991.90-1604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,747.534,750.936,And the new act says no regulation of intrastate fares.
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,750.936,754.072,"Because Congress intended no regulation of fares, period, regardless of--"
1991.90-1604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,754.072,763.511,"They want a competitive regime, which is consonant with the notion that they wanted competitive advertising too."
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,763.511,770.267,--Competitive advertising can only exist if the advertising is truthful and is not deceptive.
1991.90-1604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,790.93,808.059,"So true is, as the Government points out, that if you're practically disempowered from advertising because you are compelled to include within your notice all of the exceptions that may exist on various routes, you as a practical matter can't have any advertising."
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,808.059,808.525,Your Honor--
1991.90-1604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.525,810.375,"And state law could do that, I suppose."
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,823.818,825.518,"--There is no prohibition there, Your Honor."
1991.90-1604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,914.994,915.661,That's up to the state.
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,928.136,928.519,"--Yes, Your Honor--"
1991.90-1604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,928.519,930.004,I'm just trying to see where your principle leads.
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,952.786,970.748,"--Your Honor, all we are seeking here today is a declaration that the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act as written and as enforced, or attempted to be enforced in this case, is not preempted because as written and as enforced it does not regulate and therefore does not relate to the rates, routes, and services."
1991.90-1604,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,992.244,998.732,"That's a point that the airline could raise in the state case that was brought against it, I suppose?"
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,998.732,999.398,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1035.607,1069.761,"Well, you don't get to the jury until you have a valid state enforcement proceeding, and it seems to me that your position must be that California can require one size of type on airline advertisings, that Texas can require another size of type, and that Arizona can require a third type of type with an added disclosure, and that every one of those state statutes would be valid as a state enforcement of its laws against deceptive practices."
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,1069.761,1070.244,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1070.244,1071.03,That has to be your position.
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,1071.03,1071.846,Absolutely.
1991.90-1604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1079.636,1094.812,"If the state laws contain the provisions that I have hypothesized were enacted, would they or would they not be preempted under the existing Federal statutes?"
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,1094.812,1105.935,"I would say, Your Honor, that they would not, but I would also say in that instance in my own opinion that that is when it's appropriate for the Department of Transportation to step in and preempt us."
1991.90-1604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1110.488,1110.771,All right.
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,1119.277,1125.415,"--Your Honor, the airlines... this case came to the Court on virtually no factual evidence at all."
1991.90-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1183.97,1188.005,May I ask you a question that was raised by your response to Justice Kennedy?
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,1196.511,1197.713,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.713,1199.829,Pursuant to what authority?
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,1199.829,1209.335,"We believe that the Department has intrinsic authority under, as the interpreter of the Federal Aviation Act, to say that this--"
1991.90-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1209.335,1211.271,To go out and preempt a lot of state laws?
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,1224.88,1226.713,--I am speculating that they could do that.
1991.90-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1233.183,1244.591,"What if you had, say, not an airline industry, say in the automobile industry that all the automobile companies wanted, were subjected to a lot of conflicting regulations on advertising, the same kind of thing Justice Kennedy suggested."
1991.90-1604,0,41384,stephen_gardner,,1248.245,1253.28,--I believe the Federal Trade Commission would assert to this Court that it did have that intrinsic authority.
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1654.24,1657.375,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1604,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1696.317,1711.927,"Mr. Jones, do I gather from your first point that you feel it's necessary to your case to show that the State here was intending to implement the NAAG guidelines and not just general fraud statutes or deceptive advertising statutes?"
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1711.927,1734.606,"I don't think that's integral to our argument, but I think that it's important to inform the Court what the case is really about, because the State takes the position that it has been enjoined from enforcing its consumer protection laws generally, and we brought this case specifically targeted at those eight postscriptions that are articulated in the NAAG guidelines."
1991.90-1604,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1734.606,1739.41,Do you support the breadth of the injunction issued by the district court here?
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1739.41,1744.112,The states are concerned about the breadth of the ordering paragraph in the injunction--
1991.90-1604,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1744.112,1744.398,Yes.
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1746.564,1773.149,"--I don't think that the ordering paragraph as such was correctly written, but I think that if you read that paragraph, not in isolation but in the context of what the district court said earlier in the text of the same order and also read it in light of the complaint which narrowly focuses on the NAAG guidelines, you will agree with us that the proper construction of the injunction is that it just bars the State--"
1991.90-1604,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1773.149,1783.439,"Rule 65 is quite precise that the injunction was set out not in the light of something else, but very precisely, exactly what is enjoined."
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1795.331,1798.116,--This order was very broadly phrased.
1991.90-1604,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1812.876,1815.244,Even though the order did not mention the NAAG guidelines?
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1815.244,1827.135,"Well, actually the order does mention the NAAG guidelines twice in its first paragraphs, but what counsel for the State has focused your attention on is the particular ordering language of the injunction."
1991.90-1604,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1836.074,1846.68,"Yes, but Mr. Jones, isn't it your position that the consumer protection laws are generally preempted insofar as they apply to airline advertising of rates?"
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1846.68,1850.668,It may be that in a future case this Court will so hold.
1991.90-1604,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1850.668,1852.268,But isn't that your position in this case?
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1855.536,1873.664,"Our argument is that the particular restrictions placed upon airfare advertising by these guidelines themselves are plainly barred, whatever application state consumer protection law may have in other contexts."
1991.90-1604,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.664,1887.655,"I don't understand why you just don't argue that insofar as the consumer protection laws are enforced against, are attempted to be enforced against airline advertising it's just preempted."
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1899.213,1918.359,"We think the consumer protection laws as they apply to airfare advertising are preempted, but the analysis that we set forth is an attempt to show why these guidelines in particular interfere with the pro-competitive policy of the statute."
1991.90-1604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.359,1924.43,"What about consumer protection laws as they apply to the sale of tickets, never mind advertising?"
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1935.821,1941.308,On the face of it you would think that they were as closely related.
1991.90-1604,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2077.847,2094.725,"Mr. Jones, I think we've had a little difficulty this afternoon in getting either you or Mr. Gardner to articulate for us the guiding principle to be used by us in resolving this case."
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2178.479,2189.002,"I was trying to get to where you draw the line with respect to the NAAG guidelines, and then let me discuss the broader question that you have raised, Justice O'Connor."
1991.90-1604,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2274.96,2278.412,"Well, does that include state income tax laws?"
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2278.412,2281.197,I don't think that it does.
1991.90-1604,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2281.197,2284.248,Does Texas have an income tax law?
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2284.248,2287.95,"Texas does not have an income tax law, to my knowledge."
1991.90-1604,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2287.95,2289.885,"But other states do, of course."
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2289.885,2290.319,That's right.
1991.90-1604,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2297.206,2302.793,Zoning laws?
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2303.677,2326.408,"--I think that our position is that the formulation relating to naturally encompasses all state laws whose enforcement would be likely, likely to affect the actual level of rates or the routes or services in a manner that was contrary to the underlying pro-competitive policy of the Deregulation Act."
1991.90-1604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2339.383,2348.841,"That's the problem that I see in your argument, Mr. Jones, that your theory does not accord with the statutory text that you're using to implement it."
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2380.21,2400.041,"We're suggesting that the statute has to be applied in the same way as the ERISA statute, and in those ERISA cases the Court has looked at the operation of state law, has analyzed the operation of state law in relation to the objectives of the Federal statute."
1991.90-1604,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2426.791,2443.734,"Your opponent, Mr. Jones, suggests that Congress, in enacting the ERISA statute, intended to, quote, occupy the field, whereas here congressional intent was not the same, and that therefore the phrases, though identical language, should not be read the same in the two acts."
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2445.836,2455.874,"Our response is that in this context the difference between regulation and deregulation is, the distinction is one without a difference."
1991.90-1604,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2487.496,2498.137,"How about section 1506 of Title 49 that says nothing contained in this chapter shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but this provision of this or in addition--"
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2498.137,2499.92,That's something of an anomaly.
1991.90-1604,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2522.086,2525.621,--Are you suggesting it was repealed by implication?
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2525.621,2535.06,"--Well, to some extent any later enacted preemption clause will be incompatible with the full breadth of an earlier savings clause."
1991.90-1604,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2543.047,2545.432,Perhaps only if you read the preemption clause the way you do.
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2545.432,2546.799,"No, I don't think so."
1991.90-1604,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2556.14,2559.926,"Mr. Jones, can I ask you a question to be sure I understand your theory?"
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2572.066,2574.851,"That's essentially correct, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1991.90-1604,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2574.851,2588.195,"And I take it you would also say that, say regulation, state regulations prohibited obscene advertising or advertising of liquor in conjunction with airline travel in the terminal would not be preempted if it didn't have any significant burden?"
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2594.932,2597.717,"We're not claiming that here, no."
1991.90-1604,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2597.717,2601.853,It's got to be sufficiently burdensome to affect the rate making process?
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2601.853,2604.621,I'm not sure if burdensome is the word that I would choose.
1991.90-1604,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2621.599,2623.618,I'm not sure there's a big difference between what you said and what I said.
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2623.618,2624.834,--Perhaps there isn't.
1991.90-1604,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2661.973,2669.479,"If you emphasize burden rather than the content of the ads, you seem to admit that a lot of ads could be regulated that mention rates in the airline terminal and the like."
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2684.656,2701.198,"Well, Congress did specifically provide that the states could continue to impose certain kinds of taxes and it also provided that their proprietary control over airports and their regulations issued in connection with that were not preempted."
1991.90-1604,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.127,2720.162,What exemption are you talking about now?
1991.90-1604,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2722.198,2727.066,"With respect to the proprietary operations, that's in the preemption statute itself."
1991.90-1604,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2826.865,2829.717,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2866.99,2871.96,"Well now, does that go so far as to say they can't regulate obscene advertising in the airport?"
1991.90-1604,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2871.96,2876.079,Obscene advertising would not relate to rates in our opinion.
1991.90-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2876.079,2886.304,"I'm talking ads with the rates put on them, or maybe not obscene but the character of the advertising, having people serving liquor, say, at the time some states are concerned about that."
1991.90-1604,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2896.009,2904.765,"Your Honor, I think that the liquor example is a special case because it involves, the states have special authority in that situation."
1991.90-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.835,2913.621,Could they just ban all advertising in the waiting room of the airport--
1991.90-1604,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2913.621,2918.525,"No, Your Honor, they could not ban advertising in the waiting room of the airport."
1991.90-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2918.525,2921.977,"--thinking it's not aesthetically suited to the, you know, to the terminal or something like that?"
1991.90-1604,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2926.279,2948.127,"There are, there is an exemption in the act for the rights exercised by proprietors of airports, state proprietors, and on reflection I think that the sorts of regulations that have to do with the maintenance of the environment in the airport, like the anti noise regulation, would be within that exemption."
1991.90-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2948.127,2951.429,"But I'm talking about advertising by, not by the proprietor, by the airline."
1991.90-1604,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2951.429,2956.983,"Well, the proprietor I believe has proprietary rights to maintain the airport."
1991.90-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2966.339,2966.672,"No, no, no."
1991.90-1604,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2978.646,2979.413,"No, Your Honor."
1991.90-1604,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3012.218,3019.973,"What if one of those ads is seriously misleading, not in one of the ways set forth in the guidelines, but it just lies."
1991.90-1604,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,3030.012,3062.317,"Your Honor, the line that the Department draws with respect to that is if the misrepresentation is a situation in which the airline fails to produce on a contractual promise, in other words if I walk up to the ticket counter and I am told that if I give you 100 dollars you'll deposit me in San Francisco, and in fact you drop me off in Chicago, that I have an action under state law to enforce my contract to be, to have the terms of the contract enforced."
1991.90-1604,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3082.697,3086.266,So the problem with the guidelines is that they use tort law instead of contract law?
1991.90-1604,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,3101.71,3122.541,"--Your Honor, no, because Federal law specifies the nature of the contract of carriage between an individual and an air carrier, so that there would not be a way around this for the states simply to recast law regulating deceptive advertising in the form of contract law."
1991.90-1604,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3122.541,3138.967,"What if the airline advertises Dallas to Washington, D.C., 100 dollars, and I show up for a ticket and they say well, no, it's 200 dollars, we just didn't mean what we said in that ad."
1991.90-1604,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,3142.621,3143.887,"Your Honor, no."
1991.90-1604,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3162.016,3165.201,But the answer given isn't that there are no seats.
1991.90-1604,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,3174.224,3191.435,"Again, that would be preempted is our position, preempted because the regulation of what is said about fares, deceptive practices is a, that is an area that is committed to the Department of Transportation."
1991.90-1604,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3262.364,3268.685,Do you support the affirmance of the injunction as written and issued by the court below?
1991.90-1604,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,3268.685,3278.541,"--Your Honor, again, we agree with the airline that it, that read as a whole it can be read more narrowly than the ordering paragraph."
1991.90-1604,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3311.595,3315.416,So you think a remand is necessary?
1991.90-1604,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,3315.416,3321.92,Again it's our position that read as a whole the order captures the more limited meaning.
1991.90-1604,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3325.772,3335.061,"Mr. Nightingale, before you sit down I would like to just have some description of the principle by which we should decide these cases."
1991.90-1604,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,3335.061,3335.561,"Right, Your Honor."
1991.90-1604,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3335.561,3336.344,And I haven't heard it.
1991.90-1604,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,3342.065,3344.665,Let me suggest that we take ERISA as a starting point.
1991.90-1604,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3412.911,3414.344,"Thank you, Mr. Nightingale."
1991.90-1604,3,41384,stephen_gardner,,3419.398,3429.771,"To address Justice O'Connor's request for a principle, I apologize for not laying it out and I will observe that it seems to me strikingly similar to the one the airlines announced."
1991.90-1604,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3476.002,3477.285,What about just the guidelines?
1991.90-1604,3,41384,stephen_gardner,,3485.674,3495.196,"There is no record of any effect of any of the, whether the guidelines or the actual enforcement of the state law."
1991.90-1604,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3517.245,3518.112,"Thank you, Mr. Gardner."
