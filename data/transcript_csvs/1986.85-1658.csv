1986.85-1658,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.372,"We will hear arguments next in two consolidated cases, Federal Communications Commission against Florida Power Corporation; and Group W. Cable against Florida Power Corporation."
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,71.987,77.563,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,273.593,274.468,Voluntarily?
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,282.31,287.167,"I don't know the answer to that question, Mr. Justice."
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,287.167,288.494,I'd be very surprised if they didn't.
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,291.259,305.457,"The recent amendments require sharing of the rights of way, but doesn't refer to a requirement that an attachment be made to the poles."
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.814,317.703,Do we know that all the contracts at issue here were not entered into under compulsion of State law?
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,317.703,322.983,--There is no indication in the record that there was any compulsion.
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.482,325.169,Nor that there wasn't?
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,325.169,329.996,--The appellees voluntarily wished to rent the excess space on their poles.
1986.85-1658,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,347.693,358.471,"Mr. Wallace, does the act and does the FCC permit a utility company to terminate a pole attachment lease?"
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,358.471,375.932,"There is no doubt that if the contracts, as they typically do and as these do, give the utility company the right to reclaim the space for its own purposes, that it can do that."
1986.85-1658,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,390.927,407.232,"Do you take the position that under the act the utility company may make a termination for some reason other than a pretextual one to avoid the act, can terminate?"
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,407.232,410.839,The Commission has not yet taken a position on that.
1986.85-1658,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,446.358,452.246,"Well, do you think the answer to that may be a factor in knowing whether there's been a taking?"
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,452.246,455.244,It may in a case that raises that.
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,462.117,477.407,"Well, let's talk about termination for what your brief and the FCC calls a pretextual reason, that is, terminating simply because the utility just doesn't believe the amount of money it's getting from this thing is worth its trouble."
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,477.407,479.813,That's what this case--
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,479.813,480.75,That's right.
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,480.75,482.139,--resembles.
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,482.139,485.123,Is there any doubt that that would be prohibited by the FCC?
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,485.123,488.091,There's... there's no doubt that it would be prohibited.
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,494.542,502.774,"But is that a condition to their asserting that this is not a voluntary arrangement, as you're maintaining it is?"
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,528.158,530.312,We're not saying that they volunteered to rent it at this price.
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,535.093,536.812,"Oh, well, I see."
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,536.812,539.264,And that this is a compatible purpose with the use of their poles.
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,539.264,542.325,Don't you think it's important that they volunteered to do it for a price?
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,542.325,549.057,"Well, this is precisely the distinction that this case turns on."
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.565,571.44,xxx the purpose for which they rented it was to make money on it.
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,575.47,579.25,That is the only purpose for which they are selling electricity to their other customers.
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,579.25,579.656,Of course.
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,579.656,581.234,But the rates are still regulated.
1986.85-1658,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,588.138,602.04,"Mr. Wallace, before you go on, if the State undertook to regulate the rate itself, would the Federal commission then not regulate the rate of return?"
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,602.04,602.712,That is correct.
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,615.708,626.563,"Mr. Wallace, in the rates that the FCC... the statute sets forth what the rates that the FCC... the range that the FCC can impose, right?"
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,631.951,634.217,"--Incremental costs, we call it, yes."
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,634.217,634.545,Right.
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,636.81,653.036,"No, Your Honor, they have taken the position that if they are reducing the rate from the contract rate, they can only reduce it to the maximum allowable under the statute, which is the so-called fully allocated cost."
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,666.891,669.171,"It does include fully distributed cost, then?"
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,669.171,670.405,It does.
1986.85-1658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,923.791,950.359,"So you would... I take it you would suggest, then, that if the... if the utilities said to the commission, we don't like the rates you're allowing, we're going to get out of the business of renting to these people, and the FCC said, sorry, no, you can't do that, even if it were a taking, there would be just compensation in their price formula?"
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,950.359,953.577,"That is our position, Mr. Justice."
1986.85-1658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,961.028,969.119,"And the same thing would go for the company... for a utility that had never been in the business, and didn't want to get into the business, and the FCC ordered it to get into the business?"
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,969.119,978.239,"--That would follow under that approach to it, that that would amount to a taking for a public use for which just compensation was provided."
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,991.735,997.749,Do we have to approve the entire statutory formula in order to agree if you here?
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1007.339,1014.477,There would be a problem if there were a taking.
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1020.865,1021.459,0 xxx.
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1021.459,1022.709,--That is correct.
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1023.303,1033.769,In Hope Natural Gas could the utility commission have allowed the gas company to charge only marginal cost for all of its products?
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1049.202,1051.139,--The two questions are intertwined.
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1058.246,1067.493,And not it not be confiscatory to allow only marginal costs where you yourself are not assuring the obtaining of more than average costs somewhere else?
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1067.493,1084.97,In the Permian Basin cases the Court did say that the statutory inquiry in what is a just and reasonable rate basically coincides with the Constitutional standard of just compensation.
1986.85-1658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1084.97,1086.22,"You're sure that's not here, though?"
1986.85-1658,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1091.186,1098.872,"Well, I think it's here in the sense that we submit that the statute does provide a nonconfiscatory system of rate regulation."
1986.85-1658,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1102.34,1103.152,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1986.85-1658,1,32517,jay_e_ricks,,1105.246,1109.821,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1325.109,1332.325,"Mr. Ricks, did the contract give the utility the right to simply go out of the business of renting to cable TV people?"
1986.85-1658,1,32517,jay_e_ricks,,1332.325,1347.288,"Mr. Chief Justice, the contract has a term in it for, I believe, five years, and then renewable, six months or year increments after that; at which time, presumably, it could, if it wished to, go out of that business."
1986.85-1658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1374.512,1376.275,"They wouldn't make it a matter of principle, so to speak?"
1986.85-1658,1,32517,jay_e_ricks,,1376.275,1379.165,"--Well, that seemed to be the observation."
1986.85-1658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1397.345,1406.607,"Excuse me, what about a failure... a failure to renew, because of the fact that the company is just not satisfied with the amount that it's getting?"
1986.85-1658,1,32517,jay_e_ricks,,1410.153,1416.479,"--The... Justice Scalia, the utility has the right to obtain fully allocated costs."
1986.85-1658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1434.174,1437.923,"I don't know, maybe because they say, you know, we're rate regulated anyway."
1986.85-1658,1,32517,jay_e_ricks,,1456.496,1466.18,"Well, that is absolutely correct that the utility is not going to be enriched by exacting more money from the cable operator, but it's merely a--"
1986.85-1658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1466.18,1468.226,Suppose they do that and the State lets them get away with it?
1986.85-1658,1,32517,jay_e_ricks,,1470.271,1472.88,--The FCC is not presented with that case.
1986.85-1658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1492.998,1500.621,"In Munn v. Illinois, could the railroads have simply said, we're going to get... or the grain storage warehousemen simply said, we're going to get out of this business?"
1986.85-1658,1,32517,jay_e_ricks,,1505.431,1517.364,"This Court has dealt with that in rent control cases, and has said that a property owner can not get out of the ambit of regulation simply by saying, I'm going to cease renting my property."
1986.85-1658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1682.382,1684.785,"Thank you, Mr. Ricks."
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,1687.143,1695.094,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1658,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1819.499,1820.249,Perhaps not finally.
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,1828.153,1830.278,"I don't think it can, Your Honor."
1986.85-1658,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.651,1886.274,"But why can't the Court of Appeals, reviewing a decision of the FCC, make just that sort of inquiry?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,1886.274,1908.764,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, the difficulty with that is because the FCC is not having a proceeding before it with a wide open record in which it's permitting evidence to come in that would be relevant to the inquiry of just compensation; for example, evidence as to market price; evidence as to what we charge other customers."
1986.85-1658,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1910.139,1921.463,"Well, couldn't the Court of Appeals so indicate in an opinion reviewing the compensation award in a particular case that there was not enough evidence allowed in to really decide what just compensation was?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,1921.463,1931.974,"Well, what the Eleventh Circuit was saying in this case, Your Honor, is that the statutory scheme is such that that kind of evidence can never end up being presented before the FCC."
1986.85-1658,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1938.691,1944.829,"Well, but we don't really have to deal with every conceivable configuration of facts that might come up."
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,1955.169,1956.825,"Your Honor, I think that's correct."
1986.85-1658,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2011.915,2016.318,"Then your position here is somewhat different than that taken by the Eleventh Circuit, isn't it?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2016.318,2017.333,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2149.988,2162.328,"Well, I take it... I take it you would say that no court could ever define that fully distributed costs would afford reasonable compensation?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2162.328,2164.934,"--Justice White, what I'm saying is that--"
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2164.934,2166.699,"Well, is that what you're saying or not?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2166.699,2176.04,--What I'm saying is that the court can't say that allocated costs will constitute just compensation in all cases.
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2176.04,2177.305,"Well, but could it ever?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2177.305,2180.46,"It's conceivable in a case, perhaps... perhaps--"
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.46,2182.099,"Well, what about this case?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2182.099,2190.315,"--I don't think it can, because in this case the FCC was operating with a very, very narrow standard and very narrow--"
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2190.315,2191.627,"Well, that may be so."
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2211.042,2212.417,"--Well, Your Honor, the court couldn't--"
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.417,2213.399,Could the court have said that?
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2213.399,2214.227,--I don't think so.
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2214.227,2218.632,"Because you haven't had a... you weren't allowed to make a record, is that it?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2218.632,2219.694,That's precisely correct.
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2233.049,2240.14,"Well, the Court of Appeals said this was a judicial task, not an administrative task to... that's what they said, isn't it?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2240.14,2240.732,--That's correct.
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.732,2241.795,Classically a judicial task?
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2248.872,2251.185,"I don't believe, Your Honor, that a court can perform--"
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.185,2252.263,Then what would be your objection?
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2257.449,2273.365,"--No, Your Honor, my objection would be that the statutory scheme doesn't permit the FCC to make the kind of broad-ranging inquiry; it doesn't permit that kind of factual determination before the FCC to permit that kind of record."
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2293.314,2302.171,So you're saying that we can't... we can't decide whether these rates are compensatory or not?
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2302.171,2315.323,"In the same sense, Your Honor, if Congress passed a law that said homeowners... somebody purchased a piece of property for $50,000; put $10,000 in it in terms of costs and improvements."
1986.85-1658,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2336.096,2345.857,"But would we simply throw out the statute as a whole, or would we say, it may well be bad as applied to some cases, but we're going to decide on a case-by-case basis?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2345.857,2359.32,"Your Honor... and I recognize, of course, it's only as a last resort that we throw out a statute, but I think that we couldn't make the inquiry in a case-by-case interpretation without rewriting the statute."
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2359.32,2384.966,"Why wouldn't you be... why wouldn't you be satisfied with a... if you won, in the sense that... that we would say that just compensation is not measured... necessarily measured by allocating costs, and that the record is insufficient, and send it back to the FCC or send it back to some court to determine?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2384.966,2390.121,"Well, the difficulty with that is... I mean, I'd obviously be happy with the victory."
1986.85-1658,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2398.056,2403.476,"Well, Mr. Topol, all of this argument, it seems to me, presupposes there's been a taking."
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2446.946,2453.38,"Your Honor, let me address that taking issue and respond to your question, because in a sense, you're absolutely correct."
1986.85-1658,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2468.188,2475.824,"Well, but it is different because the utilities and the cable companies willingly entered into leases originally."
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2481.104,2483.134,"--Your Honor, I have two responses to that."
1986.85-1658,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2509.578,2511.248,How does that differ from rent control?
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2511.248,2517.621,"--Well, Your Honor, I think it differs under the distinction that this Court made in the Loretto case."
1986.85-1658,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2546.516,2552.811,I think you have a real hurdle to get over on the compulsory aspects of Loretto which aren't present here.
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2552.811,2565.306,"Well, Your Honor, with respect to the compulsory aspects of Loretto, as to whether we put them on, there was a dialogue on the opening colloquy on the question of, can we take them off?"
1986.85-1658,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2633.672,2641.574,"Well, how does that differ from typical restrictions against retaliatory evictions under rent control laws?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2641.574,2644.089,"--Well, it's not retaliatory evictions."
1986.85-1658,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2691.101,2692.382,"Mr. Topol, a lot of utilities can't do that."
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2726.838,2727.416,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1658,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2744.161,2746.768,"But a landlord is, for all of that, not a public utility."
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2746.768,2749.032,"Well, it's not, Your Honor, but--"
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2749.032,2761.762,"Well, why should this utility get any more... why should its rates for renting on poles be established by any different formula than is used for selling gas or electricity?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2761.762,2768.025,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, that comes back to the question of whether or not there's been a taking, I mean which I think is the initial question."
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2774.601,2787.971,And... why would that measure of just compensation be any different for pole rental than for setting the rates for gas?
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2787.971,2794.766,"Because this Court has spoken in a number of cases, Your Honor, as to what just compensation means in a Constitutional sense."
1986.85-1658,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2805.715,2807.699,"But we've said something different in utility cases, for some reason."
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2825.52,2827.973,"But Your Honor, let me respond to the two points."
1986.85-1658,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2884.109,2896.167,"I suppose, then, that the States would be acting unconstitutionally if they only allowed the utilities to get fully distributed for the stringing of... for allowing telephone companies to string their wires on their poles?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2907.336,2919.161,"No, but there is a different situation in that the telephone companies are subject to a State regulation across the board, I mean, which is a difference; whereas the CATV companies aren't."
1986.85-1658,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2942.805,2946.399,"Mr. Topol, does this statute require your client to make any new attachments?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2946.399,2951.366,"It doesn't require them to make any new attachments, no, the statute--"
1986.85-1658,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2951.366,2957.847,Did the statute in Loretto require landlords who did not previously have cables affixed to them--
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2957.847,2958.753,--I believe it did.
1986.85-1658,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2958.753,2960.689,--So isn't that a rather important difference?
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2960.689,2962.846,"Well, with this statute... I don't think so, Your Honor."
1986.85-1658,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2969.875,2977.779,"But one is a statute that only applies that have been accepted voluntarily, and the other is a statute that compels the landlord to accept those he didn't want."
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2977.779,2979.387,"Well, I guess there are two distinctions, Your Honor."
1986.85-1658,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2984.808,2987.635,I understand on the particular facts of that particular landlord.
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2991.993,2995.992,"--Yes, but in this situation, Your Honor, what is it Florida Power agreed to do?"
1986.85-1658,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2996.632,2997.179,A different price.
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,2997.179,2998.913,"--Yes, it agreed to put them on at $7."
1986.85-1658,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2998.913,3000.195,And you say that you're compelled to stay in business.
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,3002.584,3003.303,That's correct.
1986.85-1658,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3003.303,3007.083,And why isn't the State statute a taking by an equal... by the same argument?
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,3007.083,3018.846,"Well, Your Honor... well, I guess because the courts have provided in a number of cases, most importantly, from Florida as well, that the business of renting space on poles is not part of our public utility business."
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3032.342,3035.902,"If a State said to the contrary, would it be unconstitutional?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,3035.902,3040.87,I think if there was a State... yes.
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3044.103,3050.445,"Well, they just said, we're going to treat your pole rentals just like we do everything else, as part of your utility operation."
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,3050.445,3050.882,--Yes--
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3050.882,3055.256,And we're going to fix the rates on the same formula.
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,3055.256,3068.267,"--Yes, Your Honor, if they said that, then we would argue, because this is not part of our utility business, that there would be a taking, and we would have a right to just compensation in a Fifth Amendment sense."
1986.85-1658,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3068.267,3071.469,"Well, is the question of whether it's part of your utility business a question of Federal Constitutional law?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,3077.046,3082.513,"I suppose it could, Your Honor, but no courts to my knowledge have done that."
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3092.619,3101.445,"I know, but it's unconstitutional, I take, under your view, for Congress to treat this part of your utility business?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,3101.445,3103.164,That's correct.
1986.85-1658,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3105.818,3108.785,"Maybe no court has treated it that way, but Congress seems to have."
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,3108.785,3109.566,--Congress has.
1986.85-1658,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3156.3,3167.967,"But Mr. Topol, here you have a situation where the utility company with the power poles and the easements has the only access possible for cable television to use."
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,3179.008,3180.227,"--No, Your Honor, I'm not."
1986.85-1658,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3192.115,3196.191,"Well, that depends on whether it's a taking rather than a monopoly regulation."
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,3196.191,3197.113,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1658,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3367.266,3384.276,"If it's not a Loretto taking, though, if it's a Hope Natural Gas taking, if it's that kind of a taking, in that area, it's always the legislature or a State agency that makes the determination of what's just compensation, isn't it?"
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,3384.276,3385.104,--That's correct.
1986.85-1658,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3385.104,3386.478,Which a court simply reviews?
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,3386.478,3387.306,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1658,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3396.132,3399.584,But there's clearly nothing inherent in takings that requires the Court to have the first cut at it.
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,3409.3,3416.517,"--Well, the agency can have the first cut at it if the agency's standard is just compensation in a Constitutional sense."
1986.85-1658,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3420.624,3421.67,It's not the agency's standard.
1986.85-1658,2,17108,allan_j_topol,,3426.091,3429.106,"--Well, here the Agency's operating under the standard that Congress set."
1986.85-1658,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3431.606,3435.871,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace, you have three minutes."
1986.85-1658,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3435.871,3446.727,"Mr. Wallace, I hate to cut in on your time, but it would help me if you could tell me what standard should be applied on judicial review in determining whether the rate is just and reasonable?"
1986.85-1658,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3446.727,3453.35,The same standard that's applied in Permian Basic and Hope Natural Gas.
1986.85-1658,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3453.35,3453.693,Same basis as is applied in Hope Natural Gas?
1986.85-1658,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3453.693,3454.833,Exactly the same standard.
1986.85-1658,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3454.833,3457.427,What effect would the formula have on the application of that standard?
1986.85-1658,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3457.427,3464.237,It provides guidance for the commission that the court should review the adequacy of to meet that standard.
1986.85-1658,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3526.701,3527.888,We'll resume at one o'clock.
