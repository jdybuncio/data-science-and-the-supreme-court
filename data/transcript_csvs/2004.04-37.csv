2004.04-37,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,5.656,We'll now hear argument in Clingman against Beaver.
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,8.795,31.745,"Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-37,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,86.542,114.035,"Well, of course, I guess from the standpoint of the Libertarian Party, it's kind of a problem because a voter who wants to disaffiliate under Oklahoma law with their... their prior registration have to do it basically 8 weeks ahead, at which time they don't know if the Libertarian Party will even qualify for having a primary."
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,127.781,142.27,"Well, Your Honor, the practicality of that matter is... is that generally the parties are notified 10 days/2 weeks in advance of the registration deadline that they are being... if... being recognized as a political party."
2004.04-37,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,159.61,162.954,"If they're turned in earlier, will they... will they be ruled on earlier?"
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,162.954,163.204,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-37,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,181.984,187.353,I guess there's a difference here between the interest of a small party and a large one.
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,207.702,209.105,"No, Your Honor."
2004.04-37,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,221.67,233.421,"In line... in line with Justice Breyer's question, does the State of Oklahoma have an interest in insulating major parties from competition for members?"
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,233.421,241.51,"Not from insulating them from competition, Your Honor, but the State of Oklahoma does have... it has a closed primary system."
2004.04-37,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,253.566,266.364,So you have a... the State has an interest in protecting major parties from losing their members and thereby weakening the two-party system by benefitting a third party.
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,277.881,293.939,"--Well, Your Honor, since that time in Anderson and as Timmons and other cases cite, if the regulation is a neutral, nondiscriminatory regulation, then it is a proper regulation as far as it is applied to all the parties."
2004.04-37,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,329.234,336.376,"Well, even in presidential elections, most people don't get interested until 4 or 5 weeks before the election."
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,338.067,342.487,"--Well, Your Honor, we... this is not the presidential primaries of which we're talking about."
2004.04-37,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,342.487,344.771,"Well, I'm saying even in a presidential primary."
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,350.661,387.896,"Well, the statutes in this... or the sites or the... the elections themselves are close in time, and... and the statutes involving the petitioning have all been looked at as... as courts and have been found that this is a close enough connection to the time of the elections, that that time frame of petitioning and getting the requirements for... for petitions and the State recognizing the political party all fit comfortably within the confines of... of constitutionality."
2004.04-37,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,387.896,397.201,"Mr. Poe, the... the district court in this case rejected all grounds except one."
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,455.346,457.554,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-37,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,476.789,486.72,"Well, when you... would you say that the rationale on which the district court rejected the Libertarian Party's claim was unsatisfactory?"
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,486.72,488.04,"No, Your Honor."
2004.04-37,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,541.212,543.191,"Mr. Poe, I... I suppose... here I am."
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,543.191,544.388,"--Excuse me, Justice Scalia."
2004.04-37,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,544.388,576.793,"I suppose that if... if I were the party chairman of the Republican or Democratic Party, I'm... I might have defended your... your State system if I had been named as a party, but if I were not named as a party, I'm not sure that I wouldn't... I wouldn't decline to come in as an amicus, even though I'm interested in the outcome simply because I don't want to alienate my Republican members by depriving them of the freedom, if they want to do it, to go vote."
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,594.172,595.658,"I would agree, Your Honor."
2004.04-37,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,599.001,601.109,"They are, after all, politicians, aren't they?"
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,601.275,604.703,--And they do like to keep their party members as happy as they can.
2004.04-37,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,604.703,608.418,"Mr. Poe, may I just focus in on exactly what the injury is?"
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,613.702,618.139,"The... the injury is twofold, Your Honor."
2004.04-37,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,643.485,650.423,"But wouldn't it be precisely the same injury if they just didn't like the Republican candidate in that particular election, decided to stay home?"
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,650.423,658.225,"--Well, if they had already made the decision to stay home, then they would not be voting for the candidate, but they would also not be voting in another party's primary."
2004.04-37,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,658.225,663.881,"But how... how are they hurt by the fact that rather than staying home, they decide to cast a vote for a minority party candidate?"
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,663.881,670.735,"Well, the party is here because it has the... the possibility, for those who are not voting, of changing the elections of the candidates."
2004.04-37,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,671.971,677.051,"Well, it's very unlikely if it's a party that is... gets the small vote that this party gets."
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,685.596,697.484,"--Well, because they voted either way of voting... or for voting in the Libertarians and... and not voting, they have changed and possibly have changed, especially when they went to the--"
2004.04-37,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,697.484,706.484,Is there any evidence on the question whether the... the support for the major party candidate is any smaller than it would have been if there had been no Libertarian Party at all?
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,706.484,708.752,--There... there's nothing in the record that supports any of that.
2004.04-37,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,708.752,710.571,And... and a very similar question.
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,721.883,723.164,There... there is nothing in the record.
2004.04-37,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,741.119,744.091,"But that... I mean, the Libertarians are happy to have... take that risk."
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,744.091,744.729,--Yes.
2004.04-37,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,744.729,762.523,"It seems to me if we don't know whether the... the Republicans who are going to migrate to the primary are stay-at-homes or Republican voters, the State has no basis even to say whether in fact the harm it's trying to prevent is going to be affected one way or the other by its rule."
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,762.523,773.708,"Well, I... I think, Your Honor, there... there is a context or... there is belief that it will harm."
2004.04-37,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.422,801.078,"Mr. Poe, I... I... why do you rely only upon the damage to the Republican and Democratic Parties?"
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,844.917,850.201,"--And... and, Your Honor, we... we provided that information and those interests to... to the district court."
2004.04-37,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,858.003,873.607,"It... if it's running as a party, it should run somebody who... who shares the views of the people in that party, which is somebody who is nominated by... by the people in that party, or at least those people, joined by others who are not affiliated with another party."
2004.04-37,0,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,894.04,897.634,"--That... that is the premise, of course, of the voter registration."
2004.04-37,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.275,1060.935,That's fine.
2004.04-37,1,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,1063.164,1071.132,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-37,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1241.538,1262.547,"Well, I guess the one other concern would be the timing in Oklahoma is such that the... the Republican or Democrat who wants to disaffiliate in order to vote with the Libertarians has to do so at a time before the State has decided whether to allow the Libertarian Party on the ballot."
2004.04-37,1,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,1282.155,1285.46,"--Justice O'Connor, I... I think that's really up to the party."
2004.04-37,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1290.95,1296.522,It just seemed to me that it might be more burdensome on the voter in that situation.
2004.04-37,1,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,1296.522,1303.293,"--Yes, I... I think that's true, but again, the burden on the voter depends on what the LPO does."
2004.04-37,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1330.497,1334.129,Let me just ask you to look at the other side of the equation.
2004.04-37,1,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,1344.121,1353.78,"Well, I think... I think the State's interest is what the district court found it to be, and I think the... the district court actually found two interests, not just one."
2004.04-37,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1360.429,1366.412,Do... do you think the... the poaching argument stands up on any... any empirical basis?
2004.04-37,1,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,1366.412,1366.867,I do.
2004.04-37,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1370.21,1372.151,May... let me just add quickly.
2004.04-37,1,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,1384.988,1385.442,--Yes.
2004.04-37,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1400.675,1405.299,"Well, he found that the numbers are such that they could, but did he find... and I'm not sure of this."
2004.04-37,1,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,1413.101,1416.445,--That is implicit in his finding.
2004.04-37,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1440.843,1443.444,Was there a basis in the record for making that finding?
2004.04-37,1,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,1443.444,1443.937,--Yes.
2004.04-37,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1593.538,1595.245,"And that's not permitted in Oklahoma, is it?"
2004.04-37,1,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,1597.929,1598.062,--That's correct.
2004.04-37,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1598.062,1598.517,Yes.
2004.04-37,1,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,1598.517,1599.055,That's correct.
2004.04-37,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1613.089,1615.401,"Well, neither of the major parties has done that in Oklahoma, has it?"
2004.04-37,1,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,1615.401,1621.678,"Not that I'm aware of, but... but it is... but it is a plausible concern that a legislature would have."
2004.04-37,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1623.081,1627.994,"But the question is whether when a minor party like the Libertarians do it, is... is it going to have that effect."
2004.04-37,1,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,1627.994,1633.605,"--Well, there... there's another scenario for... in the California example, for example."
2004.04-37,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1649.375,1655.979,But the cost of that deal would... they'd also run the risk the Democrats would... would migrate also if they made that deal.
2004.04-37,1,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,1655.979,1658.208,--It depends on how they ran... ran the campaign.
2004.04-37,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.294,1675.77,"I apologize for taking your time with a question, but I'm afraid your time is up."
2004.04-37,1,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,1675.77,1676.291,--Thank you.
2004.04-37,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1676.291,1676.784,Yes.
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,1679.635,1685.579,"Justice Stevens, may it please the Court:"
2004.04-37,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1744.279,1744.901,Why is that inconsistent?
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,1768.222,1768.965,And--
2004.04-37,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1768.965,1779.285,"--that the Republicans, in order to have their party work, have to be able to plan a campaign for a stable group of voters."
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,1802.13,1802.858,--Most States--
2004.04-37,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1802.858,1803.517,What's your answer?
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,1804.344,1806.777,"--Justice Breyer, most States have a rule for minor parties."
2004.04-37,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1811.896,1815.573,--The States do but to say that the Constitution... and I'm asking.
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,1836.211,1845.044,"I think in... in Alaska, of course, right now there is a party option where all the parties but the Republicans have opened the primary."
2004.04-37,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1852.558,1861.186,"Well, because they say... what they're thinking, I take it... I don't know what they're really thinking, but I imagine they could be thinking, no, we don't want to open our primary."
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,1874.15,1875.348,--And... and that--
2004.04-37,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1875.348,1878.404,And how can the Constitution tell them that they can't make that judgment?
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,1879.435,1891.323,--I don't think the... I think the Constitution... and the Court has recognized that it is legitimate to protect against raiding because we can all suppose how disloyal voters coming into a party could hurt it.
2004.04-37,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1896.98,1898.838,"Go back to my interest, the one I asserted--"
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,1898.838,1899.414,--Yes.
2004.04-37,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1899.414,1900.407,--which isn't that.
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,1925.504,1933.76,"And, Justice Breyer, that sort of First Amendment view of your voters shows that the party thinks that they own the voters."
2004.04-37,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1943.336,1943.502,"--No, no."
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,1965.877,1976.196,"--I... I think it is flimsy and I'll tell you why because I think paternalistically the State of Oklahoma is way off or the Republican Party, if they thought that way in Alaska, would be off."
2004.04-37,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.678,2013.847,The... the State... the State of Oklahoma doesn't want your party raided.
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2059.878,2062.766,--Because it's... it's not practical on what happens.
2004.04-37,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2125.72,2126.296,Weren't those--
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2126.296,2127.328,--over these other affiliations.
2004.04-37,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2127.328,2135.667,--weren't those who would like to nominate the Libertarian candidate who would attract the most people from the other large party?
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2136.616,2137.442,Who would they attract?
2004.04-37,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2151.371,2165.966,"No, but... but the candidate mostly to attract people from one of the major parties is the candidate that is... is more likely to water down the pure Libertarian message and be closer to the message of the Democratic Party or the Republican Party."
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2167.247,2167.99,--If you can tell--
2004.04-37,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.99,2179.014,--people who come into your primary may want to elect such a candidate so that the Libertarian Party will be strengthened and draw votes away from the other majority--
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2179.014,2188.135,"--Of course, this Court, I think, has recognized that raiding is not a legitimate concern for the State that overcomes a party that would open up."
2004.04-37,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2231.603,2242.627,Do I understand your brief to say that this constitutional rule that you are seeking would be just for the minority party?
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2261.796,2269.376,"--The finding of the Tenth Circuit was, of course, that it applied to these plaintiffs under these particular facts."
2004.04-37,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2300.129,2300.212,--What facts?
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2318.128,2321.843,I do... I do ask that the State legislatures think about what they're doing.
2004.04-37,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2322.958,2323.33,Okay.
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2343.475,2349.13,--I'm saying that I... I don't... I don't think courts should ever go out and look for cases in advance.
2004.04-37,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2350.245,2352.763,"No, but we are... we have got to look around the corner."
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2352.763,2353.673,--about the effects.
2004.04-37,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2353.673,2365.373,"And... and if you're issuing the invitation to come up with a different rule for Republicans and Democrats and Libertarians, I think you're asking for trouble and we would be asking for trouble if we accepted that invitation."
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2365.373,2366.099,No.
2004.04-37,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2372.21,2389.793,"Then... then if you say that... I want you to just respond in detail to the questions that I think Justice Scalia and Justice Souter were asking, as I understand it, putting it dramatically, that if you win this case, Alaska's system becomes the Constitution of the United States."
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2394.213,2401.393,"--Because, number one, first, let's eliminate the 21 States that do not have political party registration."
2004.04-37,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2417.08,2419.848,That's the same as election system... that's the same as Alaska's system.
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2423.108,2430.0,"--Justice Scalia, I respectfully disagree because Alaska, unlike Texas, has political party registration."
2004.04-37,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2593.18,2618.649,"Would there be a way... suppose, for hypothetical purposes, the Court were to say... you got a ruling that said there is no rule in the Constitution that forbids a State, as a general matter, to forbid this cross registration, this jumping, for a reasonable time."
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2647.256,2655.884,"I think that's something reasonable, but in this case it is unreasonable because you simply don't have the opportunity to register."
2004.04-37,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2656.544,2667.401,I thought your case was you want to appeal to people who don't want to register as Libertarians and don't even want to be independent.
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2680.776,2682.262,--That... that is part of the appeal.
2004.04-37,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2702.778,2705.956,The last category could... could register as independents.
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2710.714,2713.276,"--A person can do that, yes."
2004.04-37,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2717.28,2720.168,"Yes, but that you could do right now, and you say that's not enough."
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2725.575,2735.856,"--We would like... first, when you have competition in ideals and in politics, it's always a continuing process, and they're hoping to win all these people over."
2004.04-37,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2818.06,2819.214,What did... what did you seek in this action?
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2834.24,2842.248,"--As... as to the Libertarians, we asked that we have a party-option open primary, which I think is acceptable, and it's what New Hampshire does."
2004.04-37,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2842.248,2848.07,"So more... more time might be... might be a good idea, but that wouldn't satisfy your... your complaint here."
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2848.07,2849.101,If you go... if you go--
2004.04-37,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2849.101,2850.67,Your... your complaint is no matter how much time you're given--
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,2850.67,2873.704,"--The... the legislature... if... if the law is overturned and the Tenth Circuit is affirmed, the legislature might go back in then and address the problem and they might come up with some solution as they did back in 1980 when it became apparent to them that they had set up a system where Libertarian candidates couldn't be candidates for State office because they couldn't be affiliated with a party with 6... for 6 months."
2004.04-37,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3043.943,3058.516,"But how does that square with Timmons where this Court turned away a party that says, we've got this candidate and she's running on a major party ticket and she's happy to be on ours too?"
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,3072.096,3087.411,"--Because that was a candidacy right, what the candidate was going to do, and in that particular case, this Court noted that the candidate of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party had a choice."
2004.04-37,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3331.145,3332.426,--What are the mici States?
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,3335.769,3337.711,"--The amici, amicus--"
2004.04-37,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3337.711,3337.961,"Oh, the--"
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,3337.961,3338.366,--amici.
2004.04-37,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3338.366,3339.363,--Okay.
2004.04-37,2,31574,james_c_linger,,3340.562,3342.231,Amici.
2004.04-37,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3361.361,3363.286,"Thank you, Mr. Linger."
2004.04-37,3,45819,wellon_b_poe_jr,,3366.463,3368.775,"I will try and be brief, Your Honor."
