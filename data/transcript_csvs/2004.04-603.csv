2004.04-603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.207,"We'll hear argument now in No. 04-603, Grable & Sons Metal Products v. Darue Engineering."
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,11.687,14.699,"Mr. Chief Justice, good morning, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-603,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,49.41,57.452,Do you take the view that Merrell Dow somehow just silently overruled about five cases dealing with quiet title actions?
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,57.452,60.29,"--No, Justice O'Connor, we do not take that position."
2004.04-603,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,61.582,62.665,That seems to be your position.
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,68.277,69.222,--Agreed.
2004.04-603,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,117.578,119.499,Haven't we... haven't we got something equally different here?
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,172.24,175.219,"Justice Souter, I agree that it is a Federal issue."
2004.04-603,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,190.649,192.954,"Yes, but I don't... I guess that's where we're parting company."
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,213.242,214.31,"I see, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,238.481,239.671,Which was a Federal issue.
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,239.671,251.679,"And that is the only Federal issue, just like in Merrell Dow where the Federal... the violation of the Federal labeling standard was alleged to constitute one element of the product liability claim in that case."
2004.04-603,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,251.679,258.982,"But as Justice Souter pointed out, the State law incorporated the Federal standard and made it its own."
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,285.632,297.882,"No doubt, Justice Ginsburg, but I think it is the wrong emphasis to look to what the State's interest is, which was a... a part of the focus that the Solicitor General's was on."
2004.04-603,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,305.43,307.094,"Well, my--"
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,307.094,307.856,"Yes, sir."
2004.04-603,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,307.856,308.294,"--Please, please."
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,310.355,312.496,"No, but go ahead, Justice Kennedy, please."
2004.04-603,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,312.496,312.708,"No, please."
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,343.345,344.875,Justice Kennedy--
2004.04-603,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,344.875,346.55,"And you rely on Merrell Dow, which is fine."
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,349.863,365.396,"--There are, Your Honor, but I think that to give a... an honest and principled answer to Justice Souter's and Justice Ginsburg's questions, I have to face it in line of Merrell Dow and the cases that Merrell Dow relied on."
2004.04-603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,365.396,369.017,We hope all your answers will be principled.
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,370.904,372.047,"Yes, sir, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.04-603,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,374.383,382.494,"Well, Justice O'Connor had asked you about the... the quiet title cases, but Kansas City Title & Trust is still good law."
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,384.027,384.572,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I agree."
2004.04-603,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,435.676,453.61,"Yes, but the Court didn't make it... the Court's proposition in Kansas City Title & Trust was if it appears from the complaint that the right to relief depends on the construction or application of the Constitution or laws of the United States."
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,460.796,486.684,"I believe that the Court in Merrell Dow made a limitation on that phrase that Your Honor is quoting from, and the limitation is where Congress controls the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, such as with Federal statutory law, then the limitation of Merrell Dow that Congress must also have intended to create a Federal private right of action obtains."
2004.04-603,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,487.5,495.355,"Well, when does... when does the... when do the words, or laws, in Kansas City Title & Trust have operative effect?"
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,495.355,508.585,"--When... when, as Merrell Dow says, Congress intended there to be a Federal private right of action for violation of the statute is alleged to be--"
2004.04-603,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,508.585,520.284,"You mean that the... are you saying then in the context of this case that the Federal law would have to create a quiet title action, which is traditionally State law?"
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,520.284,522.53,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's exactly what we are arguing."
2004.04-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,522.53,528.568,"But doesn't Congress have to create causes of action for constitutional violations as well, or at least for most of them?"
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,528.568,541.644,"Your Honor, Congress has not created a jurisdictional statute for Federal constitutional claims, which is why the Bivens doctrine arose, unlike section 1983."
2004.04-603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,541.644,543.942,"Well, maybe this needs... I mean, if were to clarify--"
2004.04-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,543.942,544.343,Wait.
2004.04-603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,544.343,545.112,--Sorry.
2004.04-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,545.112,548.26,I'm... I'm not sure that I... that I'm satisfied with the answer.
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,555.519,556.674,"I am, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,556.674,557.239,On... on what basis?
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,564.005,572.854,It derives from footnote 12 of Merrell Dow where the Court was attempting to explain this... this difference that we are discussing.
2004.04-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.202,599.369,And you think that that explains all of these cases.
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,599.369,608.176,"Well, Your Honor, yes, I do because of the nature of Congress' control over whether or not there should be Federal private rights of action."
2004.04-603,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,618.808,623.719,But you can't get anything out of the words of the... of the statute arising under to help you.
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,623.719,633.541,"No, Justice Kennedy, I don't believe you can because as many of the cases that this Court has decided point out, those words are broad."
2004.04-603,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,642.73,644.19,So just the strength of the Federal interest is the--
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,644.19,646.464,Clearly the--
2004.04-603,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,646.464,647.333,--the controlling test?
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,647.333,671.351,"--the strength of the Federal interest is important, Justice Kennedy, but as Merrell Dow pointed out, the Federal interest is not deemed to be substantial enough, or the Federal question at stake in the case is not deemed to be sufficiently substantial unless Congress has created a Federal private right of action for violation of the particular statute that is being pled."
2004.04-603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,671.351,682.01,"That's what I... I wanted to follow up on this because I think it's a confusion that's embedded in my mind in some of the cases, exactly what Justice Scalia was asking you."
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,797.999,802.595,"Justice Breyer, I disagree with the premise of that thought."
2004.04-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,837.061,849.77,How did Congress... surely Congress did not expect any pronouncement of... of title by the Federal Government to be immune from challenge by private individuals.
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,877.161,894.245,"You would bring, Your Honor, a State quiet title action, as Grable did in Michigan court, and allege, as the basis for the superiority of plaintiff's title in that case, the violation of Federal statute by the Federal agents."
2004.04-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,902.277,905.655,Which is what... is... how does that differ from what happened here?
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,905.655,906.984,That's exactly what happened here.
2004.04-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,907.319,908.005,That's exactly what happened here.
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,908.005,909.016,"--What differs, Your Honor--"
2004.04-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,909.016,912.012,And... and is that not precisely what Congress expected?
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,918.179,919.82,"--I think without question, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,935.758,972.448,"Well, I think you... you have to acknowledge there are at least three situations then: number one, where Congress did not create a Federal cause of action and did not expect that the States would create a cause of action to vindicate or challenge the asserted Federal interest; number two, where Congress did create a... a Federal cause of action; and number three, falling between the two where Congress did not create a Federal cause of action but, in the nature of things, must have anticipated that there would be State causes of action resting upon the Federal claim."
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,972.448,974.529,"Yes, I agree, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,978.946,980.892,Why was that a middle case?
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,980.892,983.079,--Why was that a middle case?
2004.04-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,990.04,1000.543,Congress would not have necessarily anticipated that the States would glom onto a Federal criterion for purposes of their State... of their State tort law--
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,1000.543,1000.911,--But--
2004.04-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1000.911,1005.878,"--whereas here, Congress must have anticipated that quiet title actions of this sort would be brought."
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,1005.878,1037.634,"--Your Honor, when Congress enacted the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and did not provide a Federal cause of action for it and yet laid out Federal standards of conduct for labeling of drugs like Bendectin in that case, Congress must have understood that without it creating a Federal private right of action, the States... the State product liability law, State inadequate warning law would subsume claims--"
2004.04-603,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1037.634,1039.026,But it wasn't necessary.
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,1039.026,1039.741,--for a violation of that Federal standard.
2004.04-603,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1039.741,1041.805,It was... that's the difference.
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,1082.648,1098.303,"Justice Ginsburg, that's an argument that appears in the Solicitor General's brief as well, and I believe that the Solicitor General's focus on a difference in State interests is misplaced when one is dealing with Federal jurisdictional principles."
2004.04-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1112.608,1119.027,"Right, except the... except you sort of abandon that for constitutional questions for some inexplicable reason."
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,1119.027,1121.37,"Well, Justice Scalia--"
2004.04-603,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1121.37,1122.309,"No, no."
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,1125.406,1126.475,--That's exactly right.
2004.04-603,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1146.606,1150.095,But you... so you are... you are proposing one way to reconcile Kansas City.
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,1210.726,1224.054,"Because, Justice Ginsburg, I think the focus is on the substantiality of the Federal question and that's where the difference between the two situations you are positing lies."
2004.04-603,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1250.246,1257.418,"So you're saying that Merrell Dow did take out those words, or laws, from the Kansas City Title & Trust."
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,1257.418,1257.882,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1288.114,1324.852,"I take it you would agree that we could leave the... the Kansas City formulation, the oral laws, intact and say that the distinguish... that the distinction between Merrell Dow and this case, which leaves it intact is the distinction between in Merrell Dow's case, the adoption by the State of a Federal standard, though the State did not have to adopt it in its tort law, purely optional, and in this case, the application of Federal law which, under the Supremacy Clause, the State had absolutely no choice but to apply."
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,1331.317,1354.342,"No, Justice Souter, I don't think you could because I think to do that would federalize a great many State law causes of action that just happen to have, as an element of them, a violation of some Federal law that, due to the Supremacy Clause, the States would, of course, be obliged to enforce."
2004.04-603,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1354.342,1357.98,What... what are the... sort of the... the horribles that you have in mind?
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,1357.98,1384.622,"An example would be anytime a tax preparer makes a mistake of Federal income tax law in... in preparing a return for a client and, as a result of that, the client pays more tax than they otherwise should have and they have a claim against the tax preparer either for common law negligence or professional malpractice under State law, but why did the... the preparer commit malpractice?"
2004.04-603,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1388.116,1399.625,"Yes, but in... in that case, the action is not enforcing the Federal tax law, whereas in this case, the action is, indeed, enforcing the passage of title statute under the... under the tax code."
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,1399.625,1407.971,"The tax code, section 6338(b) specifically provides that title passes under State law, not under Federal law."
2004.04-603,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1410.167,1411.654,But Federal law is determinative.
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,1411.654,1420.962,--The only issue of Federal law here that is determinative is whether or not the agents gave proper notice of the seizure.
2004.04-603,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1444.608,1446.725,Wasn't that in the... in the pleading?
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,1446.725,1448.366,"It was, indeed, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1448.366,1448.713,Wasn't that in the complaint?
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,1448.713,1451.13,In the complaint that they failed to do it.
2004.04-603,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1458.487,1461.875,But the... but the well-pleaded complaint doesn't say it has to be a disputed allegation.
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,1468.37,1469.896,"--Agreed, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1509.945,1512.566,I know you want to reserve your time.
2004.04-603,0,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,1523.107,1527.852,"Justice Kennedy, under Michigan law, as I understand it, there is no distinction any longer."
2004.04-603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1545.65,1547.011,"Very well, Mr. Zagrans."
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1549.257,1553.876,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-603,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1666.219,1679.811,"Suppose that the plaintiff here alleged that the tax deed were forged, that the occupant simply forged the tax deed and was occupied under forgery."
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1681.099,1686.611,"I believe that that would be a State cause of action, yes."
2004.04-603,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1686.611,1687.127,All right.
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1701.913,1704.291,"Then I... excuse me, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1711.285,1714.054,Suppose--
2004.04-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1714.054,1718.81,"What if it doesn't require construction, but... but what if there is a factual controversy?"
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1739.539,1741.558,"If it's... excuse me, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1745.277,1748.974,"Well, it doesn't present any question of law, just a question of fact."
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1783.027,1794.744,I think that it could still be a substantial Federal question because it could implicate a substantial Federal interest.
2004.04-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1794.744,1796.628,"Well, you're taking the... I mean--"
2004.04-603,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1796.628,1798.598,"--Well, and how is that different from the forgery?"
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1798.598,1799.97,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1799.97,1802.098,How... how is that different from the forgery hypothetical?
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1802.098,1803.791,"It would... it would then be the same, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1803.791,1813.236,"--Well, you're taking the position then, as I understand it... and I... I don't disagree with your... your position necessarily... that its construction or application--"
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1813.236,1814.555,Yes.
2004.04-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1814.555,1815.204,--of Federal law.
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1815.204,1815.851,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1816.484,1816.697,Yes.
2004.04-603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1816.697,1832.934,--Suppose the... there was an issue in this case about the plaintiff in the quiet title action having waited too long.
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1851.631,1852.666,"It would, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1852.666,1860.537,So that case wouldn't be removable then if the... if the defense is laches?
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1861.674,1862.915,"I believe... excuse me, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1862.915,1863.347,--Yes?
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1863.347,1868.801,I believe that it could be removable because it could still involve the application of the Federal law--
2004.04-603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1868.801,1876.839,But you might never get to the Federal law if the determination of 6 years is too long to wait to bring a suit like this.
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1901.253,1905.598,"--I see, Your Honor, yes."
2004.04-603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1905.598,1914.21,"So if laches is pleaded as a defense, then it's not removable?"
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1921.404,1923.253,"Your Honor, I'm not certain."
2004.04-603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1933.331,1936.98,"--Well, at what point do you remove the case?"
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1936.98,1940.023,I'm sorry.
2004.04-603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1941.38,1951.161,"A complaint is filed in State court, and you are the defendant and you want to remove that case to Federal court."
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1951.161,1952.389,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1952.389,1957.438,How much time do you have to remove?
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1960.741,1962.743,"Yes, Your Honor, it would."
2004.04-603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1962.743,1971.823,"So that in my case, you would remove on the basis of the complaint before you put in your answer, and I think you're--"
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1971.823,1972.354,Yes.
2004.04-603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1972.354,1982.652,"--And then you could get into the Federal court, and the answer could be laches and you're in the Federal court and the only question that's decided is the State law question."
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,1982.652,1984.561,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1984.561,1999.23,I suppose that happens pretty often in removal... in... in removed cases.
2004.04-603,1,36838,michael_c_walton,,2012.618,2013.855,"That's accurate, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2025.401,2027.043,"Very well, Mr. Walton."
2004.04-603,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2029.737,2039.343,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-603,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2072.797,2083.313,Why wouldn't that same rule apply in a State where there's a common law cause of action for ejectment and it's substantively under State law different from a cloud on the title?
2004.04-603,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2089.522,2089.902,--Right.
2004.04-603,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2089.902,2094.742,How is your statement that you just made consistent with the Court's holding under the Taylor line of cases?
2004.04-603,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2094.742,2108.505,"In the Taylor line of cases, what is necessary to... to allege in a well-pleaded complaint for common law ejectment is only that I have title and you're wrongfully here."
2004.04-603,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2113.764,2119.094,"So if we had exactly the facts of this case and there's a common law ejectment, you would not say that it goes to Federal court."
2004.04-603,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2119.997,2120.326,No.
2004.04-603,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2139.183,2140.799,"Well, I... I suppose that--"
2004.04-603,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2140.799,2141.507,--to... to sue for cloud on title.
2004.04-603,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2141.507,2145.524,--in a common law ejectment action that we are supposing that what's going to come up is the tax sale.
2004.04-603,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2145.524,2146.464,That's true.
2004.04-603,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2146.464,2147.669,Which is just the facts of this case.
2004.04-603,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2162.011,2175.184,"In the common law cause of action, which isn't available in Michigan, but under the common law cause of action, all was... all that was determined was that you had a right to possession at the time the lawsuit was filed."
2004.04-603,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2175.184,2180.287,I guess this... this problem is simply a consequence of the well-pleaded complaint rule.
2004.04-603,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2180.287,2181.441,"It... it is, Justice Scalia."
2004.04-603,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2181.441,2183.117,"If we... we altered that rule, it would make more sense."
2004.04-603,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2183.117,2184.918,"Well, the... the--"
2004.04-603,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2184.918,2187.431,This... this kind of peculiarity happens all the time.
2004.04-603,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2187.431,2188.008,--It does.
2004.04-603,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2188.008,2190.758,It depends on whether the Federal question has to be pleaded or not.
2004.04-603,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2190.758,2191.88,That's correct.
2004.04-603,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2208.373,2208.998,It's quick and dirty.
2004.04-603,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2213.977,2214.501,Mr.--
2004.04-603,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2214.501,2215.139,It's enough to be pretty close.
2004.04-603,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2215.139,2221.535,"--But the way you stated the rule, if I heard you correctly, you're contending that Merrell Dow was incorrectly decided."
2004.04-603,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2221.535,2227.891,"No, because Merrell Dow did not involve a substantial question of Federal law, and that was part of the test that I announced."
2004.04-603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2271.381,2274.934,We do occasionally review that kind of a decision here.
2004.04-603,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2274.934,2277.516,"You do, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.04-603,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2301.932,2315.284,"I assume that a fact in a particular case which affects nobody else in the country, but which is determinative of the Federal question is never a substantial question of Federal law."
2004.04-603,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2324.458,2338.788,"Let me draw a distinction between those cases where the cause of action is supplied by Federal law, in which case factual issues are resolved by Federal courts as long as there's a Federal cause of action and cases where there's not a Federal cause of action."
2004.04-603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2365.062,2377.252,"If there were only a dispute about when the notice was given and not a factual dispute, then it would not have been removable I take it."
2004.04-603,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2377.252,2381.588,It's... it's removable if the only question was whether notice was given.
2004.04-603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2389.573,2394.151,"Well, that's a very... sliced baloney very thin."
2004.04-603,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2394.408,2404.839,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that slices the baloney the way this Court's cases have sliced the baloney, and that... that rule is that there has to be a substantial question of Federal law."
2004.04-603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2457.728,2462.752,"Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
2004.04-603,3,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,2466.879,2467.927,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2004.04-603,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2514.136,2527.822,"Mr. Zagrans, there is language in Merrell Dow that makes it sound like it's not as clear and certain as you are urging."
2004.04-603,3,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,2574.59,2581.275,"I agree, Justice Ginsburg, is... it is a Federal question as a common sense matter and every other way."
2004.04-603,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2590.095,2598.615,I'm simply making the point that you are reading Merrill Lynch... Merrell Dow in a rather rigid way.
2004.04-603,3,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,2616.537,2646.366,"--I think, Your Honor, that Merrell Dow's emphasis on making pragmatic, sensitive judgments, judgments that are both principled and common sense, dictated the holding in that case which was when it's an act of Congress that is being inserted as an element of a State law claim, in order then to bootstrap that State law claim into Federal court on removal jurisdiction, there would need to be a substantial Federal question."
2004.04-603,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2695.234,2703.784,"I thought that there was no State law issue in this case, that the whole thing turned on what kind of notion... notice was sufficient to convey title."
2004.04-603,3,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,2703.784,2709.24,"There are many State law issues in this case, Your Honor, in terms of the State quiet title action."
2004.04-603,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2725.808,2727.172,"Thank you, Mr. Zagrans."
2004.04-603,3,23470,eric_h_zagrans,,2727.172,2727.77,Thank you.
2004.04-603,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2727.77,2729.388,The case is submitted.
