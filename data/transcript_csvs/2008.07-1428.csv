2008.07-1428,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.337,"We will hear argument today in Case 07-1428, Ricci v. DeStefano, and the consolidated case."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,9.606,24.031,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Racial classifications are inherently pernicious and, if not checked, lead as they did in New Haven to regrettable and socially destructive racial politics."
2008.07-1428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,76.298,77.666,May I just ask this question?
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,81.218,83.987,"--No, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-1428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,101.33,108.285,Are you contending that that's an issue of fact that has to be tried out or that we should accept your version of that -- of that issue?
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,108.285,111.137,"I believe that that's an issue of law, Your Honor."
2008.07-1428,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,131.801,140.907,"That was pursuant to -- to an affirmative action plan, and here we're dealing with this concept under Title VII of disparate impact."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,203.862,215.871,"--If that decision was grounded in a determination that we simply need to ensure that there are more women on the force, then, yes, it would be subjected to heightened scrutiny, maybe not strict scrutiny under that--"
2008.07-1428,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,215.871,234.166,"Not more women on the force, but this test that we're giving has the effect of excluding most women, just as the high school diploma had the effect, a disproportionate effect, on one race."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,234.166,247.973,"--I think your question gets to part of the heart of this case, and that is, ultimately: Is the decision that's being made one that is -- is based in race or is -- is based on a determination that there is an improper test?"
2008.07-1428,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,273.708,284.016,So they would have to go -- I take it from what you said they would have to go as far as proving a Title VII disparate impact case against themselves.
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,294.888,309.714,"--To use the constitutional analogy, Your Honor, I think Wygant, Croson, Adarand, other cases, make clear that you do not have to prove the violation against yourself, but you do have to demonstrate that you have a strong basis in evidence for believing you are violating the law."
2008.07-1428,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,314.285,328.461,"The problem, Mr. Coleman, is that -- that the cases you are relying on, it seems to me, are cases in which ultimately what is being judged is a different result in the -- at the end point of the process which was starting."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,412.948,415.248,"No, I completely disagree with that, Justice Souter."
2008.07-1428,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,421.202,431.558,But you make no distinction between race as an animating discriminating object on the one hand and race consciousness on the other.
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,441.097,442.282,--I also--
2008.07-1428,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,442.282,444.566,--without pervasive race consciousness.
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,451.738,453.923,"--I disagree with that as well, Justice Souter."
2008.07-1428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,476.853,483.443,"Well, let me ask you this -- this question, and I don't mean to interrupt your answer, but it is based on what Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg have both been asking."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,515.211,529.786,"--Under our alternative argument, Your Honor, assuming that -- that fixing disparate impact can be a compelling interest, we believe that you would at least have to demonstrate a strong basis in evidence to show that there is liability under (k) ( 2) -- your -- your example--"
2008.07-1428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,529.786,536.124,"My -- my question is -- and you can answer, I guess, both under Title VII and -- and under the Fourteenth Amendment."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,553.503,565.894,"--Under the Armstrong basis of evidence test, it might very well be because it meets the second qualification of the disparate impact statute, in which there is a specific alternative that is equally valid."
2008.07-1428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,572.548,580.403,And do you find -- and do you find any constitutional deficiency in the city's choice in that hypothetical case?
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,582.52,598.198,"--Well, we are certainly quite troubled that the Court would say, as it has not said, that the idea of -- of overcoming purely unintentional discrimination can be a compelling interest for cutting off what we believe is intentional discrimination."
2008.07-1428,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,613.208,616.994,"Well, what -- what if you've got -- what if you've got the basis of Justice Kennedy's hypothetical?"
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,650.215,661.788,"--Under that argument, as long as it can be demonstrated to be equally content valid, equally or better content valid and to have a lesser impact, then it would show -- it would establish a stronger--"
2008.07-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,661.788,664.824,They would not have discriminated against any particular--
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,664.824,668.192,"--That's -- that's correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,668.192,673.83,"--white or -- or majority applicants in -- in that selection, which is what occurred here."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,688.59,694.142,"Well, I understood Justice Kennedy's hypothetical to be after you have taken a test and building upon the hypothetical."
2008.07-1428,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,694.142,695.127,It wasn't my--
2008.07-1428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,695.127,695.627,No.
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,696.144,696.677,It was--
2008.07-1428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,696.677,702.379,"--It was designed to show, and maybe it's theoretical, but I want to know the answer so that I can understand this case."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,707.298,717.423,"--If -- if in your situation is simply in your situation the initial giving of the test, can you choose between those two tests, then we believe based upon what the Court has said in the past that a city could do that."
2008.07-1428,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,717.423,730.814,"A city can in fact choose a test simply because there will be more minority people who will in fact end up in the positions, that's your view?"
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,730.814,731.348,Well--
2008.07-1428,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,731.348,732.433,You needn't do anything else?
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,734.916,736.618,--Nobody can know in fact--
2008.07-1428,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,736.618,739.854,I want to know is that your answer to Justice Kennedy or not?
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,739.854,742.205,"--Under that hypothetical, we believe they can choose that test."
2008.07-1428,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,742.205,742.939,Are you assuming--
2008.07-1428,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,742.939,743.472,The answer is yes.
2008.07-1428,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,743.472,744.157,--Are you--
2008.07-1428,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,744.157,749.811,"If that's so, what's the difference here?"
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,790.852,792.638,"Two very strong differences, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-1428,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,810.1,816.754,"--Well, that can't be right if they -- if what you just answered to Justice Kennedy is -- is right."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,844.689,847.439,--We're not claiming that it's a vested right.
2008.07-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,884.414,905.144,"What -- one of the briefs said that, and maybe it wasn't done below, but one of the briefs said part of the claim is that some of the things that this test tested for were not -- were not qualities or abilities that were needed in New Haven, although they might be needed in other fire departments."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,910.481,912.916,"--No, Your Honor, not in the district court."
2008.07-1428,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,936.782,960.111,"Then why did they have the testimony before the Civil Service Board, about -- somebody from another testing company said this is a multiple choice test; it tests rote memory; we could have come up with a test that would better test the skills needed to be -- nothing about the localization, but something about command presence."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,974.638,979.109,"Justice Ginsburg, that's not at all what Mr. Hornick said in front of the Civil Service Board."
2008.07-1428,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1023.888,1028.457,"--Counsel, some time ago you said you had two answers to Justice Breyer's question."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1030.024,1032.659,"--Well, I actually think I got to the -- the first."
2008.07-1428,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1032.659,1035.611,"If you got to that, then I have -- I'd like one follow-up, and that's it."
2008.07-1428,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1036.711,1041.099,"Maybe if you don't mind, you could remind me what the second answer was."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1041.099,1069.368,"Again -- again, getting to the -- the fundamental point is, the use of race is so, so very important that the Court has always expressed skepticism and hostility to it, and what we're saying under this argument regarding a strong basis in evidence, and I think this answers both your hypothetical and Justice Souter's, is that what the city is saying, we don't have to demonstrate a strong basis in evidence for liability, we concede that we don't have that; all we have is good faith."
2008.07-1428,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1071.484,1092.782,"But you are -- as I understand it, you are imposing your strong basis in evidence test on what you referred to a second ago as the use of race, and that cannot be correct, because the use of race includes race-conscious decisions which are not discriminatory decisions, and they certainly do not implicate the -- the obligation that you want to impose."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1111.611,1113.078,"--That's not our intention, Justice Souter."
2008.07-1428,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1113.078,1113.511,Then--
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1113.511,1117.432,"Our argument is clearly that this is not race-conscious, that it is race-based."
2008.07-1428,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1127.804,1128.554,--But even--
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1128.554,1130.256,--viability or strong basis in evidence.
2008.07-1428,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1131.573,1136.56,"--I don't want to turn this into just a rhetoric exercise, but I think the rhetoric is important."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1182.006,1184.458,"But it -- it clearly is, Justice Souter."
2008.07-1428,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1226.368,1251.249,"But the cost of drawing the distinction between this case and Justice Kennedy's hypothetical example is that if we draw that distinction, the only way the city can get itself out of not only a certain lawsuit, but quite probably a successful lawsuit, is to make, in practical terms, a preliminary case against itself."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1251.249,1252.366,I--
2008.07-1428,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1252.366,1276.348,"And it -- I cannot conceive that Congress intended to put a city into that situation saying you've either got to blunder ahead into a losing lawsuit in court, or you have got to stop and expose yourself to another lawsuit which you can only win by proving that you at least had taken some steps in violating the law the first time."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1277.883,1288.774,"--Justice Souter, I understand the concern about the employer's point of view, which we don't think stands here just because of the blatant way the City went about this."
2008.07-1428,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1329.832,1331.851,What do you do if there is not a liability in question?
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1376.796,1377.682,I think--
2008.07-1428,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1377.682,1378.332,It is?
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1379.065,1379.798,--I think it is.
2008.07-1428,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1382.867,1385.569,That's just what I'm doing exactly.
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1385.569,1392.092,--It's -- it's really isn't different from Justice Thomas also had an example in Grutter.
2008.07-1428,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1393.008,1398.245,"But I'm interested in the distinctions, not whether it's similar to Justice Thomas's or not."
2008.07-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1406.065,1408.101,Can I hear his answer to this one first?
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1410.986,1432.066,"--I think the Court is certainly not fully in agreement on these questions, but the Court has at least an opinion suggested that those types of examples really are more of -- as Justice Souter, you were saying, the race-conscious type determination, and they don't violate this principle of individual dignity."
2008.07-1428,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1441.005,1463.502,"--And the difference between that and drawing the school district boundary, which takes from the individual children who live in that neighborhood the right to go to this school, which they think is a better one, and sends them to that school, which they think is a worse one, the difference between changing that boundary and changing the exam is what?"
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1463.502,1486.367,"--The difference that the Court, I believe, has suggested is that that type of a redrawing is likely to include a number of traditional redistricting factors and that race in that instance, unless it was shown to ultimately predominate, would not make it a race -- or, excuse me, a race-based effort that would violate equal protection."
2008.07-1428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1487.2,1488.569,May I ask you one question--
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1488.569,1489.086,--Of course.
2008.07-1428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1489.086,1491.854,--because I'm not sure I understood your answer to Justice Kennedy?
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1514.484,1530.728,"Again, assuming that no test has previously been given, if there are two tests, they are equally valid, one can be demonstrated to have lesser disparate impact, if there are no other circumstances, then we think they could likely under that test--"
2008.07-1428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1530.728,1538.049,"They could take that test, even though its sole purpose was to achieve racial proportionality in candidates selected?"
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1538.049,1541.584,"--I disagree that its sole purpose would be for that reason, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-1428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1555.694,1564.699,"This is the -- putting to one side liability in the lawsuit, is the interest in avoiding disparate impact a valid State interest?"
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1564.699,1577.091,"--We certainly have taken the position if disparate impact is identified purely as unintentional discrimination, then we don't believe it's a compelling State interest to overcome--"
2008.07-1428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1577.091,1578.459,I didn't say compelling.
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1585.697,1596.255,--I'm not sure that we are questioning whether there's a State interest in--
2008.07-1428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1596.255,1601.908,"The City is not merely trying to avoid liability, they are trying to avoid a disparate impact."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1603.291,1614.649,"--If the disparate impact is caused by something that could be demonstrated to equate to discrimination on behalf of the entity, which is what the elements of--"
2008.07-1428,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1614.649,1630.159,"But I thought the whole idea of disparate impact is it's unintentional, that's the assumption, disparate treatment, intentional discrimination, disparate impact, unintentional, but it has askewed racial results."
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1630.159,1632.992,"--There are two aspects to that, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-1428,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1671.633,1679.389,How do we know whether something is discriminatory or just that it will have a certain effect?
2008.07-1428,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1696.934,1704.921,"Congress has spoken on this issue, has identified job relatedness and lack -- and the refusal of an alternative in K itself."
2008.07-1428,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1715.996,1717.112,"Thank you, Mr. Coleman."
2008.07-1428,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1725.667,1736.439,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has long recognized that Title VII prohibits not only intentional discrimination but acts that are discriminatory in their operation."
2008.07-1428,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1736.439,1740.593,"With respect to both blacks and whites, correct?"
2008.07-1428,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1740.593,1741.143,Yes.
2008.07-1428,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1741.143,1761.924,"So, can you assure me that the government's position would be the same if this test -- black applicants -- firefighters scored highest on this test in disproportionate numbers, and the City said we don't like that result, we think there should be more whites on the fire department, and so we're going to throw the test out?"
2008.07-1428,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1765.376,1769.594,"Yes, and let me -- your question had two parts of it."
2008.07-1428,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1780.718,1781.318,Yeah.
2008.07-1428,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1781.318,1783.754,--under -- under Title VII.
2008.07-1428,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1783.754,1785.372,That's the part I don't understand.
2008.07-1428,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1807.136,1824.581,"Well, to -- to say that an employer violates the disparate treatment provision of Title VII when it seeks to -- when it acts for the purpose of complying with the disparate impact provisions of Title VII would be to set those two mutually reinforcing provisions of Title VII at war with one another, contrary to--"

2008.07-1428,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2797.889,2799.757,--that alone would be sufficient?
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2799.757,2813.899,--Our view is that it might be conceivable under Title VII in some cases for the statistical disparity to be so severe such that it would give an employer a reasonable basis under Title VII.

2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2879.588,2891.296,"Well, but if we -- if we agree with your -- I mean, you're assuming, it seems to me in your argument, that the actions that they've taken here are not intentional racial discrimination; and of course if they're not, then you don't have much to worry about."
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2896.831,2914.542,"Well, the difference in those cases that you talk about, Croson, Adarand, Parents Involved, they involve express racial quotas -- excuse me, express racial classifications, where the government is making a decision based on a particular individual on the basis of race."
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2914.542,2919.029,And the only reason you say that isn't by an individual is that you have blacked out the names?
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2919.029,2924.517,"No, because it's a facially neutral action which applies to all test takers the same."
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2925.25,2926.517,So your position is what?
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2938.943,2940.677,"--No, I would say that there's no classification."
2008.07-1428,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2954.386,2956.738,I don't see how you can call it facially neutral.
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2963.075,2974.866,"--There is no classification, because each individual, and -- when a particular individual is looked at and a decision is made on the basis of race, that is a racial classification."

2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2992.994,3004.2,"--Well, the point is, if all the tests are being thrown out and different decisions are not being made on the basis of different individuals on the basis of race, then--"
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3004.2,3007.837,So they can keep -- they get do-overs until it comes out right?
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3014.491,3016.058,"--Well, two responses."
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3042.525,3045.193,Well if -- how many times before it's a problem?
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3045.193,3046.295,--Well--
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3046.295,3047.729,You say if they did it over and over again.
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3048.995,3054.03,"--Well, that would be a question about whether they had a reasonable basis to do it."
2008.07-1428,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3057.851,3060.251,What -- what has New Haven done in fact?
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3076.395,3080.03,"Justice Ginsburg, this is information outside the record, of course."

2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3278.338,3279.874,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3299.251,3301.953,I guess it would go to how you construe the statute.
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3308.191,3311.059,"--Well -- well, I would disagree."
2008.07-1428,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3323.467,3326.068,"Well -- well, but you are loading the -- the equation."
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3350.201,3362.443,"Well, I -- I may have misunderstood the question, but compliance with Federal statutes have to be a compelling interest as long as that -- that statute is constitutional."
2008.07-1428,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3362.96,3367.229,Of course you're not saying that -- that the test is -- is compliance.
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3374.418,3375.885,--Or--
2008.07-1428,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3375.885,3386.726,"I mean everybody would probably concede that if -- if continuing would clearly be in violation, of course, it's a compelling interest."
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3395.665,3396.532,--Well--
2008.07-1428,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3396.532,3398.534,What -- what's the line there?
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3398.534,3401.2,"--Well, the line is set out by this Court's cases."
2008.07-1428,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3422.565,3427.201,You acknowledge strong basis in evidence is -- is what -- what the city has to have?
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3427.201,3429.636,--Assuming that strict scrutiny applies--
2008.07-1428,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3429.636,3430.336,Right.
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3430.336,3432.255,"--then, yes, then the city needs to have a strong basis."
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3432.255,3441.877,"Can I get back just -- just -- since I don't understand it yet, the distinction between intentional racial discrimination and race conscious action."
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3485.222,3498.297,"Well, again, this is a question about what triggers strict scrutiny, and compliance with the Title -- compliance with the Federal statute should not be deemed a -- a discriminatory purpose."
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3505.986,3508.152,"Well, that -- you may be right that that's what the question is about."
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3533.934,3558.632,"Well, again, all of those other cases involved discretionary actions by State actors, and those are -- were making decisions, trying to comply, trying to further various goals, and in those cases making a very express use of race that a particular individual -- when that person was looked at, whether in Croson, whether in Wygant, whether in Parents Involved, a particular decision was made as to that individual."
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3558.632,3566.988,"But just to take Parents Involved, it wasn't a necessary -- the driving factor was not a specific decision with respect to specific individuals."
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3582.032,3592.47,"Well, the -- the difference there is that in that case, Jones and Smith, different decisions were being made on the basis of race such that there was a labeling on the basis of race."
2008.07-1428,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3620.871,3624.906,"When you say ""take away barriers"", one thing is not a hundred percent clear."
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3663.398,3664.583,We're not saying that.
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3691.55,3691.966,You just referred--
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3691.966,3692.4,--and therefore--
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3692.4,3693.016,--I'm sorry.
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3704.941,3705.808,"--No, not at all."
2008.07-1428,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3728.056,3729.189,What do you mean by--
2008.07-1428,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3729.189,3730.091,I'd like to talk just briefly--
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3730.091,3732.96,Justice Kennedy.
2008.07-1428,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3732.96,3741.197,--I would like to talk just briefly about this point that the -- some of our hypotheticals where the test hadn't been given yet.
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3805.906,3830.272,"To answer your first question, the question of statutory interpretation, I would disagree with the suggestion that that gives support to the Petitioners' side, and for the following reason: Congress made a careful judgment about what can and can't be done once tests have been administered, and it told employers it -- it can't alter the scores when those scores are being used."
2008.07-1428,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3831.54,3832.674,It can't alter the results.
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3834.658,3842.412,"--But the -- but the point is that that ties the hands of employers so that the employer, in fact, is limited in what it can do."
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3943.527,3945.877,What type of -- what type of other things are you talking about there?
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3945.877,3962.237,"I mean, it could -- could be, for example, if there were a five-part training program that the City or an employer set up, and individuals may have completed some portion of the training program such that there would be similar reliance interests like the--"
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3962.237,3968.14,"Well, the question, I guess, would be whether the program was valid or not under the traditional approaches you take under Title VII."
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3968.14,3968.69,--Exactly.
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3971.008,3975.479,So does your position here depend on a conclusion that this test is invalid?
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3975.479,3976.329,"--No, it doesn't."
2008.07-1428,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3985.918,3988.037,And why didn't it have a sufficient basis here?
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4029.162,4034.232,"Well, first of all, the City did not act on the basis of numbers alone."
2008.07-1428,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4069.322,4071.357,What difference does the cut-off score make?
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4071.357,4081.63,"The difference of a cut-off score is a determination, a scientifically based determination to determine who is qualified and who is not qualified for--"
2008.07-1428,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4081.63,4089.403,"Well, I understand that, but the people at the top would -- the problem here was not the composition of the people who scored above the cut-off, was it?"
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4094.889,4096.872,"--Well, two responses, Justice Alito."
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4150.374,4160.082,"So your response to me that you don't have to show that the test is invalid, your argument is you just have to show that there's a basis for being worried that it might be invalid."
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4169.188,4170.638,Yes and no--
2008.07-1428,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4170.638,4172.722,I thought you just said that.
2008.07-1428,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4177.21,4178.96,I think your phrase was -- I think--
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4178.96,4183.614,I understand from -- I guess I should say I understand from your brief if not from your argument that--
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4183.614,4184.197,"--No, no."
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4184.197,4186.899,--You agree with the strong basis in fact standard?
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4186.899,4200.373,"To answer in a way that's consistent to -- to both of you, the answer is if the test is under Title VII, strong basis should not be the standard."
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4216.898,4227.773,"So I guess, my -- so my -- your position is that you should never have a strong basis in fact standard, because you don't think strict scrutiny should apply, and you think if it's under Title VII, it's only reasonableness?"
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4227.773,4228.473,--That's correct.
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4228.473,4237.879,So your position is that the city -- the -- the government can take action without -- only if it's reasonable.
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4246.568,4251.472,We agree with the government's articulation of the standard of reasonable basis.
2008.07-1428,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4252.456,4257.792,--But does it have to be reasonable basis to believe they would be liable if they went ahead?
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4266.498,4269.183,--I agree that it could be something less than that.
2008.07-1428,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4269.867,4270.317,Okay.
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4270.317,4273.219,"Well, what is something less than that, that they might be sued?"
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4273.219,4275.735,"--No, not that they might -- might be sued."
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4312.074,4320.18,"Isn't that -- isn't that kind of a blank check to discriminate, if all they need is a reasonable basis to think that further investigation might be useful?"
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4320.18,4326.834,"No, it's not because this is a way to reconcile, under Title VII, the two provisions of this statute."
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4328.251,4330.953,"No, I'm sorry -- that's an answer about why it would be okay."
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4334.322,4336.54,"--Well, I would disagree."
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4337.892,4338.542,But--
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4338.542,4340.76,"Here, however, we had much more."
2008.07-1428,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4374.479,4377.164,"Mr. Meade, let me -- let me go back to one earlier question."
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4397.827,4401.946,--Assuming that it was a test that was valid--
2008.07-1428,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4401.946,4408.45,It's a test they made after talking to everybody who testified in this case and filed amicus briefs and everything else ----
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4412.354,4413.021,--Absolutely.
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4413.821,4414.371,--I'm sorry--
2008.07-1428,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4414.371,4414.971,Absolutely what?
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4415.456,4418.306,--Absolutely yes.
2008.07-1428,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4418.306,4419.991,Absolutely positively?
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4420.608,4421.258,Absolutely positively.
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4421.258,4423.926,--I still -- I still don't have absolutely yes -- of what?
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4423.926,4424.395,"Yes, because--"
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4424.395,4425.228,"Yes, they can--"
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4425.228,4428.847,"--Yes, they -- they need to certify the -- the results."
2008.07-1428,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4428.847,4429.964,They would have to certify it.
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4429.964,4430.816,They would have to certify the results.
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4439.002,4442.523,"--Well, just to get back to your answer to Justice Stevens, you say they'd have to certify it."
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4457.616,4466.139,"--Well, not on the basis of -- of the investigation that Justice Stevens, I understood, hypothesized, as part of the example."
2008.07-1428,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4466.139,4473.559,"And that would be so, even if another Mr. Hornick showed up and said, I could ----"
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4480.814,4495.158,"Again, having gone through all the different examples that Justice Stevens said, at that point then -- then it would be -- the City would need to go forward with the test."
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4495.158,4500.276,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1428,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,4500.276,4501.145,Thank you.
2008.07-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4501.145,4507.482,"Mr. Coleman, to keep the time even here, I think you have 8 minutes."
2008.07-1428,3,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4507.482,4526.776,"There's another statute that the Court ought to consider in the Title VII context, and that's section 2000e-7, which says that Title VII will not overrule and pre-empt State law unless there is a violation of Title VII."

2008.07-1428,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4611.465,4612.065,That it's unconstitutional?
2008.07-1428,3,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4612.065,4612.749,--Based on that alone--
2008.07-1428,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4612.749,4613.282,Yes.
2008.07-1428,3,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4613.282,4614.251,"--No, it would not be."
2008.07-1428,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4614.251,4615.601,It would not be unconstitutional?
2008.07-1428,3,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4615.601,4616.117,It--
2008.07-1428,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4616.117,4616.703,And what about--
2008.07-1428,3,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4616.703,4618.653,--You're not taking away tenure from anybody.
2008.07-1428,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4618.653,4619.319,--All right.
2008.07-1428,3,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4620.071,4621.021,You're just saying we want to change the tenure process.
2008.07-1428,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4621.021,4628.761,But what we are doing is not giving the promotions to the assistant professors who otherwise would have job security.

2008.07-1428,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4640.217,4640.719,"Oh, so."
2008.07-1428,3,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4640.719,4641.468,--therefore we want to change it.

2008.07-1428,3,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,4701.853,4702.537,--it can do it.
2008.07-1428,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4702.537,4703.07,Okay.
