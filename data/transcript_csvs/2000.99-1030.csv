2000.99-1030,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,7.309,8.506,Mr. Chinn.
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,8.506,18.947,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The City of Indianapolis operates roadway checkpoints comprised of conduct that in other relevant contexts this Court has approved."
2000.99-1030,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,52.922,56.182,I have just one question about that.
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,84.335,91.644,"--It's to do both, Your Honor, but primarily to look for drug possession and trafficking in cars."
2000.99-1030,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,91.644,104.191,What do the statistics show or do they show about the percentage of people that were arrested that were using drugs and were therefore driving under the influence of drugs?
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,105.761,107.348,Not in this case.
2000.99-1030,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,119.508,132.798,"But does that make this akin to a checkpoint, for instance, to catch burglars in an area or a murderer or something of that kind?"
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,139.403,145.264,"No, Your Honor, I think it's different than the hypotheticals that you described for this important reason."
2000.99-1030,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,173.765,187.329,"Well, if there were a high crime area with lots of thefts and burglaries and it was believed that the burglars typically made their getaway in cars, is it appropriate to have roadblocks and check people for that purpose?"
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,187.329,191.044,"It might be, Your Honor, if that connection was shown."
2000.99-1030,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,203.387,204.586,"Well, there's always such a connection."
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,210.651,213.335,"Well, certainly if you have a lot of crime in the neighborhood--"
2000.99-1030,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,213.335,216.846,You can stop all cars to see if they have burglary tools?
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,216.846,220.189,"--Probably not, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,236.081,251.602,"Why is the connection between burglars, who usually get where they're going by car, not as close as the connection with drug traffickers, who usually engage in their business by car?"
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,259.32,271.664,"It's special, Your Honor, because here the car is used as an instrumentality to secret away the drugs that are then either... have been just purchased in a neighborhood or may be on their way to a neighborhood for sale."
2000.99-1030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,271.664,280.597,Does the record... does the record tell us how many of these drug arrests involved persons who were selling drugs as opposed to those who might have just been using them themselves?
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,280.597,282.976,"It doesn't tell us specifically, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,298.867,308.444,Would your case be as strong if the record showed that every one of the persons stopped just happened to be a casual user or something and then had some drugs left in the car?
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,308.444,311.416,Our case would be as strong for two reasons.
2000.99-1030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,311.416,315.957,You don't really... you don't really have to rely on the fact that some of them may be selling drugs?
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,315.957,317.443,That's correct.
2000.99-1030,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,321.326,346.793,"Mr. Chinn, I think you answered to an earlier question that the dominant reason for this program is to catch people who distribute, unlike the alcohol stops, the sobriety checks, that the dominant purpose is not to catch dangerous drivers, and you have no record of distinguishing between those two, so we have to assume... well, you have been candid about it."
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,350.88,353.769,--Distributing... to smuggle drugs.
2000.99-1030,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,357.279,358.228,"Well, I don't--"
2000.99-1030,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,358.228,359.221,--Is that the only purpose?
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,359.221,360.79,For these checkpoints?
2000.99-1030,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,360.79,361.283,Yeah.
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,361.283,362.48,Our... our... no.
2000.99-1030,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,395.091,417.836,"I suppose given the fact that you don't have a record with respect to finding actual impairment among the people that you stop, I suppose that if we sustain the search here, we would be required to do the same thing if you made a facial showing that in a given neighborhood drug distribution was done on foot."
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,430.013,434.76,"Pedestrian stops present a different case, Your Honor, for several reasons."
2000.99-1030,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,441.819,442.191,Why not?
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,442.191,455.194,"--Well, I believe because the degree of intrusion and one's expectation of privacy in the pedestrian context is simply higher or different than in the motorist context."
2000.99-1030,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,455.194,465.019,"Well, the reason that it is is that... that we... we have, if not a history, at least some experience with... with motorist checkpoints, but there was a day when we didn't."
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,477.379,487.023,"Well, the Court certainly has recognized for some time, for 75 years perhaps since Carroll, that motorists enjoy a diminished expectation of privacy."
2000.99-1030,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,487.023,501.595,"Yeah, but the original rationale for that was that because the person was in a car, the person could get away easily, and yet that rationale has nothing to do with the rationale that... that you're advancing here to justify this stop."
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,526.048,530.961,"Again, I think there are some differences, Your Honor, between the pedestrian context and the motorist context."
2000.99-1030,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,565.884,588.629,"I thought the rationale with the car was a lesser expectation of privacy in a car, say, as opposed to a home, but if you're going to do expectation of privacy, one can't be seen, I suppose the street would be lowest because the car, at least you are sheltered by the car itself."
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,618.435,632.553,"--I think in this case the expectation is a freedom of movement because here no searches are undertaken without probable cause, so really what we're talking about in this case and all respondents have ever challenged about this case is the initial stop of the car."
2000.99-1030,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,653.562,666.648,"I've never heard the concept of expectation of privacy which has been applied to... to searches applied to seizures, which is what you're now saying."
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,671.728,674.078,"I think that's right, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,674.078,678.537,Do you know of any of our cases that ever applied that reasoning to seizures?
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,697.363,709.084,"I think it's inherently part of the Brown balancing test, as this Court applied it in Sitz, for example, it measures in the third element of the Brown test the degree of intrusion on motorists."
2000.99-1030,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.084,712.511,"Yeah, but it doesn't say anything about expectation of being stopped."
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,726.546,740.292,"I think the point remains that cars are stopped in any number of different contexts, even at the government's direction, and so it's reasonable for the Court to conclude that that is a... presents a lesser degree of intrusion than the pedestrian context."
2000.99-1030,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,740.292,741.035,"Well, even so, it's somewhat circular."
2000.99-1030,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,754.205,755.524,You're using the expectation.
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,797.301,809.561,"It is reasonable to stop a car because of, again, the connection between the activity that's sought to be regulated here and the roadway."
2000.99-1030,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,809.561,818.272,"So that's when we go back to Justice Ginsburg who made the point very well, look, people sometimes rob banks on foot."
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,845.083,854.493,"Again, we think that the Court could look to the substantial connection between drugs and their trafficking and possession on the roadways."
2000.99-1030,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,865.267,867.579,What was the reasoning of the Court in Martinez-Fuerte?
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,873.895,885.95,"Yes, the Court found on balance the degree of intrusion was not... did not outweigh the government's interests in that case, and that since Martinez Fuerte, like the case here, is a smuggling case."
2000.99-1030,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,903.206,919.303,"Mr. Chinn, wasn't there the factor, the locational factor there that the stop, although distant from the border, was on the main... the road, the highway that you would take if you were going from the Mexican border into the interior because that's where all the traffic flowed."
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,922.442,926.074,"--Let me say a few things about that if I can, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,935.733,937.796,But it was a fact in the case.
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,943.164,952.657,"Yes, it was a factor in the case, Your Honor, but it didn't appear critical to the Court's holding, nor did the United States argue that that case is sufficiently different from our case."
2000.99-1030,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.657,958.973,So you think you could stop... police can stop cars anywhere in the United States just to look for smuggled immigrants?
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,966.775,975.57,"If a particular government program was not successful, certainly, that is one check against that sort of checkpoint as well."
2000.99-1030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,985.972,992.538,"What seems to be your argument, the strength of your case depends on the success, your success rate."
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,998.194,1001.37,"I think it's... I think it's both, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1013.63,1023.678,"If I read your brief, it's important to your case that 5 percent of the people in Indianapolis apparently don't have their driver's license with them and another 5 percent have some marijuana in the car."
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,1026.718,1029.068,"It would be weaker, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1029.068,1029.522,Yeah.
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,1029.522,1030.637,Although probably--
2000.99-1030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1030.637,1033.776,But you didn't know that until you conducted the searches.
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,1033.776,1035.839,"--Well, we knew that we had a problem."
2000.99-1030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1035.839,1039.842,"Sort of like... sort of like you found something there, ergo, it was reasonable to look for it."
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,1039.842,1046.53,"Well, we certainly knew we had a problem, and our program actually proved that we were correct."
2000.99-1030,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1046.53,1068.094,"The case that everybody begins with in automobile searches is Carroll, the prohibition case, and the Chief Justice in that case writing it said it would be intolerable and unreasonable if a prohibition agent were authorized to stop every automobile on the chance of finding liquor and thus subject all persons lawfully using the highway to the inconvenience and indignity of such a search."
2000.99-1030,0,15662,a_scott_chinn,,1068.987,1071.133,It's not for a couple reasons.
2000.99-1030,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1101.393,1102.052,"Very well, Mr. Chinn."
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1103.91,1130.743,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our position is first the petitioner's checkpoints, including their drug detection component, are constitutional under this Court's decisions in Martinez-Fuerte, which upheld a checkpoint designed to intercept alien smuggling, and Sitz, which upheld a sobriety check-in... checkpoint."
2000.99-1030,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1140.979,1145.808,"On your first point about Martinez, how would you respond to Justice Scalia's question?"
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1148.326,1151.298,"--As a constitutional matter, yes."
2000.99-1030,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1154.808,1155.635,As a constitutional matter.
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1155.635,1156.665,--does not have authority to go beyond a hundred miles.
2000.99-1030,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1173.589,1180.155,"With what we now know about Indianapolis, just right as of today, do you think it would be legal to have the Martinez-Fuerte's checkpoint in Indianapolis today?"
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1180.155,1184.446,I think we would have to show an alien smuggling nexus to the roadways on which we established our checkpoints.
2000.99-1030,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1184.446,1194.782,"Well, then did they have to show them before they conducted these checkpoints here, did the city have to show that 5 percent of the people were driving without licenses or did they find that out after they did it?"
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1194.782,1199.557,I think they have to establish... they have to have a reasonable basis for believing that there will be a problem.
2000.99-1030,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1209.049,1211.363,The high crime statistics they got as a result of the program they instituted.
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1211.363,1222.88,"--No, no, no, general crime, drug crime statistics, which you obviously will know in advance as a law enforcement agency, just as we know where the primary problems of alien transportation are in the country."
2000.99-1030,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.88,1225.496,Let me follow up on the Indianapolis hypothetical.
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1252.973,1269.253,"I think as a constitutional matter, if the government were able to show the appropriate nexus and the effect that its checkpoints again were actually effective that it would... and the intrusion was no more than it was in Martinez-Fuerte, but, yes, the Fourth Amendment applies the same in Indianapolis as it does in Arizona."
2000.99-1030,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1269.253,1271.936,Then the same result then would be for pedestrian checkpoints?
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1271.936,1272.868,"No, not at all."
2000.99-1030,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1272.868,1273.611,Why not?
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1273.611,1278.069,There's a bright line in this Court's decisions between cars and pedestrians.
2000.99-1030,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1278.069,1278.829,Why should there be?
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1287.153,1288.722,"First, it's beneficial."
2000.99-1030,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1295.781,1343.131,"Well, if... if Martinez-Fuerte can be applied as you have said to Justice Scalia that it may be applied in Indianapolis or the middle of Nebraska somewhere because there is... there is a... a... a general basis in the evidence prior to the search operation, that there is a high incidence of illegal aliens, then to begin with Judge Posner's rationale has nothing, I guess, to do... much to do with the case, and it doesn't seem to have anything... it doesn't seem to be key to the use of automobiles, and therefore I don't see why, if we accept your answer to Justice Scalia, we are not well down the road toward pedestrian checkpoints."
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1343.131,1345.11,--Because cars are different than pedestrians.
2000.99-1030,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1402.324,1415.327,"Well, then, on... excuse me... on that theory could the police station drug detection dogs at every street crossing where the traffic lights require pedestrians to wait until the yellow light comes along?"
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1428.209,1428.785,--Yes.
2000.99-1030,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1436.504,1441.128,"So if somebody says to the dog, you know, get away from me, the police can say, no, you've got to let the dog search you?"
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1441.128,1445.67,"--No, that then I think would be a seizure of a pedestrian if they won't... can't get away, but the pedestrian can walk away."
2000.99-1030,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1446.496,1454.298,Then why isn't it a seizure of the car for something other than the purposes of checking license plates when the dog goes around the car?
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1461.662,1462.51,"No, I don't think so."
2000.99-1030,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1469.902,1472.42,You have a legitimate basis for stopping the pedestrian until the light turns yellow.
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1479.107,1480.426,"That... that... well, I think it's a separate question whether--"
2000.99-1030,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1480.426,1483.77,"If the pedestrian can tell the police to get the dog away, why can't the car owner?"
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1483.77,1488.395,"--I'm not sure that a traffic light, in fact, effectuates a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment."
2000.99-1030,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1488.395,1489.054,Well--
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1489.054,1492.603,"Because pedestrians can turn around and walk away, they can do a U-turn."
2000.99-1030,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.141,1512.627,"--Do we know in the facts of this case whether the dog sniffing occurs while the license check is going on or whether the policeman first checks the license and then says, okay, now stay here, I'm done checking your license, but I want to walk around the car with a police dog?"
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1512.627,1517.085,My understanding is that it's done while the driver's license check is going on.
2000.99-1030,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1522.862,1541.727,"Suppose the city council authorized this search and had a preamble and said, in order to interdict drug distributors, we are setting up the following checkpoint, and then the case is just like it is, and you have a license, they say that the sole... the purpose is to interdict drug smuggling."
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1543.667,1546.928,It doesn't... we have two rationales.
2000.99-1030,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1596.795,1620.572,"In other words, in order to do it, the city has candidly told us it wants it to apprehend drug distributors, it has this pretense of stopping people to check their licenses an also purpose, but it's using that as a gateway to get to what it's really interested in, which is the drug distribution."
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1620.572,1626.35,You mean pretense by the fact that they ask for licenses but don't do anything about it?
2000.99-1030,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1627.798,1629.117,"No, you said that they would have to do that."
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1650.089,1651.325,--That's not what I mean to say.
2000.99-1030,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1656.322,1658.838,So let's take... then let's take away that.
2000.99-1030,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1668.665,1670.189,--I'm saying two things.
2000.99-1030,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1714.65,1715.848,"Thank you, Ms. Millett."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,1717.91,1726.472,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is not Martinez-Fuerte."
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1736.857,1743.729,Certainly the seizures in Martinez-Fuerte and Sitz were also seizures of primarily entered in.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,1747.937,1764.888,"--That's correct, but this Court recognized, Your Honor, for instance, in Montoya de Hernandez that Martinez-Fuerte was one of a number of cases reflecting the long-standing concern for the protection of the integrity of the border, which has been characterized as a noncriminal investigatory concern."
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1764.888,1769.551,But in Martinez-Fuerte they arrested these people.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,1771.243,1777.27,"Well, of course, Your Honor, but in Camara back in 1967, violation of the housing codes in issue there were criminal."
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1792.502,1796.134,"What did the Court say, then in Martinez-Fuerte?"
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,1800.387,1814.589,"--Protection, integrity of the borders, Your Honor, have been recognized by this Court since I believe the 1880s in the United States v. Boyd, that the United States has an inherent regulatory right to ensure that people and things that enter this country do so lawfully."
2000.99-1030,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1829.533,1830.193,And drunk driving.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,1830.193,1831.473,"And drunk driving, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1831.473,1834.074,How about driving while impaired by drug use?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,1837.335,1847.161,"If the... if the City of Indianapolis could show here that there was, indeed, a problem of drugged driving, like there was in Sitz of drunk driving, then of course there could be a regulatory purpose."
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1847.161,1851.535,How could the city show that without having done some investigation?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,1851.535,1860.452,"Well, I think if you looked at Sitz there were reams of statistics introduced there to show what the national and local problem of drunk driving was."
2000.99-1030,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1862.848,1864.351,"Please, finish your answer."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,1864.351,1870.771,Sitz recognizes that there is a regulatory right of a state to get an immediately unsafe vehicle off the road.
2000.99-1030,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1877.17,1882.577,"What about a driver without a driver's license, is that a safety concern?"
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,1888.771,1896.778,"Arguably, Your Honor, but even those stops, even those noncriminal investigatory seizures have to be justified under Brown, there has to be a showing there actually is--"
2000.99-1030,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1896.778,1897.232,That's fine.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,1899.833,1900.288,--Yes.
2000.99-1030,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1900.288,1908.955,"What difference does it make that in the course of that search, in the course of that stop the police also send a dog around the car?"
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,1954.159,1954.613,That's correct.
2000.99-1030,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1954.613,1959.482,"Now, why shouldn't that apply in gross, just as it applies with respect to individual traffic stops?"
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,1959.482,1963.568,Subjective intent is irrelevant provided there is otherwise probable cause.
2000.99-1030,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.568,1964.19,"Right, so--"
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,1964.19,1966.995,"But there is no cause here, Your Honor, and this Court has insisted--"
2000.99-1030,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1966.995,1967.905,--But there is cause.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,1971.082,1973.478,"--Well, there's not a criminal investigatory cause."
2000.99-1030,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1985.282,1987.428,I'm assuming they're not going beyond what's allowed.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,1997.255,1998.203,"Well, Your Honor--"
2000.99-1030,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1998.203,2000.72,While they do that the dog sniffs around the car.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2000.72,2004.601,--Obviously adding the dog goes beyond the scope of a license checkpoint.
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2007.779,2012.32,The dog... the dog is not a search under our place.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2012.32,2014.178,"--Well, arguably that's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2014.178,2015.088,Or it's a stop.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2018.265,2028.834,"The Court has said that a search of unattended luggage is not... by a dog, a sniff, excuse me, is not a search, but I'm assuming it's not a search for this purpose, Your Honor, but still it is clearly beyond the scope."
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2029.865,2031.185,Beyond the scope of what?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2031.185,2035.643,"--Beyond the scope of what is allowed for the regulatory intrusion to check someone's license, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2035.643,2040.656,"I guess a policeman could walk a dog, a sniffing dog down the street, couldn't he?"
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2050.297,2051.496,"Well, but Your Honor, this is a seizure."
2000.99-1030,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2051.496,2055.212,But I would like you to address that particular point.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2101.585,2103.342,This is not like stopping at a red light.
2000.99-1030,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2107.679,2108.832,But that isn't my point.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2129.987,2132.693,"This is a search to look for drugs, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2138.887,2145.796,"Now, when you say it's a search to look for drugs, and the Solicitor General says it isn't, it's a search for... how am I going to find out who is right?"
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2145.796,2153.786,"The City of Indianapolis concedes that the primary purpose of this search, excuse me, of this seizure is to look for drugs."
2000.99-1030,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2153.786,2155.438,Where did they concede that?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2155.438,2157.956,"They have conceded that, I believe, in their briefs."
2000.99-1030,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2159.525,2166.684,"And does primary purpose mean in the absence of their ability to do that, they wouldn't have done it; i.e., it was a necessary condition for the stop?"
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2166.684,2168.358,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I cannot answer that."
2000.99-1030,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2180.907,2185.737,Did the courts below find there were these other purposes in addition?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2185.737,2193.722,"--The trial court found that from the fact that the licenses were checked, that there's a secondary purpose to look for licenses."
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2226.398,2229.948,Why can't the city or the state have a multipurpose stop?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2229.948,2232.177,Arguably they could.
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2235.149,2240.145,I thought counsel here said that there were three purposes for the thing.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2240.145,2246.832,"--The city has never attempted, never attempted below to justify even under Brown having a license checkpoint."
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2254.262,2259.175,What service... at what point do you think the city would have to make that showing?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2259.175,2264.543,I think at some level they would have to show that they believe this is a problem in Indianapolis and this is--
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2264.543,2267.887,You mean the city council would have to pass a resolution?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2267.887,2271.064,"--No, I mean in the course of justifying their search to the Court."
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2271.064,2272.838,Justifying it at what point?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2276.182,2277.091,Yes.
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2277.091,2281.095,But you're not saying they would have to justify it beforehand?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2281.095,2281.855,No.
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2281.855,2287.865,"It seems to me in court, the lower court, the District Court they found that there were additional purposes."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2287.865,2294.348,"The lower court found only that licenses and registrations were taken, and from that she surmised this secondary purpose."
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2294.348,2296.327,Surmised?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2296.327,2298.185,"Well, there is no other evidence, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2298.185,2304.872,"But if that was satisfactory for the District Court, are you saying it's clearly erroneous to have found that?"
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2304.872,2306.608,"No, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2314.986,2333.479,"Take an easy case in which there is simply a history in Indianapolis or any other jurisdiction of license roadblock checks, and after 25 years of doing this, suddenly one day a drug sniffing dog appears at the license check."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2340.621,2349.166,"Yes, Your Honor, that would be unconstitutional because you have now gone beyond the scope of what is arguably a valid, noncriminal investigatory seizure under Brown."
2000.99-1030,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2350.197,2352.881,"Well, but let's... you're talking about seizure."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2369.683,2370.509,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2400.891,2413.439,"But in the example that I gave you, the assumption that I was making or implying by the hypo was that the license check remained, in fact, a bona fide license check."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2436.185,2438.164,"Yes, it does, and for the reason I indicated."
2000.99-1030,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2438.164,2444.852,Does it raise it for any other reason than it raises a question as to whether they are still really looking for licenses?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2444.852,2447.331,Your Honor--
2000.99-1030,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2447.331,2449.848,I can understand... I guess I can understand your argument.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2473.83,2479.115,"--Your Honor, we're not asking this Court or any court to go inside the head of people to see what their real purpose is."
2000.99-1030,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2484.027,2489.6,But the reality of police work is that the police enforce all of the laws.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2508.63,2517.464,"No, provided they use that expertise in a way that does not require dogs or equipment or anything that is beyond the scope--"
2000.99-1030,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2517.464,2525.737,"No, but they're trained especially to look at people's eyes and to smell and to look at the kinds of containers they can see in plain view, this is to normal police work."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2525.737,2525.903,--Sure.
2000.99-1030,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2532.325,2535.258,"So then if that's permissible, what's not permissible about adding the dog?"
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2536.949,2538.641,Because... but you've added the dog.
2000.99-1030,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2543.842,2546.442,Officers with really sharp noses would be okay?
2000.99-1030,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2547.064,2554.987,"How about bringing a witness, just bringing a witness to look at somebody stopped at a stoplight?"
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2582.645,2589.333,"--Your Honor, we are arguing this because we... the question has been asked, what if there was a legitimate secondary purpose."
2000.99-1030,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2592.305,2593.625,What does secondary mean?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2604.278,2611.541,"--Your Honor, I cannot tell you what the city would and would not have done but for the drug search seizing."
2000.99-1030,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2611.541,2615.916,Do they have any other places in the city where they stop people for checking for licenses?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2615.916,2618.228,"Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2618.228,2624.916,Do they have any other places in the city in the same way where they stop people for drunk driving with these same kinds of checks?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2624.916,2627.145,"Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2627.145,2633.089,"Mr. Falk, I don't understand why it makes any difference whether the city would have done this otherwise."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2679.157,2686.959,Programmatic purpose has always been extremely important in searches or seizures which are designed for things other than criminal investigation.
2000.99-1030,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2686.959,2699.302,"Mr. Falk, I want to get into this same area with you because as I read Sitz and Martinez-Fuerte, this Court didn't look at purpose at all."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2723.285,2736.638,"The problem, Your Honor, is if we lose the purpose inquiry procedures which are not inherently regulatory like Martinez-Fuerte, which are not immediately concerning safety, like Sitz, then we are going to end up with pedestrian roadblocks because--"
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2736.638,2737.569,You have no bright line.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2754.947,2755.69,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2759.284,2764.235,But where does it say in Martinez-Fuerte that the seizure is primarily regulatory?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2764.235,2769.808,"Martinez-Fuerte does talk about the immigration problems, and other cases I cited this Court back--"
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2769.808,2771.583,I asked you about Martinez-Fuerte.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2771.583,2774.555,"--No, there is nothing in Martinez-Fuerte, Your Honor, that specifically says it's regulatory."
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2774.555,2775.298,That says it's regulatory?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2775.298,2775.835,That's correct.
2000.99-1030,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2775.835,2790.492,"But you're trying to reconcile that decision as a piece of a tapestry with the ones that had to do, for example, with the fire investigation when this Court did make something of a purpose line."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2797.096,2799.241,That's correct.
2000.99-1030,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2799.241,2800.456,"But if you're trying to find the arsonist, it's not okay."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2800.456,2801.304,Of course.
2000.99-1030,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2809.356,2816.331,But I want to go back to the rationale that I think you started to add up right there for the reason for the purpose inquiry.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2860.997,2871.771,"Well, if the category collapses in multiple dimensions, the first collapse, as this Court noted in questionings of Mr. Chinn is what about things that are serious concerns to the city other than drugs?"
2000.99-1030,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2925.392,2936.044,"But we have recognized special needs as an exception to the individualized suspicion, and we've recognized those special needs in the automobile context."
2000.99-1030,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2966.88,2971.172,"And if I may add, this is exactly what the Court said, this is what Justice O'Connor's point is."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,2984.918,2988.344,"It's an unsafe car involved, as Justice O'Connor noted."
2000.99-1030,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2996.602,2999.119,That doesn't translate to pedestrians at all.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3007.747,3014.556,"But it doesn't... that's correct, but it doesn't translate to searching the trunks of cars to search for drug smugglers, it doesn't translate to that at all."
2000.99-1030,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3019.115,3019.552,Right.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3024.77,3033.67,"There is an increase in intrusion when the state turns a criminal investigatory eye on presumably innocent persons, yes."
2000.99-1030,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3033.67,3048.243,"I know you say yes, but until I heard the Solicitor General, frankly, I thought that just like the first of the cases you're talking about was an immigration case and the second case was a drunk search."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3050.222,3050.76,Yes.
2000.99-1030,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3050.76,3052.617,The lower courts have treated it this way.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3052.617,3053.194,Yes.
2000.99-1030,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3053.194,3055.673,Indianapolis had said any other purpose was secondary.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3055.673,3056.416,Yes.
2000.99-1030,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3056.416,3061.989,"Now suddenly since the Solicitor General argued, I think there is a new premise reaching in... reaching in."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3072.103,3072.596,That's correct.
2000.99-1030,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3072.596,3083.453,"And because of that issue, I think it's important to get clear on what it is, and if we're treating it as a drug case, it's one thing."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3099.596,3103.804,This is most definitely a drug case.
2000.99-1030,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3128.613,3133.708,"So what is wrong about the city saying, look, we have a right to stop people, to look at their licenses?"
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3154.785,3164.65,"And, again, assuming that was the case here, which I do not believe it is, because I think we are dealing with a primarily if not sole drug issue, but even assuming that sort of mixed motive which you're hypothesizing--"
2000.99-1030,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3164.65,3166.591,"No, I'm not... I'm not assuming a mixed motive."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3181.618,3186.464,--Then what we have is a criminal investigatory seizure done without any individual--
2000.99-1030,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3186.464,3188.056,"No, it isn't a criminal investigatory seizure."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3189.913,3190.656,"--No, it's not."
2000.99-1030,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3194.455,3196.191,"No, but this comes back to your purpose argument."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3201.392,3201.968,That's correct.
2000.99-1030,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3201.968,3207.253,"And you're saying that because purpose is crucial, we characterize it this way as the drug search."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3207.253,3208.079,There has been--
2000.99-1030,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3208.079,3231.114,"But the tough question, and I think this is consistent with his question, what if we assume, it is found as a fact by the reviewing court that the license check or the registration check is, in fact, a genuine, bona fide purchase... purpose, and they simply add the dog?"
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3238.211,3239.491,--Because--
2000.99-1030,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3239.491,3243.495,Why does the dog taint the search in that case?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3243.495,3255.301,--Because then you're going back to having a seizure which is for criminal purposes which is beyond the scope of what might otherwise be allowed in a noncriminal investigation.
2000.99-1030,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3255.301,3260.381,And is the reason of the beyond the scope criterion essentially a slippery slope reason?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3288.078,3292.453,"Yes, although I think in defense of Indianapolis, they're not winking."
2000.99-1030,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3293.279,3294.189,"--Oh, I realize that."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3299.512,3304.507,--If you break the distinction down between criminal investigatory purpose and a noncriminal investigatory purpose--
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3304.507,3311.4,"--Would you say stopping for driver's license, a man who doesn't have a driver's license is not a criminal investigatory purpose?"
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3311.4,3314.334,"--I believe, Your Honor, that that's been deemed to be regulatory because--"
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3314.334,3314.994,Deemed by whom?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3314.994,3324.076,"--Well, I think in lower courts, in approaching the problem, have deemed that to be... the desire is to remove immediately unsafe people off the roads."
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3326.406,3328.906,"Well, there's also a presumption you've committed a crime."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3328.906,3339.326,"Well, yes, Your Honor, but again this Court has recognized, as I said, in Camara and Burger and other cases that you can have a regulatory purpose and a criminal investigatory purpose."
2000.99-1030,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3339.326,3347.566,"Do you want us to use the Von Raab analysis and in Sitz we said when you have automobiles you don't, you use the Martinez-Fuerte analysis."
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3347.566,3372.541,"And that's why Sitz said that, because Martinez-Fuerte, I believe, was there, indicating that for that seizure which was not a criminal investigatory seizure, which was part of the inherent regulatory right of the United States to regulate people and things coming into the United States, in that you use a balance, but if we abandon the cause requirement when it's a pure criminal investigation, then we will have seizures which are based on a perceived governmental need."
2000.99-1030,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3372.541,3374.77,Would you allow a dog in a Martinez-Fuerte stop?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3374.77,3389.919,"A dog searching... if, in fact... if, in fact, this Court's case law allowed regulatory seizures at that point for purposes of contraband, yes."
2000.99-1030,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3389.919,3399.329,It seems to me that you're really arguing that there's a difference between pretext when it's an individual officer acting and pretext when it's a regulatory program.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3400.693,3405.856,"It is, and I don't like using the word pretext because, again, I think the City of Indianapolis isn't being--"
2000.99-1030,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3405.856,3406.637,It's a word motive instead of pretext.
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3406.637,3414.772,"--It's a primary, what is the purpose, and this Court itself in Opperman said here the primary purpose is noncriminal investigatory."
2000.99-1030,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3423.356,3430.869,And what's the danger that you perceive in making the distinction between the individual and the programmatic?
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3434.751,3447.094,"Because the danger, then, I believe is that a sufficient government interest, the drug crisis, will be sufficient to overcome the privacy interests which this Court has always recognized as something held by individuals under the Fourth Amendment."
2000.99-1030,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3447.094,3463.851,"Mr. Falk, I asked Miss Millett earlier whether the dogs ever took longer than the license check, and she said no, that the license check takes three to five minutes, and the dog's done by the time the license check... do you agree with that?"
2000.99-1030,2,33822,kenneth_falk,,3463.851,3465.587,"The record is not clear, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3520.86,3522.346,"Thank you, Mr. Falk."
2000.99-1030,3,15662,a_scott_chinn,,3524.287,3526.145,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.99-1030,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3562.691,3568.248,"And do you ever do other similar traffic, any registration checks without the drugs?"
2000.99-1030,3,15662,a_scott_chinn,,3568.248,3571.47,"It's not clear from the record whether we do, Your Honor."
2000.99-1030,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3585.05,3586.081,How was it advertised to the public?
2000.99-1030,3,15662,a_scott_chinn,,3594.133,3605.65,"Yes, the signs... the signs display what our area of emphasis is for those checkpoints, which is narcotics detection checkpoint ahead so many miles, one mile, half a mile, canine in use."
2000.99-1030,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3607.629,3616.053,What is your... what is your take on whether... whether you have to wait after your driver's license has been checked for the dog to complete sniffing?
2000.99-1030,3,15662,a_scott_chinn,,3617.455,3621.625,"Well, Mr. Falk is certainly correct, the record isn't absolutely clear on that."
2000.99-1030,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3636.774,3637.229,Thank you all.
