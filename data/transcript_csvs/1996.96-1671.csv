1996.96-1671,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.474,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1671, Frederick D. Raines v. Robert C. Byrd, and counsel have been advised, I believe, that you are to have 35 minutes each on a side."
1996.96-1671,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,13.558,16.593,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-1671,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,178.163,188.721,"Well, it could do that all across the board, I suppose, General Dellinger, simply perhaps render the thing kind of a nullity if it incorporated that sort of a provision in every appropriations item."
1996.96-1671,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,188.721,192.089,"It could, of course, though we doubt that it would."
1996.96-1671,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.134,223.108,"Well, of course, the President then could veto such subsequent bill and that would then require a larger vote of Congress to override the veto."
1996.96-1671,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,227.91,232.797,"No, I'm not sure that I agree, if I understand your question, Justice O'Connor."
1996.96-1671,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,234.147,256.993,"Well, suppose Congress decides later on that maybe some type of appropriations shouldn't be subject to this line item veto, so they include passage in a subsequent bill saying that the Line Item Veto Act won't apply to a certain type of appropriation."
1996.96-1671,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,267.368,267.868,"--Yes, that--"
1996.96-1671,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,267.868,271.07,And to that extent it kind of changes the equation.
1996.96-1671,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,271.07,295.868,"--But in your example Congress passes the requirement that the provision be exempt from this provision only after it has first passed an omnibus appropriations act, but Congress is more likely to choose to do that with an appropriation it cares about in the process of passing the omnibus appropriations act, and that's not, you know, unfamiliar."
1996.96-1671,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,341.611,351.3,"Well, but in all events, Mr. Dellinger, you are defending the line item veto as it was enacted and as it was intended to work, are you not?"
1996.96-1671,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,351.3,352.167,--That is correct.
1996.96-1671,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,352.167,360.421,And it does seem to me that there is some point to the argument that this changes the legislative dynamic.
1996.96-1671,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,367.075,367.658,Yes.
1996.96-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,376.344,382.148,"Mr. Solicitor General, your example of the ABC and a small number certainly is easy to understand."
1996.96-1671,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,399.341,406.763,"--No, he wouldn't, but that's only because he will have been unable to convince a majority of his colleagues to make that mandatory."
1996.96-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,407.529,415.333,"Yes, but isn't it true... isn't it true that the typical bill is anticipated to have a large number of items and that the ABC example is really not very realistic."
1996.96-1671,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,415.333,417.035,--That is correct.
1996.96-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,433.461,437.263,"Yes, but then you might have 300 different Congressmen wanting to put that rider on--"
1996.96-1671,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,437.263,437.781,That is correct.
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1921.112,1929.218,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-1671,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1998.093,2010.837,"Mr. Morrison, on the tax benefit part, the legislation instructs the joint committee to flag every one of these limited tax items, where fewer than 100... fewer than 10 benefit."
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2022.145,2027.03,"I do not believe so, because that must be in the text of the Act itself."
1996.96-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2059.068,2064.888,"Mr. Morrison, before we get too deeply into the merits, can I ask you about the standing--"
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2064.888,2065.554,Certainly.
1996.96-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2065.554,2066.674,--the standing issue?
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2117.389,2117.989,"No, Your Honor."
1996.96-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2117.989,2121.657,--against the court of appeals for taking away his power to impose a tax?
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2121.657,2122.291,"No, Your Honor."
1996.96-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2122.291,2122.859,Why not?
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2122.859,2127.328,Because he has not been injured in any ongoing way.
1996.96-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2163.651,2168.103,But that's irrelevant unless they have a personal interest in the power that they exercise.
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2168.103,2168.519,"Well, that depends on the--"
1996.96-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.519,2171.554,And you... and you say that the district judge does not.
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2171.554,2175.256,"--That depends on the meaning of the word ""personal interest"" in your hypothetical."
1996.96-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.932,2194.55,All of the things that the Constitution gives a right to are not necessarily enforceable in court.
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2201.954,2204.906,"That's because... it's not because of standing, Your Honor."
1996.96-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2260.571,2263.337,"But stand... standing is... is an Article III proposition, too."
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2263.337,2265.123,"It certainly is, Your Honor, and I agree."
1996.96-1671,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2281.9,2287.638,Do you agree that rightness is a factor that goes into the Article III calculus?
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2287.638,2288.254,I do.
1996.96-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2324.961,2327.68,"Mr. Morrison, can I try a few other examples?"
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2339.087,2340.104,--Such as Moore.
1996.96-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2340.104,2343.356,"And, therefore, violates the origination clause."
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2351.062,2353.828,I think that is a more difficult case.
1996.96-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2369.088,2369.304,Yes.
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2378.444,2380.46,I... I believe--
1996.96-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.46,2381.36,Article III.
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2381.36,2385.931,--I believe that... that the injure... that the person may have suffered an injury.
1996.96-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2393.87,2420.437,"What about the President is about to enter into an executive agreement with a foreign country regarding the Panama Canal, regarding NATO, regarding whatever, and an individual member of the Senate believes that this is in fact a matter that should be subject to treaty, and therefore, that he has been deprived of his right to vote on the conclusion of that treaty; does that matter come before us?"
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2420.437,2442.183,"Well, as far as a standing question is concerned, when this Court had before it the Goldwater case, which is the converse of that, the Court declined to reach the merits, but no member of this Court said that there was a lack of standing for Senator Goldwater, although that issue had been specifically passed upon by the court of appeals in a divided opinion."
1996.96-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2442.183,2443.516,That was a summary disposition.
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2443.516,2444.416,"It was, Your Honor."
1996.96-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2465.296,2473.135,So I have to think of something else other than standing to... to prevent these matters from being brought immediately into the Court?
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2473.135,2473.985,--I think you do.
1996.96-1671,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2476.503,2476.586,"No, no."
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2481.387,2482.371,Yes.
1996.96-1671,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2482.871,2489.977,"--But not here, because Congress can always wipe that out by providing that the... providing a right to sue."
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2489.977,2494.845,And I think it's particularly important that they provided the right to sue in the bill itself.
1996.96-1671,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2499.516,2511.323,"Well, what... what about the situation of a bill passed by Congress that we would all agree is an improper delegation of legislative authority to the executive branch."
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2517.394,2526.4,"--In my view, that member has been injured in a constitutional sense, but I do not believe that you have to agree with me on that proposition to find standing here."
1996.96-1671,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2527.916,2531.887,"Yes, but we're trying to explore with you how far your theory would take you."
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2531.887,2531.97,--Yes.
1996.96-1671,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2531.97,2535.088,"So they would have been able to come in, in Mistretta, for example?"
1996.96-1671,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2535.088,2536.155,--That's right.
1996.96-1671,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3958.6,3969.622,"Mr. Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy raised the question about irregularity in the legislative process as being an allegation that would give rise to standing."
1996.96-1671,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4043.002,4044.768,"Thank you, General Dellinger."
