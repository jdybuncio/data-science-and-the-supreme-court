1971.71-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,39.566,"We'll hear arguments next in number 71-16, United States against Mandel."
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,41.04,43.902,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-16,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,185.441,187.415,He was a what kind of a Marxist?
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,187.415,187.824,A revolutionary.
1971.71-16,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,187.824,189.927,I thought you said common market at first.
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,189.927,192.0,"No, Communist Party."
1971.71-16,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,212.424,216.243,Is he interested in academic life or a political life?
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,216.243,228.977,"Academic life primarily, and he has written a book called, Marxist Economic, that is considered a well-known work and indeed his works are sometimes studied in college."
1971.71-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,374.461,377.264,"Excuse me, Mr. Friedman, on the 58 of the Appendix."
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,377.264,385.442,"68, I am sorry, 68 of the Appendix, Mr. Chief Justice, at the bottom of that page and last paragraph."
1971.71-16,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,510.15,516.188,Mr. Friedman do you read the judgment of the three-judge court as turning exclusively unconstitutional ground.
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,516.188,527.32,"I do Mr. Justice, I do Mr. Justice, that's the whole theory of it and as far as we can tell the Court to did not decide any of the other attacks which the plaintiffs made upon the statute."
1971.71-16,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,527.32,528.041,What was the question?
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,529.146,535.726,The question is whether I read the judgment of the District Court as turning solely on constitutional grounds and my answer is I do.
1971.71-16,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,602.875,618.036,"Under your theory, could a born professor who planned to come here to teach Mandel's text, that book you called, what's it, The Marxist Economic Theory?"
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,618.036,618.606,Yes.
1971.71-16,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,618.606,620.43,Would he be excluded?
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,620.43,632.582,"I think it, iI am not certain about it, let me just -- if I made just look at the statute again."
1971.71-16,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,632.582,640.039,He is coming here to teach this theory in Mandel's book.
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,640.039,652.172,"I suppose it could be under subsection (j) because it refers to who knowingly having their possession for the purpose of circulation, publication, distribution, or display any written or printed matter."
1971.71-16,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,665.592,666.182,I understand.
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,666.182,668.197,"Yes I think, I think --"
1971.71-16,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,668.197,679.218,How far you would go because the Court is not pretty far to let the academic community stand alone in what wants to teach.
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,679.218,684.092,I think the academic community of course has the right as to what it wants to teach and there is nothing.
1971.71-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,800.211,811.825,Let me be sure what has happened to the argument that statute is unconstitutional because it rests under viewable authority and the Attorney General.
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,812.828,815.465,"No, that argument has not been abandoned."
1971.71-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1106.839,1110.543,Well he could send tape recordings.
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1110.543,1115.67,"He can send tape recordings, he could send books, his books are freely brought in here."
1971.71-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1115.67,1117.528,I thought your statement was a little too broad.
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1117.528,1118.943,"Oh, I am sorry Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.71-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1118.943,1119.604,That he --
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1119.604,1122.474,"He cannot speak in person here, he cannot speak in person."
1971.71-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1122.474,1129.436,"They could tape, well I ask you, could they tape a video tape in Brussels and send it over in air or all the networks."
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1129.436,1132.203,"I would see no reason -- I would see no reason, why not."
1971.71-16,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1289.544,1306.237,"His, at least this difference, however, the cases that which you have been citing us of all of that cases in which Congress in its wisdom or lack of it has decided to exclude certain kinds of people who want to come to this country."
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1326.611,1333.137,"I think not mistrust Mr. Justice, Congress has broadly prohibited admission of --"
1971.71-16,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1333.137,1337.443,"Well, except in fact and I have seen the figures and the briefs and the papers here."
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1343.239,1351.245,"If I may add one qualification Mr. Justice, the lion's share of those as to whom an affirmative recommendation was made by the counsel."
1971.71-16,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1352.828,1354.288,"Well, here it was made by the Secretary of the State, was it not?"
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1354.288,1354.8,Yeah.
1971.71-16,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1361.203,1365.587,"Yes, but we are talking about this category where it's made by the Counsel or the Secretary of the State."
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1365.587,1390.528,"But if I may suggest Mr. Justice, that the cases I have cited in addition to recognizing the broad discretion of the Congress to exclude aliens have also correspondingly recognized that the congress may delegate to administrative officers discretion to decide whether to admit or exclude a particular alien."
1971.71-16,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1554.408,1561.685,"Mr. Friedman, if we follow this language in Jay of unfettered discretion."
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1565.677,1568.847,"We are on this case, because Mr. Justice, the District Court --"
1971.71-16,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1568.847,1572.15,"If it's unfettered, why court should be involved with it at all?"
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1573.293,1576.84,But because the district court has struck down.
1971.71-16,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1576.84,1581.056,That's your position that the District Court could do nothing.
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1581.056,1582.783,"Well, our position Mr. Justice."
1971.71-16,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1582.783,1584.762,Or that was unfettered means?
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1584.762,1585.382,That's right.
1971.71-16,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1588.417,1592.624,But can Congress give unfettered discretion.
1971.71-16,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1592.624,1596.218,This court has said that Mr. Justice in Jay against Boyd.
1971.71-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1628.291,1630.555,Thank you Mr. Friedman.
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1631.435,1639.885,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the court.
1971.71-16,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1671.828,1673.909,"Well, are they asserting his rights?"
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1673.909,1677.389,They are asserting their rights Your Honor and not his.
1971.71-16,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1842.715,1845.809,The District Court didn't pass on your alternative though?
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1845.809,1852.365,"No, the District Court didn't pass on our alternatives, because the Government really didn't give it the chance to."
1971.71-16,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2149.854,2158.984,How do you compare what the government assets here with the power of the Attorney General to suspend deportation.
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2159.879,2161.912,I think they are they are quite similar powers.
1971.71-16,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2161.912,2163.506,Has that not been supported?
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2163.506,2169.428,"I think it has been supported, but in no case has been supported where the court has found."
1971.71-16,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2194.101,2201.453,"Mr. Boudin in Jay, the court did refer to the power of Attorney General to suspend the petitioner's unfettered discretion."
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2201.453,2209.166,"I think it it did Your Honor, but I think it found that as a practical matter there was no arbitrary action on the part of the Attorney General."
1971.71-16,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2311.763,2324.544,"Mr. Boudin before you do that, aren't there a number of acts by which the Congress has vested in administrative agencies un-reviewable power to make certain determinations?"
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2328.91,2334.964,"I think Mr. Chief Justice, I would distinguish any case and I am not to be familiar with that particular problem."
1971.71-16,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2342.523,2350.26,Your point links First Amendment with any effort to grant un-reviewable power?
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2350.26,2351.85,"Exactly, in other words in --"
1971.71-16,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2351.85,2357.493,In this case you link it to the First Amendment rights of Americans to listen?
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2357.493,2363.945,"Precisely, I am relying specifically upon three lines of decisions which this court has handed down."
1971.71-16,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2782.466,2798.739,"Mr. Boudin in view of what you say as the tripartite line of cases you rely on, I take it you would feel case were not as strong if instead of being college professors who wanted him here, it was just some of his relatives or some friends in this case?"
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2798.739,2799.792,"Oh, I can clear."
1971.71-16,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2809.824,2814.997,Do you suggest those rights are greater for academic community people and for others?
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,2814.997,2820.755,"I remember Your Honor -- Mr. Chief Justice, I warned myself about leaders and I am not sure."
1971.71-16,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3121.675,3143.572,"Mr. Boudin, if we follow your theory of this statute that you are reading of this statute, anytime would it not then result that anytime 100 people signed a petition and said they wanted hear from some person generally falling in the class of excludable aliens they would have to be admitted?"
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,3145.483,3146.409,I don't think Your Honor.
1971.71-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3182.536,3195.372,"Mr. Boudin do you think, the government's case would be stronger or weaker if the Attorney General had said I am refusing entry, because I don't like his views just like the statute says."
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,3195.372,3201.244,"Then I think I would be faced with an attack on the statute and I would have a harder burden, but I would attack the statute."
1971.71-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3201.244,3206.853,Is it more arbitrary to give no reason than to a give a reason that I don't like your views?
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,3206.853,3213.948,"If the Attorney General had said I am following the statute strictly -- well, I don't think the Attorney General could do that."
1971.71-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3216.95,3217.224,"Well, I think he is."
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,3217.224,3228.426,"I think the statement -- the problem you are posing Mr. Justice is one in which we are faced with where the statute says, there is an absolute ban; and that would place a burden on me and I would have to meet it is for court --"
1971.71-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3228.426,3233.457,"Well, the statute does authorize exclusion based on views?"
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,3233.457,3237.089,"Yes, it does and I would challenge that, but I don't think that I have to challenge that."
1971.71-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3237.089,3241.729,"Well, if the Attorney General says, based on views, I am going to keep you out."
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,3243.6,3251.111,"I think that would be improper, because Congress intended the Attorney General exercised the discretion with respect to the views also."
1971.71-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3251.434,3256.973,"So was it constitutional to give him the discretion, but it's unconstitutional or it's important not to exercise?"
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,3256.973,3259.16,It depends on how it's exercised.
1971.71-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3267.683,3276.512,I take it that you don't think you have to -- I take it you think you can concede that the statute is valid on his face and still win.
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,3276.512,3278.006,But only purposes of winning.
1971.71-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3278.006,3280.207,"Well, I understand that."
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,3280.207,3282.274,"Well, for the other purpose Your Honor."
1971.71-16,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3282.274,3288.537,That means that every exercise of discretion by an Attorney General under the statute is subject to judicial review?
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,3288.537,3290.086,"No, I would not say that."
1971.71-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3394.425,3402.779,Isn't it also true this court has never upset a decision to exclude aliens previously?
1971.71-16,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,3402.779,3407.411,"I think Your Honor is correct, that the Court has never excluded aliens."
1971.71-16,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3446.262,3457.349,"Thank you Mr. Boudin, thank you Mr. Friedman."
