2002.01-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.125,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 01-1862, Jeanne Woodford, Warden versus Robert Frederick Garceau."
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,11.596,14.762,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1862,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,108.855,112.559,"Well, what do we do about McFarland's approach?"
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,112.559,116.212,"--Your Honor, I believe that... that these are easily reconciled."
2002.01-1862,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,157.06,159.463,It's the difference between a case and a proceeding.
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,162.422,185.192,"The... actually, the provisions of chapter 153 themselves do not contain the word case. That... we only come to that term at all because in this Court's opinion in Lindh, the Court looked to... created a... viewed the... as being a negative inference from the absence of the pending cases language that appears in the 154 provisions."
2002.01-1862,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,216.855,218.812,How was it treated on the court's docket?
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,229.372,233.863,--That would... it could be characterized as... you could use the word case.
2002.01-1862,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,236.03,237.769,Do you know how it was in fact?
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,240.083,240.627,It--
2002.01-1862,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,240.627,242.468,Was it given a case name and a file?
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,242.468,246.463,"--It was... it was certainly given a case name and assigned a case number, undoubtedly, but I do not--"
2002.01-1862,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,246.463,249.265,And would that number indicate that it was a habeas petition?
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,249.265,257.815,"--I'm sure it did because our courts in California, the... the district courts have numbers that specify that it's a habeas proceeding."
2002.01-1862,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,257.815,261.212,So it was on the docket as a habeas case.
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,261.212,262.093,That's correct.
2002.01-1862,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,262.093,262.931,And that's not good enough.
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,262.931,264.886,That's not determinative.
2002.01-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,291.532,295.973,"Well, McFarland was a totally different statute from AEDPA, was it not?"
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,298.823,299.992,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,299.992,305.899,"And really, what we're trying to interpret here, I take it, is the meaning of some of the language in Lindh."
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,310.609,324.048,"Well, we're concerned about... Lindh used the phrase that... that there was non-retroactivity of chapter 153 to cases... to cases pending under 153."
2002.01-1862,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,340.451,346.39,Why... why would we look to the express terms of the statute when Lindh itself didn't rely on any express terms of this statute?
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,352.519,368.04,"--I would agree with that, that the... what I'm saying is that in the absence of... in the absence of language... there's clearly an absence of language in 153 that addresses this commencement event."
2002.01-1862,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,423.832,425.934,That's the part I wonder.
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,438.775,440.01,"--Yes, it's a possible construction."
2002.01-1862,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,440.01,446.138,"And then... and then it being a possible construction, I wonder, well, there was an awful lot of proceeding that went on here."
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,464.799,476.852,"It was... the... the proceeding was well underway, but that doesn't... is not determinative in... in the sense that counsel had been appointed and a petition was in the works."
2002.01-1862,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,477.148,479.323,That's... that's what I want you to address precisely.
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,486.12,486.915,--I don't--
2002.01-1862,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,486.915,489.535,"--And yet... well, you... you think it's more strong in your direction."
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,510.754,521.256,"--In order to deviate from... from the normal... also, there is no question that in... in the general run of habeas cases, it's triggered by the filing of the application."
2002.01-1862,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,566.455,576.292,"But if everyone had focused on AEDPA, which they didn't because it wasn't enacted at the time all this started, then maybe the district judge would have made the time lines different."
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,607.263,612.851,"--This case that's before the Court does not involve the statute of limitations, however."
2002.01-1862,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,616.457,621.442,"But you don't want AEDPA to apply, if you're diligent counsel, because the standards are much tighter."
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,621.442,624.708,"--It does affect the standards of review, but they don't--"
2002.01-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,624.708,628.332,"Well, counsel didn't have to take all the time that the district court allowed, did he?"
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,628.332,631.429,"--He did not need to, but he... he was fully compliant."
2002.01-1862,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,689.083,691.219,Do we know how many cases fall in this category?
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,699.34,700.296,--That's correct.
2002.01-1862,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,700.296,702.243,How many cases are in that category?
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,702.243,708.837,"We believe... we believe that it affects approximately... in the Ninth Circuit, particularly in California, it affects approximately 45 capital cases."
2002.01-1862,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,708.837,709.809,45 cases.
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,709.809,725.859,"It also... it also, of course, affects the other... those cases, those capital cases, that are covered by the other circuits which currently use... all of which, other than the Ninth Circuit, as to those 45 cases, use the filing date of the application."
2002.01-1862,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,757.983,759.672,Do you happen to know... that was a very good answer.
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,764.082,765.19,"--I'm... I'm sorry, Your Honor, I do not."
2002.01-1862,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,765.19,768.4,--It's a vanishing problem in any event.
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,768.4,770.684,"That's certainly true, but it's very important."
2002.01-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,846.82,849.491,Do you wish to reserve the remainder of your time?
2002.01-1862,0,31901,janis_s_mclean,,849.491,858.319,"Your Honor, I do."
2002.01-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,860.849,861.983,"Very well, Ms. McLean."
2002.01-1862,1,34269,lynne_s_coffin,,863.597,867.944,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,932.389,949.279,"Well, are you... are you saying, Ms. Coffin, that McFarland is controlling in the very strict sense of the word here, that if... we must rule in your favor without looking anywhere else just because of the decision in McFarland?"
2002.01-1862,1,34269,lynne_s_coffin,,949.279,950.275,No.
2002.01-1862,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,999.83,1004.72,When... when did Congress pass the law that... that overturned the result in McFarland?
2002.01-1862,1,34269,lynne_s_coffin,,1008.08,1017.165,"No, no. What I said was that they passed AEDPA, and when they did that, they were informed in how they wrote that statute by McFarland."
2002.01-1862,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1018.332,1018.793,Okay.
2002.01-1862,1,34269,lynne_s_coffin,,1022.333,1032.162,"Well, in... yes and no. I mean, I think that they... they had an opportunity to change 848(q) and looked at 848(q)--"
2002.01-1862,2,31901,janis_s_mclean,,2581.464,2585.45,"Your Honor, I respectfully disagree with that."
2002.01-1862,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2599.884,2601.967,"Well, I'm... I... I take it the district court is interested."
2002.01-1862,2,31901,janis_s_mclean,,2650.588,2662.807,No. And the reason for that is that that document that is filed is so skeletal that it absolutely bears no resemblance to a... ultimately to a petition.
2002.01-1862,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2707.888,2710.326,The only expectation is you'll get a stay until you file your petition.
2002.01-1862,2,31901,janis_s_mclean,,2710.326,2710.66,--Exactly.
2002.01-1862,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2720.346,2721.239,"Well, why... why--"
2002.01-1862,2,31901,janis_s_mclean,,2745.269,2753.913,"In McFarland, this Court was construing the term post-conviction proceeding and saying... because 848... 21 U.S.C. 848--"
2002.01-1862,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2753.913,2755.744,Before whom a habeas corpus proceeding is pending.
2002.01-1862,2,31901,janis_s_mclean,,2756.021,2760.785,"--That is actually the... the companion provision, the State provision, in 2251."
