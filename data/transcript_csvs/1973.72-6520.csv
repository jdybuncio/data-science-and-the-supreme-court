1973.72-6520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.046,"We’ll hear arguments next in number 72-6520, Lau and others against Nichols."
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,55.705,56.979,Thank you.
1973.72-6520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,116.881,120.244,"But, if I may interrupt you."
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,130.911,135.412,"They are both Chinese-Americans, they are both native-born and they are also foreign-born, Your Honor."
1973.72-6520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,148.284,148.829,"Oh, they are?"
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,148.829,155.062,"Yes, five of them, David Leung, David San, Judy San, Karen Lee, Karen Yee and John Yee (ph)."
1973.72-6520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,155.062,162.517,"There’s been a good deal of recent immigration in the United States and particularly into the City of San Francisco, has there not from Taiwan?"
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,162.517,163.784,Oh definitely!
1973.72-6520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,201.199,209.947,"Has -- and this 1,800 is out of how many Chinese or Chinese-American students in the school population of San Francisco?"
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,209.947,219.4,"In the school population of San Francisco, in the record of the case, there are approximately, one figure as 13,000 from the City Attorney, one figure as 15,000 from the School District."
1973.72-6520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,245.755,248.578,"But what was that 13,000 or 15,000 figure?"
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,248.578,251.771,The total number of Chinese students within the San Francisco school system.
1973.72-6520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,251.771,256.458,"So that these -- this group of 1,800 is something more than 10%?"
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,256.458,258.721,"Probably between 10% and 15%, depending on which figure it is."
1973.72-6520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,258.721,281.268,"And the -- I was just curious whether or not Native-born American, that is American citizens in San Francisco grow up not knowing English, or whether this group does embrace primarily recent immigrants from Taiwan and elsewhere."
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,281.268,285.883,I don’t think that it can -- based on the facts in the case Your Honor although the school system does not break it down.
1973.72-6520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,314.542,322.754,"Yes, I know the argument but my query as to why, it was as to why they don’t speak English and I think that may have something to do with this case."
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,322.754,331.714,"I think why they don’t speak English, of course, is not in the record, but I think that these Court can take cognizant of the fact that the Chinese community in San Francisco is what we refer to as a ghetto."
1973.72-6520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,342.701,349.266,"Well in the Chinatown part of San Francisco, is it true that most people there don’t speak English?"
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,349.266,350.134,I don’t know the facts --
1973.72-6520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,350.134,352.837,Only a ghetto doesn’t answer that question one way or the other?
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,352.837,364.0,"I don’t know, I don’t think we can speak in terms of those, but I think we can speak in terms of the 1,800 students, a vast percentage or Native-born Americans who have lived their entire lives in San Francisco, and have come into the school system speaking no English."
1973.72-6520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,364.0,366.785,"You say a vast majority now, these 1,800, are they native-born?"
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,366.785,369.902,"Well again, I cannot address that because it is not in the record."
1973.72-6520,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,387.515,389.75,What is your ultimate complaint?
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,396.522,397.523,Oh no!
1973.72-6520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,430.103,435.139,So you would have the same objection if they taught them in Chinese?
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,435.139,441.562,"If the school system decided that teaching them in Chinese was the most effective method that would be a bilingual method, Your Honor."
1973.72-6520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,443.97,446.01,You wouldn’t complain if they taught them in Chinese?
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,446.01,449.993,So long as they would be able to understand the language of the instruction which they’re getting throughout the school system.
1973.72-6520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,449.993,455.063,I thought you said you wanted them to learn English so that they could survive in our society.
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,455.063,461.323,"Well, under the state -- under the law of State of California, the school system must primarily teach them in English."
1973.72-6520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,481.477,488.074,"Do you know how many other students from the so-called ghetto besides these 1,800 are in the schools?"
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,491.081,496.054,Again the school system has not broken down the place from which the Chinese students come.
1973.72-6520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,505.829,512.937,"And all that you like -- and you, you complain only about 1,800 of them who aren’t passable in English?"
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,512.937,518.957,"Well, we’re complaining of the 1,800 who were non-English speaking Chinese students."
1973.72-6520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,539.74,540.501,Excuse me.
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,565.535,572.527,"Well, I cannot tell you why these 1,800 came to school and not knowing English and other Chinese students do."
1973.72-6520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,572.527,577.641,"Well do you think, it carried your burden of proof if that isn’t in the record?"
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,577.641,587.406,"Oh, I think we have because I think we have shown that the school system has admitted that these 1,800 students receive today no educational opportunities."
1973.72-6520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,594.353,610.158,"So for whatever reason or whatever reason a person comes to the school not knowingly English, your position is that he must -- that the school has an obligation to take some special steps to make him passable in English?"
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,610.158,615.752,"Well the school district, Your Honor, is not possible in this regard. The school district compels these students to come to school."
1973.72-6520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,618.643,619.374,"Well, I understand that."
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,633.582,636.208,If two things are satisfied.
1973.72-6520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,655.139,661.156,But the majority of which children from that group know English?
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,661.156,674.524,"That maybe so on the facts, but I don’t -- my understanding of the case is that not every member of a suspect class, if I can use that terminology, must be discriminated again before this Court will give a special protection."
1973.72-6520,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,674.524,677.529,Of course this takes us to the next obvious question.
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,693.382,711.174,"If Your Honor assumes that the situation comparing the Portuguese children the same as in this case, where the school system admits that they can receive no possible educational benefits, use it for exclusion, then I think, the school district would have an obligation to do something."
1973.72-6520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,723.188,724.941,But why not?
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,728.298,737.333,"No, I am speaking to relief that teaching the five Portuguese that it might be the type of relief that they might just be able to use cassettes, that they might just be able to use some flexible --"
1973.72-6520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,737.333,740.982,"Well, that has nothing to do with the constitutional right."
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,740.982,748.524,"Oh, no, I am saying that if they are effectively excluded, these Portuguese students would have -- I would assume they are members of a national origin."
1973.72-6520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,764.786,768.925,"Well, but something can only be one thing and that is to teach them English, isn’t it?"
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,768.925,770.352,But how that is done?
1973.72-6520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,796.666,801.133,"But you say, the constitutional right is the same right?"
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,801.133,806.574,I mean that there was the effective exclusion which of course to the factual question which has to be dealt within the case.
1973.72-6520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,806.574,814.628,"But if they cannot speak English, there is a constitutional obligation on the Government to teach them English."
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,816.507,818.135,If the Government is going to have --
1973.72-6520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,818.135,819.889,"Well, just -- that’s a yes or a no?"
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,824.891,826.602,"The answer is yes, that we have a system of education."
1973.72-6520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,826.602,838.079,"And then obviously that that applies, to pursue Mr. Justice Blackmun’s point to Russians, Israelis, Norwegians, Danes etcetera."
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,840.36,845.619,"Well, but again we are assuming that the one Russian student in a given community."
1973.72-6520,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,866.447,870.767,Is your position the same as to deaf children too?
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,870.767,875.187,We are contending that our students unlike the deaf child are not primarily handicap.
1973.72-6520,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,885.718,887.459,You are not concerned then with the deaf children?
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,887.459,888.254,I am very much concerned.
1973.72-6520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,921.382,932.48,"What if the state were to relieve your plaintiffs of their compulsory obligation to attend school, would that undermine or overcome your constitutional argument?"
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,932.48,936.049,That sort of a question which I think this Court would have to answer after Rodriguez.
1973.72-6520,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,958.553,966.691,"Mr. Steinman, I take it that the Title VI argument was never -- couldn’t have been raised in the District Court?"
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,966.691,968.258,It was raised in the District Court Your Honor.
1973.72-6520,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1001.608,1011.286,"If Congress had intended to have Title VI apply to this kind of a situation, do you think they would have been more precise in their statutory language?"
1973.72-6520,0,23235,edward_h_steinman,,1011.286,1015.361,"Well, I hope I could address the question as Mr. Will Pottinger address himself to."
1973.72-6520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1290.55,1291.78,Mr. Pottinger.
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1291.78,1295.377,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-6520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1434.7,1440.181,"Of course, Mr. Pottinger, this applies only to the school districts that participate in the grant program?"
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1440.181,1441.675,That is correct.
1973.72-6520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1441.675,1445.476,And would that -- is that rather comprehensive throughout the country or --
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1445.476,1448.223,It is Mr. Justice.
1973.72-6520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1448.223,1450.572,That is virtually every school district in one form or another?
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1450.572,1453.357,It would reach virtually all pubic school systems.
1973.72-6520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.357,1456.309,"Well, does it reach all the districts involved in this case?"
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1456.309,1456.995,It does.
1973.72-6520,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1504.837,1512.188,Doesn’t HEW itself has a -- have a sanction that defines non-compliance with Title VI i.e. cutting off the fund?
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1512.188,1515.667,"Yes, Mr. Justice it does."
1973.72-6520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1540.46,1565.254,Didn’t this Court suggest that that was the remedy I think in Rosado against Wyman or one of the New York cases that when states are not complying with conditions of grants that the remedy was to cut off the grant and that the District Court had an alternative remedy or duty indeed to stop the expenditure of federal money?
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1565.254,1567.448,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct."
1973.72-6520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1747.437,1759.771,"Well, would you relate that concretely for me to the colloquy we had with your associate on Russians, Portuguese, Danes, Israelis etcetera?"
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1759.771,1761.649,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice Burger I would be pleased to."
1973.72-6520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1875.819,1879.739,Are you suggesting that Spanish-speaking people are not Caucasian?
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1879.739,1883.091,"No, I would like to correct myself in that regard."
1973.72-6520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1889.71,1893.83,Would you think the Spanish aren’t Western European?
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1893.83,1895.323,The --
1973.72-6520,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1895.323,1896.522,Or the Portuguese?
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1896.522,1920.892,"The Portuguese and Spanish clearly are Western European, if my understanding of geography is still correct, Mr. Justice, but I would hasten to add that the -- without going too much into the history of the Mexican-American population in this country that it took significant degree, that particular segment of our population has not been treated as Western European Caucasians."
1973.72-6520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1959.982,1970.932,"Do you thought -- do you think our recent opinion in the Karl case bears on this one at all, in terms of the significance of your guidelines and their validity?"
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1970.932,1973.544,"Mr. Justice White, I don’t believe it is controlling."
1973.72-6520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1979.629,1982.003,But you’re claiming this is an act of words in discriminating?
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1982.003,1983.062,That is correct.
1973.72-6520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.062,1997.976,"And although nothing reads on national origin in school district policies because they teach -- they certainly had met Chinese, they treat all Chinese the same as whites."
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1997.976,1999.368,Mr. Justice White with all deference --
1973.72-6520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1999.368,2002.786,Except for those that they give special instruction to?
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2002.786,2007.642,Well I believe that it isn’t -- is not the case that they do treat all Chinese --
1973.72-6520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2007.642,2008.91,"That’s your point, I take it?"
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2008.91,2017.818,"That is correct, that is the point and to underline Mr. Steinman’s point in this regard, the class of petitioners here is excluded entirely."
1973.72-6520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2135.648,2140.565,"Mr. Pottinger, I note in your brief, you support Mr. Steinman’s constitutional argument."
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2140.565,2141.222,That is correct.
1973.72-6520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2141.222,2151.921,"But I gather, what you told us about the scope of the 601, if we agree with this, we don’t have to reach the constitutional argument, do we?"
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2151.921,2155.583,That is possible that that is the case.
1973.72-6520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2170.962,2189.05,"Well -- but that is not so here and I -- ordinarily, I think our practice has been – our policy rather, not to reach constitutional questions with statutory determination favorable to the petitioners can be made?"
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2189.05,2196.05,"Well, I believe that distinctions that do exist here may be addressed by Mr. Steinman, that is adequate."
1973.72-6520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2196.05,2208.291,"But if you are right, we agree with you on the statutory basis, it will be quite inappropriate to reach the constitutional issue at al, wouldn't it?"
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2208.291,2214.803,But we believe that with regard to the effect of this decision we have on other cases similarly situated that would not be correct.
1973.72-6520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2215.245,2218.381,"Other Chinese, other Chinese?"
1973.72-6520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.381,2221.031,How would you relate other cases?
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2221.031,2223.701,Well that is distinctly possible.
1973.72-6520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.283,2246.436,"Well, I thought all courts were obliged to deal with statutory issues or constitutional issues in the Ninth Circuit?"
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2246.436,2247.982,"Well, I believe that is the case."
1973.72-6520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2251.943,2263.448,But is it clear that the Title VI remedy is broad enough to reach all the people who are now before the Court?
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2263.448,2266.156,"Yes, it is correct that that would happen."
1973.72-6520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2282.871,2293.811,"Well, may I suggest the technique is simply to decide the statutory issue, and say therefore, it’s not necessary for us and the other Court to have reached the constitutional question?"
1973.72-6520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2293.811,2296.455,"But of course under the Ninth Circuit had no choice, did it?"
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2309.978,2312.475,That is correct Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1973.72-6520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2323.01,2344.434,"Conceivably a state, perhaps remote, but it’s conceivable that the state might say, if those are the burdens on Title VI grants, we’ll reject all these grants and then our school system without federal aid and then that case would present pure constitutional question, would it not?"
1973.72-6520,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2344.434,2348.878,That is correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-6520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2348.899,2354.192,Very well Mr. Pottinger.
1973.72-6520,2,43162,thomas_m_o’conner,,2356.15,2359.701,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-6520,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2494.946,2499.492,"If all of this is true, what’s this case about then?"
1973.72-6520,2,43162,thomas_m_o’conner,,2499.492,2516.152,This case I think is a case which says that the school board in San Francisco must supply special instruction in English to all students who may require it.
1973.72-6520,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2516.152,2530.152,"Now you told us that you provided for a Japanese, Filipinos, Chicanos, and Chinese and the Chinese who are involved here, what is it, just your program for the Chinese is not big enough?"
1973.72-6520,2,43162,thomas_m_o’conner,,2533.482,2544.204,These are my preliminary statements to show the disposition of San Francisco as far as an attitude toward instructing its children in -- who do not speak the language.
1973.72-6520,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2544.204,2559.843,"Right, and you have told us that your -- the practice and policy is to teach English to these people and that prompted my inquiry as to if that is true, what’s this case for controversy?"
1973.72-6520,2,43162,thomas_m_o’conner,,2559.843,2583.106,"Our contention is that contrary to what the plaintiffs in this case stated, say they are the group who has not been reached as far as programs are concerned and that San Francisco under the Equal Protection Clause must cover every child with a non-English speaking problem."
1973.72-6520,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2597.434,2605.657,"But if you are doing this, as I thought -- I’d understood you are telling us that you are, then the -- nobody needs to decide whether or not it is your constitutional duty?"
1973.72-6520,2,43162,thomas_m_o’conner,,2605.657,2609.037,I didn’t mean to say that we are covering the program entirely.
1973.72-6520,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2621.17,2625.288,"Well, let’s come down to the 1,800, are they all covered or not?"
1973.72-6520,2,43162,thomas_m_o’conner,,2625.288,2643.43,"Well, in 1971 when this case was decided, there were -- under stipulation of facts and it was not a stipulation that the children as stated where doomed, that they did not get education."
1973.72-6520,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2652.526,2654.069,And weren’t getting it?
1973.72-6520,2,43162,thomas_m_o’conner,,2654.069,2669.751,"And there where 2,856 students in the school district with who are non-English speaking Chinese children and of that the number 1,800 received no special instruction."
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5217.735,5226.264,"I think that what has been happening, Your Honor, is that the Court is focusing only one possible method, that would be a bilingual method where the teacher speaks Chinese as well as English."
1973.72-6520,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5227.188,5228.054,Which Chinese?
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5228.054,5229.167,-- method most commonly employed --
1973.72-6520,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5229.167,5230.615,Which Chinese dialect?
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5230.615,5233.384,"Well, it’s a problem which the City has never alluded to."
1973.72-6520,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5321.479,5326.024,"Sooner or later they will learn to communicate, but not very well --"
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5326.024,5327.497,"That is something which is debatable, Your Honor."
1973.72-6520,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5336.596,5340.332,"Well, do we know that those now getting the instruction, do they learn English?"
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5340.332,5342.457,"Those getting the special help, yes."
1973.72-6520,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5343.72,5346.39,Do those programs succeed?
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5346.39,5347.749,I am not an educator.
1973.72-6520,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5362.774,5368.022,"Well, hasn’t been what your colleague there said a little while ago, he said it was effective?"
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5368.022,5375.982,"Well I am citing the appending pages 103 to 104, Mr. O’Conner as I believe are making statements that are not reflected by the record."
1973.72-6520,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5434.719,5448.414,"Mr. Steinman, may I just change the subject a second. I notice at 4 (a) and 5 (a) of your brief, is this contract, Title VI contract, which apparently dates back to 1965."
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5452.215,5462.946,"My understanding is that -- I just checked with Mr. Pottinger that this -- the school system at the end of a given contract year can refuse to, you know, can say we don’t wish to participate anymore."
1973.72-6520,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5482.546,5493.728,"Well, I gather at least [Attempt to Laughter] the breadth of this contract would indicate that you can’t get out of a particular program, but you got to get out of all programs."
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5497.925,5499.553,Mr. Pottinger agrees with the interpretation.
1973.72-6520,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5499.553,5505.005,"And San Francisco couldn’t just drop this one, it would have to drop all funded programs, wouldn't it?"
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5505.005,5507.764,That’s right and as Mr. O’Conner said he does not know what they would do.
1973.72-6520,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5507.764,5511.439,"Well, practically how much of a Title VI programs are there."
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5524.715,5530.379,"Your Honor, I’m just saying that the possible problems in the future which the Court if it does not wish to address now, need not."
1973.72-6520,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5530.379,5534.273,"Well, [Attempt to Laughter] why can’t we wait till they arise if the statute protects it, covers this?"
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5534.273,5536.185,If that is the Court’s wishes naturally.
1973.72-6520,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5536.941,5539.202,Don’t we usually?
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5539.202,5553.248,"My understanding that in some cases, especially cases where you have national origin type of problems, race problems, some of this segregation cases that this Court when faced with a combined statutory, constitution argument has chose not to. Naturally this is something for the Court to decide."
1973.72-6520,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5555.377,5559.56,Do you remember one of those?
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5559.56,5566.872,My understanding that some of the segregation case was raised in the late 60’s involved both complaints under Civil Rights Act as well as constitutional.
1973.72-6520,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5566.872,5567.713,Can you give me an example?
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5567.713,5570.377,I cannot give you one.
1973.72-6520,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5570.377,5582.376,"I gather an intimation from what you said that as a practical matter, the State of California or any particular school district could not afford to withdraw totally from federal programs."
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5592.785,5594.218,I would guess that would be true.
1973.72-6520,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5595.981,5602.267,Do you know off-hand what in millions of dollars how much California is getting under these programs?
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5602.267,5603.738,"No, I don’t know off-hand."
1973.72-6520,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5604.724,5605.934,It must be a very large sum of money?
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5605.934,5606.184,Yes.
1973.72-6520,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5610.463,5617.599,"Lastly, more I should assume than the $2 million they are now spending for the second language program."
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5617.599,5621.473,"Well, the $2 million is for all non-English-speaking students in San Francisco."
1973.72-6520,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5675.092,5691.834,"Mr. Steinman, would your constitutional grievance be met if the classes were conducted for these 1,800 children in Chinese,if they went to school where they could learn manual training and arithmetic and domestic science and --"
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5691.834,5702.566,"If the school system feels, Mr. Justice Stewart, that the most effective way for these children to gain a master of English is to teach them only in Chinese then I would have -- I would abide by the decision."
1973.72-6520,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5713.444,5716.131,I am just asking about your constitutional grievance?
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5716.131,5725.443,"So long as the children would not be effectively excluded from having understanding the instructions given in other courses, my constitutional grievance I think might be settled."
1973.72-6520,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5733.387,5740.489,"Well but let’s -- we are talking about your constitutional grievance, not about the California law?"
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5740.489,5741.977,If they were just taught Chinese --
1973.72-6520,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5741.977,5747.484,Just taught in Chinese.
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5747.484,5757.709,"I would think that they would then probably have a constitutional grievance if they wished to be taught what other students in California are being taught, that is in the language -- English language --"
1973.72-6520,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5757.709,5773.495,"(Inaudible) Theory, educational theory around and sometimes at least by people taking extreme position sometimes caused in -- cause the terms or because of the Constitution that it’s wrong to homogenize everybody."
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5803.67,5806.168,I believe what you are alluding to sir is bilingual programs where the --
1973.72-6520,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5806.168,5808.673,"No, I’m not, I’m not."
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5808.673,5809.891,"Pardon me then, I’m sorry."
1973.72-6520,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5809.891,5817.841,And I wondered if there might not be alternative answers therefore to your constitutional grievance.
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5817.841,5822.044,The alternative answers would be within the methods and programs devised by the school system.
1973.72-6520,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5834.121,5840.246,"It might be a little hard to teach Shakespeare or Charles Dickens in Chinese, might it not?"
1973.72-6520,3,23235,edward_h_steinman,,5840.246,5845.717,"I think it would be and I think that is where the bilingual program, the English aspect is utilized."
1973.72-6520,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5846.79,5847.923,"Very well, thank you gentlemen."
