1973.72-1490,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,52.761,"We'll hear arguments next in 72-1490, Federal Power Commission against Texaco and 1491, Dougherty and others against Texaco."
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,56.001,58.737,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,446.869,457.559,"well, I gather Mr. Evans, if in the pipeline proceeding it's determined that the producer rates are too high, there's no requirement that the small producers’ refund, (Voice Overlap)."
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,457.559,458.009,That’s right.
1973.72-1490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,479.757,481.738,Judge Fay disagreed with that didn’t he?
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,481.738,488.775,"Well Judge Fay, he concluded that it would be appropriate to strike the no refund aspects of the -- of this order."
1973.72-1490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,616.865,619.049,Is there a definition of small producers?
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,619.049,630.377,"Small producers, Mr. Justice are defined, I’m not sure where in the order, but they’re defined similar -- similarly to the way they were defined in the Permian case to include all --"
1973.72-1490,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,630.377,637.921,"Footnote 5 on page 6, page 5. Footnote 3 on page 5 of your brief."
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,637.921,640.436,Oh!
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,802.575,804.424,"Well, the order isn’t all that fair, is it?"
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,806.494,807.567,I think that’s right.
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,809.04,812.779,"Just as the Court of Appeals couldn’t read it like as you suggested, Mr. Evans?"
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,812.779,814.142,That’s right.
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,816.114,817.51,The Court of Appeals didn’t read it like --
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,817.51,820.084,"They didn’t read it that way, but I think it was an incorrect reading."
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,820.084,824.543,Why does that the Commission objects to putting it in another way?
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,824.543,826.846,"Well, the Commission believes that the --"
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,826.846,837.924,"I mean it’s a -- I suppose the Court of Appeals might come up with different result if you said in the -- plainly in your order, what you claim the order said."
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,837.924,844.08,"Well, the Commission certainly had that option at one point, it doesn’t have it at this point."
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,844.08,845.548,It certainly doesn’t though --
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,845.548,848.811,But there is a substantial problem of delay here.
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,861.069,865.84,"I suppose I -- this is one way of saying what it means, that you’re now saying this is precisely what it means and --"
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,865.84,867.319,That’s one way.
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,867.784,870.48,"So now you’re sending it back, now that you’ve said what it means."
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,870.48,877.218,"Well, in the sense there is no, you know, if the Court construes it the way we suggest it should be construed, that’s what the order means."
1973.72-1490,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,877.218,879.473,"This thing began in 1970, didn’t it?"
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,879.473,889.318,That’s right.
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1053.747,1066.252,"Do you -- the Commission doesn’t contend that the order would permit refunds, you -- your regulation is going to be wholly prospective, I take it?"
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1066.252,1071.864,"With respect to the producer rates, it does permit refunds if the pipelines file for an increase to pass --"
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1071.864,1072.019,Oh!
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1072.744,1072.923,Yes sir.
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1072.923,1074.923,"So maybe the pipelines are on the hook, but --"
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1074.923,1075.419,Yes.
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.419,1080.07,"-- the producer, if you determine that producers have been charging unreasonable rates to the pipeline --"
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1080.07,1081.5,That’s right.
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1081.5,1085.394,-- you’ve committed yourself apparently not to order any refund?
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1085.394,1086.507,That’s correct.
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1087.338,1089.726,Even though the rate is determined to be unreasonable?
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1089.726,1095.213,"Right and, you know, the Act does not require the Commission to order refunds in any case."
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.502,1121.63,"How about the -- what about under the Federal Power Act, is there any independent cause of action for a refund by a consumer or a pipeline?"
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1121.63,1122.967,Under the Natural Gas Act?
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.967,1123.429,Natural Gas Act.
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1123.429,1124.847,I don’t believe there is.
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1129.002,1134.325,"If there was, it wouldn’t do you much good to say that we’re not going to order any refunds?"
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1134.325,1138.621,"Well, I guess right, except I suppose the Commission could, by rule make -- Oh!"
1973.72-1490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1142.051,1144.553,"(Voice Overlap) for managed business, there’s an independent you can sue for it?"
1973.72-1490,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1144.553,1144.772,Right.
1973.72-1490,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1225.524,1226.806,Mr. Vaughan.
1973.72-1490,1,18122,ben_f_vaughan_iii,,1226.806,1229.965,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.72-1490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1273.449,1278.584,"Well, but the refund obligation never comes from the part imposed by the Commission?"
1973.72-1490,1,18122,ben_f_vaughan_iii,,1278.584,1287.362,"It -- Your Honor, it maybe brought in action by a Public Service Commission, but it must be brought in the forum of the Commission and must be brought by the Commission."
1973.72-1490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1287.362,1294.512,"Well, if the -- what's the source of the obligation to refund, only if Commission determines it?"
1973.72-1490,1,18122,ben_f_vaughan_iii,,1294.512,1298.16,"Only if the Commission determines that it -- that the rate that was charged was unjust and unreasonable, Your Honor."
1973.72-1490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.16,1304.914,I thought that -- does it automatically follow that there is a -- that there's a refund obligation if the rate is determined to be unjust and unreasonable?
1973.72-1490,1,18122,ben_f_vaughan_iii,,1304.914,1305.765,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1973.72-1490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1319.064,1324.205,But there's never going to be any -- under this order there's never going to be any refund obligation then?
1973.72-1490,1,18122,ben_f_vaughan_iii,,1324.205,1326.29,"No, Your Honor and I would suggest to the Court --"
1973.72-1490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1326.29,1328.921,I mean there’s nothing of --
1973.72-1490,1,18122,ben_f_vaughan_iii,,1328.921,1332.873,"I -- beg your pardon Your Honor, please finish your question, I --"
1973.72-1490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1332.873,1338.971,"I would suppose you could restate that the worry is being that maybe there ought to be a refund obligation, is that what you’re suggesting?"
1973.72-1490,1,18122,ben_f_vaughan_iii,,1338.971,1339.313,Yes.
1973.72-1490,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1444.805,1460.747,"Mr. Vaughan, what is the economic reason that as Mr. Evans stated, 80% of the exploratory work is by the small producer rather than the large one, theoretically the small one doesn’t have the funds to do this?"
1973.72-1490,1,18122,ben_f_vaughan_iii,,1460.747,1462.391,Why does all this transpire?
1973.72-1490,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1588.364,1593.371,"Very well, Mr. Vaughan."
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,1595.849,1598.496,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.677,2039.824,Oh!
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2039.824,2040.274,Yes.
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2040.274,2047.871,What would you -- what argument would you make if the order actually said what the Commission says it said?
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2055.333,2056.757,Are you saying what they claim here?
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.757,2057.126,Yes.
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2057.126,2057.561,Before the Court?
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2057.561,2058.681,Yes.
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2058.681,2062.195,"I would say that the Act precludes it, absolutely precludes it."
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.539,2084.914,"But they say, they haven’t exempted any one and they say they are regulating --"
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2084.914,2085.259,They say that (Voice Overlap)
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2085.259,2086.166,-- in this Order.
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2086.166,2088.46,They say they’re regulating indirectly through the pipeline.
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.46,2096.306,"And that when -- when and if they find a small producer charging unreasonable rate, they will correct it."
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2096.306,2097.447,Through the pipeline rates?
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2097.447,2098.99,"Well, that’s what they -- they say that --"
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2098.99,2100.345,"Well, they say that."
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2100.345,2100.57,Yes.
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2100.678,2105.903,"And they say that the standards now, that the market standards are the just and reasonable standards."
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2106.039,2110.867,"Well, let’s say that they are two -- it does have two other the factors they take it in consideration, that’s all they say."
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2110.867,2112.526,"Well, the -- yes."
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2113.946,2123.604,"Well, I want to say -- I want to just to accept the -- their Order as they say it now as -- except that -- except the fact that the Order means what they say it means now."
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2123.604,2130.31,I -- you mean that the all other relevant factors really gave them the power to take into consider all -- raising all the things they’re now talking about.
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2130.31,2138.558,"They say that, they say that -- that they do take into a lot -- they -- that they plan to take into consideration a lot more than just those two factors, that’s what they say."
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2138.558,2139.544,"Yes, they do."
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.544,2141.013,"Well, I’ll accept that for the moment."
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2141.013,2142.149,Alright.
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2142.149,2145.536,"Now, what's illegal about their proceeding along this route?"
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2145.536,2149.53,I think the standard is an impossible one to -- for the pipelines to live by.
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2149.53,2152.683,"It may be impossible, but is it illegal under the statute?"
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2152.683,2153.214,Yes.
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2154.44,2155.472,Why is it?
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2155.472,2160.337,"I think in all the decisions, just and reasonable rate does not mean the market price."
1973.72-1490,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2178.51,2180.777,"When they say market price, it’s just one factor."
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2182.951,2184.723,"Well, they did, Mr. --"
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.723,2186.167,What would they be doing now?
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2186.167,2188.019,"They don’t know, that’s right."
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2273.129,2277.982,"And there might be some problems with the pipelines getting together, it might be?"
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2277.982,2286.207,"[Laughter] Yes, I think there could be problems in pipelines getting together and then the producers are well aware of that."
1973.72-1490,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2422.125,2429.135,What do you about to say Mr. Boland about the current power of the Commission to experiment with (Voice Overlap) --
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2429.135,2441.231,"I’m glad you mentioned that Mr. Chief Justice because this is not an experiment and they keep talking about this and Mr. Justice Rehnquist raised the question well wasn’t this started in 1970, it was."
1973.72-1490,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2469.613,2475.446,Is this what they have been in effect during that time or has it been stayed?
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2475.446,2475.738,No.
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2487.661,2488.092,"Well, why --"
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2488.092,2489.051,The order is in effect.
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2489.051,2491.254,Was the Court of Appeals’ judgment stayed?
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2491.254,2493.617,No.
1973.72-1490,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2493.952,2497.499,"Well, so the Federal Power Commission has been proceeding under this system --"
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2497.499,2497.685,Oh!
1973.72-1490,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2498.328,2499.136,-- for three years?
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2499.136,2499.459,Right.
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2501.254,2504.352,But so the Court of Appeals is set to decide?
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2504.352,2508.01,"The Court of Appeals set to decide, that’s right."
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2515.832,2520.051,"How can they be operating under, let's say, if their judgment, if their Order was set aside?"
1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2520.051,2527.415,"Well, the pipelines are still entering into contracts and we have one just in January, Trunkline, Pipeline --"
1973.72-1490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.415,2534.594,"No, I -- if the Court of Appeals set their Order aside, they set it aside, then that judgment hasn’t been stayed, has it?"

1973.72-1490,2,18437,christopher_t_boland,,2563.404,2565.914,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-1490,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2598.924,2601.18,Mr. Schiff.
1973.72-1490,3,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2601.18,2606.174,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.72-1490,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2671.385,2679.08,"Mr. Schiff, before you get there, how much of this cost has to come to the consumer over these three years?"
1973.72-1490,3,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2679.08,2680.229,I can’t answer that.
1973.72-1490,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2680.851,2681.617,"Well, what’s your --"
1973.72-1490,3,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2681.617,2682.554,There's no way of telling.
1973.72-1490,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2682.554,2684.186,"Well, what is your complaint?"
1973.72-1490,3,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2684.186,2685.26,Well --
1973.72-1490,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2685.26,2695.117,"You say -- you said you started off by saying, this high cost will be passed on to the consumer and now you say it hasn’t."
1973.72-1490,3,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2695.117,2702.647,We can’t tell exactly what is being passed on because these rates are not being regulated.
1973.72-1490,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2709.275,2713.889,"(Voice Overlap) the pipeline rates that you’re paying, I take it you’re paying the pipeline?"
1973.72-1490,3,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2713.889,2715.159,We’re paying the pipeline rates.
1973.72-1490,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2715.159,2717.509,And the -- those are regulated.
1973.72-1490,3,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2717.509,2737.285,"Well, let me answer those in terms because if you would turn to page 142 of the joint appendix which is the Commission’s Order 428 which is under review, the Commission set a standard."
1973.72-1490,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3194.958,3210.204,"If the Commission’s Order says, the Act I take it here in our view does not constitute the regulations in by small producers who will continue to regulate such sales, to produce at the pipeline level by reviewing the purchased gas cost of each pipeline is purchasing."
1973.72-1490,3,38303,peter_h_schiff,,3216.729,3232.104,"Well, the regulation that they are promising is a regulation of the purchases and the standard that they are setting is a market standard which is not the proper standard for what is a just and reasonable price."
1973.72-1490,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3314.849,3325.472,"Are you suggesting Mr. Schiff that the -- if we go along the Commission, that’s pro tanto a withdrawal from what we held in Phillips?"
1973.72-1490,3,38303,peter_h_schiff,,3325.472,3329.026,"I think yes, inevitably so."
1973.72-1490,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3332.103,3332.98,"Well, it is."
1973.72-1490,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3332.98,3334.063,[Laughter] If you say so.
1973.72-1490,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3334.063,3335.234,That he is right?
1973.72-1490,3,38303,peter_h_schiff,,3335.234,3335.389,"Well, --"
1973.72-1490,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3335.389,3337.006,Are you suggesting we go the whole way?
1973.72-1490,3,38303,peter_h_schiff,,3337.006,3339.35,"Well, I certainly do not suggest you go the whole way."
1973.72-1490,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3402.799,3409.066,"Mr. Evans, you have about four minutes left."
1973.72-1490,4,35781,mark_l_evans,,3409.066,3417.788,Let me respond first to the question that -- what the Commission has been doing in the interim since the Court of Appeals decided the case.
1973.72-1490,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3571.83,3572.547,Thank you gentlemen.
