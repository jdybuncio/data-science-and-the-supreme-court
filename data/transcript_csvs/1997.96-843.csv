1997.96-843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.261,"We'll hear argument now in No. 86-843, National Credit Union Administration <v@l> [= v.] the First National Bank and Trust Company, and a related case."
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,14.839,17.931,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,80.484,86.309,"Well, how do you reconcile that petition... position, Mr. Waxman, with our decision in the Clarke case?"
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,86.309,115.813,"Well, Justice Rehnquist, in Clarke, this Court determined that the plaintiffs, the security industry, had standing because it found that Section... Sections 36 and 81 of the McFadden Act, which were the substantive provisions at issue there, had been enacted to reflect a, quote, congressional concern to keep national banks from obtaining monopoly power over credit and money through unlimited branching."
1997.96-843,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.864,152.532,"Well, Mr. Waxman, the... the Investment Company Institute v. Camp case was enacted, of course, to restrict competition."
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,154.578,156.608,"You did, Justice O'Connor."
1997.96-843,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,165.308,167.683,"Yeah, I think that's the... the closest case for the standing argument."
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,169.276,172.962,I... I... I... I think... I think it is... and I think it's important and can be readily distinguished in three ways.
1997.96-843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,269.703,277.762,"But in order to find out the answer to that question, what was the reason for enacting the common bond, must we go back into the legislative history?"
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,277.762,299.926,"--I think you do, because prudential... the prudential standing inquiry this Court has taught is an analysis of what Congress intended; that is, the interest... to quote Association of Data Processors... the interest sought to be protected by the complainant must be arguably within the zone of interest to be protected by the statute."
1997.96-843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,299.926,301.128,So this is--
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,301.128,306.127,So you must determine what the zone of interest to be protected by the statute was.
1997.96-843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,329.07,331.085,"--Well, it just came out of the Great Depression and the War."
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,331.085,334.052,--The banks... it was in the Great Depression.
1997.96-843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,334.052,334.521,Yeah.
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,334.521,336.552,The banks had failed in great numbers.
1997.96-843,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,370.444,370.819,Mr. Waxman--
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,371.116,372.054,Wow.
1997.96-843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,375.287,377.1,--You might want to start at the end and work down.
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,378.926,380.41,Justice Ginsburg.
1997.96-843,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,380.41,397.434,"If we go to the zone test, which is you're arguing that... that the banks are outside the zone, I believe that test was first introduced in an opinion by Justice White, where he said, it's only arguably within the zone."
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,413.114,414.974,Well--
1997.96-843,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,414.974,420.629,"He was, in that opinion, expanding standing beyond what it had been up until then."
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,426.079,443.947,"--Justice Ginsburg, the zone of interest test, which I believe was first articulated in the Data Processing case, was a case that was decided with explicit reference to the legislative history in order to determine Congress' purpose; that is, who Congress intended to benefit."
1997.96-843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,483.555,497.691,"--extensive... such extensive legislative history... if legislative history is the proper source of this, I suppose all you would need is a couple of statement by individual senators, who could... who could cause the statute to be broader than it otherwise would."
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,502.814,503.798,"--Well, I... I think, Jus--"
1997.96-843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,503.798,505.531,That just puts an awful lot of weight on legislative history.
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,505.531,511.498,--I... I... I did not mean to... to suggest that a tremendous amount of weight ought to be put on legislative history.
1997.96-843,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,634.902,635.667,Suppose that--
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,662.999,665.06,It... I don't think it does.
1997.96-843,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,667.31,670.138,Because it seems to me that that's quite a plausible in... inference.
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,670.138,678.806,"--The legislative history... to the extent the legislative history reflects anything at all about the banks' interest in this, it reflects two things."
1997.96-843,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,680.461,692.91,"But I'm assuming that it does establish the proposition that... that I put forward, that the banks would have been very active in opposition to this bill had this interpretation been written explicitly into the statute."
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,692.91,702.342,"--Well, then, I think the answer is that the banks would have the same remedy now that they would have had then, which is to go to Congress and ask for a legislative adjustment."
1997.96-843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,745.748,748.605,What if I don't... what if I don't agree with you that it's at all ambiguous?
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,762.975,765.754,"--Then, it seems to me, the banks are out of luck on standing grounds."
1997.96-843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,766.27,769.067,"No, but his argument is they... they would have opposed it."
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,779.125,791.323,"--Justice Scalia, Chevron says, as I understand it, that if an agency's interpretation is not in conflict with the plain language of the statute, deference is due."
1997.96-843,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,813.971,816.532,"General Waxman, my... I just want to be clear on one point."
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,831.9,833.228,"--Not at all, Justice Ginsburg."
1997.96-843,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,833.228,834.368,Who could challenge it?
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,834.368,839.959,We think the logical challengers are in fact the same kind of parties that have been challenging chartering decisions.
1997.96-843,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,866.918,870.728,Could a competing credit union have standing to challenge?
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,870.728,891.424,"I think... I think a competing credit union might have standing if it was challenging a decision that the agency had made under Section 1754 of the Act, which requires that the... the NCUA ascertain that economic advisability of the proposed... of the proposed chartering or proposed merger, but not--"
1997.96-843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,891.424,893.437,Why doesn't that open it to... why doesn't that open it to banks?
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,893.437,894.5,--Well--
1997.96-843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,894.5,900.936,That... economic advisability sounds to me something like a competitive possibility.
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,900.936,901.637,--Here... here's the reason.
1997.96-843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,916.99,919.442,"Yeah, but that's... that's a two-part standard."
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,923.238,924.738,"In any event, Justice Souter--"
1997.96-843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,924.738,925.377,Isn't it?
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,926.533,926.908,"--No, I--"
1997.96-843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,926.908,932.813,"--viability is a wonderful word, but it... and I'm not sure what it means, but it says something about economic feasibility."
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,937.998,944.027,"--Justice Souter, the banks, number one, have not challenged the determination of economic advisability here."
1997.96-843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,944.715,945.449,But what about the answer to my question?
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,945.449,963.846,"--if they had, I would argue that they do not have standing, because the evident purpose of that statutory provision was to make sure that when the NCUA charters a credit union, it does so, taking cognizance of the interests of other credit unions and the credit union system, not the banks."
1997.96-843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,963.846,964.237,"Well, that certainly is included."
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1004.221,1010.797,"The... the answer to your question is your cases, most recently, Bennett v. Spear, do recognize that Congress can have two purposes."
1997.96-843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1018.012,1018.825,"Well, but that isn't the only--"
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1018.825,1019.466,--banks from competition.
1997.96-843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1019.466,1020.934,--But let me ask you this.
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1047.611,1048.783,It would not be fair.
1997.96-843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1051.938,1053.874,"Well, then, how would we ever decide the standing question?"
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1053.874,1056.733,"--Well, I think maybe then it goes to who has the burden of proof."
1997.96-843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1062.793,1063.027,Right.
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1074.335,1085.799,"The... the accepted purpose... and the... and the Court of Appeals, the court below, specifically found that it would be anomalous, in light of the available evidence, to suggest that this provision had been intended."
1997.96-843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1085.799,1087.844,"No, but I'm... no... you're changing the question, I think, with respect."
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1105.463,1106.244,I think it would not.
1997.96-843,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1142.058,1144.057,"But it is a limitation of some kind, isn't it?"
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1145.963,1146.198,--It's--
1997.96-843,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1146.198,1149.399,--the... the credit union.
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1149.399,1149.867,--It... it is.
1997.96-843,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1156.287,1158.474,But it... so it's meant to be confining to--
1997.96-843,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1158.474,1178.247,"--It is meant to be confining in the sense that the statute requires something that the... the proponents of the credit union movement desperately wanted, which is to maximize success, that these groups be organized around... that credit unions be organized around groups having a common bond."
1997.96-843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1179.589,1179.964,--Yes.
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1182.229,1189.555,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice; and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1205.237,1210.483,"Well, I... I don't know that it's beside the point, because the way you're arguing, it's something of... of a trap."
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1231.522,1232.709,They did--
1997.96-843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1232.709,1233.771,I'm sure they did.
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1240.05,1240.628,--But--
1997.96-843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1240.628,1248.172,--and all over the Hill had it... had it been given the plausible interpretation that you're now arguing for.
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1248.172,1255.278,--I... I think they would not have been for the simple reason that banks were not in the business of making small consumer loans in 1934.
1997.96-843,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1288.155,1293.436,What is your basis for saying that banks were not into this business in the 1930's?
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1293.436,1295.731,--It... it resounds throughout the legislative record.
1997.96-843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1323.687,1330.701,Do you agree that a member of a credit union would have standing to establish... to... to attack this--
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1330.701,1331.357,Certainly.
1997.96-843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1336.339,1350.755,"--Then... then it seems to me we're really enforcing something of... of a fiction on our standing doctrine; that the most interested challenger in this interpretation, the most injured person or entity is the bank."
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1350.755,1351.443,I think that--
1997.96-843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1351.443,1355.956,And so we're having a credit union member front for the banks' interest.
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1357.878,1364.125,"--Well, I think the argue... the line... that line of argument confuses the Article III standing inquiry and the prudential standing inquiry."
1997.96-843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1381.79,1383.805,"Well, no, it wouldn't show that there's no difference."
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1406.061,1412.402,"The Court has told us that the prudential standing inquiry turns on congressional intent, not simply effect."
1997.96-843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1419.306,1422.304,"Mr. Roberts, what will we presume the congressional intent to be?"
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1439.439,1440.095,"See, our--"
1997.96-843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1440.095,1441.858,So we... we have some presumptions.
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1462.194,1465.678,"--Well, then that's... that's a new exception to the zone of interest test."
1997.96-843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1487.044,1488.044,Change the statute a little.
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1498.369,1504.648,"--Then, as the Court has said in all the other prudential standing cases, you look to see what the intent of Congress was."
1997.96-843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1506.928,1507.709,You don't have to find the intent.
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1509.644,1510.441,--Arguably--
1997.96-843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1510.441,1520.266,"Does arguably within the zone of interest mean you have to identify... you have to identify the purpose for sure, and then the question is whether this is arguably within that purpose?"
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1525.452,1528.919,--Arguably... arguably doesn't mean you just sort of have to get in the neighborhood.
1997.96-843,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1554.142,1560.265,"Mr.... Mr. Roberts, the zone test came up in a case where the Court recognized that there was standing."
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1595.345,1605.528,"--Well, the Court found standing in the Data Processing case, but it has, on other cases, other articulated a test for determining whether there's standing, and it said you looked to congressional intent."
1997.96-843,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1612.244,1618.32,"Mr. Roberts, I... I know you're still trying to address standing, but, so far, nobody has even talked about the merits."
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1618.32,1619.945,"Well, I'll turn to that right now, Your Honor."
1997.96-843,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1658.883,1672.282,"Well, in light of that second geographical limitation clause, it... it's awfully hard to give it this broadest reading of groups, each of which could have a common bond."
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1678.467,1679.17,In the community... the community--
1997.96-843,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1679.17,1679.467,Yeah.
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1679.467,1680.638,--The phrase is--
1997.96-843,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1680.638,1684.699,It just seems like... like such... interpretation.
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1684.699,1686.589,--There are two different types of credit unions.
1997.96-843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1702.052,1703.66,You couldn't have a single group?
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1706.94,1708.706,You can--
1997.96-843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1708.706,1711.127,It has to be composed of groups that have a common bond.
1997.96-843,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1713.968,1722.152,"--No, I... I don't think that's a... if it is a plausible reading, it's not the only plausible reading of the language."

1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,1921.151,1921.448,Yes.

1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2024.204,2024.516,--Yes.

1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2142.797,2146.858,I believe that under this Court's decisions the question is the zone of interest.
1997.96-843,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2148.45,2152.215,So you do not defend the D.C. Circuit's suitable challenge test?
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2152.215,2153.871,"--Well, I do in this sense, Justice O'Connor."
1997.96-843,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2173.222,2177.891,"Well, there isn't much left of the zone of interest test if you rely on the suitable challenger notion."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2177.891,2178.36,--Well--
1997.96-843,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2178.36,2179.657,That seemed a little odd to me.
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2179.657,2182.811,"--Well, that formulation is one which I think this Court doesn't have to reach."
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2203.319,2219.405,"You would... if... there would be standing for the banks if the provision, instead of the one we had before us, said that the credit union has to have its offices in the same building that the employer has its offices, and then they want to open an office next door."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2221.233,2234.743,"Well, I think if that were part of this test, that sounds very much to me like the McFadden Act limitations on where a bank can put an office that were at issue in the Clarke case, Justice Stevens, and so I think on that basis I would conclude yes."
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2234.743,2235.462,You think there would be standing?
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2235.462,2237.804,"I think so, because that sounds to me just like McFadden."
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2237.804,2242.271,What if the provision limited the people who could serve on the board of directors of the credit union--
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2242.271,2242.787,Well--
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2242.787,2247.504,"--so you have to have two appointed by management and two employees and a third party, or something like that?"
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2247.504,2255.391,"--I think there, when you look at that kind of a statute, you would conclude, I think, that it isn't a competitive boundary."
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2259.64,2263.17,It might limit the number of associations that could do business.
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2263.17,2264.091,--It might do that.
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2271.698,2277.569,"Well, you'd have a proliferation of credit unions that didn't qualify on the director standing."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2280.897,2282.193,--Well--
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2282.193,2290.331,"If they could demonstrate that factually, that they just... for some reason it's a lot easier to organize them quickly if they don't have to go through the red tape of appointing all these directors."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2290.331,2297.671,"--I think that is harder than a clear competitive boundary like this one on who you can serve, and in that one I--"
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2297.671,2300.482,"It's who can serve, not only who you can serve."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2300.482,2300.841,--That's right.
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2301.42,2303.872,"That would identify what unit can serve, which is also what happens here."

1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2313.29,2321.989,"And wouldn't that mean that any time a restriction affected the number of credit unions out in the market, the bank could have standing to challenge that restriction?"
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2321.989,2324.144,"--Well, I think you have to... when you look--"
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.144,2324.613,"And if not, why not?"
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2325.754,2337.765,--I think that the... at some point the relationship between the nature of the limitation and the--
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.765,2343.638,"I'm suggesting that maybe the limitation has to be on... one on conduct, rather than one on who may do business."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2343.638,2351.135,"--And in response to that I would say that Clarke is a case... Camp is a case on who may do business, what business you can do."
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2362.629,2363.472,"Well, a movement from where to who?"
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2364.222,2365.675,--Where to--
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2365.675,2377.56,"I'm just wondering if your test wouldn't require us to say, any restriction that limits the number of entities that may do business by meeting certain qualifications would be subject to challenge by a competitor."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2377.56,2389.931,"--Well, I think that if the limitation affected the competitive authority of a regulated entity in--"
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2389.931,2393.383,"Well, it affects number, and number always affects competition."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2393.383,2415.076,"--Well, if number always affects competition and... it seems to me that the principle is that in a regulated marketplace limitations on your competitor are limitations that it's sensible to believe that Congress would permit the other competitors to meet, and if that's that kind of limitation, then I would agree that they would have standing."
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2415.076,2420.216,There's standing any time you have a limitation on the number of entities that may enter the business.
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2420.216,2420.808,"Well, there's--"
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.808,2425.417,"Or that may, by its natural tendency, limit the number of entities."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2425.417,2455.545,"--I think it is true that the first thing you look at is the text, and what it does, and if it has the effect of limiting one competitor in a regulated marketplace, which is what this is, that cases like Data Processing, which involved data processors, Arnold Tours, which is about travel agents coming in, even though the Court said there was no indication at all that the Court was concerned about data... about travel agents, would permit standing under those circumstances, what--"
1997.96-843,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2455.545,2457.06,"I'm... go ahead, please."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2457.06,2457.294,--I'm sorry.
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2509.461,2519.738,Would it be a different case if Congress had made an express finding that the sole reason for making this requirement is that we think this will maximize the number of credit unions that can succeed in the marketplace?
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2519.738,2521.175,--It certainly is true--
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2521.175,2523.704,"If they'd made such a finding, would there be standing?"
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2523.704,2529.327,--If they'd made such a finding at some point you're going to get close to a case like Block v. Community Nutrition.
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2529.327,2529.499,I don't want another case.
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2530.249,2530.467,Okay.
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2550.834,2556.425,"When I... or, does that mean in the hypo I gave you you'd say there was standing, or was not standing?"
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2556.425,2570.997,"In that hypothetical, I think if Congress clearly said in the statute this is the sole and only purpose of it, then that would be a manifestation of congressional intent that other people not sue, but legislation--"
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2570.997,2571.81,It's your understanding there'd be no standing.
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2571.81,2573.653,"--There would be no standing, I'm sorry, yes, but... I'm sorry."

1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2640.579,2645.172,"--Yes, it was in State provisions, and in a model provision as well."
1997.96-843,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2645.172,2663.414,"And in that line I'd like to know whether any States have interpreted their legislation using the same language, groups having a common bond, to mean what the Government and their credit unions are now asserting."
1997.96-843,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2664.742,2667.053,Attorneys merits... no.
1997.96-843,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2667.053,2667.241,--interpreted that language?

1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2688.825,2694.324,"If that legislation passed, parts of this legislation might be moot."
1997.96-843,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2702.977,2711.504,"It says that members of any Federal credit union shall be limited to one or more groups, each of which have within such group a common bond."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2717.767,2727.122,"--If that legislation were passed, it would eliminate... yes, it would eliminate our argument that the statute now requires one common bond for all of the members."
1997.96-843,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2727.122,2729.153,--I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2729.153,2729.434,Certainly.
1997.96-843,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2729.434,2748.349,"I assume that the basic standing question... this is the assumption... is whether you, your clients, the plaintiffs, suffer the kind of injury that Congress or that this statute intended to protect these kind of people against."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2768.466,2771.42,"Well, and I think that Justice--"
1997.96-843,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2771.42,2772.074,Am I right?
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2776.323,2784.93,"--Yes, Justice Breyer, with... although it is not necessary to show under the cases that there was a spec... an intent to benefit the particular--"
1997.96-843,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2784.93,2801.327,"I'm saying we have to interpret a statute, the object... the question is, is, are the plaintiffs suffering the kind of injury that this statute seeks to protect these kind of people against, or compensate them for, or prevent in the future?"
1997.96-843,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2801.327,2801.827,--Or prevent them from suffering?
1997.96-843,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2801.827,2802.077,"Yes, right."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2802.077,2802.39,Yes.
1997.96-843,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2802.39,2802.827,Right.

1997.96-843,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2803.343,2808.482,"Now, that's the question, all right, and the answer is, how do we decide if it's arguably so."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2854.182,2858.337,--I don't think that you need to have any presumptions here.
1997.96-843,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2860.914,2861.133,Okay.
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2915.516,2928.73,"--Justice Breyer, the reasons that we have standing are that the statute... the effect of the statute, what the statute does is to limit who the credit unions can sell their banking services to."
1997.96-843,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2943.646,2944.256,"All right, good."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2946.285,2946.504,--That is in--
1997.96-843,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2946.504,2946.941,--that would be helpful.
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2946.941,2953.642,"--That is in... you have to start with the legislative history of the D.C. Credit Union legislation, which was passed in 1932, okay."
1997.96-843,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2970.885,2972.915,But that's on a different... a different provision.
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,2978.647,2994.312,"--Justice O'Connor this law, and my colleagues agree, is the precursor to the Federal Credit Union Act, and Mr. Bergengren, who was the sole witness on the Federal act, referred to the D.C. act as a copy."
1997.96-843,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3006.183,3007.291,And it had the groups language in it?
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3007.291,3007.916,"--Yes, it did."
1997.96-843,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3010.025,3011.728,Was Senator Kean still alive?
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3011.728,3012.337,"--the same common bond limitation, exactly."
1997.96-843,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3012.337,3016.413,Was Senator Kean still alive when the act we're looking at was enacted?
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3016.991,3019.584,"I'm sorry, Justice--"
1997.96-843,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3019.584,3020.334,"We don't really know, do we?"
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3020.334,3022.427,"--I'm sorry, Justice Scalia, I don't--"
1997.96-843,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3022.427,3022.739,Never mind.
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3023.114,3023.833,--I don't know.
1997.96-843,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3023.833,3028.595,I don't want you to stop before you've said... I have page 31 of the '32 act.
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3029.642,3052.368,"Well, you also have the bankers testifying in... on... in the proceedings on the '32 act about their competitive concerns, particularly with respect to deposit-taking by the credit unions, and you have that, Congress changing the act in that respect to accommodate the bankers' concerns, and you have that change carried forward to the Federal Credit Union Act as well."
1997.96-843,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3129.477,3130.663,"At least arguably, you say."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3131.007,3131.913,"At least arguably, yes."
1997.96-843,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3135.49,3140.659,"--I... we're talking about Federal law here, but there is some law in the States on the position."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3166.196,3169.289,Any doctor who was injured by that.
1997.96-843,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3172.538,3175.474,Is that the law in the States generally?
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3175.474,3178.519,"I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy, I simply can't answer that question over--"
1997.96-843,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3178.519,3184.126,Unauthorized practice of law actions are largely based on that sort of re... actual research.
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3184.126,3186.078,"--And are permitted, yes, Chief Justice."
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3186.078,3186.516,Probably not--
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3186.516,3188.422,If I may turn to the merits... I'm sorry.
1997.96-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3188.422,3190.75,--Just a little... one tiny question on history.
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3202.743,3204.696,That's... that is correct.
1997.96-843,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3232.856,3236.918,"Well, I guess we have to ask if the statutory language is ambiguous."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3239.354,3240.682,We... I submit--
1997.96-843,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3240.682,3248.193,"If it is, then we would defer to any reasonable interpretation by the agency."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3248.193,3259.408,"--That's right, and I submit that the... and the courts, both the Sixth Circuit and the D.C. Circuit, held that the legislative intent, as expressed in this language, was not ambiguous, shown in two ways that I will summarize here."
1997.96-843,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3259.408,3268.358,"I would hope we would look at the language of the statute to answer the question of whether it's ambiguous, not at some legislative intent."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3268.358,3268.998,"Well, the--"
1997.96-843,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3268.998,3270.778,Let's look at the language.
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3273.231,3275.793,--The... we submit that the language is not.
1997.96-843,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3335.831,3340.813,"Mr. Helfer, aren't there other limitations that would prevent this infinite progression?"
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3340.813,3349.481,"--There are at the... there are other limitations that the agency has imposed in its discretion, like not letting credit unions compete with one another."
1997.96-843,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3380.546,3386.325,"Well, we know the agency considers the language ambiguous, and we know that some Members of Congress do, too."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3388.935,3409.255,"Well, the agency and its predecessors interpreted the common bond clause to require one common bond per credit union from the time of enactment until 1982, nearly 50 years, and from the time of enactment and for that long is strong evidence about what the clarity of the original intention was."
1997.96-843,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3427.653,3428.215,But they did say--
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3428.215,3428.59,This case is like--
1997.96-843,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3428.59,3433.979,--They did say this is a bill to clarify the existing law and ratify the NCUA interpretation.
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3433.979,3437.868,"--Well, I think I can say with all respect the credit unions have lobbyists, too, and the--"
1997.96-843,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3443.334,3443.663,Who said that?
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3448.706,3451.986,"--If he was still alive, I'm sure he would have."
1997.96-843,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3451.986,3458.187,That's why I thought it might be relevant if States having the same language interpreted it the way the Government is urging us.
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3458.187,3466.184,"Yes, absolutely, and the Government doesn't cite any such interpretations, and I'm not aware of any, Your Honor."
1997.96-843,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3470.401,3470.839,What case?
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3470.839,3475.196,"I'm sorry, Chief Justice, the Dimension case, Dimension v. Board of Governors."
1997.96-843,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3475.196,3476.118,I thought you said dementia.
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3485.192,3489.579,Perhaps I ought to skip Dimension and go on to parallel clauses.
1997.96-843,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3580.091,3590.477,"I suppose under the agency's interpretation, if there is only one group in a credit union, the people in that group don't have to have any common bond at all."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3596.381,3596.85,I think that's the--
1997.96-843,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3596.85,3600.958,"--You know, AT&T and other companies, all those other companies have to have a common bond."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3600.958,3606.972,"--I think that's a logical conclusion, Justice Scalia, but they do--"
1997.96-843,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3606.972,3609.408,"Either that, or you can only have groups, and you can't have one company."
1997.96-843,2,36033,michael_s_helfer,,3609.408,3613.498,"--That's right, but they do in fact permit one company, one group there."
1997.96-843,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3664.056,3664.572,Thank you.
