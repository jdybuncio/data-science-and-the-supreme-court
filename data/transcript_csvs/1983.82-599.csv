1983.82-599,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,71.002,"Mr. Phillips, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,71.002,73.096,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,290.086,299.348,"Mr. Phillips, even after 1975 are bonuses and advance royalties income from the property?"
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,299.348,300.223,"Yes, ma'am."
1983.82-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,303.207,308.906,"That would be consistent with our decision in Herring, the old decision."
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,308.906,309.656,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,311.827,326.666,"Well, is there anything in the statute we are talking about here or the amendments that specifically changes the definition of gross income to exclude bonuses and advance royalties or that overrules Herring?"
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,326.666,328.539,Nothing that expressly does that.
1983.82-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,363.853,377.754,"Well, Congress did not change the definition of gross income is what you are saying, but it did state that the deduction for percentage depletion had to be with respect to production."
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,377.754,378.44,"That is right, Your Honor."
1983.82-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,378.44,389.421,Now is the statutory language not given better effect by allowing the deduction but just postponing it to the year of actual production?
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,389.421,392.622,"Well, of course, that is not the issue in this case."
1983.82-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,396.073,401.369,"Well, I am asking you if that is not a better application of this statutory language?"
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,401.369,406.32,"Well, I will concede that that is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory language."
1983.82-599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,454.722,457.503,How about the converse?
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,461.407,482.789,"The Commissioner has taken the position at least with respect to the hypothetical he presented in his proposed regulations that if you have say $100,000 of production in one year and $85,000 of income in that year and $15,000 of income in the next year he will permit you the $15,000 deduction in--"
1983.82-599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,482.789,484.428,In the next year even if there is not any production.
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,487.271,488.849,--Not precisely.
1983.82-599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,530.02,550.075,Is it clear that he would not if you have advance royalties in one year and the next year you have production he would not allow the depletion of the royalties received in a prior year?
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,550.075,552.652,"That seems clear, yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,552.652,553.886,He will not do that?
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,553.886,554.527,He will not do that.
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,565.74,568.973,"Mr. Phillips, let me just be sure I understood you correctly."
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,578.781,579.625,During the taxable year.
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,591.371,612.799,I am just wondering about whether there was this refinement of the general objective that there must be some production during the lease term which would be consistent with the old law and it really would not make much difference whether you had a year beginning or the end of the year lease where there was no production whereas there is a difference under the proposed regulations.
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,612.799,620.672,"Well, of course, the proper result in this case does not really hang on whether or not the proposed regulations are consistent."
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.278,633.635,If there is no production during the entire life of the lease even the taxpayer would agree he would have to give back the--
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,633.635,644.755,"That is correct, but it seems perfectly consistent with the statute to expect that Congress may have preferred to have production as quickly as possible and not postpone it five to ten years."
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,644.755,651.58,--One of the purposes of Congress was to discourage the practice of leasing with an advance royalty payment scheme?
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,651.58,662.186,"Well, I think not to discourage it particularly but simply not to provide the extraordinary encouragement that percentage depletion would otherwise grant."
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,662.186,667.871,"It is correct, is it not, that the Commissioner's position will discourage this particular form of lease?"
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,667.871,676.728,"From the prior practice, yes, it will not be as readily adopted but of course--"
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,676.728,679.055,Which may in turn cause--
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,679.055,682.131,--Anybody other than a small producer would not be--
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,682.131,682.819,--That is right.
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,689.051,690.378,"--I do not think so, Your Honor."
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,696.687,706.075,"Right, but he loses the advantage if the lessee cannot assure him that there will be production in the year in which he is first receiving royalties."
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,706.075,707.81,That is correct.
1983.82-599,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,732.518,736.141,We will resume at one o'clock.
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,759.21,763.787,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-599,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,886.815,895.342,"Mr. Phillips, what do you make of the language immediately preceding the critical section where it says ""with respect to""."
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,897.577,898.481,Yes.
1983.82-599,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,928.532,930.514,I do not quite read it that way.
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,957.88,959.021,"No, I agree with that."
1983.82-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1019.152,1035.364,"Mr. Phillips, does the Commissioner require the lessees to capitalize lease bonus and advance royalty payments that they make and to take a percentage depletion allowance against them in the year of actual production?"
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1035.364,1046.156,"Well, he does not permit them... They have historically not been permitted to take the lease bonus and advance royalty and deplete that, use percentage depletion on that."
1983.82-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1195.268,1199.22,"Mr. Phillips, does any of the history address covering the Commission?"
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1199.22,1200.891,Directly?
1983.82-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1200.891,1201.5,Yes.
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1201.5,1202.625,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
1983.82-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1202.625,1208.014,Your answer to the argument based on Herring is?
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1208.014,1215.651,Is that it obviously did not require Congress to have considered the prior law in order to change that law.
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1331.307,1333.024,"Mr. Phillips, can I interrupt you one second."
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1358.03,1358.905,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1381.708,1386.987,So that when we are looking at lease bonuses we do not care whether there is production or not.
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1386.987,1388.159,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1537.301,1538.363,May I ask another question?
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1553.623,1555.215,It is conceivable that we could.
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1558.667,1568.446,"Well, to the extent that you rely on the lease bonus language in the '74 report, does that language apply with the same force to the advance royalty situation?"
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1568.446,1580.503,"--Well, since the advance royalties and lease bonuses had historically been treated essentially the same I would say that there is no reason to draw a distinction between them simply because Congress in its example referred to lease bonus."
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1583.08,1590.608,"So in effect in your argument the history really has changed, that the old law was changed, not just limited to a certain category of persons."
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1594.466,1594.841,--The Herring?
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1594.841,1595.435,The Herring case.
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1595.435,1595.933,"Well, no."
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1644.929,1647.866,"Well, not until there is production at least."
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1647.866,1648.132,Right.
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1648.132,1651.365,Under their view once there is production it could be attributable.
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1651.365,1660.813,"Sure, but if that is not done in the taxable year then the statutory language itself makes clear that you ought not to be entitled to the percentage deduction in that year."
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1660.813,1679.962,"The thing that troubles me about your emphasis on years are if I understand the papers correctly there are situations in which you would agree that in a fifth year of a lease there could be a depletion allowance based on production during earlier years in the lease, a fifth year in which there was no production in the fifth year."
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1679.962,1680.884,If there were income.
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1680.884,1681.633,Yes.
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1681.633,1682.602,And production.
1983.82-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1734.473,1738.252,Except that it will have an effect on the way in which people will negotiate their leases.
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1740.158,1759.87,"I think it will have some effect on the way they negotiate their leases, but I do not think it undermines the basic purpose which was to encourage independent producers to continue producing, that is, because they still have the basic advantage when you get to income when you have actual production and actual income you still get a significant advantage with percentage depletion that you simply do not get otherwise."
1983.82-599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1759.87,1763.415,Other people do not get that.
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1763.415,1764.712,That is right.
1983.82-599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.694,1785.048,Could I ask did the Seventh Circuit believe that your suggestive interpretation and the interpretation submitted by your opponents both were reasonable?
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1785.048,1785.485,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.717,1792.872,Yet they turned down your interpretation.
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1792.872,1794.2,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1795.918,1804.321,Did they give an explanation for rejecting yours or for saying that they need not give you any deference at all?
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1804.321,1812.834,They gave no explanation for why the Commissioner ought not to receive some deference in interpreting his statute or why the Tax Court should receive no deference in interpreting the statute.
1983.82-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1822.485,1843.399,"Mr. Phillips, if you look at the conference committee report because this language was added in a floor amendment so we do not have a lot of history to go by and if you just look at the conference committee report for the language that was actually adopted, there is no indication that Congress intended to amend the definition of gross income from property."
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1843.399,1844.539,I do not believe--
1983.82-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1844.539,1845.929,Or to change the prior result.
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1848.007,1850.974,--It seems to me there are two answers to that.
1983.82-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1904.811,1914.761,"Well, it also indicated that it intended to retain the percentage depletion privilege for the independent producer."
1983.82-599,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1916.62,1922.851,"Well, no it said it intended to retain the percentage depletion at 22 percent for 2000 barrels."
1983.82-599,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1948.903,1949.933,Very well.
1983.82-599,1,42636,thomas_j_donnelly,,1953.276,1957.712,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-599,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2157.819,2181.654,"Mr. Donnelly, would it not be a reasonable position for the Commissioner to require that the deduction... Even if you are right about the fact that bonuses and advance royalties are part of gross income, would it not be reasonable for the Commissioner to require that the deduction be taken in the year of actual production?"
1983.82-599,1,42636,thomas_j_donnelly,,2181.654,2186.214,"Well, I think that would be reasonable, but under the statute cannot be done."
1983.82-599,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2242.316,2244.393,Well then maybe that is what Congress did do.
1983.82-599,1,42636,thomas_j_donnelly,,2244.393,2258.544,"Well, Congress... You see under the 1974 bill that Mr. Phillips referred to there was no requirement that the calculation be made in accordance with Section 613."
1983.82-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2393.786,2396.363,"Mr. Donnelly, can I ask you a question?"
1983.82-599,1,42636,thomas_j_donnelly,,2396.363,2396.66,Yes.
1983.82-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2396.66,2404.156,"It will reveal my ignorance, but is there another definition of the term ""small independent producer"" in the statute other than the--"
1983.82-599,1,42636,thomas_j_donnelly,,2404.156,2404.468,No.
1983.82-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2404.468,2405.968,--This is what defines it.
1983.82-599,1,42636,thomas_j_donnelly,,2405.968,2408.624,This is the definition.
1983.82-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2434.846,2435.925,Explain this to me then.
1983.82-599,1,42636,thomas_j_donnelly,,2445.061,2453.278,"Well, most of the giant oil companies are retailers and refiners or one of the two."
1983.82-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2470.724,2481.749,"So the only meaning of the word ""small"" is that if you are otherwise an independent producer then you may take depletion up to the maximum limits that year."
1983.82-599,1,42636,thomas_j_donnelly,,2481.749,2482.109,That is correct.
1983.82-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2482.109,2482.609,I see.
1983.82-599,1,42636,thomas_j_donnelly,,2482.609,2491.809,"If production limits do not exceed that total, you are considered a small producer and you are entitled to the full depletion--"
1983.82-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2491.809,2497.745,It seems to me that tends to support your view that this is a limit rather than a basic condition for eligibility.
1983.82-599,1,42636,thomas_j_donnelly,,2497.745,2500.008,--We believe that it does support that.
1983.82-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2500.008,2501.055,I see.
1983.82-599,1,42636,thomas_j_donnelly,,2501.055,2515.941,"In the case of our client, our client received $7600 in advance royalties based on the price of oil as it existed in 1975."
1983.82-599,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.216,2540.992,"But you do not say, do you, that if there is never any production that you can have percentage depletion on advance royalties or bonus payments?"
1983.82-599,1,42636,thomas_j_donnelly,,2540.992,2542.897,"Justice White, we recapture."
1983.82-599,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2547.975,2554.3,So there is a precondition to claiming percentage depletion on this income other than being a small producer?
1983.82-599,1,42636,thomas_j_donnelly,,2554.3,2558.032,--The precondition--
1983.82-599,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2558.032,2559.22,There has to be some production.
1983.82-599,1,42636,thomas_j_donnelly,,2559.22,2565.997,--The precondition claiming percentage depletion on advance royalties has always been that ultimately--
1983.82-599,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.997,2568.184,"That may be be, but the answer is yes."
1983.82-599,1,42636,thomas_j_donnelly,,2568.184,2569.371,--So as to avoid recapture.
1983.82-599,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2569.371,2569.762,Okay.
1983.82-599,1,42636,thomas_j_donnelly,,2569.762,2570.809,Right.
1983.82-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2570.809,2572.011,Your answer is yes.
1983.82-599,1,42636,thomas_j_donnelly,,2574.869,2575.431,That is correct.
1983.82-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2835.062,2841.746,Mr. Collie.
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,2841.746,2844.168,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-599,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2999.386,3005.009,"Mr. Collie, are you referring to a particular point in the briefs here that you would like to have us look at?"
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3005.009,3025.562,"Sir, Justice Rehnquist, what I am referring to is where the brief says there is remarkable similarity between the 1974 bill and the Act that came out as 613A."
1983.82-599,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3033.403,3034.918,Where should we turn to look at the Act?
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3034.918,3045.07,"Sir, in the application for certiorari the last page, page 93, has that."
1983.82-599,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3050.162,3055.378,That is 93 in your case.
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3055.378,3058.392,"In application for certiorari in my case, yes, sir."
1983.82-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3383.418,3384.417,May I ask you one question?
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3384.417,3385.182,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3385.182,3393.961,Did the 1974 bill... What did that do with respect to regulated natural gas and natural gas sold under fixed contract?
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3393.961,3398.397,"They had a provision for it, yes, sir."
1983.82-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3398.397,3400.864,For preserving or eliminating?
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3400.864,3402.129,For preserving it.
1983.82-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3402.129,3402.567,I see.
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3402.567,3404.942,"But... Excuse me, sir."
1983.82-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3404.942,3407.003,So it was parallel in that regard?
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3407.003,3418.107,"In that regard, but again without the transitional or shall we say cross-referencing langauge that picks up 611 and picks up 613 in that manner."
1983.82-599,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3525.69,3528.047,Do you feel that weighs heavily in your favor?
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3528.047,3528.453,Sir?
1983.82-599,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3528.453,3530.656,Do you feel that weighs heavily in your favor?
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3533.952,3537.964,"Justice Rehnquist, I would rather it be on our side than on the other side."
1983.82-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3540.323,3542.478,Are you happy to report that none of them is a student?
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3542.478,3543.072,Sir?
1983.82-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3543.072,3546.228,Are you happy to report that none of them is a student?
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3546.228,3547.367,"No, sir."
1983.82-599,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3572.702,3575.357,Unless he is on the other side of the case.
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3578.214,3579.354,Lastly--
1983.82-599,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3579.354,3591.552,"Mr. Collie, before you go on do I understand that you think that it would be appropriate to require the deduction then to be taken in the year of the actual production?"
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3591.552,3593.925,"--No, ma'am."
1983.82-599,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3619.353,3626.694,Well would it not be consistent with it and be a reasonable interpretation that the Commissioner could make?
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3626.694,3627.944,"Yes, ma'am."
1983.82-599,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3627.944,3643.61,So perhaps even if we agreed with you on the gross income issue it should be remanded to the court below to consider deference to the Commissioner on that?
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3643.61,3656.199,"With all deference, Justice O'Connor, to the Commissioner when the Commissioner has adopted a totally erroneous position he is not entitled to prevail."
1983.82-599,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3656.199,3660.917,"Well, maybe we could disabuse him of that position in the process."
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3660.917,3663.9,"I would hope, of course, the Court would, yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3743.54,3746.305,May I ask you a question about your position?
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3751.427,3753.052,"A very large what, sir?"
1983.82-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3753.052,3754.177,A very large producer.
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3776.965,3803.688,"Yes, sir, but then it would have to be spread over the large production if I understand the question correctly in the later years and it would immediately violate the 3000 or 2000 barrel limit and you would immediately in the next year restore a part of the depletion deduction to income."
1983.82-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3821.743,3821.978,Right.
1983.82-599,2,35618,marvin_k_collie,,3821.978,3856.244,"So you spread your bonus over that ten years proportionately, and if you take your bonus and spread it to the next year and see how many dollars you are getting for that production you immediately are able to see that you have gone over in the second year your 2000 barrel limitation and so in the second year you immediately restore the depletion you took in the first year back to income."
1983.82-599,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3856.244,3859.697,I think you have answered the question now.
1983.82-599,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3861.103,3863.602,No.
1983.82-599,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3863.602,3864.134,"Thank you, gentlemen."
