1971.70-5021,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,28.657,"We will hear arguments next in number 5021, Townsend against The Illinois Department of Public Aid."
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,56.564,60.383,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5021,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,314.248,321.888,"What if they were 25 years old and attending graduate school, would the argument be the same?"
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,321.888,326.057,"They will not be eligible, Your Honor, because Congress did not make them eligible."
1971.70-5021,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,326.057,332.388,"That is my point, is that a denial of Equal Protection?"
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,332.388,334.213,"I do not believe that it would be, Your Honor."
1971.70-5021,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,334.213,339.413,"Why did -- but it is if you are dealing up to 21, is that it?"
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,339.413,348.817,"In terms of the Equal Protection, it is if you distinguish between children attending a vocational or technical school and those attending a college or university up to the age 21."
1971.70-5021,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,410.13,424.048,"Mr. Lefkow, is it your position that the difference in receiving the aid under AFDC and not receiving it makes the difference between going to school or not?"
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,424.048,427.425,"Yes, Your Honor that would be our position."
1971.70-5021,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,466.516,474.24,Is your position here that Omega would have gone to school had she been able to obtain the AFDC benefits?
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,474.24,477.187,"She did go to school, Your Honor and she is in school today."
1971.70-5021,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,477.187,485.219,"Well then, conceding that is not your lawsuit merely one for a certain amount of money?"
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,485.219,487.652,"Yes, Your Honor that is what AFDC eligibility is."
1971.70-5021,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,762.253,775.262,"While your statutory argument was brought out I suppose if -- no, it would be the same if Illinois did not give grants to the children over 18, who are attending vocational school?"
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,775.262,777.245,"That is correct, Your Honor, that is still mandatory."
1971.70-5021,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,777.245,782.654,"Yes, it still be mandatory but your Equal Protection argument would not obtain?"
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,782.654,783.898,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1971.70-5021,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.315,798.386,So you think that both the Federal Government and the state may fail to give grants to students over 16?
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,798.386,799.56,"No, I do not believe that the state --"
1971.70-5021,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,799.56,800.436,Entirely?
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,800.436,801.397,"No, I do not believe --"
1971.70-5021,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.397,815.6,Let us assume the Federal Government though said that the Act did not require or did not even contribute to grants for children over 16?
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,815.6,817.091,"Alright, what is your question then, Your Honor?"
1971.70-5021,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,817.091,821.56,"Well, would there be any denial of the Equal Protection of the law in such a law?"
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,821.56,825.035,"I do not know, if I understand your question correctly --"
1971.70-5021,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,825.035,825.579,I will put it the other way.
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,831.259,832.34,Yes.
1971.70-5021,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,832.34,835.816,"And the state, went up to 18 and went no further, any denial of Equal Protection?"
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,835.816,837.997,"Not in terms of this case, Your Honor."
1971.70-5021,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,842.698,848.543,"Even though, most of the children over 18 would be in college and most them under 18 would be in high school?"
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,848.543,851.492,"That is right! But you see, in this case Congress has made a determination."
1971.70-5021,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.492,855.573,"I understand that, I was just trying to find out your Equal Protection Argument?"
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,855.573,856.642,I see.
1971.70-5021,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.544,858.585,I am sorry.
1971.70-5021,0,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,858.585,863.693,I would like to reserve two minutes for rebuttal.
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,863.693,868.714,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5021,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,911.642,917.746,Is the vocational education uniformly post-secondary as you have described in --
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,917.746,919.261,"Uniformly, no sir."
1971.70-5021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1195.568,1197.903,"Mr. Spitzer, what is OASDI?"
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1197.903,1203.206,This is the Old Age Survivorâ€™s Benefits and Social Security Act also.
1971.70-5021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1204.482,1206.356,It is not involved in this case?
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1206.356,1221.643,"No, it is not, but the reason why I mentioned and it is included in the committee report and these provisions were done in tandem, that Congress evinced a clear purpose to make the provisions as nearly alike as possible."
1971.70-5021,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.253,1406.743,"You are saying that if the state wants to move in to that 18 to 21 category at all, it must support all those children in that age group?"
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1406.743,1406.92,That is correct.
1971.70-5021,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1406.92,1408.626,If they are going to any kind of the school?
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1408.626,1409.541,That is --
1971.70-5021,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1409.541,1412.128,Although they could exclude them wholly?
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1412.128,1415.639,They could exclude the 18 to 21-year-old group wholly.
1971.70-5021,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1421.872,1423.031,It is an all or none thing?
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1423.031,1424.232,That is correct.
1971.70-5021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1430.006,1432.833,"That they must and also that they have, that Congress has?"
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1432.833,1433.981,That is right.
1971.70-5021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1433.981,1435.374,They use that too?
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1435.374,1436.029,That is right.
1971.70-5021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1436.029,1449.76,"And I think, I am not sure, if (Inaudible) would address himself to the constitutional issue and that would be that the state must do it, but certainly your statutory argument is that Congress has done it?"
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1449.76,1450.172,That is right.
1971.70-5021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1458.122,1464.929,The state violates the Equal Protection Clause by discriminating difference as among 18 to 21-year-old --
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1464.929,1465.742,That is correct.
1971.70-5021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1465.742,1476.892,"Well, I thought you were arguing that the state by supporting only prior of the 18 to 21-year-old group in school, is going contrary to the Social Security Act?"
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1476.892,1478.958,"I am arguing both positions here, Mr. Justice White."
1971.70-5021,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1478.958,1481.379,A supremacy argument and (Voice Overlap)
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1481.379,1484.205,That is absolutely correct.
1971.70-5021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1861.08,1868.316,"How many others states Mr. Spitzer, in addition to Illinois have done this, any other state?"
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1868.316,1869.09,Nine other states.
1971.70-5021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1869.09,1878.338,Nine other states and how and the other 40 states have done this?
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1878.338,1880.55,There is a wide variety of programs.
1971.70-5021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1884.822,1886.519,At all.
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1886.519,1888.515,Some have gone into age limit.
1971.70-5021,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1892.744,1895.541,Today -- would you think that would be proper?
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1895.541,1897.229,"I do not think that that is proper, no sir."
1971.70-5021,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1897.229,1898.252,Not under your definition?
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1898.252,1898.699,That is right.
1971.70-5021,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1902.631,1910.282,"Well, I thought your position was that, your statutory argument was that they had to go in it and go all out into it?"
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1910.282,1913.625,Now on my statute argument they do not have to go into the 18 to 21-year-old group.
1971.70-5021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1913.625,1914.513,But if they do?
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1914.513,1915.454,They have to go all the way out.
1971.70-5021,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1926.138,1936.621,"May I ask, looking at 606 (2) (a) (10), why is it you say that you do not have to go into that statute under the 18 to 21?"
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1936.621,1948.176,Under the term law is that 606 (2) (a) (10) requires all eligible individuals to be given aid and dependent children is included under 606 (a) (2) (B) includes the 18 to 21-year-old group.
1971.70-5021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1964.89,1965.834,That is about an option?
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1965.834,1966.642,That is right.
1971.70-5021,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1967.937,1971.527,"There is, I see that an option to go in or not but --"
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1971.527,1972.385,That is right.
1971.70-5021,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1972.385,1978.057,"But does the legislative history supports the position that if they go in at all, they must go about --"
1971.70-5021,1,36648,m_james_spitzer_jr,,1978.057,1981.499,They refer to the 18 to 21-year-old extension as a program.
1971.70-5021,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2025.41,2029.371,"Thank you, Mr. Spitzer."
1971.70-5021,2,21658,donald_j_veverka,,2036.617,2042.261,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5021,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2062.161,2064.547,That was wholly a state program?
1971.70-5021,2,21658,donald_j_veverka,,2064.547,2065.645,"That is true, Your Honor."
1971.70-5021,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2065.645,2068.592,The general assistance funds?
1971.70-5021,2,21658,donald_j_veverka,,2068.592,2086.357,I believe the issue before this Court is whether the Equal Protection Clause or the Supremacy Clause requires the states to participate fully in the federal AFDC program regardless of their financial condition.
1971.70-5021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.366,2254.372,"Well, you would not think that Congress could or that the state could say give support payments to just half of the children under 16?"
1971.70-5021,2,21658,donald_j_veverka,,2261.47,2262.845,"No, that is true, Your Honor."
1971.70-5021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2262.845,2284.2,"Well, if Congress says that here are matching funds to provide education for students over 18 in vocational schools or colleges and the state says well we will -- you would not think they could just say half of the students in those categories we will support and the other half we will not?"
1971.70-5021,2,21658,donald_j_veverka,,2284.2,2302.766,"I think, Your Honor that if the state adopts a classification established by Congress that here is the right and Congress, I think has expressly recognized the fact that it has the right to take the same steps as are established by Congress."
1971.70-5021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2341.871,2356.779,"Well, I understand, I understand that, but when they expanded it up to the 18-21-year-old category, they said that 18-21-year-old students who are attending vocational school or college?"
1971.70-5021,2,21658,donald_j_veverka,,2356.779,2361.912,"No, at the time that they first made the classification, it was vocational and technical school."
1971.70-5021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2361.912,2362.764,Yes.
1971.70-5021,2,21658,donald_j_veverka,,2362.764,2368.614,"And then a year later, it was expanded to include kids who are in colleges or university."
1971.70-5021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2368.614,2372.738,"So as it now stands, the definitions is students in vocational schools or in colleges?"
1971.70-5021,2,21658,donald_j_veverka,,2372.738,2374.05,"That is true, Your Honor."
1971.70-5021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.05,2378.967,And that is the congressional category that the Act defines?
1971.70-5021,2,21658,donald_j_veverka,,2378.967,2394.233,"That is true, Your Honor but at the same time that they did that and at all times that they have expanded that definition, they have made it clear that the state can expand it if the financial conditions are as far as is practical under the laws of the state."
1971.70-5021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2418.828,2422.874,(Inaudible) why you draw this line?
1971.70-5021,2,21658,donald_j_veverka,,2422.874,2423.095,Pardon me?
1971.70-5021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2423.095,2437.976,"Between the vocational, you said a minute ago that you go to high school, then you come out with a diploma and you go to vocation school, you come out with a job, what do you mean by that?"
1971.70-5021,2,21658,donald_j_veverka,,2437.976,2445.937,"Your Honor, I think that under the history of Social Security Act, Congress has recognized the fact that not all --"
1971.70-5021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2445.937,2452.148,"Well, number one, do you get a diploma out of vocational high school or not or Illinois is different?"
1971.70-5021,2,21658,donald_j_veverka,,2452.148,2454.323,"I believe you do get a diploma, Your Honor."
1971.70-5021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2454.323,2455.523,But why do you draw the difference?
1971.70-5021,2,21658,donald_j_veverka,,2459.595,2473.479,"Well, I draw that distinction because of the fact that normally, you speak of the diploma in terms of a formal type educational as opposed to vocational or technical type."
1971.70-5021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2477.003,2485.944,But you think there is a deputy in MIT and all that?
1971.70-5021,2,21658,donald_j_veverka,,2485.944,2489.718,"No, I do not believe so, Your Honor."
1971.70-5021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2489.718,2499.439,"Is it just true that you want these poor people just to be limited to jobs that are trained skills, is that what you want?"
1971.70-5021,2,21658,donald_j_veverka,,2499.439,2500.529,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-5021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2500.529,2503.006,And you want to preclude liberal arts people?
1971.70-5021,2,21658,donald_j_veverka,,2503.006,2503.223,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-5021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2503.223,2504.095,To get money?
1971.70-5021,2,21658,donald_j_veverka,,2504.095,2504.808,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-5021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2526.248,2527.267,"Well, let me ask this?"
