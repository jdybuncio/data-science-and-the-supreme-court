1989.88-1377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.916,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 88-1377, Louis W. Sullivan v. Brian Zebley."
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,11.56,19.715,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.757,280.488,Mr. Kneedler--
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,280.488,280.575,--Yes.
1989.88-1377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,280.575,289.003,--Isn't a functional evaluation often a necessary predicate to making a medical diagnosis?
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,289.003,299.559,"Yes, and the way in which this program is implemented, in fact, provides for a functional assessment in many circumstances."
1989.88-1377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,299.559,301.5,"Well, if it makes it to the list."
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,311.997,316.559,"Well, there may be... there may be children who aren't on the list, but that doesn't... I mean, there are two points about that."
1989.88-1377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,354.136,370.085,"If... if it were an adult being considered for disability benefits, steps 4 and 5 of the evaluation appear to catch some severe impairments that aren't on the Listings for adults."
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,370.085,378.34,"Well, the principal thrust of steps 4 and 5, step 4 is if the person can do his past work he is not disabled, and that would... we'll put that to one side."
1989.88-1377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,388.137,395.49,"I understand, but would you agree with me that those steps, for adults, appear to pick up some people who aren't on the lists?"
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,395.49,398.553,"--It may pick up some people, but this gets to the point I was going to make."
1989.88-1377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,432.766,448.555,"Well, what is it that the Secretary has done, beyond Part B Listing, to ensure that children's impairments, of comparable severity to an adult, are handled properly?"
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,448.555,451.697,"Well, what the... what the... it is the Part B Listing--"
1989.88-1377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,451.697,465.327,"I mean, it sounds like all the Secretary has done is to make the Part B Listing, which admittedly doesn't include some major diseases, as I understand it, things like Down syndrome and cystic fibrosis and heaven knows what all."
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,465.327,472.371,"--As to that, Justice O'Connor, I... the Respondents and some of the amici, I think, have a misapprehension about the way the Listing works."
1989.88-1377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,622.12,635.057,"So, under your view, the phrase, with reference to adults, unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity, is just irrelevant with respect to the child?"
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,635.057,638.64,It is not irrelevant in terms of--
1989.88-1377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,638.64,640.611,Are you reading it out of the statute as to the child?
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,640.611,640.991,--No.
1989.88-1377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,681.279,692.318,And under your interpretation that's a functional analysis that is comparable to the functional analysis that you engage in in determining substantial gainful... substantial gainful activity standard?
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,692.318,692.699,Right.
1989.88-1377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,731.394,745.192,"It is still not clear to me, if you don't read it, that phrase, any substantial gainful activity, out of the statute, why is it that you require a hearing as to an adult, or an individualized determination, whereas you don't with the child."
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,746.701,752.325,"--I think it... yes, I think it... I hesitate... yes, I think it is misstating the issue."
1989.88-1377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,791.401,801.729,"Would there be a case where a 17-and-a-half-year-old could not obtain benefits, but then upon reaching 18 he could?"
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,801.729,806.372,"It's possible, but... it's possible that he might, but it seems... there are two reasons for that."
1989.88-1377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,830.037,833.078,But if the disease... if the disease and the impairment is the same--
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,833.078,835.17,"--If the impairment is the same, yes, but what--"
1989.88-1377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,835.17,842.135,--How is it that at age 17 and a half you don't obtain the benefit and at 18 plus you do?
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,848.87,854.194,"--Well, the reason, there is comparability in the severity of the impairment."
1989.88-1377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,880.039,884.394,"But I thought you said that you have to take that into account anyway, because you are not reading that out of the statute as to children."
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,884.394,893.961,"No, well, what I said was you don't read it out of the statute in the sense that, in deciding what is comparable severity."
1989.88-1377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,914.491,918.445,"Mr. Kneedler, I... this... this exchange is bringing out what has puzzled me."
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,939.84,943.012,I think your question highlights the difficulties with Respondents position.
1989.88-1377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,943.012,946.825,"Are you using a middle aged adult as your standard, or an elderly adult?"
1989.88-1377,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,946.825,953.066,"The comparable, the touchstone is the Part A Listings, which would render adults generally disabled."
1989.88-1377,1,40732,richard_p_weishaupt,,1471.949,1490.119,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1377,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1493.993,1507.431,If... you wind on the side... if you wind that up on the side--
1989.88-1377,1,40732,richard_p_weishaupt,,1507.431,1507.921,--Thank you.
1989.88-1377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1552.481,1561.116,"--Well, Mr. Weishaupt, the... Mr. Kneedler says that the equivalence determination takes care of that."
1989.88-1377,1,40732,richard_p_weishaupt,,1561.116,1562.027,Yes.
1989.88-1377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1562.027,1578.347,"And I think you better address yourself to that, that the Secretary's interpretation is that the equivalence determination allows consideration of the functional impact of even multiple conditions."
1989.88-1377,1,40732,richard_p_weishaupt,,1578.347,1590.175,"The Secretary's interpretation, as promulgated by Ruling 83-19, which is the only thing on paper that addresses the question of equivalence, quite simply states that functional consequences are not to be determined."
1989.88-1377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1737.193,1755.506,"If the Secretary took out the language there, in that Regulation 83-19, so that a medical... a medical equivalency determination also looked to functional impairment, would there be anything left of your case?"
1989.88-1377,1,40732,richard_p_weishaupt,,1755.506,1759.797,That would go a long way toward resolving the problems that we have with the Secretary's approach.
1989.88-1377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2022.738,2033.646,"The Secretary explains that, Counsel, by saying that for an adult like that, a young adult like that, the statute provides a clear criterion: the ability to work."
1989.88-1377,1,40732,richard_p_weishaupt,,2053.527,2056.719,"Yes, but the Secretary does not take a functional approach."
1989.88-1377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2063.594,2066.487,I don't know how we resolve that.
1989.88-1377,1,40732,richard_p_weishaupt,,2079.697,2105.162,"I think by looking carefully at the wording that actually exists in Ruling 83-19, which states that functional impairments cannot be looked at in order to arrive at a conclusion that someone has a impairment that rises to Listing level, which in and of itself is a more difficult test than an adult would ever be put through."
1989.88-1377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2147.122,2152.545,"Once again, there is just a flat disagreement as to what... I guess what the fact is on that."
1989.88-1377,1,40732,richard_p_weishaupt,,2169.847,2187.958,"The Secretary will allow an equivalence finding to be made in the circumstances where a child has a combination of impairments that together yield the signs, symptoms and laboratory data that are necessary to meet one of the Listings."
1989.88-1377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.683,2258.847,"Does the record give any indication of how often that occurs, that three different kinds of symptoms that you just referred to?"
1989.88-1377,1,40732,richard_p_weishaupt,,2258.847,2263.329,"--No, although the brief of the AMA and the American Academy--"
1989.88-1377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2263.329,2264.12,Is that the record?
1989.88-1377,1,40732,richard_p_weishaupt,,2266.291,2278.3,"--No, it relies on their knowledge to state that children frequently suffer from a wider array of disabilities, and frequently have more combinations."
1989.88-1377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2340.74,2347.315,"Did any of the Plaintiffs in this case have the sort of situation that you are talking about, with the three different kinds of symptoms?"
1989.88-1377,1,40732,richard_p_weishaupt,,2347.315,2369.78,"No, although Joseph Love suffered from a combination of mental retardation and emotional disorders, failed third grade three times, eventually was found to be so disturbed that he could not even be in a classroom with other emotionally disturbed children."
1989.88-1377,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2420.903,2434.373,"But when the Secretary found that his ability to help his mother entered into the equation, isn't that the very functional kind of analysis that you insist ought to be made?"
1989.88-1377,1,40732,richard_p_weishaupt,,2434.373,2437.563,"Yes, but it is only used in that case to deny."
1989.88-1377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2530.215,2531.958,"Thank you, Mr. Weishaupt."
1989.88-1377,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2534.398,2538.469,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-1377,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2587.152,2591.884,"Why isn't it before the Court, if there are members of the class who would fit the description of your adversary?"
1989.88-1377,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2598.129,2604.324,"--Well, the question... this suit was brought to challenge the requirement that a child must meet or equal the Listings--"
1989.88-1377,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2604.324,2605.015,I understand.
1989.88-1377,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2605.015,2607.536,--not what... not what the content of the Listings themselves was.
1989.88-1377,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2614.622,2630.499,"Well, but if there are members of the class, I gather... I don't have the definition of the class in front, it would include this person in the... Wilkinson case, or whatever it was that he referred to, why can't the argument be made that that requirement is invalid as applied to some members of the class?"
1989.88-1377,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2630.499,2639.395,"Well, we just can't tell on this record, on the basis of the record of this, of a hypothetical member of a class who might have one disorder or not, first of all whether he would be found disabled."
1989.88-1377,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2647.082,2664.751,"Well, I understand if it is equal to one that is listed, but looking at page 240 of the regulation, where you called our attention to paragraph 3 on 239, it seems to me that there would be people who would have... it would be people under 18, who would have total disability but not meet one of the standards."
1989.88-1377,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2664.751,2665.272,Well--
1989.88-1377,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2665.272,2674.308,"Because you specifically say the functional consequence of the impairments, i.e., RFC, irrespective of their nature or extent, cannot justify a determination of equivalence."
1989.88-1377,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2674.308,2678.902,--And I think the parenthetical is... explains what this sentence is about.
1989.88-1377,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2704.047,2706.299,You match one of the impairments to the... you match to one--
1989.88-1377,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2706.299,2709.03,"--You match the combined effect of the impairments, as--"
1989.88-1377,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2709.03,2710.772,--To only one of the Listings.
1989.88-1377,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2710.772,2713.924,"--To the one that is most near, most nearly applicable."
