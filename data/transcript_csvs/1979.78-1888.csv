1979.78-1888,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,17.867,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Maher v. Virginia Gagne, and others."
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,23.465,28.178,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1888,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,74.145,88.954,"Mr. Walsh, looking at page 21A of the petition for certiorari, did their consent decree reserve to the court the right to fix attorney's fees for the plaintiffs in the case?"
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,88.954,110.018,"It did not, Your Honor, but in all candor it must be said that prior to the entry of the consent decree the State proposed that each party would pay its own costs and the respondents' attorneys refused to agree to that and we decided we would leave it to the District Court when they brought a motion subsequently for attorney's fees."
1979.78-1888,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,110.018,121.37,"So the State, in effect, consented that after the consent decree was entered a motion for attorney's fees or a new suit for attorney's fees could be brought?"
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,121.37,126.014,"Yes, Your Honor, that is the only way that we could get the consent decree signed."
1979.78-1888,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,131.985,148.734,"But you also say that, at least orally, you did not agree that the consent decree settled all the issues in the case, including the issues of whether attorney's fees should be awarded."
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,148.734,149.583,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,588.915,606.529,"Well, what about in a case like that where there is unquestionably a constitutional claim joined with a statutory claim and the Court proceeds to decide the statutory claim, never reaches the constitutional claim, and the plaintiff wins on the statutory claim."
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,610.14,610.968,"That is right, Your Honor."
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,616.393,620.586,Is that the practice in the courts now or are holdings --
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,620.586,624.71,I would say that there are several holdings otherwise.
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.71,631.726,But even if they decide only the statutory claim there is fees available because of the joinder of a constitutional claim?
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,631.726,635.51,As long as the claim has a common nucleus of operative facts.
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.51,636.053,I see.
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,636.053,637.652,"Now, precisely what --"
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.652,643.188,"Well, I suppose if those cases are right, then this case is right, too, then."
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,643.188,644.009,"That is right, sir."
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,644.009,644.373,(Voice Overlap)
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,644.373,647.082,That would be the case.
1979.78-1888,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,648.869,652.527,Doesn't the legislative history support that?
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,652.527,657.757,"I think, Your Honor, that the legislative history does not support the claim in this case."
1979.78-1888,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,753.408,761.162,Wasn't 1983 passed pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment?
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,761.162,762.602,Under the analysis of the --
1979.78-1888,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,762.602,763.688,Isn't that true?
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,763.688,775.371,"I would say ""No,"" Your Honor, under the analysis of Chapman, because in a case of this kind that is just, if you will, the admission ticket that the Federal Court in 1983 -- but the underlying --"
1979.78-1888,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,775.371,777.358,You are not talking about this case.
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,787.64,803.467,"Our position is, Your Honor, that you cannot tell that in a case of this kind until you examine the underlying statute, which is the substantive basis of the 1983 claim."
1979.78-1888,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,818.189,825.11,But in one case 1983 was passed pursuant to section 5 and in another case it is not.
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,826.086,841.711,"No, Your Honor, I think 1983 is never passed, it is just an admission ticket to get the Federal Court, it is the underlying claim that determines whether or not the Fourteenth Amendment claim is being enforced."
1979.78-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,841.711,844.063,"Mr. Walsh, maybe you have already covered it."
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,850.427,853.337,"Well, I would say, Your Honor, I referred to the underlying claim."
1979.78-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,860.098,865.313,"Well, there was here an underlying Constitution -- there is an allegation of violation of the Constitution here, wasn't there?"
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,865.313,867.8,"There is a recital of a constitutional claim, Your Honor."
1979.78-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,868.845,873.778,"And that is what says that is a part of Federal Jurisdiction, is the statutory claim is pendent to the Constitution."
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,873.778,875.588,Under Hagans v. Lavine.
1979.78-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,875.588,875.696,Yes.
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,875.696,885.1,"But under Chapman, when you analyze the Chapman decision, that this Court has analyzed it, it really says there is no constitutional claim because --"
1979.78-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,885.1,888.215,Wasn't that a case in which there was no constitutional claim?
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,888.215,892.743,"Chapman was a jurisdictional question, yes, Your Honor, there was no constitutional claim."
1979.78-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,892.743,895.713,And here there was both a constitutional and a statutory claim.
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,895.713,895.963,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,895.963,902.105,So doesn't it fit the description of the kind of case in which the statute allows attorney's fees.
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,908.489,913.774,"See, Your Honor, Chapman tells us that 1983 confers no substantive rights."
1979.78-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,913.774,916.871,"Well, they don't argue that 1983 confers any substantive rights."
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,930.768,934.76,"Well, they may be relying on 1988 but when --"
1979.78-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,934.76,938.07,1988 gives them the attorney's fees.
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,938.07,941.641,1988 provides that in any claim brought under 1983.
1979.78-1888,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,941.641,942.202,Right.
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,948.505,951.561,But we say Congress didn't mean any claim when they said any claim.
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,967.514,970.973,"But if it is not part of the case, there is no jurisdiction."
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,970.973,974.361,"Well, unfortunately that is the trouble."
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.235,981.393,Right.
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,981.393,999.156,"-- the Court will say it is sufficient to get a Federal Court who will consider the statutory claim. But that still does not confer, as I understand Chapman, any substantive constitutional rights on the plaintiff's claim."
1979.78-1888,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1001.715,1006.001,I don't understand.
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1006.001,1042.016,"Now, the respondent has also cited the case of Katzenbach v. Morgan proposition, if I understood him correctly, that Congress -- once Congress has determined that it was acting pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment which has been suggested they said when we enacted 1983 we were acting pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that is not for this Court even to question Congress as to whether or not that was a proper exercise of their power under section 5."
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1180.104,1189.921,"Well, what if the case had gone to trial and the judge addressed the statutory issue first and found against you."
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1194.839,1195.49,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1195.49,1196.867,That is called a statutory claim --
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1196.867,1196.921,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1196.921,1198.589,-- although it is a supremacy clause claim.
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1198.589,1201.292,"Supremacy clause claim; yes, sir."
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1201.292,1215.937,"Suppose the judge had said this is wholly consistent with say Federal law and then he had gotten to the constitutional claim and said, well, both the State and the Federal law are unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection."
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1218.59,1219.922,If the Court found that there was a violation --
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.922,1221.15,Yes.
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1221.15,1226.851,"-- a constitutional violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, then I think there is no question that it would be interpreted as enforcing --"
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1226.851,1227.094,Yes.
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1227.094,1228.191,-- the Fourteenth Amendment.
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1228.191,1229.424,What would be?
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1229.424,1233.974,The plaintiff's action as an action brought to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1233.974,1244.511,"Well, what if your settlement agreement had expressly recited that you were settling both the constitutional and the statutory claim?"
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1244.511,1247.038,"Well, under my analysis, Your Honor, I think that --"
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1247.038,1250.72,"Well, the suit would still have been brought for exactly same purpose."
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1250.72,1251.896,"That is right, Your honor."
1979.78-1888,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1262.416,1266.201,"Yes, yes."
1979.78-1888,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1266.201,1272.897,"At any rate, the Senate Report says that the Fees Act was intended to just be limited to civil rights cases."
1979.78-1888,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1397.85,1409.993,"Very well, Mr. Walsh."
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,1416.255,1418.856,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1888,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1479.604,1500.779,"Well, I have been away from the private practice for ten years and perhaps things have changed a good deal since then, but for instance in other Federal statutes like title VII of the Freedom of Information Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act also provide for the award of attorney's fees."
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,1532.656,1534.924,"I think that is a good point, Your Honor."
1979.78-1888,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1581.268,1599.171,"Well, that is certainly true in any litigation that I am familiar with, is that one of the things on the table, so to speak, is whether the plaintiff recovers not only $150,000 for the loss of an arm but $25,000 attorney's fees."
1979.78-1888,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1599.773,1600.693,And costs.
1979.78-1888,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1600.693,1601.722,-- and costs.
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,1618.116,1625.842,I think that is very possible in those cases where the plaintiff would otherwise have to pay his counsel's attorney's fees.
1979.78-1888,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1649.879,1662.684,"That is typical in a contingent fee action, too, isn't it, where you have a plaintiff who doesn't -- has little or no money and is dependent upon the recovery to pay his own attorney?"
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,1662.684,1663.949,"That is quite true, Your Honor."
1979.78-1888,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1663.949,1689.214,"Do you think there is any analogy, Ms. Pilver, in this situation and the one where parties will agree or stipulate consent to liability but submits for a litigated basis the issue of the amount of damages?"
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,1689.214,1704.95,"I think there is a similarity and I think that kind of approach is very useful to settle the merits of the case first and then allow those other matters to be handled either in a separate negotiation or if they cannot settle it, then to allow it to be decided by the court."
1979.78-1888,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1762.421,1765.448,You mean it was settled on the merits or litigated on the merits?
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,1765.448,1773.52,"It was -- I am sorry -- litigated on the merits, Your Honor, This case was settled."
1979.78-1888,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1793.962,1796.465,What was the first difference cited?
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,1796.465,1801.669,The first difference is the fact that in Hutto the case was tried on the merits.
1979.78-1888,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1801.669,1802.05,And here?
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,1802.05,1803.471,And in this case it was settled.
1979.78-1888,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1803.471,1805.187,I see.
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,1805.187,1805.627,The Civil Rights Attorney's --
1979.78-1888,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1805.627,1808.717,Isn't there still another difference.
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,1823.62,1834.056,"Well, if I understood Mr. Justice Rehnquist's position in Hutto, it was that because the Eight Amendment has been incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment."
1979.78-1888,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1840.061,1841.67,Right.
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,1841.67,1842.765,-- that --
1979.78-1888,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1842.765,1843.846,"But you don't have that obstacle, that --"
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,1843.846,1845.281,"No, we don't."
1979.78-1888,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1845.281,1847.782,So in one sense your case is stronger than the other.
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,1847.782,1848.984,"Yes, that is quite correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1888,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1848.984,1849.524,Yes.
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,1849.524,1852.27,"That is true, this is."
1979.78-1888,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2111.486,2126.091,"Ms. Pilver, do you make anything at all of the first paragraph in the consent decree saying nothing in this consent decree is intended to constitute an admission of fault by either party to this action?"
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,2126.091,2127.403,"No, I don't, Your honor."
1979.78-1888,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2140.746,2144.154,"Well, the defendant hadn't accused her of any fault."
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,2144.154,2145.321,"I am sorry, Your Honor --"
1979.78-1888,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2145.321,2148.259,"The defendant hadn't accused her of any fault, had they?"
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,2148.259,2157.981,"No, but the plaintiff did make allegations in the complaint which, you know, we certainly maintained to the State that if the matter had gone to trial that we would have prevailed."
1979.78-1888,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2157.981,2163.535,You regarded this as just kind of boiler-plate that you stuck in the request of the defendants?
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,2163.535,2164.558,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1888,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2164.558,2172.165,"Well, isn't it agreed that boiler plate -- have you ever seen a stipulation of this kind to a consent decree that doesn't have it in?"
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,2172.165,2173.069,"That is right, I haven't."
1979.78-1888,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2173.069,2174.945,You will settle that the rule admit nothing?
1979.78-1888,1,32477,joan_e_pilver,,2174.945,2176.864,"That is right, Your Honor."
