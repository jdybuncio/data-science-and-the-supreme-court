2000.130_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,4.476,"We'll hear argument now in No. 130, Orig."
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,8.071,9.445,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.130_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,20.811,22.047,Would you speak up a little please?
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,22.047,22.856,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2000.130_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,22.856,25.997,Maybe you can raise the podium and everything closer.
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,25.997,29.37,I apologize.
2000.130_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,100.308,114.886,"If we agree with your position, does it become important or do we decide here, or does it remain in dispute whether the middle means the geographic middle or the middle of the channel?"
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,114.886,131.415,"No, paragraph four of the 1977 decree specifically held or noted or ruled that as used in the 1740 order, quote... middle of the river, closed quote... means middle of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River."
2000.130_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,132.483,149.972,But what I guess I'm asking is it necessary then... if your position is to be maintained... that we refer to our own earlier decree as opposed to simply relying on the 1740 decree?
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,158.151,162.423,"--Hopefully it will not come up again, as this is the third time it has come up."
2000.130_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.013,175.942,Where is that?
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,175.942,187.398,"That would be the Commissioner's report... it's at, I believe, 14(A) attached to our appendix, or attached to our brief."
2000.130_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.906,206.601,"Well, the 1977 consent decree I thought had to do with the lateral marine boundary from a point going out to sea."
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,219.095,221.457,"No, Your Honor."
2000.130_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,221.457,222.124,No?
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,222.124,223.199,At the--
2000.130_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,223.199,227.907,Where is it... it is not at 14(A)... at least not on 14(A) of your brief.
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,229.432,236.955,"--I apologize, Your Honor."
2000.130_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,248.687,249.078,It's not 7(A) either.
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,255.144,256.16,--No.
2000.130_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,260.067,260.257,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,265.56,266.589,Second paragraph.
2000.130_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.589,267.139,7(A).
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,267.139,268.343,Second paragraph.
2000.130_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,310.344,323.986,"Yes, but the question might then become whether it follows the salvaig or it doesn't, and whether the '77 consent decree has res judicata effect here."
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,329.581,342.163,"--The decree on its face in paragraph four, without reservation, gives meaning to the phrase quote... middle of the river from the 1740--"
2000.130_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,342.163,342.674,And what page is that on?
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,342.674,343.923,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
2000.130_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.923,345.137,"Page four, which is where?"
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,348.896,349.425,The Maine--
2000.130_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,349.425,353.329,"The '76 decree... that's what we're talking about, isn't it?"
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,353.329,360.667,--The 1977 decree is reproduced attached to the United States brief... the gray brief... and I believe the--
2000.130_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,360.667,361.742,That's what I've been asking for.
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,362.874,363.435,"--I misunderstood, Your Honor."
2000.130_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,459.373,477.034,--But the point is that I at least looked at New Hampshire's complaint here as resting on an allegation that the division is the low-water mark of the Maine shore.
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,505.225,506.693,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
2000.130_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,506.693,512.187,"We could do that, and that would mean they could come back here a fourth time, I assume."
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,512.187,514.234,"I assume, yes."
2000.130_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,514.234,535.917,But to do that we would just as much have to rely on the fact that the only thing which the 1977 decree technically held... mainly the outward line... depended upon a calculation of what the line within the River was.
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,552.691,553.745,That's logical.
2000.130_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.052,559.557,"Well, I think the other approach is illogical."
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,593.572,594.963,"--We agree, Your Honor."
2000.130_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,688.855,695.586,"Just as a matter of English usage, it seems when you're talking about the middle of the River it would not be Maine's shoreline."
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,695.586,699.025,"--That's what we have been saying, Your Honor."
2000.130_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,771.167,776.321,But the last time around there wasn't any actual adjudication.
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,799.143,804.117,We would disagree with that for a number of reasons.
2000.130_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,828.816,844.762,"First, on claim preclusion, it isn't the same claim because it was one portion that was in content to be '77 and a different portion now, so I don't see how it could be claim preclusion."
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,855.524,877.532,"Not exactly, because back in the 1970s, as it has been explained previously, by necessity it was essential to determine the location of the boundary in the River and, in fact, the decree applied the principle to a portion of the River."
2000.130_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,896.032,905.031,The difference is that claim preclusion would be used to the extent that it doesn't matter what was actually litigated if it's a part of the whole claim.
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,905.031,905.887,--Exactly.
2000.130_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,905.887,910.757,"In issue preclusion, it usually does matter whether it was actually litigated."
2000.130_orig,0,38367,paul_stern,,910.757,912.336,Yes.
2000.130_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,963.658,964.848,"Very well, Mr. Stern."
2000.130_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,967.036,977.356,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.130_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1000.622,1001.96,What?
2000.130_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1001.96,1008.821,This is in the eight and a half by eleven document entitled New Hampshire's Map Lodging for Oral Argument.
2000.130_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1008.821,1021.203,"I don't have it, Mr. Minear."
2000.130_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1021.203,1039.896,"Okay, perhaps I can describe the line and that might be helpful to understand the operation of the consent decree in 1977. This consent decree did provide for descriptions of the lateral marine boundary which runds perpendicular to what would be the coastline of Maine and NH."
2000.130_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1039.896,1042.575,"For those of us that do have it, what page?"
2000.130_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1042.575,1043.615,It's map number four.
2000.130_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1108.949,1119.44,"When you said that definition of the middle of the River, the main channel... is that the talveig, or just the channel that is in fact used by the ships?"
2000.130_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1119.44,1123.574,I think in actuality it is the channel that is in fact used by the ships.
2000.130_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1147.549,1153.757,And how does that help us as we proceed north through... beyond Seavey's Island?
2000.130_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1153.757,1158.697,--Seavey's Island is to the left... to the west of this line.
2000.130_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1185.419,1215.084,The argument is being made that the normal conditions for issue preclusion are met here because this was not an ordinary consent decree... the Court really had to make a legal determination because of the special nature of the Court's repsonsibilities with regard to boundary disputes between the states.
2000.130_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1240.812,1244.727,"Well, Maine was making that argument, and it wasn't ultimately resolved."
2000.130_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1255.303,1261.272,"Well, you say the Court actually decided that that's what the 1740 document meant?"
2000.130_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1261.272,1271.623,"--No, rather what the Court said in its 1976 decision was first that it's clear that the 1740 Order of the King controls here, and it's the middle of the River."
2000.130_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1285.773,1291.459,The 1740 decree reasonably referred to harbor lights that were planted out there in what... 1960?
2000.130_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1291.459,1299.618,"--No, I think what the Court was suggesting is they could have... that decree could reasonably describe what was the main channel of navigation, however that was determined at that time."
2000.130_orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1368.049,1371.503,"Mr. Minear, which preclusion principle are you relying on?"
2000.130_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1377.799,1379.936,We rely on issue preclusion.
2000.130_orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1379.936,1385.556,"And even though the Court didn't actually adjudicate anything, it accepted the parties' submissions."
2000.130_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1385.556,1390.114,"Well, the Court did adjudicate the question of whether the 1740 Order controls."
2000.130_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1457.475,1463.278,What is that vertical blue line that you're talkign about on map four?
2000.130_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1463.278,1463.966,Yes?
2000.130_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1463.966,1472.875,On paragraph five of the decree it says it proceeds southward as indicated by the range lights located in the vicinty of Pepperell Cove and Kittery Point.
2000.130_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1474.185,1474.44,Yes.
2000.130_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1477.142,1483.495,So it starts... so that phrase in paragraph five is meant to pick up the top of that vertical leg and go down.
2000.130_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1483.495,1484.046,That's right.
2000.130_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1484.046,1484.479,Okay.
2000.130_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1484.479,1489.193,And the reason that they say in the vicinity is they start that point with the two range lights intersected.
2000.130_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1489.193,1491.11,So this all comes from some map?
2000.130_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1495.927,1504.581,"Now, the current charts... if the Court is interested in looking at the current charts, they're NOAA charts 13278 and 13283."
2000.130_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1515.957,1517.587,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,1517.587,1537.295,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.130_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1702.836,1712.205,"But you said how you argued in 1977, you said we said, which I think is something that you said in the past."
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,1712.205,1713.375,Excuse me.
2000.130_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1730.651,1734.92,You think middle of the harbor was also not relevant to that decree?
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,1734.92,1742.078,"Your Honor, the consent decree did not address the phrase middle of the harbor, nor did it address the phrase mouth of the harbor."
2000.130_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1742.078,1751.143,We have that four says the terms middle of the river and middle of the harbor as used in the above quoted order mean the middle of the main channel of navigation.
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,1751.143,1752.358,I understand that.
2000.130_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1775.822,1782.246,"Let me just interrupt you to get one thing straight... the parties signed a consent decree, but this Court didn't enter that decree."
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,1783.997,1789.022,--This Court entered an order approving the consent decree.
2000.130_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1789.022,1791.605,Where is the consent decree in the materials in front of us?
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,1810.172,1816.937,"The parties' consent decree appears in the appendix to the brief for the United States, and the paragraph--"
2000.130_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1816.937,1818.781,"Whereabouts, Ms. Ludtke?"
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,1818.781,1820.884,"--Excuse me, at 1(A) in--"
2000.130_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1820.884,1824.882,"That's what I'm looking... that's what we're reading from, and it says middle of the harbor."
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,1839.847,1843.704,"--That means the middle of Gosport Harbor, Your Honor."
2000.130_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.926,1848.01,And it means... it means the navi--
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,1848.01,1849.896,--boundary lines go through the middle of Gosport.
2000.130_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.896,1860.366,"--The regular channel of navigation through the harbor, and you think that middle of the river does not mean the regular channel of navigation through the river."
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,1862.33,1875.243,"Your Honor, NH has very carefully reviewed the historical documents pertaining to the 1740 Order and the way in which that language was used in that 1740 Order."
2000.130_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1875.243,1892.788,"We're just focusing on number four for a minute... it says the terms middle of the river as used in the above quarter mean that I'll interpolate (a) the middle of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River, and (b) the middle of the main channel of navigation of Gosport Harbor."
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,1898.145,1899.198,That's correct.
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1920.297,1922.476,Right.
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1922.476,1932.546,"So then it goes on to define what they're talking about, and they say the middle of the main channel of navigation, and that's why I ask this question, and they say is that blue line."
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1939.537,1946.66,Paragraph five of that decree means exactly as if it were written... that blue line.
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,1946.66,1947.976,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1947.976,1948.22,Right.
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,1958.553,1986.287,"Your Honor, the state of NH is not contesting the lateral marine boundary in the portion... I call it the dogleg portion... that runs up toward Pepperrell Cove, and that is the line that is referred to that is marked by the 1956 ships' range line, and that line, by definition, terminates at the location of the ships' range light lines which are located on Pepperrell Cove."
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1988.573,1996.663,"So can you... I'm sorry that I may be... looking at map four, what part are you talking about?"
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,1996.663,2017.937,"Looking at map four, the line that proceeds from here to here, the top towards Pepperrell Cove, the turn, represents the 1956 ships' range light line--"
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2017.937,2018.369,Right.
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2018.369,2019.668,--determined by that.
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.969,2022.176,Which is the blue dogleg.
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2022.176,2022.889,--That's correct.
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2022.889,2022.889,Okay.
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2022.889,2027.588,And it terminates by definition at the shore right here.
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2037.699,2041.538,What is it NH wants?
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2041.538,2042.467,Pardon?
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2042.467,2046.172,I'm sorry... don't assume too much... assume I know nothing about this.
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2054.014,2074.84,"The portion of the boundary that is at issue in this litigation is the portion that starts from this line west of this line, and runs up the river to the saltwater confluence at the Puchico River."
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2074.84,2077.629,So Seavey Island... that's the part.
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2077.629,2079.27,This is Seavey's Island right here.
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2079.27,2080.393,And you want part of that.
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2080.393,2096.539,"This case is not about the location of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard... it's about the boundaries of NH, and it's about whether NH has rights to Portsmouth Harbor that historically have been NH's."
2000.130_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2120.074,2125.607,But shouldn't all of this have been fleshed out in the 1976 case?
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2125.607,2131.768,L In 1976 the parties had no motive or reasons to litigate these issues.
2000.130_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2162.216,2162.216,That's with the... these are all... that refers to the 1976 litigation?
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2166.963,2162.216,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.130_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2182.142,2191.582,"But if in fact the choice of that starting point also leads to other perfectly logical conclusions, isn't NH bound by that?"
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2191.582,2193.01,"No, Your Honor."
2000.130_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2209.339,2216.498,"May I just ask... you say there is no actual adjudication, but paragraph four was a subject of dispute within this Court."
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2222.05,2232.211,"Your Honor, I think that the question on whether there was an actual decision goes to the matter of whether that stipulation was essential to the Court's authority to enter the decree."
2000.130_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2274.603,2276.114,You're just repeating Justice White's argument.
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2276.114,2276.731,--Pardon?
2000.130_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2276.731,2281.699,You're just repeating Justice White's argument that the Court rejected.
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2281.699,2308.204,"And that's... that's why I think that the 1976 order issued by this Court does stand for the proposition that the states have broad latitude in coming to agreement as to the lcoation of a boundary when the underlying boundary instrument is imprecise, and I think the second correlary of that is this Court need not adjudicate the actual true and correct historical meaning of the underlying decree in approving such an agreement of the parties."
2000.130_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.952,2387.294,"Well, I think the Court would be surprised to learn that the real disagreement between the majority and the dissent in the case was not over where the line was, but rather over whether you can accept the parties' stipulation or not."
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2422.003,2434.886,"Well, the consent decree that was approved stated specifically in the first paragraph that the master's decision is approved, and the master's recommendation provided for a line at the geographic middle."
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2529.719,2534.676,Is your point this... I look at that map four.
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2544.944,2546.628,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2546.628,2546.789,All right.
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2555.082,2555.989,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2555.989,2546.789,"So now you're saying whatever we might have done to compromise that blue line, we never said a word about the line that isn't there, and by the way, it wasn't in the case... the line that wasn't there... so we get to litigate that afresh."
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2546.789,2569.86,That's absolutely correct.
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2572.126,2573.892,"Okay, I understand."
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2573.892,2578.098,"--As stated in the complaint, the claim was for the lateral marine boundaries that ran from the mouth--"
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2578.098,2595.087,"Okay, is there any theory... is there any theory of law or common sense or anything that would say, all right, the blue line... you draw the line at the lights, but the line... imaginary line... goes off to the left past Seavey's Island, you don't draw at the lights."
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2601.44,2606.597,--There is no line... that is a natural outgrowth of the line that terminates at the lights.
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2613.203,2615.259,And there are no range lights the other way?
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2615.259,2623.173,"Well, there are actually some range lights at Pierce's Island, but those range lights weren't even discussed in the context of the 1976 case."
2000.130_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2623.173,2632.37,"Ms. Ludtke, the one problem with what you're saying is that it just doesn't... doesn't comport with what is said in the consent decree."
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2681.725,2693.124,"Your Honor, I would disagree with that based on the oral argument when NH represented it to the Court that that was an arbitrary location based on the administrative convenience of the parties."
2000.130_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2694.771,2695.422,Where was that?
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2698.34,2710.693,--NH in the oral arguments that those locations were arbitrary and based on the desire for the administrative convenience of their respective states.
2000.130_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2710.693,2713.51,But that doesn't certainly mean that Maine necessarily agreed with that.
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2713.51,2728.915,"Your Honor, Maine did not take the position at this time that this was a litigated issue or that this was an issue that actually was tied to the historical location of the ship's channel--"
2000.130_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2728.915,2729.82,"Well, then you shouldn't lie about it."
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2736.929,2738.095,--Your Honor--
2000.130_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2738.095,2741.529,That is simply incompatible with getting up and saying the line is arbitrary.
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2748.014,2757.845,"--Your Honor, the history of the litigation shows that at the time that Maine and NH entered into this decree, which was 1974, both states did it with the best of intentions."
2000.130_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2769.392,2773.769,"Well, at the very least it didn't mean the low-water mark on the Maine shore, did it?"
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2778.713,2786.366,"Your Honor, I think the question goes to the applicability of that phrase to describe the harbor boundary."
2000.130_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2797.447,2801.27,"Excuse me, I just... I don't think I had an answer to my question."
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2808.968,2843.575,"--Your Honor, our position on the term up the middle of the river means that... we take the position that as historically used that was intended to describe the course of the boundary up the main part of the Piscataqua River, and it was intended to direct that the line that proceeded north two degrees west went from the main tributary that was that the main feeder stream into the headwaters of the Salmon Falls River, and we have shown through the 1763 boundary proceedings and the 1828 boundary proceedings that that is how that term was used."

2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2867.152,2867.538,The NH--
2000.130_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2867.538,2879.907,"--If I understand you correctly, if you were counsel for NH in 1976 and you then knew what you now know, would you have signed this decree?"
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2879.907,2880.63,"--No, Your Honor."
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2885.478,2886.3,"All right, so that's what worried me."
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2934.267,2939.046,"Your Honor, we're not trying to get out of anything that was decided in 1976."
2000.130_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2939.046,2942.288,"It wasn't literally decided, because it wasn't directly an issue in the case."
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,2947.729,2950.148,"Your Honor, the issue wasn't actually adjudicated."

2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,3026.415,3034.095,The 1740 decree is a relevant piece of historical evidence.
2000.130_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3034.095,3037.873,"Yes... is relevant historical evidence, or is irrelevant?"
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,3038.258,3049.204,"No, we've actually stated it is relevant to when we've listed the items that we believe fair on NH's boundary claim, and that's on page twelve of our motion and our brief."
2000.130_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3049.204,3064.637,"Well, why can't I read the consent... why can't I read our earlier decision... our decree as saying that the 1740 determination is controlling of the boundary?"
2000.130_orig,2,34744,leslie_j_ludtke,,3064.637,3072.239,"Your Honor, I don't think that decree can be read in that way becuase therre was no adjudication of the issues."

2000.130_orig,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3401.07,3402.584,"Are there two harbors here, by the way?"
2000.130_orig,3,38367,paul_stern,,3402.584,3409.202,Gosport Harbor is the harbor out at the Isle of Shoals.
2000.130_orig,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3410.99,3413.391,"Oh, out by the... okay."
2000.130_orig,3,38367,paul_stern,,3413.391,3416.893,Piscataqua Harbor or Portsmouth Harbor is the one we're talking about.
