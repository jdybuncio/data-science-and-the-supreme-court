1971.70-71,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,27.647,"-- in number 71, United States against Bass."
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,30.121,34.723,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-71,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,466.458,492.866,"Is this an issue that whatever Congress has constitutional matters that (Inaudible), if statute requires as an element of the advancements a proof of company in commerce or affecting commerce and your argument is although this requires (Inaudible), is that it?"
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,492.866,497.084,"Yes, Your Honor essentially we think that the--"
1971.70-71,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,497.084,501.094,"What I am trying to get at is, is there any constitutional question here?"
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,501.094,542.666,"There is a constitutional question assuming that you were to hold that the Court of Appeals was wrong, as we content it was in applying the in commerce or affecting commerce language to the receipt and possession branches of the statute, you would then have to reach, as four Courts of Appeals have done, the constitutional question of whether a statute, which eliminates the necessity for proof, in the individual case of any such effect is within Congress’ powers under the constitution."
1971.70-71,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,542.666,546.769,"Well, I thought that is (Inaudible)"
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,546.769,576.324,"That is correct, Your Honor and the decision below came before this Court's Perez decision and it was written by the judge who had dissented in the Court of Appeals from the affirmance of the conviction in Perez case, but I would first like to address myself to the threshold issue of what the proper construction of the statute should be."
1971.70-71,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,576.324,587.616,"Further, in pursuant to my brother Brennan’s question, it's your submission I suppose that after the Perez case of last term, there is no serious constitutional question?"
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,587.616,589.95,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1971.70-71,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,589.95,607.08,"Certainly, in the Court of Appeals from the Second Circuit, their construction of the statute was reflected constitutional doubt test to the -- a doubt that some constitutionality on the different construction, did not it? (Inaudible)"
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,607.08,608.683,"Yes, it did Your Honor."
1971.70-71,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,618.883,626.136,"And no doubt, we are part of the motivation for them to construe the statute as they did as I understand they are supposed to (Voice Overlap)"
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,626.136,628.57,That is correct.
1971.70-71,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,646.603,651.907,You know that one dissent is enough to raise actual constitutional doubt?
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,651.907,681.053,"I realize you dissented in that case Your Honor, but as the opinion indicated the Court could purported at least, the Eighth to be following a long line of cases emanating from United States against Darby, 312 United States, and with respect to the statute constructed in similar fashion to this one, where Congress makes findings and then eliminates on the basis of them."
1971.70-71,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,698.196,701.804,But what I am pointing out is that when in (Inaudible) early.
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,711.097,711.845,That is correct.
1971.70-71,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,713.164,722.381,That is right and that Second Circuit was wrong in suggesting that the -- without that modification it would be constitutional?
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,722.381,749.385,"That is correct and in addition I should say, we think that are limits to the doctrine that statutes should construed to avoid constitutional doubts and that the legislative of history and other features of this statute make application of that doctrine by the Court of Appeals inappropriate here even were there constitutional doubts."
1971.70-71,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,878.028,886.034,"So, why raise the question and why they put in the modifier at all?"
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,886.034,888.062,"In 1202 (a) you mean, Your Honor?"
1971.70-71,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,888.062,890.207,Yes.
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,897.641,914.225,"I do not think there is any sound answer to that Your Honor other than that the legislative history of the statute, which I was going to come to in a moment, indicates that it may have been put in there as inadvertence --"
1971.70-71,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,914.225,917.398,"In any event, you think it is (Inaudible)?"
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,917.398,934.042,"In any event, we think it should confined, not withstanding the possible logic of this position solely to the transportation branch of the statute."
1971.70-71,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1158.421,1171.157,"Mr. Pauley, let me ask one question about the construction aspect. The Senator (Inaudible) spoke in terms of felons, how is felon defined that the --"
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,1171.157,1179.161,"Felon is defined, the provision is Section 1202 (c) and is set forth at page 3 for our brief."
1971.70-71,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1179.161,1188.75,"Yes, in other words, this takes us to the several variant definitions of state statutes as well as to the definition of the federal law?"
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,1188.75,1190.985,"That is correct Your Honor, Justice --"
1971.70-71,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1190.985,1195.935,What maybe a felony in Missouri might well not be in California?
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,1195.935,1197.621,"That is certainly true, Your Honor --"
1971.70-71,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1197.621,1199.335,Does this disturb you at all?
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,1199.335,1215.191,"I do not think -- this is a point which respondent has raised in his answering brief and which both sides agree was not reached by the Court below and thus need not to be considered here, but were to be considered."
1971.70-71,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1243.979,1271.062,"You do not seem to cite the (Inaudible) case, decided I think around 319, US 320, Justice Robert's opinion for the Court, where there was a presumption that a person who possess the firearm and has acquired it (Voice Overlap), this would seem to be another way of creating a conclusive presumption, is it not?"
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,1271.062,1273.478,"No, I do not think so, Your Honor."
1971.70-71,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1392.243,1401.962,"And there Mr. Pauley, however, was specific congressional findings tying it in with organized crime as such, were they not?"
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,1401.962,1404.153,"That is correct, Your Honor, but--"
1971.70-71,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1404.153,1410.451,Had there been such finding here with your posture be a little stronger in the light of Perez?
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,1410.451,1441.129,"It would -- it would be closer to the facts of Perez were that true, but the essential feature of Perez on which we rely is the test was assessing the constitutionality of statute of these species which the Court in Perez reaffirmed, and in that test is simply whether the findings made by Congress have a rationale basis."
1971.70-71,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1664.043,1667.697,Is Second Circuit the only one that's held as they did?
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,1667.697,1669.124,"Yes, it is Your Honor."
1971.70-71,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1669.124,1670.948,And you have four at least the other way?
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,1670.948,1692.849,"Yes, and for the Court's convenience I would point out that the Six Circuit's opinion which is one of the more extensive is now reported, it was not at the time of writing these briefs and it is in 440 F. 2nd one (Voice Overlap) 440 F. 2nd, 144."
1971.70-71,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1692.849,1694.984,In the exert of one reported (Inaudible)?
1971.70-71,0,40176,roger_a_pauley,,1694.984,1698.897,"Yes it is -- yes it is, Your Honor."
1971.70-71,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1718.798,1720.143,Mr. Hellerstein.
1971.70-71,1,44962,william_e_hellerstein,,1720.143,1723.09,Justice Douglas and may it please the Court.
1971.70-71,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2298.775,2308.359,We will recess at this time.
1971.70-71,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2308.359,2319.342,"The Chief Justice intends to sit in the cases argued this afternoon, although he is necessarily absent. Mr. Hallerstein."
1971.70-71,1,44962,william_e_hellerstein,,2319.342,2321.371,Mr. Justice Douglas and may it please the Court.
1971.70-71,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3249.131,3255.137,Mr. Hellerstein could I ask one question?
1971.70-71,1,44962,william_e_hellerstein,,3276.082,3310.456,"Yes, in the White case which was cited in the Second Circuit's opinion because the government heavily relied on it below, at page 15 of my brief Mr. Justice Blackmun, I cite through I -- and I view the White case as a Second Circuit did that, the circuit harmonized White with this case by noting that in sustaining Congress' power to regulate possession of depressant and stimulant drugs itself recognized the distinct problems inherent in the field of drug regulation."
1971.70-71,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3340.074,3349.433,"You would draw a distinction then with firearms from drugs, they get on highways too once in while, are they not?"
1971.70-71,1,44962,william_e_hellerstein,,3349.433,3357.884,"Yes but they are not, they are not injected by the petitioner or the defendants."
1971.70-71,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3433.635,3440.195,"Well, the cases as group come together and somewhere there is a lot of sharing, is not there?"
1971.70-71,1,44962,william_e_hellerstein,,3440.195,3460.619,"Yes, I think in this case, Your Honor, it is all things being equal, the litigation posture this case, the record before the Court, the Circuit Court of Appeals was certainly I think I had a better of it than avoiding entanglement of those constitutional questions."
1971.70-71,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3460.619,3463.105,"Mr. Pauley, you have I think 3 minutes left."
1971.70-71,2,40176,roger_a_pauley,,3463.105,3467.776,"I have nothing further, Your Honor, unless there are questions?"
1971.70-71,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3467.776,3470.131,The case could be submitted.
1971.70-71,3,44962,william_e_hellerstein,,3480.116,3485.321,"Thank you, Your Honor."
