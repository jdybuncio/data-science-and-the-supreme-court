1973.72-481,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,22.85,"We will hear arguments next in number 72-481, State of Washington against the Puyallup Tribe."
1973.72-481,0,29731,joseph_l_coniff_jr,,25.525,28.833,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1973.72-481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,388.31,396.263,"Of course, in the present case we have the particular words of a particular treaty, don’t we General that --"
1973.72-481,0,29731,joseph_l_coniff_jr,,396.263,396.872,Yes.
1973.72-481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,396.872,404.072,The right of taking fish in all usual and accustomed grounds or stations as part of this -- the said Indians in common with to all citizens of the territory.
1973.72-481,0,29731,joseph_l_coniff_jr,,419.292,424.141,"Well, I don’t believe Ward v. Racehorse is the kind of general language that you are referring too."
1973.72-481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,443.528,444.842,"No, that’s not the type of language."
1973.72-481,0,29731,joseph_l_coniff_jr,,448.372,466.966,"Yes, well that my point is Your Honor the treaty involved in Ward v. Racehorse is so close to the Isaac I. Stevens Treaties that were confronted with in the State of Washington that the court’s revitalization, if you will of the equal footing doctrine of Ward v. Racehorse, I believe to be extremely significant."
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1597.957,1606.27,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1792.779,1795.303,And of accustomed place?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1795.303,1797.507,"Usual and custom places, that’s right."
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1799.433,1804.271,But do you think it also means that the usual and custom manner?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1804.271,1809.774,I think it means more than that and different from that and I will try to get to that in just --
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1809.774,1813.428,What does Pyallup One say (Inaudible)
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1813.428,1818.255,Puyallup One says that the treaty doesn’t say anything as to the manner.
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1818.612,1836.241,"Did Puyallup say anything else about it in terms of how the means to likely to fish even if they have the right to fish in the accustomed places, did it say anything about whether they could do fishing on an accustomed way?"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1836.241,1839.767,"The Puyallup One decision, the prior decision of this Court?"
1973.72-481,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1868.549,1876.944,"Mr. Sachse, as I read Puyallup I thought at least on page 398, it says that the manner maybe regulated in the interest of conservation."
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1882.854,1918.516,"Yes sir on page 402 in the footnote, it's footnote 14, the court said as to a regulation concerning the time and manner of fishing outside the reservation, we say that the power of the state was to be measured by whether it was necessary for the conservation of fish, and the court then contrasted the lesser power of the state to regulate Indian fishing from its general police power and I think that is also [Voice Overlap] in the affirmance of the court below."
1973.72-481,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1918.516,1924.872,How would you weigh a statement in the opinion itself if it seemed to conflict with the statement on the footnote?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1924.872,1942.778,"I would look at the case as a whole and I would say that this case affirmed the decision below, which held in accordance with several other decisions of this Court that the standard is whether it is necessary for the regulation of fish, and that this Court actually went further with Puyallup."
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1966.462,1978.156,You think the treaty would give the -- treaty fishing right do you think would cover -- would guarantee the right for Indians to fish commercially even though at the time the treaty was assigned that they have never fished commercially?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1980.554,1988.456,"Well, to start of with the court in Puyallup One assumed that the Indian did fish commercially."
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1988.456,1994.085,I was asking whether what is your view of the treaty?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2001.545,2003.884,I think that would be a difficult question.
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2009.925,2011.943,Was it irrelevant question at the time?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2011.943,2033.592,"I do not think so because at the time of this treaty, these Indians did fish commercially and the record when the case was here before statement of an anthropologist to the effect that these Indians were supplying the Hudson Bay Company with their salmon and steelhead at the time of this treaty"
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2033.592,2035.441,Which they caught with nets?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2035.441,2036.485,Which they caught with nets.
1973.72-481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2040.927,2042.486,With a gill net?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2042.486,2046.626,Yes sir.
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2419.387,2423.474,"The State Supreme Court have done that we affirm, this Court affirms?"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2423.474,2424.228,"That is correct, that is correct."
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2424.228,2426.914,"We did not remand it to the State Supreme Court, we affirmed --"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2426.914,2437.025,You affirmed and remanded for a trial on the merits on the question of whether the regulations were necessary for a conservation and not discriminate against the Indians.
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2514.305,2515.885,And that is for salmon and that is not before here?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2515.885,2520.307,"That is for salmon, it is not before the Court but it does indicate that --"
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2520.307,2520.462,The Department of Fisheries changed its mind?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2520.462,2525.387,That net fishing can properly be manage in that river.
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2525.387,2526.373,"Well, at least for salmon."
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2526.373,2527.313,At least for salmon.
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2527.313,2527.791,Yes.
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2527.791,2542.226,There at least a dozen statements in the record that there is no significant difference in the management of nets and so forth or salmon or steelhead that steelhead very much like salmon in all their habits.
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2544.897,2548.653,"The population, the size of population might be quite different in any other stream?"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2548.653,2549.014,"That is right, that is right."
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2549.014,2549.439,Between the two species?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2549.439,2551.124,That is right.
1973.72-481,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2558.285,2564.685,"Mr. Sachse, are you asking us to make a review of State Court's findings on facts?"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2564.685,2564.916,No.
1973.72-481,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2575.551,2582.59,"Well, what test do we apply here when the Supreme Court of Washington has reversed on a factual ground the Superior --"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2582.59,2584.796,They haven’t reversed on factual ground.
1973.72-481,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2589.808,2600.514,"Well, if it’s a misunderstanding of the law, why is it necessary for you to get into all the testimony below as to whether, you know, the milling and that sort of thing if it is strictly a point of law?"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2600.514,2610.364,"Well, I just want the Court to understand that we are not proposing something that it is detrimental to the fish in that area or that has to do with conservation."
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2620.852,2624.413,(Inaudible) to what they just did for one year?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2624.413,2643.136,"No I am not because the Supreme Court of the State of Washington set up a standard that has assured that every year since then, that the Indian fishing will also be prohibited and that has occurred in each year since then and -- let me show you this language."
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2643.136,2657.561,"(Voice overlap) that they set up indicated, I hope to standard, they have set up for future years would be based on what is necessary of conservation."
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2663.097,2663.938,Let me give you two.
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2675.371,2677.14,"And we are talking about steelhead, are we not?"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2677.14,2679.422,"Steelheads, steelheads, I’m talking only about steelheads."
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2679.422,2680.289,"Exclusively, are we not?"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2680.289,2681.216,Yes.
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2681.216,2681.762,I thought so.
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2681.762,2682.292,Steelhead.
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2682.292,2683.762,At least that is what you are talking about?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2683.762,2687.365,That is what I am talking about.
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2708.372,2710.53,Such as a commercial fishery?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2710.53,2710.904,Sir?
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2710.904,2713.022,Such as a commercial fishery?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2713.022,2717.572,As a commercial fishery or fishery for their own?
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2765.003,2766.514,"Now, where do you find that language?"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2779.961,2798.149,I think I have the citation to it in my brief.
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2800.146,2806.069,"Alright, 573, well this is the same patronation here."
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2817.812,2822.597,"It is finding -- it is point number four page 573, it is in this –"
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2822.597,2824.825,I see it now.
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2863.854,2867.289,That is the holding in the case.
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2867.289,2869.188,That is it.
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2869.188,2892.508,"That is the holding of the Supreme Court of State of Washington in this case, but the Supreme Court clearly established, the Supreme Court in the State of Washington clearly established a priority for sports fishermen in deciding whether an Indian fishery can be allowed in the Puyallup River and they have established that priority in section four of the --"
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2892.508,2895.637,"You think, it’s all and it’s all there, that is what you are quarreling about?"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2895.637,2908.487,"That is what we are quarreling about and we are also, I think you can see why we are quarreling about it because the Department of Game of the State of Washington still contests the right of the Indians to have any fishery there --"
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2908.487,2924.656,When you concede -- you do not attack the finding that if you take into consideration a number of fish that are caught in the sporting business that to allow commercial fishery will endanger the run.
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2935.96,2937.381,I do not know about that.
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.824,2942.54,That is what the court found --
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2942.54,2946.288,"As the matter of fact, as a fact."
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2946.288,2948.341,"Well, the court found that --"
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2948.341,2951.275,As a fact and let us assume you accept that.
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2963.326,2964.378,That is correct.
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2986.503,2992.677,And that the treaty makes it incumbent upon the state to cut down the volume of sport fishery.
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2992.677,2993.195,That is correct.
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2993.195,2996.237,"So long as the fact remains as they are, is that it?"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,2996.237,3005.21,"That is right, that they can’t take the entire harvestable fishery here and devote it entirely to a sports fishery --"
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3005.21,3006.998,And then say there’s not enough left over --
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3006.998,3008.968,(Voice overlap) who fish here?
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3008.968,3009.945,Right.
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3009.945,3018.12,"I suppose you would concede that Washington could if we agreed with you, cease putting steelhead in the river?"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3018.12,3019.836,I have no quarrel with that at all.
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3040.711,3060.738,Then I suppose Mr. Sachse that what would be -- what is obvious necessary to conserve conservation or to conserve the runs might be considerately be different than what's necessary when the fish is putting in 61% of the fish that are caught?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3060.738,3080.146,"To this extent that it makes the larger run, it makes the larger harvestable amount and to take that harvest full amount and give a preference to sports fisherman for that harvest amount in an area where the Indians have traditionally fished and where they relied on fishing; part of their life (voice overlap)"
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3080.146,3087.164,Is there anything in the record to indicate what size of a commercial fishery the Indians are talking about or desire to conduct?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3087.164,3096.597,"Not -- there is nothing in -- as to second part, desire to conduct, there is evidence as to a few years when the Indian owned salmon."
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3098.464,3098.895,Have they ever had a --
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3098.895,3104.672,There is no evidence as to size of commercial fishery on --
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3104.672,3107.627,They never had a commercial steelhead fishery you say?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3107.627,3112.021,As far as I know they fished steelhead mainly for their own sustenance and there is no --
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3112.021,3115.491,There has never been a commercial steelhead fisheries?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3115.491,3126.892,"No I cannot say that because there are on the -- when all of the reservation grants since there is a commercial steelhead fishery and sports fishery, they are conducted together by the trial --"
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3126.892,3138.048,"Well, in the hearing of the -- in order to find that the Indians couldn’t give up to run a sport fishery, there must have been some evidence put in by the Indians as to what kind of a sport fishery --"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3138.048,3139.078,Well --
1973.72-481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3139.078,3140.774,-- commercial fishery they were talking about?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3140.774,3148.364,Let me say this that the Indians traditional and to this day do not make much of a distinction between steelhead and salmon.
1973.72-481,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3226.584,3230.276,"You do not claim any discrimination against the Indians here, do you?"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3230.276,3233.458,I claim a discrimination against their treaty rights.
1973.72-481,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3233.458,3233.66,Well --
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3233.66,3235.333,"(Voice overlap) treaty rights, denial of their treaty rights?"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3235.333,3236.499,A denial of their treaty rights.
1973.72-481,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3236.499,3237.779,But the denial of their treaty rights --
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3237.779,3239.66,But there is a discrimination too.
1973.72-481,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3276.593,3284.2,"But it is not as if the State of Washington were saying to a white man that you can fish commercially, but the Indians can't."
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3286.475,3287.495,It's like this.
1973.72-481,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3314.761,3319.479,"But it is not just the place, it is a manner of fishing that has been prohibited, isn’t it?"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3319.479,3320.372,That is correct.
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3337.388,3338.534,May I?
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3344.334,3345.437,"Correct, two petitions."
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3345.437,3369.336,"And your brothers in the other side I gather say that the, you tell me if I am wrong because I am far from sure that I do understand this that, but the Game Commission of the State of Washington says that the Washington Supreme Court was Department of Game of the State of Washington says that the Washington Supreme Court was just wrong in basic principle and that Judge Hayle is dissenting opinion was basically correct."
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3370.255,3372.938,Yes sir.
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3372.938,3399.539,"You say, you say on the other hand that the Supreme Court of Washington was basically correct, but that they erred in giving sole priority to game fishing and in their approach that if and only if they were enough left over after the game fisherman got all the fish they wanted, only then could the Indians do any commercial fishing and that was wrong, that was the only thing that was wrong about that opinion?"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3399.539,3401.334,That is exactly correct.
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3411.108,3416.874,"But their only holding was with respect to 1970, wasn’t it?"
1973.72-481,1,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3416.874,3418.146,The holding was with respect to 1979 (Voice Overlap).
1973.72-481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3418.146,3425.469,But you said they applied the wrong test (Voice Overlap) all right.
1973.72-481,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3425.469,3427.811,Thank you Mr. Sachse.
1973.72-481,2,29731,joseph_l_coniff_jr,,3431.022,3434.834,"Thank you Your Honor, (Inaudible) Mr. Chief Justice."

1973.72-481,2,29731,joseph_l_coniff_jr,,3464.455,3466.882,"No, I am merely advising the Court that that is a fact."
1973.72-481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3469.487,3475.968,"Well, what you are saying it is the law that the steelhead maybe only taken by line, that is not a fact, that is a law?"
1973.72-481,2,29731,joseph_l_coniff_jr,,3475.968,3481.52,"Okay, in the past up until now, that’s where it has occurred."
1973.72-481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3506.608,3509.284,"You think Judge Hayle's dissenting opinion was correct, is that right?"
1973.72-481,2,29731,joseph_l_coniff_jr,,3509.284,3513.597,"Yes, that is correct and I agree with the statements made by counsel the way the issues are delineated before the Court."
1973.72-481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3513.597,3514.823,"Right, okay."
1973.72-481,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3514.823,3518.459,Well what did Supreme Court say?
1973.72-481,2,29731,joseph_l_coniff_jr,,3518.459,3520.841,I do not believe that -- they are okay.
1973.72-481,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3534.539,3540.143,Even though they never do that exhaustively (Inaudible)
1973.72-481,2,29731,joseph_l_coniff_jr,,3540.143,3541.221,"I am sorry, I do not understand you."

1973.72-481,2,29731,joseph_l_coniff_jr,,3545.551,3548.143,The Department of Fisheries has not the Department of Game.
1973.72-481,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3548.143,3550.093,Have they set special season?
1973.72-481,2,29731,joseph_l_coniff_jr,,3550.093,3552.525,"Yes, they have in a number of fishes."
1973.72-481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3552.525,3552.929,Not the steelhead?
1973.72-481,2,29731,joseph_l_coniff_jr,,3552.929,3555.413,Not the steelheads.
1973.72-481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3561.897,3561.973,Right.
1973.72-481,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3561.973,3565.264,And how about (Inaudible)
1973.72-481,2,29731,joseph_l_coniff_jr,,3565.264,3574.605,"With respect to steelhead it had imposed an additional burden upon the Washington Department of Game in that, it has to demonstrate annually that it is quote --"
1973.72-481,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3574.605,3576.065,You don’t have to do that every year?
1973.72-481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3576.065,3579.076,You succeeded in carrying that burden every year beginning 1970?
1973.72-481,2,29731,joseph_l_coniff_jr,,3579.076,3582.796,Under all series of Court challenges and that leads me to the final point I would like to leave --
1973.72-481,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3582.796,3591.235,(Inaudible) is because you have to say that you must satisfy the sports issue?
1973.72-481,2,29731,joseph_l_coniff_jr,,3591.235,3600.035,"Under the language of opinion that it indicates that the sport fishery, being a very efficient fishery, broken line is opposed to a net would be satisfying."
1973.72-481,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3650.482,3651.283,Thank you gentlemen.
