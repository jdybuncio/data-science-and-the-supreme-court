1971.70-5041,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,213.073,218.054,"In other words, you want to defend this with the evidence of the state witnesses at the first trial?"

1971.70-5041,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,218.341,222.04,And cross examine if they testified against the second trial?
1971.70-5041,0,38745,robert_g_bowers,,222.04,229.78,"Yes sir, both for that and for investigative purposes prior to the second trial."
1971.70-5041,1,18768,christine_y_denson,,1146.706,1149.613,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5041,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1381.872,1386.364,"Did Captain Brucher, the key prosecution witness?"
1971.70-5041,1,18768,christine_y_denson,,1386.364,1389.547,"Your Honor I would say no, I would not say he was."
1971.70-5041,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1389.547,1393.33,"He testified as to the defendant’s confession, did he not?"
1971.70-5041,1,18768,christine_y_denson,,1393.33,1407.629,"He testified as to defendant’s confession the first time then after that he got on who was present the second time the defendant repeated his statement in front of Brucher, Afobest, the girlfriend and officer Dody."
1971.70-5041,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1425.439,1427.721,There was no eye witness testimony right there?
1971.70-5041,1,18768,christine_y_denson,,1427.721,1441.865,"Yes, Afobest herself, the girlfriend who was present, testified and the discrepancy between what he had to say and what part of the confession of the defendant would be or was a difference in who struck the blow with a knife."
1971.70-5041,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1449.346,1451.707,I thought it was a frying pan (Inaudible)
1971.70-5041,1,18768,christine_y_denson,,1451.707,1453.778,It was the frying pan that killed the deceased.
1971.70-5041,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1459.242,1462.045,Is it T.M. Brucher or P.H. Brucher?
1971.70-5041,1,18768,christine_y_denson,,1462.045,1463.16,I do not recall from the record.
1971.70-5041,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1463.207,1469.535,On page 30 it is called P.H. Brucher and that is the witnesses has called here (Inaudible)
1971.70-5041,1,18768,christine_y_denson,,1469.535,1475.755,I believe it is T.M. I talked to Captain Brucher yesterday about the matter.
1971.70-5041,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1588.182,1591.463,How many mistrials you had in the last year?
1971.70-5041,1,18768,christine_y_denson,,1591.463,1591.809,Yes.
1971.70-5041,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1592.783,1594.695,About two or three?
1971.70-5041,1,18768,christine_y_denson,,1594.695,1596.336,"Your Honor, I have no idea."
1971.70-5041,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1597.513,1600.552,"So you really do not know how much of a burden it will be there, do you?"
1971.70-5041,1,18768,christine_y_denson,,1600.552,1601.69,"No we do not, but we think that this --"
1971.70-5041,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1601.69,1605.232,"I am not going to dispute what you say, but you have cited the burden on the --"
1971.70-5041,1,18768,christine_y_denson,,1605.232,1614.084,"Well, Your Honor, far from those that we have now, we are afraid that this would give them an additional reason to make a mistrial."
1971.70-5041,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1630.687,1637.527,I am trying to suggest -- I wonder why you need all that additional weight on this transcript thing?
1971.70-5041,1,18768,christine_y_denson,,1637.527,1640.775,"Well, I do not think anyone knows Your Honor, certainly I do not."
1971.70-5041,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1678.97,1687.718,As I recall it your appellate Courts said that there has been no showing of discrepancies or needs for the transcript in the case?
1971.70-5041,1,18768,christine_y_denson,,1687.718,1687.892,No.
1971.70-5041,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.51,1719.31,"Well, did they not say that there had not been any showing that there were discrepancies in the testimony?"
1971.70-5041,1,18768,christine_y_denson,,1719.31,1729.027,I believe judge Mao did discuss since I urged to him as I urge to this Court today that the point at which they were alleged discrepancies which fill and they attended on minor.
1971.70-5041,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.027,1733.47,"Was that important for the trial, at the second now?"
1971.70-5041,1,18768,christine_y_denson,,1733.47,1733.664,Yes.
1971.70-5041,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1737.364,1743.104,"Did it include this ground, it must have?"
1971.70-5041,1,18768,christine_y_denson,,1743.104,1746.05,I think that you (Inaudible) as available.
1971.70-5041,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1746.05,1752.194,"And I suppose after trial, he had thought there were discrepancies in his testimony after trial."
1971.70-5041,1,18768,christine_y_denson,,1762.484,1763.589,"Well, yes Your Honor."
1971.70-5041,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1839.976,1841.377,"Thank you, Mrs. Damson."
1971.70-5041,2,38745,robert_g_bowers,,1843.318,1848.946,"Yes, I would make just one very, rather short comment."
