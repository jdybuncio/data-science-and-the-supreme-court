1976.76-156,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.736,"We will hear arguments next in 76-156, Vendo Company against Lektro-Vend Corporation."
1976.76-156,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,36.303,41.41,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.76-156,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,175.805,179.466,It was significant that they withdrew it without prejudice.
1976.76-156,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,179.466,214.863,"I do not think so Your Honor, certainly I could have no effect on the either of the Section 2283 question which we are dealing with today, or comity and federalism questions, because obviously any litigant cannot determine for himself by removing a defense or client without prejudice that whether that shall affect the application of principles of comity and federalism."
1976.76-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,248.664,252.533,"But Mr. Pollock, it was then in the Federal Court all this period, wasn?t it?"
1976.76-156,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,257.468,263.274,"Yes, in a treble damage action which is still pending and which indeed will be going to trial."
1976.76-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,263.274,270.997,"Which was more or less set on the backburners, phrase we used to use, while a state preceding was completed."
1976.76-156,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,270.997,278.778,"It was set on the backburner over the objection of my client, Vendo."
1976.76-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,375.645,376.972,You will rely and this is the waiver.
1976.76-156,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,383.014,392.794,"Mr. Justice Stevens we are not arguing waiver, for example we are not contending that the federal plaintiffs are barred from proceeding with their treble damage action."
1976.76-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,392.794,396.576,"You are really just relying on the anti-injunction statute, as I understand it."
1976.76-156,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,396.576,408.808,"I relied on the anti-injunction statute, and in addition Your Honor, the principles of comity and federalism in this context where you have a final state judgment."
1976.76-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,408.808,416.486,"But what I am suggesting is the issues would be exactly the same if the problem arose ten years ago instead of today, the legal issues."
1976.76-156,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,416.486,455.779,"With respect to Section 2283, I think that is correct, but the additional issue as presented in our petition relating to the application of fundamental principles of federal state relations, are effected very substantially by the fact that here you have State Court defenders who has specifically raised the federal defense, and then went all the way up to the Illinois Appellate Court insisting that they have the right to have the State Court determine that issue."
1976.76-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,481.243,483.784,They then decided whether to try those issues in the Federal Court.
1976.76-156,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,483.784,493.37,"That is right, and withdrew the federal defense and for the next four years, the last four years of this marathon, tenure Illinois proceeding."
1976.76-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,543.185,548.899,I do not think they will be seeking any rehearing or appeal of any state issue decided in the state proceeding.
1976.76-156,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,556.461,563.383,"Yes, it is Your Honor, in the sense that what they have done is to nullify --"
1976.76-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,563.383,564.495,"The total result, I understand that."
1976.76-156,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,564.495,582.049,"The total result, and not only to nullify the state judgment, not only to nullify the pending state proceedings in the Illinois Trial Court, supplementary proceedings, which have been initiated before the motion for injunction was filed to enforce the judgment."
1976.76-156,1,18077,barnabas_f_sears,,1834.508,1840.391,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.76-156,2,22954,earl_e_pollock,,3775.443,3777.513,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
