1985.84-1580,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.17,We will hear arguments next in United States against Inadi.
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,53.551,76.047,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question before the Court today is whether the Federal Rules of Evidence are unconstitutional insofar as they permit the introduction in evidence in a criminal trial of co-conspirator declarations without requiring the prosecution to produce the declare or to demonstrate his unavailability."
1985.84-1580,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,321.724,325.378,"I am curious, Mr. Frey."
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,363.686,367.455,I am not sure that I am aware of what you are referring to.
1985.84-1580,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,407.596,414.536,--Would it depend in part on how strictly one has to prove unavailability?
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,414.536,416.738,That would be only a small part of the problem.
1985.84-1580,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,472.188,486.698,"You say in effect that if the declaration of an adverse party can be admitted against in open court, the declaration of an adverse party can be admitted on the same principal?"
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,486.698,504.66,"That is a part of the rationale for the co-conspirator declaration, and we would certainly say that, but I think what we are saying is broader in this immediate connection, which is that it was never intended for the confrontation clause to concern itself with most kinds of hearsay."
1985.84-1580,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,702.023,719.067,"Does it make any difference at all that the rule treats co-conspirator statements as exempt from being hearsay, and the other rules treat exceptions to the hearsay rule?"
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,719.067,734.827,"In our opinion it makes absolutely no difference, because it is still a judgment of the legal community developed over time that it is better for the jury to have than not to have this evidence, and it is a judgment--"
1985.84-1580,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,734.827,743.366,Is the exemption in the case of co-conspirator evidence based on inherent reliability of that evidence?
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,743.366,747.068,"--Well, we have a long footnote in our reply brief that addresses that question."
1985.84-1580,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,795.965,799.184,"Plus the fact that they are against interest, against their--"
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,799.184,810.889,"--They are against interest, but of course we don't know... my colleague here will tell you that agency is purely the rationale and not reliability."
1985.84-1580,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1106.176,1121.722,"--Is it your understanding of respondent's position that if Lazaro had been available, the U.S. Attorney would have had to call him to the stand and put the declaration to him in kind of a cross examination?"
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1121.722,1146.92,"My understanding of respondent's position, and counsel may be able to testify to that better than I could since she was counsel at trial, but I read Page 18 of the joint appendix, which is where this discussion is held, to mean that if we could produce Lazaro, we could not use these conversations at all."
1985.84-1580,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1146.92,1150.455,You would then have to just treat him as a normal witness?
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1150.455,1155.359,"We would have to put him on the stand or not put him on the stand, but we couldn't use his extrajudicial declaration."
1985.84-1580,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1157.478,1159.828,You might try to impeach him.
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1159.828,1164.815,"We might try to impeach him, and then it would be a question of whether it could come in as substantive evidence."
1985.84-1580,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1164.815,1166.251,"Sure, you have to ask him first."
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1166.251,1171.486,"I think, Justice Rehnquist's question does reach an important point."
1985.84-1580,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1185.712,1186.545,"Mr. Frey, there is a third one."
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1189.414,1190.449,I suppose that is possible.
1985.84-1580,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1192.651,1193.751,That is what I mean.
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1193.751,1197.853,"Oh, I understand that the prosecution could call him if it wished to call him."
1985.84-1580,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1214.248,1218.783,"If they hadn't been able to use his testimony, they might have wanted to call him?"
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1218.783,1225.37,"I am sure that if either party had been confident that the testimony would have been helpful, they would have called him as a witness."
1985.84-1580,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1347.399,1359.64,"--On the other hand, in this instance, you have the government having the benefit of capable testimony without cross examination."
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1359.64,1365.111,"Well, that was defendant's choice, not to call Lazaro and have him examined."
1985.84-1580,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1365.111,1365.578,Well--
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1365.578,1366.546,We have the benefit of--
1985.84-1580,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1366.546,1370.764,--Did defendant make the motion to put this evidence in?
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1370.764,1371.964,"--No, we put the evidence in."
1985.84-1580,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1371.964,1374.116,"Well, that is who did it."
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1376.151,1377.435,"Well, we put the evidence--"
1985.84-1580,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1377.435,1387.143,"You put in evidence which was favorable to you, and unable to have it cross examined by the other side."
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1387.143,1401.301,"--I don't agree that the other side could not... if... I am not sure what the purpose of cross... they could cross examine the witness through whom we put on the evidence, that is, to determine whether the declaration was made and what the circumstances of it were."
1985.84-1580,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1418.512,1423.916,Wouldn't you prefer to have evidence for your side not cross examined?
1985.84-1580,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1423.916,1430.32,"Well, that depends on how good the cross examiner is, I suppose."
1985.84-1580,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1599.946,1602.815,Ms. Maguigan.
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,1602.815,1617.724,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the government's argument to you this afternoon, like the brief and reply brief which they submitted, overlooks a crucial fact."
1985.84-1580,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1679.015,1682.433,Would you care to suggest what your cross examination would have been?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,1682.433,1710.686,"At a minimum, Mr. Chief Justice, it would have been to highlight the fact that in the tape recorded conversations, John Lazaro made representations of fact which were belied by evidence in the government's own case by the witnesses they did elect to call, and I would submit to you that one of the reasons the government was interested in insulating Mr. Lazaro from cross examination was, they wanted those assertions of fact to go untested by cross examination."
1985.84-1580,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1710.686,1714.338,"Well, I guess you could have called him on cross examination as a witness."
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,1714.338,1721.994,"It would not, Justice, have cured the harm to us from the denial of confrontation in their case."
1985.84-1580,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1722.944,1724.444,I don't think I follow that.
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,1724.444,1748.561,"--Well, it is because the reason, the reason that it is so important that a person accused of crime get to cross examine the government's witness is, one, that it is clear he is in fact the government's witness, and two, it is in the context of his being the government's witness that he is compelled to stand face to face with the jury, compelled to answer questions."
1985.84-1580,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1748.561,1757.25,"Don't you think that even if the government had called him, they could have called him and put him under cross examination as an adverse witness?"
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,1757.25,1761.552,"There is nothing in the record to suggest that he was in fact adverse to them, Your Honor."
1985.84-1580,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1763.337,1773.777,"Well, isn't a co-conspirator inherently an adverse witness and always subject to being called, it at all, on cross examination by the state?"
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,1773.777,1787.019,"I would say no, not always, because very often, as in this case, the two co-conspirators whom the government did elect to use and subject to cross examination were not called as adverse witnesses, were not examined as on cross examination."
1985.84-1580,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1787.019,1789.385,"Well, that doesn't mean they might not have been."
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,1789.385,1789.885,That doesn't mean they couldn't be.
1985.84-1580,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1789.885,1790.504,Right.
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,1790.504,1799.427,"I think really what it boils down to in a way, Your Honor, is that the government and the respondent agree on one thing."
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1813.35,1823.372,"Well, Ms. Maguigan, just how would this have proceeded in the trial court if the government had produced Lazaro if that's his name?"
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,1831.645,1838.231,"The recordings, sir, would have gone in in our view of 801 as an evidentiary matter whether he was present or not."
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1845.319,1848.687,They would have gone in whether he was present or not?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,1848.687,1863.297,"--If they had as a confrontation clause analysis... from the point of view of the confrontation clause, the issue is whether the government is excused by the necessities of the case from producing him for cross examination, but as a matter of evidentiary law--"
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.297,1874.586,"Well, on your view of what the law ought to be... I take it you are supporting the opinion of the Third Circuit... what if the government in this case had said here at counsel table is Mr. Lazaro."
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,1883.092,1888.479,"--In my view, sir, that would not have been sufficient, but it is important to note that they did not even that minimum--"
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1888.479,1891.031,"Well, why would it not have been sufficient?"
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,1891.031,1918.714,"--Because if they force us to put him on in our case, assuming they in fact bring him to the courtroom and say, we are not going to use him, here he is, which they didn't do, but assuming that, the difficulty is, if we put him on in our case, we are seen especially in a conspiracy trial as somehow validating the government's allegation, and it is only an allegation, that the ultimate jury question has been resolved."
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1922.316,1930.172,"So what does happen under your hypothesis if the government says here is Mr. Lazaro and we offer Exhibits A, B, and C?"
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,1935.726,1936.96,I don't think I understand your question.
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1936.96,1944.249,"Well, so they bring Mr. Lazaro into court and say, here he is, and now they still want to offer the cassettes in evidence."
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,1948.8,1951.419,What I say from the point of view of the confrontation clause is--
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1951.419,1954.271,"Well, I mean... can you answer my question?"
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,1954.271,1960.458,"--I am afraid I can't, because I don't know whether you are asking me to assume that they simply have him at the table but they don't call him."
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1961.158,1961.877,They have him at the table.
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,1967.045,1976.385,"It is my view, sir, that unless they put him on in their case as a witness and subject to cross during their case, they cannot use the tape recordings."
1985.84-1580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2005.054,2008.089,"Well, suppose he is there, they get him there, and they put him on the stand."
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2016.945,2017.962,--Not at all.
1985.84-1580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2018.628,2020.414,"How would they proceed, then?"
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2023.016,2028.068,"They could, for instance, say what is your name, have you listened to these tapes, are you the John Lazaro speaking on these tapes?"
1985.84-1580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2031.12,2032.388,If he says yes?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2032.388,2035.074,"Well, they can also impeach him if he says no."
1985.84-1580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2035.074,2036.007,What are you going to do?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2036.007,2037.424,Then I am going to cross examine him.
1985.84-1580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2037.424,2038.192,About what?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2038.192,2051.533,"About the fact that what he says on the tapes is inconsistent with what live witnesses say, about the fact that there are internal inconsistencies between his recitations of past historical fact offered for the truth of the matter asserted."
1985.84-1580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.837,2069.895,"I suppose you would much rather have the government call him, but this evidence came in, so no way didn't you call him on your side of the case?"
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2072.68,2074.699,"Well, there is a difficulty with having him--"
1985.84-1580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2074.699,2075.349,Apparently not.
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2075.349,2079.769,"--He wasn't there when the government rested, but there is a difficulty."
1985.84-1580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.219,2081.953,You didn't try to get him either.
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2081.953,2082.788,"--No, we didn't."
1985.84-1580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2086.439,2089.141,And then that his car had broken down.
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2089.141,2094.362,"Yes, then that his car had broken down, although the government never asked for a bench warrant, never asked for a recess."
1985.84-1580,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2103.834,2105.836,What prevented you from asking for a bench warrant?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2105.836,2107.653,--It wasn't our subpoena.
1985.84-1580,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2115.542,2119.411,Are you suggesting that you could not ask for it?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2119.411,2120.361,It is not the practice.
1985.84-1580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2123.465,2125.132,But you could get a subpoena.
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2125.132,2126.999,"Well, we could have gotten a subpoena."
1985.84-1580,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2154.415,2157.284,And they had no responsibility for him.
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2157.284,2159.152,"--That's right, they took no responsibility for him."
1985.84-1580,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2165.473,2178.399,"What would they ask him as Justice White has put the question to you, put him on the stand and say, are you this man by name, and did you have some telephone conversations with A, B, and C, and then drop it right there?"
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2178.399,2179.382,That is up to them.
1985.84-1580,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2179.382,2180.582,Well--
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2180.582,2182.017,"They could do that, yes."
1985.84-1580,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2182.017,2182.434,--All right.
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2185.303,2185.886,It would be the--
1985.84-1580,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2185.886,2188.421,"You would be confined to that, wouldn't you?"
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2188.421,2195.509,"--I would be confined in my view, given that they made him a witness through the tapes to the tapes and to anything he says on his direct testimony."
1985.84-1580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.063,2208.084,"You could certainly ask him if what he said was true, what he said on the tapes was true."
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2208.084,2208.835,Certainly.
1985.84-1580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2208.835,2211.703,That is what you would try to find out.
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2211.703,2212.903,That's right.
1985.84-1580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2269.44,2271.092,My I ask one question?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2297.492,2298.492,--No.
1985.84-1580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2298.492,2300.428,That is what most of these usually are--
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2300.428,2301.661,Many of them are.
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2384.312,2401.257,"--But that is quite consistent with the general rule on hearsay, isn't it, that the declarations of an adverse party can be offered on the theory that it is rather likely that an adverse party isn't going to help himself unnecessarily, or rather that he is not going to hurt himself unnecessarily."
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2401.257,2405.475,"That certainly is the fiction, and as a matter of the law of evidence, that is true."
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2419.919,2422.602,Do you say it is true as a matter of law of evidence.
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2425.823,2432.56,"--What I mean, sir, is, as an issue under the rules of evidence, that is the reason why it is not barred."
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2438.13,2445.717,Isn't the confrontation clause part of the body of rules of evidence?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2445.717,2447.069,They are not the same.
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2471.952,2475.804,Isn't that mostly in cases of prior recorded testimony?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2475.804,2483.992,"Well, it is true that many of those cases are prior recorded testimony and dying declarations cases, but this Court has considered that issue in other contexts."
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2483.992,2493.431,Has it ever held that something that wasn't prior recorded testimony couldn't come in because of the confrontation clause even though it was acceptable under the rules of evidence?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2493.431,2496.55,"Yes, confessions, declarations against interest, declarations against--"
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2496.55,2498.519,"Well, confessions in a criminal case?"
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2498.519,2499.704,--Yes.
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2499.704,2500.254,Anything else?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2500.254,2501.587,"For instance, in Douglas."
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2546.166,2548.185,Dutton was a plurality opinion.
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2548.185,2563.361,"--It was, but both the plurality and the concurring authors concluded that in Dutton there was a confrontation clause issue, and that it would be resolved by assessing the utility of trial confrontations."
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2575.502,2579.573,"No, but the ultimate holding in Dutton was that the evidence had been properly admitted."
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2579.573,2584.958,Because it was held to have been of peripheral significance at most and not crucial and devastating.
1985.84-1580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2618.531,2621.583,May I ask the other question along the line I did a moment ago?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2638.093,2640.776,We referred to the fact that there were historical narratives of past fact.
1985.84-1580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2644.08,2648.049,--That is really a critical part of your argument this afternoon.
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2651.917,2654.286,"Yes, Oh, absolutely, we did."
1985.84-1580,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2733.186,2743.594,"Suppose he had come into the courtroom, taken the stand, and taken the Fifth Amendment, refused to answer anything, including his name."
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2746.213,2748.747,"I don't believe I would have been allowed to cross examine, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1580,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2749.815,2750.298,I beg your pardon?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2750.298,2755.182,"He would have been unavailable if he had come in and taken the Fifth, assuming the judge sustained his claim of the Fifth."
1985.84-1580,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2756.132,2763.605,"You don't mean that you were barred, you would be barred from cross examining him, to test his Fifth Amendment claim, for example."
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2763.605,2764.805,--I could test his Fifth Amendment claim.
1985.84-1580,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2767.057,2768.009,Is that all?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2769.375,2773.996,"If he persists in his assertion of the Fifth and the judge upholds it, I have to live with that."
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2855.631,2879.762,"I thought in your brief you also advanced what is perhaps a little narrower around than you are advancing now, that even if the government is right that the actual holdings of these prior cases have been generally prior recorded testimony, co-conspirator declarations should be analyzed the same way as prior recorded testimony, and you don't have to call into question any of the other exceptions to the hearsay rule under the confrontation clause."
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2879.762,2880.346,That is right.
1985.84-1580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2927.243,2938.116,"I would suppose you would make the same argument... if there wasn't a confrontation clause, you would be making the same argument about hearsay, that there just shouldn't be an exception to the hearsay rule."
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2938.116,2938.749,"Well, I might."
1985.84-1580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2940.318,2941.484,I would think you would.
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2949.074,2964.083,"No, Justice, we are not, and what is made clear in the advisory committee notes and in the decisions of this Court is that the hearsay rules do not require admission of those statements that are exceptions."
1985.84-1580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2990.151,2995.471,But at least under the hearsay rules you never had to produce the man to get--
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,2995.471,2998.172,To this day under the hearsay rules.
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3012.766,3016.801,"--Except they really stem from the same general principles, don't they?"
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,3016.801,3018.836,"With regard to hearsay, yes, sir."
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3045.737,3054.759,"Would you challenge the basis for admitting, say, a defendant's out of court statements against him?"
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,3054.759,3055.493,No.
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3055.493,3058.128,You say those are sufficiently reliable or--
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,3058.128,3059.578,Those are the same party.
1985.84-1580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3061.247,3063.032,--How about the defendant's agent?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,3063.032,3070.636,"The defendant's agent is a slightly different situation when you have a clear agency as a matter of fact, a literal agency."
1985.84-1580,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3099.038,3104.007,Aren't co-conspirators generally regarded as agents of each other?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,3104.007,3105.442,"That is the fiction, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1580,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3105.442,3106.109,Fiction?
1985.84-1580,1,27641,holly_maguigan,,3106.109,3110.263,"Yes, sir, and it is reflected in the advisory committee notes and in Circuit Court opinions."
1985.84-1580,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3188.68,3190.298,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Frey?"
1985.84-1580,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3192.698,3193.6,"Yes, I do."
1985.84-1580,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3193.6,3197.619,"Mr. Frey, before you get started, I want to try to see how far we can go."
1985.84-1580,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3216.699,3217.965,I am not sure.
1985.84-1580,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3226.821,3260.609,"What would happen if you as a prosecutor were given the name of a witness, Lazaro, and it says either that this man is an unmitigated liar and he can't be pinned down to anything, or it says he will go along with any question that anybody asks, and on four different occasions has completely collapsed on cross examination, and you had the choice of either putting him on the stand or putting in his statement?"
1985.84-1580,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3264.013,3268.215,But in his statement in any event because his statement has independent evidentiary value.
1985.84-1580,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3281.807,3283.441,But you would use the statement.
1985.84-1580,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3283.441,3288.728,"Absolutely, and the statement has independent value from whatever he might say at trial."
1985.84-1580,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3288.728,3298.251,"Mr. Frey, your argument sounds a lot like that espoused by Justice Harlan in Dutton, which wasn't adopted, of course."
1985.84-1580,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3298.251,3303.571,"Well, my conceptual approach is a lot like it, but not identical to it."
1985.84-1580,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3486.74,3488.04,"Thank you, counsel."
