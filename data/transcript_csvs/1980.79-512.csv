1980.79-512,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.918,We will hear arguments next in Scindia Steam Navigation v. Lauro de los Santos.
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,47.294,52.073,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,85.95,91.526,"Well, another purpose was to get rid of a Sieracki-type cause of action, wasn't it?"
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,91.526,93.4,"--Yes, Your Honor, it was."
1980.79-512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,325.292,334.211,Isn't even simple negligence traditionally outlined in terms of duty and breach of duty owed to a particular person or group of persons?
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,334.211,355.905,"--I think that is... yes, I do think that is very common, and I think that in any ordinary negligence case one must first find the duty based upon some status or relationship which imposes upon the defendant an obligation to look out for another."
1980.79-512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,364.167,365.744,Driving an automobile.
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,365.744,366.088,Yes.
1980.79-512,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,366.088,370.086,"That's not maritime law, though."
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,370.086,370.742,I beg pardon?
1980.79-512,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,370.742,372.727,That's not exactly maritime law.
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,372.727,376.428,"That has not been the traditional maritime law, no, sir."
1980.79-512,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,376.428,380.378,"Well, it is true that a duty could exist to every single member of the public."
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,386.11,389.546,"Well, I think I must agree that such a duty can exist; yes."
1980.79-512,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,389.546,397.418,"Regardless of any special relationship, just there's a duty to every member of the public to not injure that person negligently."
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,397.418,398.903,Yes.
1980.79-512,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,401.12,405.932,"Or with fault, to use the admiralty wording."
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,405.932,414.835,--A duty not to conduct ourselves in a way which carelessly or recklessly endangers those about us; yes.
1980.79-512,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,415.788,426.767,"For example, if you stumble on a piece of grease on the stairway going up to your office, you don't recover the same way as you do if you stumble on a piece of grease on the Queen Mary."
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,427.517,429.187,"I believe that's right, Your Honor."
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,429.187,437.402,"Mr. Staring, what in your view, what was the duty of the vessel owner with regard to the condition of the winch?"
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,442.822,459.035,"If the condition of the winch... in the circumstances of this case, I do not think that the vessel owner had any duty to the longshoreman with respect to the condition of the winch."
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,460.612,469.967,"No duty whatsoever, even if the winch were defective, he knew it was defective, he knew it was dangerous, he knew that people would be working with it."
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,469.967,470.608,"--Ah, now--"
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,470.608,472.857,"And I'm saying, what the duty is, not what the facts show."
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,472.857,473.185,--All right.
1980.79-512,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,483.432,486.742,Not merely knowledge but superior knowledge?
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,486.742,487.726,Superior knowledge.
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,490.787,491.693,Superior to whom?
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,491.693,495.427,--Superior to the stevedore company.
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,495.427,496.582,Supposing they have equal knowledge.
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,500.83,501.627,I think he has none.
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,521.369,524.539,"Well, what is the purpose of the Secretary of Labor's requirement that defects in the winch be reported to the vessel owner?"
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,526.179,532.349,In order that the vessel owner can then make repairs if repairs should be made.
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,532.349,534.02,"Then he has the duty to repair, right?"
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,534.02,537.253,"Well, he doesn't have a duty as such, he has an opportunity."
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,539.362,540.095,No duty?
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,540.095,550.138,"Since the stevedore, if he has obeyed the regulation, has stopped work, it's a question whether the shipowner's duties--"
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,550.138,550.951,Maybe the stevedore hasn't.
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,560.478,565.258,"--The vessel owner then has, I would say, an opportunity to repair it and certainly--"
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,565.258,565.867,"No, but I want to ask about duty."
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,567.209,567.975,--I beg... Your Honor.
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,569.505,573.364,"Well, but if you say he has a duty, then you've got Sieracki right back."
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,573.364,576.018,"--No, I don't believe so."
1980.79-512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,598.322,606.912,What if the shipowner and the employee had equal knowledge?
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,617.268,619.111,No.
1980.79-512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,625.498,626.654,The longshoreman.
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,626.654,635.915,"If the knowledge is equal, then we do not concede that a recovery can be had from the vessel."
1980.79-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.164,654.081,"Let's suppose, when the job starts, they hire the stevedore and the shipowner says, by the way, this winch is acting up a little, but I think if you're really careful with it, it'll be all right."
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,675.993,685.755,"--What has happened, Your Honor, in that case, is that the vessel owner has pointed out a report of, let us say, a winch that operates less than perfectly."
1980.79-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,708.917,717.694,"So you... the short answer is that the extent of his duty is to make known any unsafe things that are known to him, the shipowner, that is?"
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,717.694,718.257,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,718.257,723.395,And that he has no affirmative duty to repair the winch?
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,723.395,731.003,He has no affirmative duty in that circumstance to repair the winch for the benefit of the stevedore and the longshoreman.
1980.79-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,731.003,732.408,Or for the benefit of the longshoreman?
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,732.408,733.049,That's right.
1980.79-512,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,733.049,737.172,"Now, Mr. Staring, where is it in the statute you said supports this interpretation?"
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,737.172,750.635,"The statute that I point to is not in the amendments, Your Honor, but is Section 41 of the Longshoremen's Act, which has been there somewhat more years than the 1972 amendments."
1980.79-512,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,750.635,753.055,This being the duties you read us.
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,755.851,766.769,"Your Honor, the statute is the general direction and the authority for the regulations, and then regulations have been issued under that statute, Your Honor."
1980.79-512,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,766.769,773.22,"And we don't find this in the '72 amendments, we find it in these regulations issued under the older statute?"
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,773.22,773.907,"That's right, Your Honor."
1980.79-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,930.718,946.008,"So in my example to you you would say, is that the stevedore, if he didn't like it, he didn't want to work with it, if his judgment was that the winch was unsafe or that he didn't want to take the risk, that he would just not work."
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,949.585,959.941,"--Oh, he would say, fix it, and he would go on standby and collect his charges for doing nothing until you have."
1980.79-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,962.675,969.109,Do you think that's what the restatement standard means?
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,982.338,984.79,I do urge--
1980.79-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,984.79,987.585,Did you in the Court of Appeals urge that?
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,987.585,989.648,--I did not handle the case in the Court of Appeals.
1980.79-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,989.648,990.865,But was it urged?
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,990.865,993.052,At this... it was urged in the Court of Appeals.
1980.79-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.052,995.583,And do you agree that it's--
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,995.583,998.363,I agree that that would be a good standard to apply.
1980.79-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1000.565,1005.968,"--Well, I'm wondering, because the last part of that standard says, with regard to the landowner,"
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1020.963,1026.633,"--Your Honor, if he should, in many instances that's what--"
1980.79-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1026.633,1029.726,"Well, in this case, for example, all he would have to do is tell them about the--"
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1029.726,1032.568,--If he had known about it in advance.
1980.79-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1033.865,1045.206,"--A fortiori, in this case, if he didn't know about it in advance but suppose the stevedore told him that, gee, you've got a defective crane here, and he just shrugged his shoulders."
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1046.594,1060.65,"--In this case, Your Honor, the stevedore knows it and is asserted to have known it throughout the record and did not stop work, as he was commanded by law to do, and it would do no good to tell him."
1980.79-512,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1073.693,1088.39,"Mr. Staring, incidentally, on the issue of superior knowledge, does the shipowner before he turns ships' equipment over to a stevedoring company, have any duty of inspection of the equipment, to find out if there is anything wrong with it?"
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1088.39,1094.076,"None has been established by law, none is shown in the record of this case."
1980.79-512,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1108.241,1115.958,"Unless he happens to stumble on knowledge of the defect, he has nothing in the way of a duty to say a word to the stevedore about it?"
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1118.034,1120.643,That is generally correct.
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1380.522,1386.676,"May I ask, when you say ""superior knowledge"", superior to whom, to the stevedore or the longshoreman?"
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1386.676,1387.816,Superior to the stevedore.
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1387.816,1390.316,Because the restatement talks about the invitee who's injured.
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1390.316,1394.267,The difficulty about the restatement formulation is this:
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1394.267,1400.656,"I know you're not relying on the restatement, but it seems to me there's quite a difference, whether you look at it from the point of view of the boss or the employee."
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1402.263,1405.418,--I don't just mean superior to the plaintiff.
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1411.619,1414.681,"Crew other than the plaintiff, the man running the winch in this case?"
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1414.681,1415.774,"--All of them, including the plaintiff."
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1415.774,1418.695,What if the plaintiff himself doesn't have any knowledge whatsoever?
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1422.6,1453.43,"The employer... the question of... Mr. Justice Stevens, it seems to us that if you are going to abolish nondelegable duty, it has to be possible to delegate to a contractor as one can under the great body of state land law the responsibility for protecting your employees from dangers of this sort by inspecting, examining, supervising, and stopping them from doing unsafe things."
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.43,1460.866,"I'm sure it's possible if they'd enter into an agreement that the stevedore would assume all risk of liability, he could do that."
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1460.866,1487.729,"But if the shipowner is going to continue then to have a direct duty of care for all these longshore employees exactly as though they were his employees and his seamen, his duty having by this Act been restricted only as it pertains to that person or that corporation called the stevedore, then this change in the law was a very, very hollow change indeed."
1980.79-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1487.729,1493.039,There's a difference between proving negligence and proving under... what was the doctrine before?
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1498.819,1499.647,"There is, Your Honor."
1980.79-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.561,1596.091,Could I ask you just... I should know this.
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1613.928,1619.129,--The defense of assumption of risk is not generally available in maritime law to a shipowner or to anyone else.
1980.79-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.129,1620.112,Or to anyone else?
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1628.859,1629.734,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1629.734,1643.4,And the statute in '72 said that it wanted to go to landbased principles of negligence rather than maritime law?
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1643.4,1644.212,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.212,1645.119,Except for that?
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1645.119,1655.255,"Except that it wants to preserve the elimination of the bar of assumption of risk, and the bar of contributory negligence."
1980.79-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.255,1663.377,And part of the argument here is that the ALI standard really recognizes assumption of risk.
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1663.377,1664.703,That's not my argument.
1980.79-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1664.703,1666.469,I'm sure it isn't.
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1666.469,1675.591,But the argument is made and we think it is fallacious because... for reasons which we have discussed in my brief.
1980.79-512,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1682.556,1684.65,"Mr. Staring, you have only about two left."
1980.79-512,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1684.65,1685.07,--All right.
1980.79-512,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1688.772,1697.831,Mr. Grutz.
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,1697.831,1702.922,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1811.708,1831.825,"Well, Mr. Grutz, if we apply landbased principles of negligence in this area as set out in the restatement or in some other treatise or some other line of cases, do you lose this case?"
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,1831.825,1840.104,"Landbased, Your Honor, is not a term of art."
1980.79-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1868.124,1876.418,"So you say, Congress has in effect given us no guidance and we've simply got to choose from among the various courts of appeals, or--"
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,1876.418,1879.495,"No, I think Congress has given us some guides, Your Honor."
1980.79-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1898.41,1901.346,"--But it doesn't say what the extent of the duty of the shipowner is, though."
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,1901.346,1903.657,It doesn't say what it is but I think that it's--
1980.79-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1903.657,1904.219,That's the argument.
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,1904.219,1905.422,--That's correct.
1980.79-512,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1924.024,1926.79,Is there anything at all in the legislative history which--
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,1926.79,1930.163,"Yes, Your Honor, there is."
1980.79-512,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1967.726,1969.695,--With respect to the duty of the shipowner?
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,1972.881,1973.272,--Yes.
1980.79-512,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1973.272,1974.036,What was that?
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,1974.036,1977.801,I think it was the general maritime law as it applied to negligence actions.
1980.79-512,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1977.801,1979.972,"Well, specifically as to duty?"
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,1979.972,1990.732,"As to duty, it came out of the various cases that were, that wended their way up the court system in those decisions."
1980.79-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1990.732,1991.794,"Well, it must have been before--"
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,1991.794,1992.278,Pardon?
1980.79-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1992.278,1995.949,--Weren't most cases on the seaworthiness basis?
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,1995.949,1999.12,I think most cases were on the seaworthiness basis.
1980.79-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1999.12,2002.416,"Well, where do you get much law about negligence before '72?"
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2002.416,2003.242,"Well, you get it--"
1980.79-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2003.242,2006.929,It was between the shipowner and the longshoremen.
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2006.929,2010.771,--Most of the time it's connected.
1980.79-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2015.378,2017.05,From this Court?
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2017.05,2026.827,"--Well, I think that Pope & Talbot v. Hawn recognizes a duty that--"
1980.79-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2026.827,2031.731,"That was just a refusal to overrule Sieracki, wasn't it?"
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2031.731,2039.055,--But it also recognized the fact that Sieracki did not do away with the negligence action.
1980.79-512,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2039.055,2048.896,"No, except most of the cases are seaworthiness cases, because from the plaintiff's point of view, seaworthiness, unseaworthiness is much easier to prove than negligence."
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2048.896,2049.724,Much easier to prove?
1980.79-512,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2050.302,2053.161,"So you could always go with unseaworthiness, if you were a plaintiff's lawyer."
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2053.161,2053.723,That's correct.
1980.79-512,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2059.72,2072.198,"Well, what I was asking, Mr. Grutz, is there anything in the legislative history that addresses itself specifically to the duty of the shipowner to the longshoreman?"
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2072.198,2073.042,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1980.79-512,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2073.042,2074.119,"Well, what does it say?"
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2074.119,2100.281,It says that the shipowner owes a duty of due care under the circumstances to maintain a safe place to work and to correct dangerous conditions aboard the vessel.
1980.79-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2100.281,2105.451,"Where does one find this in the... is it in that committee report, or?"
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2105.451,2105.842,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2113.791,2116.977,Is it a Joint House-Senate report?
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2116.977,2117.399,"--Yes, yes."
1980.79-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2120.086,2121.553,But it's not in the statute?
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2121.553,2122.944,It is not in the statute.
1980.79-512,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2148.716,2151.121,"Well, what's the previous sentence mean, Mr. Grutz?"
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2151.121,2152.479,And the one before that--
1980.79-512,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2152.479,2159.242,"""Will still be required to exercise the same care as landbased person in providing a safe place to work. """
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2159.242,2159.664,--All right.
1980.79-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2200.038,2209.676,"Well, what would be the difference if the shipowner has an obligation to provide a safe place to work and Sieracki is done away with?"
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2209.676,2212.472,"Well, the difference is, Your Honor, notice."
1980.79-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2257.141,2261.514,And to whom must the notice run?
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2262.295,2263.794,To the shipowner.
1980.79-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2263.794,2272.868,"--Well, on the other side, to the stevedore employer or to the actual longshoreman?"
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2272.868,2278.71,"Oh, the notice as regards contributory negligence or comparative negligence?"
1980.79-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2278.71,2281.382,"Well, the notice of the unsafe condition."
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2281.382,2303.529,"It is my position that the notice would have to run to the individual longshoreman, because he's the one... for instance, in this case... that the district court said, knew and appreciated this particular risk, and subjected himself to it."
1980.79-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2319.225,2326.315,"Well, if the plaintiff knew there was an open and obvious danger, why shouldn't he have been barred?"
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2326.315,2335.219,"As a matter of law, Your Honor, he cannot be barred because the open and obvious danger becomes assumption of the risk."
1980.79-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2335.219,2342.981,"Well, it could just as well be a fellow servant or a failure to submit sufficient proof to the district court."
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2342.981,2399.677,"Your Honor, it seems to me that if there is evidence put on that there was negligence, that there was a failure to remedy the winch, which was an integral part of the ship, and the shipowner reserved the right by regulation and by practice to repair that winch, that to simply say that if a longshoreman recognized some danger, an individual longshoreman recognized some danger, that he as a matter of law cannot recover, is simply to say that he then knows and appreciates a risk, accepts the risk, and then we're into the assumption of risk argument, which Congress in the legislative reports has proscribed."
1980.79-512,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2399.677,2405.814,"Well, I must say, Mr. Grutz, that at page I-10:"
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2429.524,2430.133,Absolutely.
1980.79-512,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2432.319,2437.772,That language that my brother Brennan has read says nothing of liability to anybody else.
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2440.754,2443.456,--But the responsibility to someone else--
1980.79-512,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2443.456,2446.767,"No, the next paragraph illustrates what it--"
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2446.767,2448.141,--It illustrates it perfectly.
1980.79-512,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2448.141,2452.438,--It talks about a longshoreman who slips on an oil spill on a vessel's deck.
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2452.438,2453.86,And it talks about the notice.
1980.79-512,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2453.86,2457.562,That's the difference between unseaworthiness and negligence; yes.
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2457.562,2458.904,So the illustration--
1980.79-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2458.904,2471.384,Why didn't Congress put this in the statute rather than leaving it all to a joint congressional committee report if it was this critical?
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2471.384,2494.734,"--I think Congress did not put it in the statute because they assumed that negligence had a meaning, that the significant meaning of negligence... that there had been a negligence action preserved in the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act ever since its inception... and that it had a meaning which they were willing to accept."
1980.79-512,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2494.734,2500.387,"Well, I don't know why you don't rely on what they said on I-11: ""Under this standard""... that is, the negligence standard..."
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2520.8,2537.31,"I think that they're saying that to resolve these questions, there are going to be trials, there are going to be cases submitted to factfinders to decide whether there was the failure to operate with ordinary care."
1980.79-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2537.31,2552.149,"Well, it sounds like the Committee at least thought that under ordinary landbased law, the injured longshoreman would recover on this oil spill matter."
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2552.149,2552.32,Absolutely.
1980.79-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.32,2556.255,They may have been wrong about what they thought landbased law was.
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2556.255,2556.739,That's right.
1980.79-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2557.27,2557.88,Or thought it was.
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2557.88,2558.474,--That's correct.
1980.79-512,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2636.63,2644.986,"Is this a new form of legislative technique, to draft a skeleton statute and then give us a legal opinion as to what it means?"
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2644.986,2648.515,"I'm not sure, Your Honor."
1980.79-512,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2650.452,2657.59,You've got two or three pages that reads like a legal opinion or a judicial opinion--
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2657.59,2658.122,That's correct.
1980.79-512,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2658.122,2660.729,"--Telling us what... now, who's telling us that?"
1980.79-512,1,30560,james_a_grutz,,2662.712,2671.366,"I think it's an advisor to Congress, a law clerk, perhaps, or a... I don't know."
1980.79-512,2,26020,graydon_s_staring,,3675.292,3676.635,May it please the Court:
1980.79-512,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3779.858,3781.311,May I just interrupt you right there?
1980.79-512,2,26020,graydon_s_staring,,3788.369,3788.713,No.
1980.79-512,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3790.432,3791.774,You don't have to?
1980.79-512,2,26020,graydon_s_staring,,3795.664,3797.303,"Yes, indeed, Your Honor."
1980.79-512,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3798.568,3801.521,Because I sort of had the view you were adopting the restatement position.
1980.79-512,2,26020,graydon_s_staring,,3801.521,3801.881,--No.
1980.79-512,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3942.715,3943.309,"Thank you, gentlemen."
