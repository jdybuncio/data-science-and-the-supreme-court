1972.71-666,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,55.027,"We will hear arguments next in 71-666, United States against Glaxo Group."
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,56.033,59.279,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-666,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,495.191,496.565,"Now, this was in the complaint?"
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,496.565,498.542,"This was in the complaint, Mr. Justice."
1972.71-666,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,498.542,503.169,And why in the complaint did the government challenged the validity of the patent?
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,503.169,510.456,"Well, we didn’t spell out in the compliant but we said that these patents were invalid and the --"
1972.71-666,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,510.456,516.979,This was perhaps an anticipation that they are relying on the patent to justify the restriction or what?
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,516.979,518.616,No they have not relied on the patent.
1972.71-666,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1131.955,1149.617,Would it not fall on Mr. Friedman that the government could bring a civil antitrust suit against any patentee claiming that since his patent was invalid and he was a legal monopolist under the antitrust laws?
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1149.617,1156.696,"As a matter of logic Mr. Justice, certainly and in the Court bellow, we argued this case on alternative theories."
1972.71-666,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1180.711,1182.874,Well they were not an issues in any sense that of the word.
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1190.02,1191.942,They were not an issue only because--
1972.71-666,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1191.942,1193.65,They were not relied upon by the defendants?
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1193.65,1194.946,They were not relied upon by the defendants.
1972.71-666,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1194.946,1198.843,Therefore they were not one of the issues to be determined in the antitrust litigation?
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1198.843,1203.128,"Well, except Mr. Justice that we did make an allegation that the patents were involved."
1972.71-666,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1203.128,1217.719,"Well, as I say, then it would follow, it would seem to me as a matter of logic that you could bring an antitrust suit against any patentee claiming that his patent was invalid and therefore his exercise of the monopoly violated the antitrust laws."
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1217.719,1227.956,"Well, we would not -- the mere fact Mr. Justice that the patent is invalid, would not be enough to establish a violation of the antitrust laws because --"
1972.71-666,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1227.956,1243.375,Well patent confers upon the patentee or its assignee the right to exercise monopolistic rights with respect to the patent for the number of years.
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1243.375,1254.926,Monopoly on the colloquial sense Mr. Justice but this Court held in the Walker Process case that that itself was not enough to establish a violation of Section 2.
1972.71-666,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1335.079,1340.762,"But did you say already Mr. Freidman what you have been arguing, you would not argue on the trouble downstairs?"
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1340.762,1341.883,We would not argue?
1972.71-666,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1341.883,1342.677,Yes.
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1344.383,1346.978,Well I thought Mr. Justice Stewart’s questions to be did not --
1972.71-666,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1346.978,1349.083,"Yes, I would tell you differently"
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1349.083,1349.369,Pardon?
1972.71-666,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1349.369,1350.192,I was turning to it differently.
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1350.192,1351.577,You are asking it differently.
1972.71-666,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1354.931,1355.796,Private party --
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1355.796,1358.89,"No, I would not think that a private party would Mr. Justice."
1972.71-666,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1359.083,1360.498,Why?
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1360.498,1364.304,Because of the role of the Attorney General has in this case.
1972.71-666,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1364.304,1368.955,"I know, but I thought the theory of the trouble damage sequence private Attorney General."
1972.71-666,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1368.955,1375.204,What if the licensee were sued by the patentee here who enforces the license agreement?
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1375.204,1375.73,He could --
1972.71-666,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1375.73,1382.444,Do you think the licensee could answer as hey will-- by the way your patents indulged?
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1382.444,1384.08,Certainly Mr. Justice.
1972.71-666,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.08,1387.19,"Well, what if it it were then?"
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1387.19,1388.751,That he could challenge it.
1972.71-666,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1388.751,1391.069,And how about trouble damages?
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1391.069,1398.398,"I would think that if-- well the trouble damages would have to be based on a violation on of the -- on the violation of the antitrust laws, and we --"
1972.71-666,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1398.398,1404.833,"Well, you then on -- would say it appears on the face of the license agreement?"
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1404.833,1406.206,"It’s been so held, yes."
1972.71-666,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1424.569,1426.814,You may continue Mr. Friedman.
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1426.814,1429.627,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-666,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1477.618,1480.344,That isn’t a very historic proposal.
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1480.344,1491.298,"It’s not historic, but it’s the principle that this Court has long since recognized Mr. Justice and indeed it goes a little -- it goes even -- it goes beyond that, it seems to us."
1972.71-666,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1527.003,1535.613,But the very implication of it is that to adopt a condition against bulk sales that would have been the license or you just --
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1535.613,1544.074,"It seemed -- there is no such indication, but it does appear Mr. Justice, I mean the limitation was a part of the patent licensing agreement."
1972.71-666,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1544.074,1548.906,I know it was but I thought it was negotiated.
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1548.906,1571.269,"Presumably, one of the conditions for the patent license was that they accepted this restriction and indeed the fact that the appellees considered this restriction so important, I think it’s shown by the fact that when they had their cross-licensing agreement, they agreed that ICI would impose this restriction upon its licensee."
1972.71-666,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.865,1865.478,"Yes, but that’s because without the patent, the case on one side of the other falls?"
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1865.478,1875.246,"Well, but I am suggesting Mr. Justice that the fact that the Court is in effect reviewing the decision of the patent commissioner."
1972.71-666,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1875.246,1883.004,"Yes, but in this case whether or not the patent is valid doesn’t determine your case in terms of whether there is an antitrust violation?"
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1890.737,1895.786,"No, but we think this is an appropriate ancillary phase of the case."
1972.71-666,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1895.786,1901.552,So is it the jurisdictional question -- is it the pendent jurisdiction question?
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1908.265,1909.877,I think it is pendent to the antitrust.
1972.71-666,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1917.756,1924.742,"But absence a separate antitrust claim, would you say there is jurisdiction?"
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1924.742,1931.373,"Perhaps under other sections, but not on the -- I wouldn’t think under Section 4 of the Sherman Act, under the other provisions dealing with it."
1972.71-666,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1931.373,1943.889,"Logically, your position would be that there was under the Sherman Act, logically, you would say that it was an antitrust -- if there is an invalid patent being practiced?"
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1943.889,1949.664,We don’t say that the mere practice of an invalid patent itself is a violation of the Sherman Act.
1972.71-666,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1964.726,1969.245,I just want to tip your tongue is there some other section that the (Inaudible) patent?
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1969.245,1974.584,"Well, I would suggest two sections, Mr. Justice."
1972.71-666,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1974.584,1976.339,An act regulating commerce or what?
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1976.339,1990.591,"Well, one is 1338 (a), the original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any act of Congress relating to patents and then also the section where the United States is the plaintiff in the suit."
1972.71-666,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1990.591,2002.104,"Mr. Friedman, substantively the question is not one of whether a patent maybe collaterally attacked since they are in other proceedings, but whether that it’s one of standing, whether the Government has standing to collateral?"
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2002.104,2014.315,Whether the Government has standing to challenge a patent involved in an antitrust violation where there is no claim of fraud on the Patent Office and where the patent is not relied on as a defense.
1972.71-666,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2019.159,2025.316,Did in Gypsum implicitly decide that question against you?
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2025.316,2026.185,We think not Mr. Justice --
1972.71-666,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2026.185,2036.126,"In Gypsum, the Court does said that where the patent is relied on, the Government can attack the patent’s validity."
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2050.26,2051.36,But then -- and then they went on to say --
1972.71-666,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2051.36,2061.027,"In other words, saying where reliance on the patent does not give immunity from the antitrust action, we don’t need to decide it?"
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2061.027,2063.643,But the Court went on and did decide.
1972.71-666,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2063.951,2065.146,The validity of the patent?
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2065.146,2066.918,"No, no, I am sorry."
1972.71-666,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2066.918,2068.645,That’s what I am -- we are talking about here?
1972.71-666,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2068.645,2085.904,"But of course in the Gypsum case, we were challenging the validity of the patent only because the defendants were relying on it, whereas in this case, they are not relying on it, and we are challenging the patent that's incidental to antitrust violation."
1972.71-666,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2647.703,2648.805,Mr. Sailer.
1972.71-666,1,28008,henry_p_sailer,,2648.805,2651.978,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-666,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3198.572,3203.767,"Mr. Sailer, both you and Mr. Friedman used the term involved in."
1972.71-666,1,28008,henry_p_sailer,,3206.377,3230.62,"Well, I – and they should ask Mr. Friedman that question, Your Honor, that I don't know, don't know what he does mean that, but I suppose my answer is that whatever it means, if it means anything relevant at all it seems it must mean a sine qua non or a foundation or basis of the agreement that is alleged to violate the law."
1972.71-666,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3368.38,3387.286,"Well you might argue that if an antitrust violation is achieved through the mechanisms of the patent, that it gave the patentee such a leverage that he could achieve certain restraints of trade that he might not otherwise achieve, that if they could argue it just as the matter of remedy?"
1972.71-666,1,28008,henry_p_sailer,,3387.286,3388.022,Yes.
1972.71-666,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3404.81,3416.294,If you find in a license agreement a condition that you won't sell a territorial restriction or a customer restriction and instead of patent agreement.
1972.71-666,1,28008,henry_p_sailer,,3430.177,3444.854,"Well, I can readily agree with your arguendo on that Mr. Justice and say at the same time that under those circumstances it might will be appropriate for a court to decree compulsory patent licensing for example."
1972.71-666,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3446.113,3455.677,Even there it wouldn't be fully irrational to say that as a matter of remedy they ought to get rid of the power that was the fulcrum for this violation?
1972.71-666,1,28008,henry_p_sailer,,3455.677,3459.649,"Well, I have a hard time seeing --"
1972.71-666,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3459.649,3459.975,I do agree --
1972.71-666,1,28008,henry_p_sailer,,3459.975,3464.325,-- to find an antitrust issue as a -- I mean a patent suit as a remedy if you will.
1972.71-666,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3464.325,3472.13,"I agree with you, it would be very arguable remedy, but nevertheless it's always one step beyond the compulsory licensing?"
1972.71-666,1,28008,henry_p_sailer,,3472.13,3474.436,"Well, I would say it's one very, very long step behind."
1972.71-666,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3474.436,3478.226,Yeah.
1972.71-666,1,28008,henry_p_sailer,,3478.226,3491.071,"The Government denigrates our position as somewhat as relying on some old case that was decided long time ago, that is if I understand Mr. Friedman’s arguing."
1972.71-666,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3575.588,3576.992,I got the idea from your brief?
1972.71-666,1,28008,henry_p_sailer,,3576.992,3582.793,"-- well, did I say so Mr. Justice, that very strongly cuts in our direction."
1972.71-666,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3645.784,3648.351,And so the patent was untouched?
1972.71-666,1,28008,henry_p_sailer,,3648.351,3649.464,In the Gypsum case --
1972.71-666,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3649.464,3649.872,Yeah.
1972.71-666,1,28008,henry_p_sailer,,3649.872,3654.537,-- they never had any litigation about the validity of the patents.
1972.71-666,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3741.298,3746.25,"Well, does the misuse at trial in effect concede the validity of the patent?"
1972.71-666,1,28008,henry_p_sailer,,3746.25,3751.373,"Well, in amidst -- I guess the answer to that was conceded arguendo I suppose Mr. Justice."
1972.71-666,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3980.565,3982.412,Mr. Timberg.
1972.71-666,2,42168,sigmund_timberg,,3982.412,3984.628,Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please.
1972.71-666,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4833.554,4846.485,"Mr. Timberg, is the apparently established authority of a court to declare a patent invalid in a suit involving a licensee and a licensor, is that authorized by a statute or is that --"
1972.71-666,2,42168,sigmund_timberg,,4846.485,4850.417,It is indeed Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1972.71-666,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4876.913,4877.364,How about it --
1972.71-666,2,42168,sigmund_timberg,,4877.364,4883.483,"It's 35, my colleague informs me, it's 35 U.S.C. 282 confers that right."
1972.71-666,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4883.483,4888.554,And they -- more recently in a suit to royalties?
1972.71-666,2,42168,sigmund_timberg,,4888.554,4895.227,"Yes and that was along the same line of reasoning, that like to the Gypsum case."
1972.71-666,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4901.94,4915.243,"I assume a patentee sues (Inaudible) unpaid royalties, and the licensee says I (Inaudible) the patent is out --"
1972.71-666,2,42168,sigmund_timberg,,4915.243,4921.658,"I assume under Lear v. Adkins, if that is the case Your Honor is referring to, it would be able to challenge patent."
1972.71-666,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4921.658,4924.199,They think this was predicated on to some other --
1972.71-666,2,42168,sigmund_timberg,,4924.199,4927.773,"It's predicated on something else, yes Your Honor."
1972.71-666,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4930.049,4930.849,Mr. Timberg.
1972.71-666,2,42168,sigmund_timberg,,4930.849,4931.115,Yes.
1972.71-666,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4931.115,4933.802,I thought that was the import of Justice Rehnquist's question.
1972.71-666,2,42168,sigmund_timberg,,4940.132,4949.524,"It's based ultimately on statute, if I may say a word Mr. Justice Blackmun on the question of Gypsum."
1972.71-666,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5030.42,5039.625,"Well, what if the Government says that it alleges there has been tying -- there is a tying agreement in existence here it is right on the piece of paper."
1972.71-666,2,42168,sigmund_timberg,,5064.227,5074.206,"It's in fact that were alleged to be the leverage that made the restraint possible then this would -- that might be so, but this is not that case Your Honor."
1972.71-666,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5088.43,5090.246,They also held patent.
1972.71-666,2,42168,sigmund_timberg,,5090.246,5101.489,"They also had patents may I say and they also cross-license the patents, but the reason that they cross-licensed the patents through each other was that they were blocking patents."
1972.71-666,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5109.045,5111.346,Was the pooling dissolved in this case?
1972.71-666,2,42168,sigmund_timberg,,5111.346,5112.705,The pool couldn't be dissolved.
1972.71-666,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5231.938,5234.626,What if it hadn't been?
1972.71-666,2,42168,sigmund_timberg,,5234.626,5254.823,"If the patent, if the -- well, if it had not been canceled then there might the possibility of the Government urging that the dosage patent be made available on a royalty free basis -- excuse me, reasonable royalty basis to all applicants which is within the discretion of the District Court."
1972.71-666,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5254.823,5256.66,That's a question of remedy then?
1972.71-666,2,42168,sigmund_timberg,,5256.66,5258.613,"It is a question of remedy, pure and simple, Your Honor."
1972.71-666,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5258.613,5263.161,And so it would be a question of remedy of they said not only that but we think that the patent should be invalidated.
1972.71-666,2,42168,sigmund_timberg,,5268.682,5276.762,"It is a remedy question but I get back to the reason why I cited Kelly and Kosuga and the Cooper case, it is if you want to call it a remedy you may."
