1964.256,0,29736,john_d_cofer,,220.848,221.654,I beg your pardon.
1964.256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,221.654,224.326,This was at the preliminary hearing?
1964.256,0,29736,john_d_cofer,,224.326,227.33,This was when the case was called for trial.
1964.256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,227.33,233.997,"Well do I understand though that on this record, something happened for two days in September --"
1964.256,0,29736,john_d_cofer,,233.997,234.186,Yes.
1964.256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,234.186,236.48,-- and there was a continuance until October?
1964.256,0,29736,john_d_cofer,,236.48,238.192,"Yes, yes sir."
1964.256,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,380.523,381.909,Do you have a description?
1964.256,0,29736,john_d_cofer,,381.909,382.601,I beg your pardon?
1964.256,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,382.601,386.211,Have you given a description [Inaudible]
1964.256,0,29736,john_d_cofer,,386.211,390.28,"Yes Your Honor, I was going to get that, yes sir."
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3229.804,3234.102,Mr. Chief Justice and associate justices.
1964.256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3310.877,3317.074,Those contracts -- those contracts made by the television people [Inaudible]
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3317.074,3318.197,That's correct sir.
1964.256,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3318.197,3320.377,Did they take a picture?
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3320.377,3325.586,"Yes sir they took film without sound, periodically."
1964.256,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3325.586,3327.677,What are they going to get?
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3327.677,3336.99,They would later use it if they wanted to and later broadcast or televise broadcast on regular televised news broadcast later.
1964.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3336.99,3344.224,"And Mr. Attorney General, would that include telecast of witnesses sitting in the witness stand?"
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3344.224,3350.133,"Yes sir, film without sound, but not regularly as was brought out here."
1964.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3359.296,3363.197,May I ask you when you get to it if you will.
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3380.003,3392.305,"Well, I might say to you that of course the judge gave them the right to televise under his instructions that is to take film without sound is very specific."
1964.256,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3404.249,3410.968,[Inaudible] on parts of the procedures other than the testimony of witnesses?
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3410.968,3413.099,"No soundtracks, no sir."
1964.256,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3413.099,3415.741,Not on any phase of the case?
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3415.741,3418.302,Except the arguments of the state.
1964.256,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3418.302,3419.517,"Well, that is an important subject."
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3419.517,3420.229,Yes sir.
1964.256,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3420.229,3423.085,The argument of the state was a soundtrack.
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3423.085,3424.305,Yes sir.
1964.256,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3424.305,3430.234,"Was the â€“ was withholding of the jury, was there a soundtrack when the jury came in?"
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3430.234,3433.084,They didn't hold it Mr. Justice?
1964.256,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3434.83,3436.267,"But there's a soundtrack then, wasn't it?"
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3436.267,3437.633,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1964.256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3439.143,3443.381,Was the instructions to the jury with soundtrack?
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3443.381,3449.239,"No, sir."
1964.256,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3449.239,3454.836,Was the argument of the -- of the prosecution broadcast live?
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3454.836,3466.092,"The argument of the first state's attorney, there were two, was broadcast sound, but not video."
1964.256,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3474.808,3475.413,Yes.
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3475.413,3482.697,On the second state's attorney argument that was telecast video and sound.
1964.256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3496.153,3504.78,"At the moment, however, there was a television picture going out in the public, namely the picture of the judge."
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3516.631,3523.258,"Mr. Justice -- Mr. Justice White, I'm not certain whether it was every minute or not."
1964.256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3529.245,3539.785,"I thought the record showed that the sound, that the picture went out and then with it, a running summary by someone who is in the courtroom listening."
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3539.785,3541.509,I don't recall that it was in the record.
1964.256,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3546.636,3554.277,The petitioner and his counsel [Inaudible] excluded from the pictures taken during the argument --
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3554.277,3554.968,Yes sir.
1964.256,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3554.968,3557.347,-- of the district attorney?
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3557.347,3559.524,Mr. Cofer and the two Mr. Cofer's --
1964.256,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3559.524,3559.795,Yes.
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3559.795,3560.295,Yes sir.
1964.256,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3560.295,3563.451,And the -- and the defendant himself was not photographed.
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3563.451,3563.955,That's correct sir.
1964.256,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3563.955,3566.456,Was he ever photographed in the courtroom?
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3566.456,3573.718,"He was -- he was photographed during, I imagine, during the film without sound."
1964.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3586.124,3590.229,"[Inaudible] here, could we?"
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3592.184,3593.831,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1964.256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3596.827,3604.898,What -- what part of the -- you mean all the videotapes is taken over the entire trial?
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3604.898,3609.511,There wasn't any videotape taken except the pretrial.
1964.256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3609.511,3620.283,But how about -- how about just the photographs of the trial proceeding without sound which they did take and which part of which were rebroadcast at some other time?
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3620.283,3621.41,I think that's here sir.
1964.256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3621.41,3621.904,It is.
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3621.904,3623.644,Yes I think that's before you.
1964.256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3623.644,3626.582,That must be quite a month old.
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3626.582,3638.992,"Well, I think you -- I think from what the judge has told me, I would be subject to being disputed by Mr. Cofer who was going to close that there was very little of this during the actual trial itself."
1964.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3638.992,3644.836,"Well, just a mechanical question Mr. Attorney, how can we see that, that takes special equipment and then we have to go to --"
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3644.836,3646.212,It was a film sir.
1964.256,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3650.397,3656.141,[Inaudible] regular pictures -- picture film or this was on video?
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3656.141,3657.104,The video?
1964.256,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3658.135,3659.558,Video?
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3659.558,3663.646,"Yes sir, you have [Inaudible] with special equipment, that's correct sir."
1964.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3663.646,3667.785,That means going to some broadcasting.
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3667.785,3673.678,"Well sir, that is a mechanical problem that you have."
1964.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3675.746,3678.285,The parties have any suggestion?
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3678.285,3679.438,As to how you might see it?
1964.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3679.438,3680.799,Yes.
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3680.799,3686.291,"We can certainly counsel that those that have equipment and see what can be done, I would be very happy to do that."
1964.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3699.646,3700.505,"Where, here?"
1964.256,1,44214,waggoner_carr,,3700.505,3701.481,Yes sir.
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,5508.165,5514.511,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.256,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5716.457,5717.848,Is this in your brief Mr. Jaworski?
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,5717.848,5718.168,It is sir.
1964.256,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5718.168,5719.569,I didn't follow it.
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,5721.312,5722.871,It is in the brief sir.
1964.256,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6070.61,6075.406,Of course Canon 35 isn't before us here at all.
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6081.919,6083.319,We fully agree with.
1964.256,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6083.319,6084.595,I think that's the point you're making.
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6084.595,6090.125,That's the point I'm making exactly.
1964.256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6146.008,6147.982,How do you deal with them?
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6147.982,6149.063,I beg your pardon sir?
1964.256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6149.063,6152.057,How do you deal with the [Inaudible] case?
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6152.057,6155.296,Well I'm familiar with that case.
1964.256,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6168.479,6174.217,What I wanted to know -- that was my point in my [Inaudible]
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6174.217,6175.157,Well I do remember that.
1964.256,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6175.157,6195.946,[Inaudible]
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6195.946,6203.455,"That's correct sir but you had in a record, they're a state of facts from which it appears that there had been an unfairness."
1964.256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6227.295,6237.218,I take it your argument then would be exactly the same as the television here has not been limited to just pictures during the trial.
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6251.538,6252.773,As far -- yes sir.
1964.256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6261.174,6262.916,"If you could do one, you could do the other?"
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6262.916,6264.376,You certainly could.
1964.256,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6264.376,6265.261,Mr. Jaworski.
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6265.261,6266.411,Yes sir.
1964.256,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6266.411,6279.841,"You regarded to me the fair trial guaranteed by our constitution, the defendants were put as they have been in Cuba in a public stadium and drive the court crowd of 20,000 people?"
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6279.841,6282.027,I certainly would not Mr. Justice Goldberg but --
1964.256,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6282.027,6282.662,Yes.
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6297.292,6304.183,"Because one was under the control of the court, and one was under the supervision of the court and the other one is not."
1964.256,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6321.178,6332.19,"It isn't the essence of the fair trial regardless about the dimensions of the courtroom, a trial before a judge in a courtroom?"
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6332.19,6333.018,That's correct sir.
1964.256,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6333.018,6334.171,The Court -- this Court had said.
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6334.171,6335.334,"That's correct, correct."
1964.256,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6335.334,6338.941,It seems quite recently.
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6366.7,6376.263,"That's one way of doing it, but it doesn't necessarily follow that because it's done by the broadcasting of pictures from the courtroom that there has been an unfair trial."
1964.256,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6431.217,6440.134,You would be making the same argument Mr. Jaworski there [Inaudible] if this jury had not been sequestered?
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6440.134,6445.275,"The jury had not been sequestered, you would again have a problem that we don't have here."
1964.256,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6468.204,6472.288,Well that does suggest then doesn't it to what Mr. Justice Stewart said.
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6480.935,6482.931,I think that's right.
1964.256,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6484.162,6484.772,Mr. Jaworski?
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6484.772,6484.922,Yes sir.
1964.256,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6484.922,6492.625,What are some differences between the examples you've cite and the [Inaudible] courtroom press.
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6546.592,6556.237,I follow everything Mr. Chief Justice that you say except the conclusion that is implied in your question and if there is any unfairness of the trial per se by virtue of that.
1964.256,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6608.714,6639.424,"The other things are -- are inherent in the trial, in the courtroom because our system demands if the public to the extent or the defendant didn't have his friends in the general public to see the trial, to see that he is not being deprived of any of his rights but these others are super imposed upon it and are not going to protect the defendant, but for the commercialization of some newspaper."
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6641.364,6647.442,"I can't see the difference Mr. Chief Justice as far as the question of due process, denial of due process is concerned."
1964.256,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6702.357,6712.067,"That was right in the constitutionality of it that it wouldn't be a absurd rule to turn this on, I think we have that rule [Inaudible]"
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6712.067,6717.706,It may not be an absurd rule Your Honor but it would certainly be an invasion of what the right -- what the state has the right to do.
1964.256,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6718.961,6719.972,I said that.
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6719.972,6720.184,Yes sir.
1964.256,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6720.184,6722.321,This isn't a constitutional question decided.
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6725.746,6726.796,"Yes sir, that's correct."
1964.256,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6726.796,6737.503,[Inaudible] the rules of the judicial process of the United States describe that and that just follows them.
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6737.503,6738.19,That's correct sir.
1964.256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6748.29,6751.334,"48 states with the same rule, isn't it?"
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6751.334,6755.033,"Yes, all except Texas and Colorado have adopted."
1964.256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6787.203,6800.405,You're not making any suggestion here that the 48 states or the federal courts which excluded absolutely photographs in the courtroom is in anyway contrary to the Constitution?
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6800.405,6801.199,Oh and they've not.
1964.256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6820.734,6825.206,(Voice Overlap) the federal court will do it constitutionally or they'll be able to do it either way.
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6825.206,6826.049,Alright.
1964.256,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6826.049,6827.488,By the same token Mr. Jaworski.
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6827.488,6827.709,Yes.
1964.256,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6827.709,6844.043,"Suppose you're not contending that at the level of dignity, decorum, judicial propriety, judicial ethics and wisdom that you're not contending that this will attack its rule, its practice if necessarily very good or wise, are you?"
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6844.043,6844.428,No.
1964.256,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6884.843,6898.332,"Like how do you think, you think if on this record you say that this violated the right for a fair trial, it would tantamount to make Canon 35."
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6898.332,6900.942,Mr. Justice Brennan that's another constitutional amendment.
1964.256,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6903.296,6905.501,It elevates [Inaudible]
1964.256,2,34642,leon_jaworski,,6905.501,6908.261,It elevates into that statute.
1964.256,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6916.45,6918.158,Mr. Cofer.
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,6918.158,6920.625,May it please the Court.
1964.256,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7060.987,7061.901,That's in the record?
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7061.901,7063.415,Yes sir on pages --
1964.256,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7063.415,7066.284,Slightly contradicted to what the state said?
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7066.284,7070.175,Let me explain that it's not a deliberate contradiction of this Your Honor.
1964.256,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7070.175,7071.017,What page is that?
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7071.017,7088.015,"On pages 99 and 101, the two young radio reporters were called to the witness stand in October and testified that right at that time and on the October 5th, they were recording the sound."
1964.256,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7107.727,7126.166,"What I don't understand Mr. Cofer, I thought the Attorney General said that that mic he pointed out on the witness box which would have recorded that the machine from the back in the courtroom had been made dead, had been cut off so that it wasn't possible for any recording."
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7126.166,7134.791,"The radio facilities were in this room, out this door right here Your Honor and they used one of the same microphones that the court recorder uses."
1964.256,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7134.791,7136.446,"What did they do, cut in on it or something?"
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7136.446,7147.237,They were just wired into the court recording microphone and they were tape recording in this room in the October proceedings which â€“ one of which was being transmitted back to the radio station.
1964.256,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7147.237,7151.712,Well now where does it appear or does it in the record that they were wired into that?
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7151.712,7158.564,On page 99 and 101.
1964.256,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7180.381,7188.419,"Well was it -- isn't it -- was this just below or you were using the same microphone that the other facility is using, the courtroom microphone?"
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7190.1,7202.548,That is the place I was referring to I [Inaudible] and the point is that -- in the Court's question that it was sound being recorded in October that was available but there's no record -- there's no evidence -- there's nothing in the record to show that (Voice Overlap)
1964.256,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7202.548,7209.39,"So in 101 it said at this moment, it is exceeding the trial through our studio where it is being taped?"
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7209.39,7210.914,Yes sir.
1964.256,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7210.914,7213.457,But it goes on instead not being used.
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7213.457,7220.174,Not being broadcast that it's available and there's no -- nothing in the record to show that the court's order in that regard was valid.
1964.256,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7220.174,7221.997,[Inaudible] tape here.
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7221.997,7224.894,The sound tapes are not Your Honor.
1964.256,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7234.995,7243.176,"Which isn't material, why didn't you ask for the tape to be brought here that do show the [Inaudible]"
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7243.176,7250.957,"Well I'm not sure that the -- the tapes themselves were material Your Honor, there's no evidence that they were just--"
1964.256,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7250.957,7260.592,"[Inaudible] your point, some of these companies took the tapes showing to them."
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7261.806,7264.36,"Your Honor, I was -- it's not an important matter."
1964.256,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7317.943,7319.684,What hearing was that?
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7319.684,7320.678,The October trial.
1964.256,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7320.678,7322.28,Well what do you -- the October trial?
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7322.28,7323.377,Yes sir during the trial.
1964.256,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7323.377,7325.655,You say that that was during the trial.
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7325.655,7328.832,"During the trial the evidence of testimony, yes sir."
1964.256,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7328.832,7332.508,Were they used in the press?
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7332.508,7333.63,Yes sir.
1964.256,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7333.63,7343.24,"I'm sure that our clipping showed in those large boxes of exhibits, all the newspapers during the trial and [Inaudible]"
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7343.24,7345.396,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1964.256,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7345.396,7347.201,None of that is [Inaudible]
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7347.201,7347.667,Excuse me.
1964.256,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7358.382,7362.023,That's an exception to what I just heard.
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7365.124,7367.641,Yes sir.
1964.256,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7367.641,7377.169,Is the interference or disruption that they may have caused -- is that -- that question is not at all covered by the limited grant of certiorari in this case.
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7377.169,7378.152,Yes sir it is.
1964.256,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7379.684,7381.406,No.
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7393.085,7394.41,Yes sir.

1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7427.76,7431.015,I believe that photography is fairly within the limit Your Honor.
1964.256,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7433.971,7436.325,I see.
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7436.325,7436.819,Yes sir.
1964.256,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,7437.878,7439.673,Mr. Cofer may I ask you this.
1964.256,3,26731,hume_d_cofer,,7439.673,7440.41,Yes sir.
