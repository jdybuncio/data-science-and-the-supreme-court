2015.15-5238,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.995,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case No. 15-5238, Nichols v. United States. Mr. Hansmeier."
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,7.995,33.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Until three weeks ago, a sex offender who moved to a foreign country was not subject to any Federal registration requirement in the United States unless and until he returned to the United States. Below, the Tenth Circuit nonetheless held that it is a Federal crime for a sex offender who moves to a foreign country to fail to -- to report that move."
2015.15-5238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,66.72,69.64,That would be true of Kansas law in this case.
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,72.515,77.08,"He had an -- he had a requirement to tell Kansas of his departure, correct."
2015.15-5238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,77.08,92.44,How does it work normally? Say a person under SORNA leaves Kansas and goes to Illinois and registers in Illinois.
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,105.094,106.21,Correct.
2015.15-5238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,145.3,150.69,And this is in addition to the -- the other venues.
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,150.69,151.52,"If there are any, correct."
2015.15-5238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,151.52,154.42,So it would be both Federal and a State requirement.
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,163.235,164.98,"I think that's correct, yes."
2015.15-5238,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,164.98,165.5,Under --
2015.15-5238,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,165.5,181.56,"What sense does it make if you have Federal law that says we're going to add this -- these -- these sanctions when you violate the -- the State law? And in the one case, if you don't register, you're triggered and State law says, well, you've got to unregister too."
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,190.015,207.215,"Well, I -- I think they would have done that because -- and if you look at the legislative history, I think this is somewhat clear. What Congress was concerned about were missing sex offenders not at initial registration but when -- when the sex offender crossed State lines."
2015.15-5238,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,273.88,280.755,"Well, but there's no problem to require him to register, but all of a sudden there is a problem to require him to unregister?"
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,280.755,284.655,"Well, it's not a problem. It's just SORNA left it to the States."
2015.15-5238,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,284.655,291.265,They left the unregistering to the States but not the registering?
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,291.265,296.37,"Not a -- not the updating the registration in a new State, correct."
2015.15-5238,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,296.37,297.705,I'm curious.
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,313.28,316.845,"Well, Justice Ginsburg's example was interstate travel."
2015.15-5238,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,316.845,317.72,"No, no, no."
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,319.88,320.55,But you're talking --
2015.15-5238,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,320.55,325.11,-- returned from -- where he had fled to? Philippines.
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,325.11,326.37,Mr. Nichols moved --
2015.15-5238,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,326.37,328.105,Under the SORNA violation --
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,328.105,328.4,Correct.
2015.15-5238,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,328.4,332.675,-- could they have asked for him to be returned under the State law violation?
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,332.675,348.67,"There's actually a provision in SORNA, I think it's 19 -- 16917, which requires Federal -- the marshals, Federal officials to assist the States in enforcing the registration requirement."
2015.15-5238,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,348.67,349.5,So is that a yes?
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,349.5,350.54,I think yes.
2015.15-5238,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,350.54,355.06,So really what we're talking about is that they asked for the extradition under the wrong law.
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,355.06,356.29,I think that's exactly right.
2015.15-5238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,367.97,375.13,Did leave -- did leaving the country without notice violate the terms of his supervised release?
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,375.13,375.95,It did.
2015.15-5238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,386.34,391.52,Are you -- it's mentioned in one -- one of the briefs -- I don't have the reference to it --
2015.15-5238,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,391.52,392.23,Yeah.
2015.15-5238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,392.23,393.09,-- at hand.
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,411.61,418.93,I think it gets a little confusing with the interstate travel because we don't really address it because there is a jurisdiction. There is an arrival jurisdiction.
2015.15-5238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,427.955,430.69,But the arrival jurisdiction is not your residence yet.
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,434.855,438.935,So I -- I think SORNA doesn't do a good job of this.
2015.15-5238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,456.705,456.975,Yes.
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,456.975,462.52,-- that -- that actually creates a system where an individual is not on the registry for a certain amount of time.
2015.15-5238,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,490.395,516.35,"You have a textual argument that I -- that I understand, but one of the arguments you mentioned at the outset was that an examination of the legislative history shows that Congress intended to produce the sort of result that was produced here, and I wonder if that's really a plausible argument. If you're correct, then two things happen; at least two things happen."
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,551.84,559.0,"Well -- well, I think if you look at the legislative history, there -- there's nothing to indicate that -- that SORNA in 2006 had anything to do with international travel."
2015.15-5238,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,592.9,627.32,"Well, if I could then come back to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical of someone like your client who moves from Kansas to Illinois, what, in the language of the statute, would prevent that person from going to the registry office in Kansas before departing and reporting there that he was moving to Illinois and his new address in Illinois would be whatever it would be? Why does that not fit under this -- under the language of the statute? Or would you agree that it does?"
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,627.32,633.42,"Well, I would agree that there's nothing that prevents him from doing that, and I would agree that he should do that under State law, but --"
2015.15-5238,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,633.42,644.4,"Well, if you -- if you agree to that, then I don't see why -- why there is a difference between that situation and the situation where the -- the person leaves Kansas and goes to the Philippines."
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,644.4,651.7,"Well, what -- but I don't agree that it's a -- it's sufficient or a Federal requirement to do it before."
2015.15-5238,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,654.4,654.97,Why would it not be --
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,654.97,655.57,-- it's not a requirement.
2015.15-5238,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,655.57,664.32,Why would it not be sufficient under 42 U.S.C. 16913(c)?
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,664.32,670.03,"Well, because that provision is still going to require -- and the government, I think, agrees with this."
2015.15-5238,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,674.785,703.26,"Well, it says, ""shall not, later than three business days after each change of residence, appear in person in at least one jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a) and inform that jurisdiction of the change of address."" So prior to leaving, he is within the period of not later than what -- than three business days after the change of residence."
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,711.855,715.93,"Well, this is on -- the text is on page 11A of the blue book."
2015.15-5238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,772.025,776.32,"But now, under current law, under the 2016 change --"
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,776.32,776.675,Right.
2015.15-5238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,776.675,781.415,-- is it -- it's clear that anyone under SORNA who leaves the country --
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,781.415,781.915,Right.
2015.15-5238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,781.915,783.445,-- has to give notice --
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,783.445,783.95,Right.
2015.15-5238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,783.95,786.83,-- to the jurisdiction from which he departs.
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,786.83,787.5,Correct.
2015.15-5238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,788.34,796.54,So they're talking about only the people who were -- were pre -- pre-2016 people.
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,796.54,806.125,"We're talking about a very small subset, I assume, unless the Federal government were to go out and indict a bunch of people who have traveled prior to February 8th for this."
2015.15-5238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,806.125,824.48,"What bearing on your argument does the last sentence at the bottom of 11(a), the last sentence of C have? That jurisdiction, in other words, the jurisdiction where he registered, shall immediately provide that information to all other jurisdictions in which the defendant is required to register."
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,825.675,826.955,"Well, correct."
2015.15-5238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,849.755,855.06,"My question was, does -- does this have significant relevance to your argument here?"
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,855.06,856.6,Does it help?
2015.15-5238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,856.6,856.985,Yes.
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,856.985,863.21,I -- I don't think it -- I just think it's how it's -- I don't know that it helps. It's --
2015.15-5238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,863.21,891.41,"There was a reference to a form that everyone under SORNA signs that acknowledges a requirement to register on commencement change, termination of residence, and give 21 days notice before traveling outside the United States. Nichols signed such a form, did he not?"
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,891.41,892.405,He did.
2015.15-5238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,892.405,907.27,"And what you're saying is that that form has no operative effect, the fact that he didn't do what he -- what he undertook to do in the form is not a Federal offense."
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,907.27,909.35,"Well, what I'm saying is that that's a State form."
2015.15-5238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,949.15,955.64,"But it's the same register, that is -- you said there's no separate Federal entity."
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,964.475,967.54,"Well, I'm saying, in practice, that's what has to happen."
2015.15-5238,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,973.42,976.915,I find interesting the new legislation.
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,986.9,987.28,Yes.
2015.15-5238,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,987.28,994.435,Is there anything in that -- in that law that requires the U.S. to tell the State the person's left -- that they've left?
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,994.435,996.14,I think there is a provision for that.
2015.15-5238,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,996.14,999.49,I didn't -- I didn't have a complete chance to go through it.
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,999.49,1006.97,I don't know that that provision made its way into the -- the government's supplemental brief. Yes.
2015.15-5238,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1011.5,1016.115,So the problem at issue here has been completely resolved by new legislation?
2015.15-5238,0,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,1016.115,1017.665,"Oh, I think that's absolutely true."
2015.15-5238,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1121.49,1127.995,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1127.995,1135.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: SORNA required Petitioner to register and to keep his registration information current."
2015.15-5238,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1166.855,1178.12,"Is it your position that he was required to notify Kansas both that he was terminating his residence and that he was moving to the Philippines, or just that he was terminating his residence?"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1178.12,1180.88,Here it's just that he's terminating his residence.
2015.15-5238,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1183.805,1185.19,But he was not required to?
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1185.19,1187.96,But that is -- that is not what he was being required to do here.
2015.15-5238,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1197.79,1204.22,"I -- I think your answer was clear, but I didn't understand it. Would it -- in your view --"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1204.22,1204.3,The --
2015.15-5238,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1204.3,1209.735,"-- would it have been compliant with SORNA simply to say I am leaving Kansas, period?"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1209.735,1244.675,"That would have complied with his obligation to keep his registration information current with the jurisdiction involved, yes. The -- we do think that Section 16914(a)(3) allows him to report where he resides or will reside, and therefore, he can report future information, and therefore, the guidelines, promulgated by the Attorney General in 2008, says that normally when somebody's moving from one jurisdiction to another jurisdiction, he should tell Kansas, I am leaving Kansas and this is where I'm going next, so Kansas can give that other jurisdiction warning."
2015.15-5238,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1244.675,1248.86,But the -- the Philippines is not a jurisdiction under the statute.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1248.86,1249.64,That's correct.
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1262.88,1280.89,"Well, all right. How is that the case since subsection (a) refers to each jurisdiction where the offender resides, is an employee or a student? When he's in the Philippines, there's no such jurisdiction covered by SORNA where he resides, is an employee, or is a student."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1280.89,1292.88,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but we think that that's not the only thing that is pulled in by the phrase, ""jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a)."" He is required to register while he's a registrant in Kansas."
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1294.07,1295.845,But how is that --
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1295.845,1296.92,At --
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1296.92,1302.87,Where is under (a) something that says it's the jurisdiction where you used to be required to register?
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1302.87,1310.11,It's -- it's the part that says he has to keep the registration information current. And subsection (c) informs us what it means to keep the registration --
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1310.11,1310.31,But where --
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1310.31,1311.12,-- information current.
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1314.81,1325.165,"Well, but he only has to keep the registration current if there is a jurisdiction where he -- covered jurisdiction where he resides, is an employee or is a student."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1325.165,1325.28,Well.
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1325.28,1331.215,Otherwise that obligation is inoperative because there's no registration place in the Philippines.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1331.215,1336.57,"Well, we -- we disagree that Kansas is not a -- is not a jurisdiction involved."
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1345.955,1346.23,Well --
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1346.23,1352.155,-- it is also the case here that he could have complied with that by giving the notice before he left Kansas --
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1352.155,1352.67,"Well, right."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1352.67,1353.22,-- when he was in dispute --
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1353.22,1357.605,But he doesn't have to comply with it until later than three business days after there's a change.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1357.605,1358.12,That's not --
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1358.12,1358.955,So he --
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1358.955,1359.72,He doesn't --
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1359.72,1363.955,Shall not later than three business days after each change? That's not true?
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1363.955,1368.245,It is true that he has to comply with it not later than three business days.
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1380.315,1381.57,"Well, maybe he should have."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1395.25,1395.47,But --
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1395.47,1396.405,-- under the --
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1396.405,1401.85,It does say where he resides. But it also says he has to keep the registration information current there.
2015.15-5238,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1404.28,1404.6,Current where?
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1404.6,1409.13,"In -- in the jurisdictions where he has been registered, where he is residing, and --"
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1409.13,1410.13,But it is current.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1410.13,1410.34,-- and --
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1410.34,1414.32,It is current at all the time in which he resides there.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1414.32,1415.27,That is true.
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1431.64,1434.89,"Well, then, you're just reading pursuant to subsection (a) out of the statute."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1434.89,1435.1,No.
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1436.66,1441.475,"Excuse me, Mr. Gannon. It tells you exactly what it means to be a jurisdiction involved."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1454.59,1461.56,"I understand that, Justice Kagan, but our view is that this is not the same as saying a jurisdiction described in subsection (a)"
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1484.47,1484.64,Right.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1484.64,1487.12,-- from or to which the change of residence occurs.
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1487.22,1500.925,"I understand -- I understand your argument about 16914(a)(3), but how many -- what's the -- the penalty for -- the maximum penalty for violating this provision?"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1500.925,1503.15,I -- I believe it's ten years. It's --
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1503.15,1503.21,Yeah.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1503.52,1504.885,-- for violating the Federal provision.
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1504.885,1514.76,"-- ten years. So you think somebody is supposed to look at this and say, should I register? Obviously he doesn't want to register or unregister, whatever it is."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1536.51,1537.08,And 6 --
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1537.08,1543.32,That's an awful lot to ask a -- a layperson to parse at the penalty of ten years for being wrong.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1543.32,1543.76,"Well, there's --"
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1543.76,1545.295,For a registration violation.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1545.295,1547.55,It's -- it's also a State law offense.
2015.15-5238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1554.25,1554.68,Then why wasn't --
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1554.68,1555.07,-- to Kansas.
2015.15-5238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1555.07,1570.785,"Why wasn't the State violation pursued? So he's in the Philippines, and he's extradited because on the government's reading of SORNA. But he did commit an offense, it's conceded, under State law."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1570.785,1576.21,"That's true, Justice Ginsburg, and that's going to be true in virtually every single case of Section 2250."
2015.15-5238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1576.21,1586.585,Why wasn't the extradition sought under that which is clear and certain instead of a -- a provision where there has to be a strained interpretation?
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1586.585,1594.41,"Well, maybe we should have sought that as well, but we did think we had a strong Federal interest in this particular prosecution for multiple reasons."
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1601.09,1604.56,In your interpretation. Let's look at this.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1610.74,1611.04,No.
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1618.71,1619.075,I see.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1619.075,1620.34,-- do think that the sentence --
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1620.34,1631.07,"In other words, it doesn't mean ""ever involved,"" and it doesn't mean ""now involved."" It means involved during the three business days where da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1631.07,1631.37,It -- it means --
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1631.37,1633.02,And a person is supposed to understand that.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1633.02,1633.18,It --
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1633.18,1635.65,"In fact, you're supposed to read that into the silence."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1635.65,1635.99,It means --
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1635.99,1639.46,"Now, that's, to me, a little farfetched, would you say?"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1639.46,1639.89,No.
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1645.43,1646.34,It's a jurisdiction --
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1646.34,1646.66,It's a --
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1646.66,1647.62,-- that was involved.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1647.62,1647.81,No.
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1649.94,1650.01,Ah.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1650.01,1653.025,-- we know he's changing from Kansas to somewhere else.
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1655.42,1655.72,I see.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1655.97,1657.28,-- in the exchange of information.
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1657.28,1657.48,All right.
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1679.4,1680.95,"That may be my fault, but --"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1680.95,1683.08,"Well, perhaps it's mine as well."
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1696.46,1715.76,"I'm firmly for purposes, but this one is a -- a little tough, because as I read it, literally, at all, I don't -- I don't get an interpretation -- and you could do the same thing. You're supposed to -- and you seem to be saying that. Look, you said you're supposed -- they're supposed to keep the registration current."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1749.9,1752.24,"No, we're arguing that he has --"
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1752.24,1752.3,Yeah.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1752.3,1756.11,-- an obligation to ensure that the information in the registry is current.
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1773.675,1779.555,So he's been living for 15 years in the Philippines where he is employed.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1787.695,1788.77,"No, because --"
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1788.77,1791.31,"Why is it? I mean, Kansas was once involved."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1791.31,1792.01,Because -- no.
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1798.41,1809.345,"Oh, what he's done is he's lived in the Philippines for 15 years, and now he's changed his residence to South Korea. Does he have to tell Kansas?"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1809.345,1810.71,"No, Justice Breyer."
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1810.71,1810.82,But --
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1810.82,1821.31,We believe that this requirement is about updating the registration information associated with his residence in Kansas. And we think that Kansas remains involved.
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1824.56,1825.11,Mr. Gannon --
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1825.11,1830.53,"-- and he has not yet given notification to at least one jurisdiction, that that is no longer true."
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1830.53,1844.16,"It seems to me that what you're saying is that each of those offenders is supposed to recognize the underlying purpose of the law, which is to have accurate registries, and to do everything he can to serve that underlying purpose."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1864.575,1864.81,Well --
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1864.81,1873.1,"So you can say well, he's supposed to keep it current, and -- and that's right. He is -- he should keep it current, because we would all like sex registry."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1884.51,1891.66,"And we just don't think that's true, because Kansas was a jurisdiction that he could have informed while he was still a resident."
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1893.32,1894.555,"You know, he could have, and he should have."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1894.555,1895.33,-- and that would have --
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1895.33,1896.42,But he didn't have to under --
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1896.42,1896.6,-- but --
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1896.6,1898.27,-- this statutory language.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1898.27,1904.96,"But it is subsection (c) that provides the content for what it means to keep the registration current, and it says you have to inform at least one jurisdiction."
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1908.15,1924.9,"It -- it says he has to have informed at least one jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a), and subsection (a) makes clear that the only jurisdictions that they're talking about are the jurisdictions in which he currently either lives, works, or is a student."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1924.9,1930.78,And that was true the morning before he left Kansas and the morning he was going to move out of his apartment.
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1931.49,1932.01,And that morning --
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1932.01,1935.53,"-- today is my last day in Kansas; I'm a resident right now, but by the --"
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1935.53,1937.4,"That morning, everything was current."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1943.33,1946.21,He is subject to the provision that requires him to keep it current.
2015.15-5238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1955.44,1955.72,You -- you agree --
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1955.72,1956.45,-- he could have done it --
2015.15-5238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1956.45,1960.085,"-- that the problem has been cured, prospectively."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1960.085,1969.52,"I -- I -- I think that the new statute captures this type of conduct, effectively, incidentally, because the new statute actually talks about a much broader category of conduct."
2015.15-5238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1981.83,1982.06,So --
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1982.06,1984.43,-- we would expect it to pick up this information.
2015.15-5238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1984.43,1994.04,So -- so who -- who is left out under the new law that would be covered under your reading of the old law?
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1994.04,2000.1,I -- I don't think any -- my point is not that somebody is left out under the new law.
2015.15-5238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2002.35,2005.02,"Well, I'm trying to find out what is the effect --"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2005.02,2005.9,The --
2015.15-5238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2005.9,2009.93,-- of -- of ruling one way or another.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2016.95,2017.33,Yes.
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2039.86,2053.55,"I understood -- I -- if I understood you correctly, there is still a category of people under your interpretation today that would not be covered under the new law, because you have to file an itinerary, right?"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2053.55,2054.42,Yes.
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2054.42,2054.69,Okay.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2065.835,2070.79,"Well, that would be true, Mr. Chief Justice, except that the language that we're talking about here is the new subsection."
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2083.76,2098.385,"So if his purpose is I'm going to visit the Philippines, and while there, he decides I'm going to set up permanent residence here, then you would be able to prosecute him under this provision, even though the new law doesn't cover it."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2098.385,2099.63,"Well, I think --"
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2099.63,2101.46,His purpose is to visit the Philippines.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2105.365,2123.27,"Well, then, I think that would -- that would raise a separate question, and would mean that because his purpose had changed, we would -- we would have to find out whether the attorney general's time and manner implementation of this provision, which is also authorized under the new statute, requires him to report such changes in purpose after he's already in the Philippines."
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2161.29,2175.83,"So you -- you read 16913(a) as saying, where the offender resides or resided, is an employee or was an employee, is a student or was a student."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2175.83,2185.16,"I don't think that that's the way we're reading the provision, Mr. Chief Justice. We're saying that there are two obligations there: one is to register and the other is to keep the registration current."
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2229.8,2230.15,That --
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2230.15,2230.72,-- in -- in --
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2230.72,2234.2,That is 16921(b)? Is that the one you're referring to there?
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2234.2,2238.0,"That's correct, 16921(b)(3), which is on 11a of the government's brief."
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2238.0,2247.1,But 16921(b)(3) is specifically an obligation that's placed on officials. It has nothing to do with any obligations on offenders.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2247.1,2257.75,"That is true, Justice Kagan, but what we think it reveals is that it is telling us which jurisdictions are involved in the exchange of information that is at issue in the change of residence."
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2257.75,2268.02,"So but an offender is supposed to look at a statute that places only an obligation on State officials and to say, really? That obligation applies to me as well?"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2268.02,2268.26,No.
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2312.52,2315.405,"They might have, but it's the language that's bothering people."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2341.59,2341.99,If --
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2341.99,2344.09,"And your answer is ""yes,"" and I say --"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2344.09,2344.32,If --
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2344.32,2345.41,-- okay.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2368.95,2370.64,"No, not precisely it."
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2376.26,2379.85,"No, that can't be a reason to be involved, because he didn't -- I mean, there are a lot of people he didn't tell."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2381.355,2386.56,They are involved because he -- he is on the rolls there as being a current resident.
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2386.56,2386.75,Okay.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2386.75,2387.85,So he has an obligation --
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2387.85,2395.26,"In other words, where he is on the rolls as being a current resident -- be careful, because you run into Thailand, and you know, the -- the guy moved 50 years later --"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2395.26,2397.07,Except he's not going to be on the rolls there.
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2397.07,2401.98,"Oh, he will be on the rolls in Kansas because they never took him off, and -- and now it's 20 years later."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2402.47,2403.26,And he violated --
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2403.26,2407.26,Let's take what you mean. And now -- now I -- I have an idea of it.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2422.03,2426.33,There is support in the Attorney General guidelines to the extent that the Attorney General --
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2426.33,2426.56,Right.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2426.56,2433.49,"-- guidelines adopted in 2008 -- and we're not claiming Chevron deference to them, but this has been our construction of the statute all along."
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2433.49,2434.51,Tell me where it is.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2434.51,2444.88,"The -- the Attorney General guidelines are reprinted at the end of our brief, and they specifically say that he is obliged in order to keep his registration information current, to --"
2015.15-5238,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2444.88,2445.83,"What's the page, please?"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2445.83,2448.225,This is at page 22a.
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2476.4,2479.22,This -- this is not an administrative law provision.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2487.46,2491.53,"We're not claiming that the Attorney General has expanded the text of the statute, Mr. Chief Justice."
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2502.6,2510.2,"And it's still given -- given what I just said, my -- my answer is, so what? So what if the Attorney General has been construing this since, you know, 1875?"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2510.2,2510.72,If -- if --
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2510.72,2513.885,You cannot do anything to expand the words that Congress used.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2513.885,2521.12,"That -- that's -- if -- if you disagree that this is a fair reading of the statute, I'm not going to tell you that the guidelines make it a fair reading of the statute."
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2521.27,2524.735,What you're saying is the Attorney General thinks it's a fair reading of the statute.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2524.735,2525.13,I'm --
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2525.13,2527.22,So -- so I should think it's a fair reading of the statute.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2527.22,2529.27,"Well, I'm also telling you that we think -- (Laughter.)"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2529.27,2540.29,"I'm -- I'm telling you that we think we have good reasons for this construction, and Justice Breyer asked if there's anybody who's ever adopted this construction before, and I say, yes, the attorney general publicly did so in 2008."
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2566.81,2574.465,"Just to -- I probably should know this, but Kansas requires him to list any change, right? He has to unregister?"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2574.465,2578.39,"He has to -- he has to report any change in the residence information, yes."
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2578.39,2578.535,Right.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2580.745,2595.15,"That their language does -- it specifically says, ""He must reregister any change or termination of residence within three days to the registering law enforcement agency or agencies where last registered."" So that's the --"
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2595.15,2596.64,"But it says ""where last registered."""
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2596.64,2616.29,"Where it specifically picks up and says, you have to go back to where you last registered, we think that goes beyond -- that's the way in which Kansas law goes beyond SORNA, because SORNA does not always require that. We think that in a situation like this, SORNA effectively required that, because there's no other place for him to have gone."
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2671.8,2689.67,"Could I -- could I ask a question, Mr. Gannon, of absolutely no legal significance? Chalk it up to curiosity. Does the Federal government bring many of these prosecutions? Because I might have thought that when sex offenders leave the country permanently, the attitude might be like, good luck and good riddance? (Laughter.)"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2689.67,2694.12,"Well, I -- I take the point, Justice Kagan, but remember this is somebody who is not just a Federal sex offender."
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2702.52,2710.27,"But you're not -- you're -- as I understand the requirement that even you say he's subject to, it's just a requirement that says he's leaving the State."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2735.58,2746.925,"Well, as -- as I said, he was a Federal sex offender who was on Federal supervisory release who appeared to be on the cusp of committing additional Federal offenses in the Philippines, and so we brought him back."
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2769.84,2779.19,"I am right, right, that when you say he had the responsibility to keep the registry accurate, that's just to say he had the responsibility to tell Kansas he was no longer in Kansas."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2779.19,2779.47,That's right.
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2779.47,2782.14,"Even on your view, he had no other responsibilities."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2782.14,2784.54,That -- that's -- that's the applicable responsibility here.
2015.15-5238,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2785.09,2785.47,In terms of --
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2785.47,2787.4,How -- how do we -- how do we know -- I'm sorry.
2015.15-5238,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2787.995,2807.355,"In terms of Federal policy, hasn't Congress, by the enactment of the new statute and in other ways, evidenced a belief that the United States should not be exporting its pedophile problems to other countries?"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2807.355,2808.1,"Yes, Justice --"
2015.15-5238,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2808.1,2835.28,"And countries like the Philippines where the -- the Petitioner here went are known places that are attractive to sex tourists who go there to abuse young children and -- hasn't Congress evidenced a concern about this both for the human rights aspects of the problem and, also, I would think, for relations with the government of the Philippines?"
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2835.28,2836.65,"Absolutely, Justice Alito."
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2841.35,2841.45,Right.
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2849.105,2858.305,I knew we should have paid that bill. (Laughter.)
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2858.305,2863.03,My red light on the bench is still working. (Laughter.)
2015.15-5238,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2863.03,2870.025,"-- does not get you the information that you need in order to tell the Philippines, look, you have a sex offender in your midst."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2870.025,2871.55,"That's -- that's correct, Justice Kagan."
2015.15-5238,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2882.13,2887.25,What's so interesting is that regulation tells the States to do this.
2015.15-5238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2887.25,2887.58,Yeah.
2015.15-5238,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2887.58,2892.175,It doesn't tell the sex offender that he's obligated to do it.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2894.15,2894.58,It's --
2015.15-5238,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2894.58,2897.4,I'm -- it's a little bit odd.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2897.4,2899.69,It's true that the guidelines were addressed.
2015.15-5238,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2909.64,2921.31,"So now a sex offender is supposed to understand what ""involved"" means and read a directive to jurisdictions in your regulation and say, ah, that includes me, too."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2921.31,2921.94,"Well, we -- we --"
2015.15-5238,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2921.94,2925.565,"Jurisdiction is supposed to do this, but now I've got to do something more."
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2925.565,2932.08,"Well, but what the jurisdiction was told is that it has to inform sex offenders that they must do this, and that happened here."
2015.15-5238,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2938.68,2943.44,What makes it a State as opposed to a Federal crime? That's really what's at issue here.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2943.44,2943.76,It --
2015.15-5238,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2943.76,2944.94,I understand it's a crime.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2944.94,2945.03,Yes.
2015.15-5238,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2945.03,2947.04,The question is which kind of crime.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2947.04,2947.48,Yes.
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2953.13,2953.32,Briefly.
2015.15-5238,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2953.32,2958.135,"Under Section 2250, because he's a Federal sexual offender, there doesn't even need to be independent travel."
2015.15-5238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2961.67,2967.674,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hansmeier, you have 11 minutes remaining."
2015.15-5238,2,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,2967.674,2971.42,"Sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
2015.15-5238,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2974.585,2975.4,Okay.
2015.15-5238,2,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,2975.4,2978.46,"I forgot to say that, but thank you. I would --"
2015.15-5238,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2978.46,2979.05,Oh.
2015.15-5238,2,62673,daniel_t_hansmeier,,2979.05,3001.4,"Justice Breyer, if I can -- I'll -- I'll be brief. On the guidelines -- this is actually a direct quote -- the -- the -- according to the Department of Justice, ""A jurisdiction may require that changes in registration information be reported by registrants on a more stringent basis than the SORNA minimum standards."
