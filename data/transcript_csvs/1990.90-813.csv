1990.90-813,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,18.713,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-813, Houston Lawyers' Association v. Attorney General of Texas, consolidated with No. 90-974, the League of United Latin American Citizens v. the Attorney General of Texas."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,64.775,67.998,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-813,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,259.355,267.842,"Mr. Chambers, let me ask you one question about the meaning of section 2(a) which was, as you point out, was dwelled on rather extensively by counsel in the preceding case."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,284.031,288.425,That the section 2(a) covers the election of judges or--
1990.90-813,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,288.425,290.818,"No, no, but that... that it's a results test--"
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,290.818,291.259,--Oh.
1990.90-813,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,291.259,292.528,--rather than an intent test.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,292.528,307.999,"I think the language, Your Honor, as well as the legislative history clearly points out as this Court held in Gingles that Congress was acting to make sure that result, rather than intent, would be the factor that would be... that would enable one to establish a violation of the act."
1990.90-813,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,307.999,315.665,So you say then that Gingles established the proposition that 2(a) is phrased in terms of results rather than intent?
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,315.665,324.861,"I think Gingles said that Congress, with the amendment in 1982, was establishing result as the basis for establishing a violation."
1990.90-813,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,339.821,345.076,"If you have a case where there's a blatant discriminatory intent, is there a 2(a) violation?"
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,356.904,357.655,"I would think so, Your Honor."
1990.90-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,373.896,390.506,"Mr. Chambers, Texas like many States I think that elect judges has decided that it will elect judges at large from the district over which the judges have jurisdiction."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,392.359,393.85,"That's what the State has asserted, Your Honor, yes."
1990.90-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,393.85,407.529,"Now, does the Voting Rights Act give the Federal courts the power to change that and require that judges be elected from subdistricts?"
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,407.529,408.009,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,417.986,423.76,"Well, let's suppose it's a single-person office like that of Governor of the State."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,423.76,424.161,Yes.
1990.90-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,424.161,432.056,Do you think the Voting Rights Act could require that there be a committee of Governors?
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,432.056,433.308,"Your Honor, on that I... I'm not certain."
1990.90-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,446.841,454.665,So you think it could require an entirely... a complete restructuring of the form of government in the State?
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,454.665,462.752,"--No, Your Honor, not as a... I think that if there is a Governor and that is truly a single-person office, this--"
1990.90-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,462.752,466.684,"Well, that happens to be the case in all 50 States right now, doesn't it?"
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,466.684,466.994,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,467.345,467.595,Uh-huh.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,470.118,470.567,"No, I'm not suggesting that at all."
1990.90-813,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,483.797,489.773,"Well, would you say that the officer of Governor as you understand it is what you call truly a single-person office?"
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,489.773,490.464,"I'm saying it may be, Your Honor."
1990.90-813,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,491.275,491.566,You... your--
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,491.566,495.158,--The Governors that I know today would certainly be single-person officers.
1990.90-813,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.158,501.362,"--So, you're... all... you're just reserving the situation for Governors that you don't know anything... governorships that you don't know anything about."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,501.362,509.659,"Well, I'm... yes, Your Honor, but I'm also thinking about cases like the City of Mobile, where we had three commissioners who arguably were single-person officers."
1990.90-813,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,662.147,673.633,"Well, is that because they have jurisdiction in other counties or just because a lawsuit can be brought into the county in which they have jurisdiction which has parties to it that would be in from other counties?"
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,673.633,683.791,"Your Honor, I think it's somewhat... it's some of both, because the other point I was going to make is that district judges in... in Texas can be assigned to other districts in order to, for example, help with docket control."
1990.90-813,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.791,684.051,By what?
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,684.992,689.796,"By the Chief Justice, by the administration... the Chief Administrator of the courts, et cetera."
1990.90-813,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,689.796,692.398,By the... the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas?
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,692.398,698.853,"There is a... that is one possibility, and I'm saying there is... there are also nine administrative divisions of the court."
1990.90-813,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,705.538,707.688,With... within the administrative division?
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,707.688,708.059,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-813,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,709.922,715.017,"I suppose the... you're really arguing a question of remedy, I suppose, in a way."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,720.059,721.06,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.90-813,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,721.06,732.378,"Do you think... so the question of whether or not these counties in Texas much be subdivided into one-judge districts, that isn't... that isn't the question before us."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,732.378,732.749,"No, Your Honor."
1990.90-813,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,732.749,739.174,I would think that from what you said that you would say that that would be the... that would have to be what the remedy is.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,739.174,743.818,"Your Honor, I think there are a number of different remedies that can be considered by the court below."
1990.90-813,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,761.089,763.523,What... what was it you disagreed with the Solicitor General on?
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,763.523,778.773,"--The Solicitor General suggests that the... because we are dealing with judges, we should in reviewing this case weigh more heavily the State interest in having this particular type of structure."
1990.90-813,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,797.847,805.591,But I don't... I don't suppose that we really... that we really need to pass on this... your... the disagreement between you and the Solicitor General.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,805.591,818.701,"Except, Your honor, the Solicitor General suggests that the case should be remanded to the district court for further findings under some, I submit with all due respect, unannounced standard for weighing the State's interest in a judicial election case."
1990.90-813,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,818.701,821.294,"Well, I would... I would think that that would be a question of remedy though."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,821.294,827.149,"Well, it may be, and if... at best where that interest is to be considered would be in the remedial stage."
1990.90-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,838.555,850.824,"Well, Mr. Chambers, you take the position that under the... the term ""totality of the circumstances"" that it doesn't mean totality... that you can't weight the State's interest as part of the totality."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,850.824,851.075,"No, Your Honor."
1990.90-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,860.461,863.994,It can't come in as one of the circumstances to be weighed?
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,863.994,867.316,--It's weighed as a tenuous factor is what I'm saying.
1990.90-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,867.627,869.967,"Well, where does it say that can only be tenuous?"
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,871.209,871.389,--In--
1990.90-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,871.389,874.16,Why isn't it just one of the circumstances?
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,874.16,880.795,"--Your Honor, there are seven factors that are set out in the Senate guidelines for evaluating a section 2 client."
1990.90-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,896.945,899.537,Where do we find the guidelines in the statute?
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,899.537,918.699,"--In the statute, Your Honor, there are seven factors in the guidelines that... not the guidelines but the Senate report on the amendment of section 2."
1990.90-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,921.931,925.574,Are... you're... are you referring to a particular committee report or to a--
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,925.574,934.44,"--It's the Senate committee report, Your Honor, and if I'm not mistaken it begins on page... I would like to submit page of the Senate report--"
1990.90-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,934.44,934.581,--Uh-huh.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,934.581,938.314,--But it's... it's listed in the Gingles decision as well.
1990.90-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,938.314,938.484,Uh-huh.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,938.484,944.53,Where the court talks about the seven factors plus the two factors that are not weighed as heavily as the seven factors.
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,946.031,948.291,But they're... but they're not exclusive.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,953.897,954.217,They are not--
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,954.217,956.609,"--and presumably any other circumstances can be brought in, right?"
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,956.609,957.951,"--They are not exclusive, Your Honor."
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,969.478,971.47,And it... the Senate rejected it?
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,971.47,971.498,Yes.
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,971.498,972.53,You mean the Senate committee?
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,972.53,973.861,And Senate report points out that it's not--
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.861,974.012,The Senate committee--
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,974.012,974.533,--Yes.
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,974.533,975.504,--didn't think it was good.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,979.237,980.068,And the Senate also--
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,980.068,981.56,"Which is pretty all inclusive, isn't it?"
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,981.56,985.383,--This Senate also included this listing of seven factors plus the two that I mentioned.
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,985.383,985.703,Sure--
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,985.703,986.374,As guidelines.
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.374,991.669,"--So they are included within totality, but everything else is included within totality as well."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,991.669,1003.507,"Your Honor, I don't think that the State's interest is an appropriate defense, and I think that the Senate report shows that it is not a defense that would bar the establishment of a section 2 claim."
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.722,1032.925,You say the question is whether it limits.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1053.67,1058.785,I think Professor Collin pointed out the appropriate standard that ought to be considered.
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1114.832,1117.935,"So you... you would one-person, one-vote essentially as the standard--"
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1117.935,1118.105,--Yes--
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1118.105,1121.518,--or the measuring... measuring device whether it's constitutionally required or not.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1121.518,1144.204,"--Your Honor, if the State in this particular county has decided that we will assign three judges for whatever reason... you raised a question earlier about whether, for example, the caseload... whatever the reasons are being advanced to deny minorities an opportunity to participate effectively deprives them of equal protection, which the Voting Rights Act is designed to address."
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1144.204,1147.857,"All right, so it is your position that one-person, one-vote is the standard."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1152.602,1158.866,"Your Honor, we're not here arguing whether the one-person, one-vote principle should be changed or reversed with respect to judges."
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1185.595,1195.282,"Yes, but if... there may be wide differences in the population of the districts that elect, say, the Louisiana judges."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1200.916,1204.589,It may not and one may not be able to establish a violation in that section.
1990.90-813,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1204.589,1208.022,"Yes, yes, although the one-man, one-vote principle would certainly get to it."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1208.022,1211.214,It would if it applied to the election of judges.
1990.90-813,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1211.214,1220.56,But your... section 2 requires dealing with the claim that minority voting interest is depreciated.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1220.56,1221.802,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-813,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1227.905,1236.331,And that may not be... that may not correct every disparity in population between districts.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1236.331,1236.782,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-813,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1247.971,1263.731,So you're saying if I understand you that any numerical ratio that fits within the range the State now tolerates is an appropriate numerical ratio when we're trying to devise a remedy for your purposes.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1263.731,1265.043,"Well, I'm not certain about the remedy."
1990.90-813,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1276.981,1284.568,But you're saying whether... whether they are or not is in part a question... is in part dependent on the numerical factor.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1299.317,1301.318,For the analogies--
1990.90-813,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1301.318,1304.329,And that would also be the appropriate numerical ratio in devising a remedy.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1305.051,1314.598,"--It may, Your Honor, but I would point out again that when the Gingles case was decided, we had that analysis for purposes of deciding whether there was a deprivation of section 2."
1990.90-813,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1338.514,1338.965,"Yes, I understand."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1339.847,1340.778,"Well, Your Honor--"
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1340.778,1344.291,"--I'm not trying... really, I don't... I don't understand what your position is."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1379.016,1379.777,"--Well, Your Honor, the first--"
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1379.777,1380.825,What... what is the standard you are using?
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1380.825,1381.216,--I'm sorry.
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1384.999,1385.7,Right.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1385.7,1389.002,"And then the next question is, what is an appropriate remedy."
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1389.002,1389.622,Right.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1392.855,1403.25,"I'm... okay, I'm looking at the standard that the State has employed in making its assignment in the first instance for purposes of assessing whether minority votes are submerged."
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1408.975,1410.367,What do you mean if they are submerged?
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1413.219,1415.94,"Well, for example--"
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.94,1419.233,"--the greatest proportion that the State has in any of the districts, is that it?"
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1419.233,1422.545,--We look at that standard within that county unit to begin with.
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1433.934,1436.846,"Well, you're using a one... one-person, one-vote standard."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1436.846,1439.187,"Yes, using... using the percentage of people."
1990.90-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.353,1451.997,"So you'd apply it with... you'd apply one-person, one-vote within the unit?"
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1451.997,1461.153,I would apply whatever standard the court... the State has employed to direct... to develop that particular system that's being challenged for purposes of this analysis.
1990.90-813,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1461.153,1462.114,"Well, Mr. Chambers--"
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1473.761,1474.101,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-813,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1474.101,1481.488,"So it never got around to... to saying, well, yes, it does cover it, but there... and then decide whether there's been a violation."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1481.488,1482.259,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-813,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1482.259,1490.033,"So if we... if we agree with you, I would think we would just tell the Fifth Circuit they were wrong in saying section 2 doesn't cover it."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1495.907,1500.222,To review the district court's finding whether there's been a violation.
1990.90-813,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.222,1500.722,"Yes, exactly."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1500.722,1500.943,Yes.
1990.90-813,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.943,1503.167,So there has to be a remand if we agree with you.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1503.167,1513.202,"They... there has to be, but the Solicitor General was asking for a remand for further findings whether there was an adequate State interest which would prohibit the application of section 2."
1990.90-813,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1521.887,1525.109,So you think he's still talking about coverage?
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1525.109,1528.771,"Well, I suggest, Your Honor, that that's what we--"
1990.90-813,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1528.771,1529.623,I can't believe that.
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1537.99,1545.657,"--If... you can read in the brief, he suggests that State interest may trump the interest of minorities in being able to participate in the electoral process."
1990.90-813,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1545.657,1550.119,"Well, that may be in using the totality of the circumstances to decide whether there's been a violation."
1990.90-813,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1550.119,1561.058,"That's correct, Your Honor, but again I was suggesting that that State interest has to be weighed as part of the tenuousness factor in the... in the cause analysis of the seven factors."
1990.90-813,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1563.179,1565.348,"Very well, Mr. Chambers."
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1567.652,1574.565,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-813,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1664.501,1671.534,"Well, Mr.... Mr. Hicks, you... take a look at the word 2(a)."
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1676.319,1678.23,--I'm willing to accept that.
1990.90-813,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1678.891,1682.353,"That really doesn't speak one way or the other then to the question of intent, does it?"
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1682.353,1684.303,--Well--
1990.90-813,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.303,1685.125,You have--
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1685.125,1686.655,--There is a problem about causation.
1990.90-813,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1690.529,1700.806,"--Well, if you read it simply as causes or eventuates in, then you're simply referred to the phrases beyond that for the substantive meaning of this section."
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1710.583,1711.144,Yes.
1990.90-813,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1875.912,1884.618,But they... those cases did... did hold that judges are covered by section 2(a)?
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1884.618,1886.398,--They didn't address it.
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1946.774,1947.235,Why is that?
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1958.783,1971.302,"I think... well, the premise of Katzenbach v. Morgan and its progeny is, yes, Congress does have to think about them, if it's enacting statutes that go further than this Court has announced the Constitution goes."
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.774,2002.266,Or... or goes further than... than it seems.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2002.266,2005.558,"Well, I can only have the words."
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.26,2055.266,Does this have to be floor consideration that Congress gives to it or just intensive committee consideration?
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2055.266,2059.831,"--It has to be... it doesn't even have to be intensive committee consideration, but some consideration."
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2062.482,2064.304,No matter how clear the language is.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2064.304,2065.094,"Well, the language here is not--"
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2065.094,2068.386,"If we think they didn't think about it enough, it's ineffective."
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2068.386,2074.821,--The hardest question for me is if they had said... added the phrase including judges here... in section 2(b).
1990.90-813,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2111.461,2112.022,"Well, by--"
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2112.022,2113.163,--not just stumbling over them.
1990.90-813,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2113.163,2122.78,"--Mr. Hicks, why is it more intrusive to apply the Voting Rights Act to State-elected judges than it is to State-elected representatives or supervisors?"
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2122.78,2125.642,"I guess it's more intrusive, because it's more unexpected."
1990.90-813,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2135.569,2136.12,Where is--
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2136.12,2138.741,--just something that happened through the use of universal language.
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2162.029,2166.22,--Wouldn't it be easy to figure that it applies to all votes?
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2168.351,2169.763,--It would be a--
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2169.763,2176.478,Isn't a vote for a judge the same as a vote for a legislator or a vote for a dog catcher?
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2176.478,2178.699,--As a matter of fact it isn't the same.
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2180.229,2182.112,"Well, why does the average person think of it that way?"
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2182.112,2184.392,--I don't think so... not in Texas.
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2187.054,2190.527,"Well, what do they think the vote is restricted to what?"
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2190.527,2192.249,They know they vote for judges.
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2192.249,2192.41,Huh?
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2192.41,2193.479,"Well, that isn't even true."
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2195.512,2196.263,"Well, what office is it restricted to?"
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2196.263,2197.853,Excuse me?
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2197.853,2202.365,What office is it restricted to and doesn't apply to anybody else?
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2202.365,2203.877,As used by Congress?
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2203.877,2206.679,As used by the people of Louisiana?
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2206.679,2208.269,The normal... a normal person in Louisiana or Texas?
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2208.269,2208.5,Yes.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2208.5,2211.294,They vote... they actually vote for all these people.
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2211.294,2214.634,"Well, don't they think that they all... a vote is a vote?"
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2214.634,2217.906,"I believe so, but by and large--"
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2217.906,2222.45,Where do you get the... look how many years it took them to draw this line.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2222.45,2224.722,--I'm sorry.
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2225.133,2230.837,How many years did it take Louisiana to figure that judges weren't included?
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2230.837,2233.768,Well--
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2233.768,2237.271,'80... wasn't it '82?
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2237.271,2239.613,--I'm sorry.
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2239.953,2248.35,"The bill... the Voting Rights bill was passed, they didn't think judges were included?"
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2248.35,2250.422,--I don't believe anybody thought judges were included.
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2251.674,2254.545,"Well, when did they suddenly decide to litigate it?"
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2254.545,2259.089,"--Well, when they were sued they had to litigate it, because they didn't anticipate this."
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2259.089,2259.6,A long time.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2259.6,2264.115,"It did take a long time, and I think that's more an indication--"
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2264.115,2266.465,Somebody had to dig way down to figure--
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2266.465,2269.737,"--Well, I think it works the other way, Your Honor, with all due respect."
1990.90-813,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2295.657,2300.158,"--Well, there were certainly some section 5 suits, weren't there?"
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2300.158,2302.489,There--
1990.90-813,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2302.489,2307.695,And wasn't it held that the section 5 requirements applied at judges?
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2307.695,2310.186,--The court... this Court has summarily held that.
1990.90-813,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2315.06,2329.001,"Well, it's a little strange to then say section 2 doesn't apply if any change in the election scheme or the voting scheme has to be cleared under section 5, then it's a little odd--"
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2329.001,2334.835,"It doesn't seem odd to me, Your Honor, because the attention at the trial court level was about change."
1990.90-813,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2346.194,2354.269,"--Well, but under your test, there wasn't any specific discussion or consideration of judges at that time either."
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2357.612,2368.65,"--Yes, you have without, giving plenary review to that question and without looking carefully at the legislative history... I'm guessing... the issue wasn't presented to you that way at any rate."
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2419.815,2427.471,"Well, if you apply a clarity test here, I don't know why you're just complaining about judges being covered."
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2438.8,2439.97,--I think--
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2439.97,2442.882,You don't then now deny that the Governor is covered do you?
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2442.882,2444.344,"--I'm not, no."
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2446.184,2448.187,Why isn't he excluded under your theory?
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2448.187,2448.928,--She in our case.
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2448.959,2449.559,Whoever.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2449.559,2457.726,Because... because if... you're thrown back into the legislative history to some extent.
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2468.587,2469.337,Well--
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2469.337,2470.388,They're discussed extensively.
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2470.388,2474.771,"--Well, it seems to me you're make... it doesn't matter whether I like legislative history or not, but you're mixing two theories here."
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2490.502,2492.794,I'm not saying that.
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2511.263,2515.907,"Elected clerks of court, for example, if there's an... an election for the clerk of court--"
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2515.907,2516.518,They're--
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2516.518,2519.811,--is... is that explicitly in the legislative history?
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2519.811,2531.758,"--It is an executive function and I believe clerks... I don't know if they're clerks of court... were certainly the object of section 2 and section 5 claims, pre-1982."
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2542.667,2551.182,Is there any other officer that's in the category of judges... any other elected officer?
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2551.182,2555.414,Do you mean the category of judges as I would place the category of judges?
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2555.414,2555.614,Uh-huh.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2555.614,2558.118,"No, I... the... I don't think so."
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2558.118,2560.389,"Well, where did they get that unique place from?"
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2560.389,2564.529,I believe that this Court has historically recognized their unique place.
1990.90-813,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2589.518,2590.81,"Well, you want us to make the exception?"
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2590.81,2596.133,--I believe that in the area of federalism the Court has done this kind of thing before.
1990.90-813,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2601.178,2608.22,So these State court trial judges are nonetheless the creatures of the State and not of the National Government.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2608.22,2617.977,"There is no question about that, and that's one reason they're entitled to some special insulation from encroachments under the enforcement clause powers under the Civil War amendments."
1990.90-813,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2623.311,2628.386,"Well, it's one thing to say they were unintentionally covered by Congress when it wasn't thinking about it."
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2637.212,2639.095,I just think it has to deliberate over it.
1990.90-813,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.208,2678.165,"If there... if there was some debate about it and... and you know that they had it in mind, but nevertheless they used the word ""representative""."
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2678.165,2681.829,"--Well, that would be closer."
1990.90-813,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2684.123,2687.305,"So you think ""representative"" is capable of covering judges [inaudible]--"
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2687.305,2688.086,--It's capable of it.
1990.90-813,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2706.158,2706.789,--Jacksonian democracy.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2706.789,2707.51,Is it Jacksonian?
1990.90-813,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2713.036,2715.617,Jefferson was not at all in favor of electing judges.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2717.39,2717.811,Thank you.
1990.90-813,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2721.034,2722.866,"Their names both begin with J, though."
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2722.866,2723.087,Yes.
1990.90-813,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2747.494,2757.0,That's all... I... you... I take it you... then you aren't defending the judgment... you're defending the judgment of the Fifth Circuit but not its reasoning.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2757.401,2758.122,--That's correct.
1990.90-813,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2763.247,2769.192,We agreed to view... what you're really saying is that there's a different standard for judging coverage than the Fifth Circuit used.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2769.192,2770.51,--Yes.
1990.90-813,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2770.51,2772.563,So we would have to remand.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2772.563,2772.732,I don't understand.
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2788.757,2795.092,"Mr. Hicks, is it your position that section 2 in its entirely doesn't apply to judges... not at all?"
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2797.475,2810.722,"I don't think it's necessary to answer that question in this case, because we've been found not to discriminate intentionally, but I think there is no legislative history to indicate that in 1965 Congress intended to get at judges."
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2849.701,2865.492,"Of course, one of the respondents here says that there is more in section 1 than just the intentional discrimination test that... that... that you can say that all that section 2(b) contains is the dilution requirement."
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2871.837,2873.587,"Well, I think there--"
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2873.587,2874.398,Do you disagree with that?
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2874.398,2875.28,--I think--
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2875.28,2880.293,That's Judge... Judge Ents if you recall his submission here.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2880.293,2885.326,--I think that there is a possibility of bringing section 2(a)'s reach and results.
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.941,3066.747,So a State could disenfranchise any minority so long as it's willing to pay the price of... of giving the decision in question to a single official.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3066.747,3067.228,"--Well, first of all--"
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3067.228,3069.411,Or so long as it has been willing in the past.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3069.411,3073.761,"--I would think if there were an effort to do that, that would be seen as intentional discrimination."
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3101.999,3105.054,You could replace a school board with a single school administrator.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3105.054,3105.562,"Well, we have to--"
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3105.562,3109.545,And there... and there could be no complaint about that diluting the minority vote.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3109.545,3112.766,"--First of all, we would have to go through section 5 of the Voting Rights Act to do that."
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3112.766,3114.139,And you'd apply different tests there?
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3114.139,3118.181,"Well, the Justice Department at the first level would analyze what was going on."
1990.90-813,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.181,3122.053,"Yes, supposing you're not a covered jurisdiction, then section 2 would apply."
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3124.605,3125.076,You're... you're right.
1990.90-813,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3136.232,3137.254,It's not intentional... it's not intentional.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3150.483,3150.904,"--Well, I--"
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3150.904,3151.935,It's not covered by section 2.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3151.935,3154.398,--I for one would find it impossible to say that wasn't discrimination.
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3160.183,3162.244,"Oh, you have to take my hypotheticals."
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3162.544,3162.795,--Okay.
1990.90-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3162.795,3165.509,I make them up myself.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3167.8,3167.94,Okay.
1990.90-813,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3167.94,3178.386,"Or a closer case, what if Mobile instead of having a three-member commission, say, it changed to a single mayor... or single administrator and there were all sorts of good government reasons for doing it."
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3180.677,3182.98,"Well, they wouldn't be exempt from the act."
1990.90-813,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3182.98,3184.07,Exempt from section--
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3184.07,3186.053,They would be exempt from an at-large vote dilution... not they.
1990.90-813,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3186.053,3186.792,--Yes.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3186.792,3190.885,A challenge there later would be exempt from an at-large vote dilution challenge.
1990.90-813,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3193.587,3195.698,But always based on intent.
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3195.698,3198.619,"Well, I don't know if they all would have to based on the intent."
1990.90-813,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3268.373,3269.504,"Thank you, Mr. Hicks."
1990.90-813,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3269.504,3269.655,Thank you.
1990.90-813,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3269.655,3272.136,"Mr. Chambers, do you have rebuttal?"
1990.90-813,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3273.478,3274.189,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.90-813,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3424.894,3431.96,"Mr Chambers, do you know of any jurisdiction that today is using cumulative voting for the election of judges?"
1990.90-813,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3431.96,3444.889,"--Yes, Your Honor, in the... our brief we point out two cases in Alabama that has approved of cumulative voting for the election I believe of county commissioners in that particular... that district."
1990.90-813,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3446.83,3448.833,"Excuse me, the court imposed that you mean?"
1990.90-813,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3448.833,3453.645,"--The court approved it was settlement, Your Honor... that included that method of electing representatives."
1990.90-813,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3512.404,3515.126,"Thank you, Mr. Chambers."
1990.90-813,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3516.338,3516.959,Thank you.
