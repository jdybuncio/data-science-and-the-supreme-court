2000.00-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.02,"We'll hear argument next in number 00-492, Alabama versus Bozeman."
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,16.513,19.402,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--"
2000.00-492,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,60.109,70.8,"Well, that's the clear provision of Article IV(e) of the Interstate Agreement, here, on Detainments."
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,90.202,95.941,"Clearly the language, when it's read in isolation, seems to indicate that the indictment must be dismissed with prejudice--"
2000.00-492,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,95.941,96.684,"Yeah, that's what it says."
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,96.684,99.535,--but the language simply can't be read in isolation.
2000.00-492,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,105.479,110.142,"Well, I would think you maybe ought to just seek an amendment of the agreement."
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,112.288,116.929,"Well, there's a question whether or not the parties to the agreement can actually amend the agreement."
2000.00-492,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,120.644,123.245,Can Alabama just get out of it any time they want?
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,123.95,128.491,They would have to go to their legislature and repeal participation.
2000.00-492,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,128.491,131.258,But the State could through this legislature just withdraw from the whole country?
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,131.258,143.602,"Yes, according to the act itself, it could withdraw from the whole Act itself, but to do so it would have to give up certain rights that are bestowed upon it in the Act that are very beneficial to the States in disposing of detainers."
2000.00-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,143.602,152.434,"Supposing there was an effort to amend this provision, if it proves that you're wrong about the... how could it be done?"
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,153.837,157.431,Congress could not unilaterally change the provision of the compact.
2000.00-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,157.431,161.062,"Congress did it, didn't it, for Federal prisoners?"
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,161.062,171.093,"Congress did do it in Section 9 of the Agreement, but when Congress passed the original Agreement in Section 7, they reserved to themselves the right to amend the agreement."
2000.00-492,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,187.977,192.603,"Well, you shouldn't sign agreements that say this then if you don't intend to abide by it."
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,211.976,219.406,"Well, the State adopted the Agreement partially... certainly because of the benefits to it, but it also adopted the Agreement against the background principle that harmless errors shouldn't apply."
2000.00-492,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,219.406,231.75,"I do not know a background principle that overcomes the explicit mandate of a statute, shall enter an order dismissing the same."
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,252.1,261.76,"No, Your Honor, I do not have a case where this Court has specifically held harmless error applicable where there is a specific type of remedy such as this contained within the Agreement."
2000.00-492,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,261.76,263.329,Isn't there a broader problem?
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,328.761,333.341,I do not know of a case where that has been done.
2000.00-492,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,358.771,364.965,"But I thought you were making a broader argument, and that is that this sort of transfer should be allowed."
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,393.034,406.203,"--Mr. Justice Souter, I am making the broader argument that harmless error should apply to a statute unless there's an indication of an intent contrary to it that says that harmless error should not apply, and it's my position that this statute does not indicate such an intent that harmless error should not apply."
2000.00-492,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,406.203,408.022,How do we know it's harmless?
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,408.022,408.477,Excuse me?
2000.00-492,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,408.477,411.244,How do we know it's harmless?
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,427.713,433.99,Normally Article IV works that you bring the prisoner over and you have 120 days within which to try him.
2000.00-492,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,433.99,436.052,So you're going to put him in the county jail?
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,436.052,436.424,Right.
2000.00-492,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,436.424,440.511,"But you have the indictment before you get him, is that right?"
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,440.511,441.337,That's correct.
2000.00-492,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,441.337,444.188,"So what's he coming for, just the trial?"
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,444.188,455.909,"Under the Act, that is the purposes, he's supposed to... if you read the language in its technical, in its... on its face, then, yes, that seems to be the only purpose which you can bring him to."
2000.00-492,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,455.909,461.193,The only reason that a State... Joe Smith is in California.
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,470.192,472.793,"That seems to be the theory, if you read it, on its face."
2000.00-492,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,472.793,474.279,But now might you sometimes--
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,474.279,474.445,"But certainly, no--"
2000.00-492,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,474.445,476.841,--have to see him in Alabama before you go to trial?
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,476.841,477.75,"--I'm sorry, I didn't understand."
2000.00-492,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,477.75,480.518,How do trials work in that State?
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,483.756,484.483,Absolutely.
2000.00-492,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,487.721,502.11,"So this must come up all the time, I mean, you bring a person into the State, we say it's not, we're not ready for trial yet, but we're going to the arraignment or we're going to have a hearing on suppression or a lot of things."
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,502.11,502.687,Certainly.
2000.00-492,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,502.687,503.325,All right.
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,523.371,526.881,"And the State of Alabama's position is, no, you don't always have to keep them there."
2000.00-492,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,526.881,527.829,But that's what it says.
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,528.755,531.506,I think that's not what it says.
2000.00-492,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,536.297,542.159,"Well, you said the prosecutor dropped the ball, I think candidly, which leads to Justice Breyer's question."
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,554.252,554.806,Right.
2000.00-492,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,554.806,558.793,But at least not to the original place until the trial's complete?
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,558.793,559.453,Right.
2000.00-492,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,559.453,561.189,Or unless I get a waiver?
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,561.189,562.221,Yes.
2000.00-492,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,562.221,571.016,Can he be brought to another State for questioning just to meet with police officials?
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,571.016,572.252,Certainly.
2000.00-492,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,572.252,573.367,Or is it just a court proceeding?
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,573.367,584.102,"Certainly he can be brought to another State just for questioning or for other purposes, but the position of Mr. Bozeman is that under the Act you can only bring him for trial."
2000.00-492,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,588.726,592.275,"But that, we don't really need to resolve that here?"
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,592.275,595.126,"No, that's not the question that's presented today, Justice Kennedy."
2000.00-492,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,595.126,620.389,"The reason I ask is the only sense I can make out of it, given the realities, is this is some kind of prophylactic rule, and the prophylactic rule would be, we know it's nutty in a lot of circumstances, but nonetheless the only way to get the States to move off the dime is to insist that they try him before they send him back, even if the jail's next door to the prison he came from."
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,624.969,648.169,"And certainly this Act was passed, this remedial legislation, it was passed specifically to address certain problems that occurred as a result of detainers, there being no formal procedures, and there being no way to bring an inmate into a State and have the detainers disposed of, and to do so in such a way that it didn't interfere with the rights to rehabilitation, that's the specific purposes behind this Act."
2000.00-492,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,659.565,664.395,"Well, but on that point, I thought that was a persuasive argument that both you and the Government make."
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,676.821,685.571,"Supposedly you could, you know, theoretically you certainly could ask for a waiver, but that is not what happened in this case, and it shouldn't be required that you ask for a waiver in order to--"
2000.00-492,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,685.571,686.564,Why not?
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,706.542,722.602,"--We could give the person the choice, but certainly again that could just simply lead to more litigation, and whether or not he understood what he was waiving and what right he had, and also we have to get him here practically in Alabama, the practical way, you have to get the person into Alabama before you can appoint counsel."
2000.00-492,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,728.175,743.862,"Well, but that just means that instead of a 24-hour turnaround, make it 48 hours, so you appoint counsel, give them time to consult with counsel, and then decide whether to go ahead with the trial before you send him back or send him back and let him continue the Government program."
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,750.443,752.568,"--Yes, he did, Justice Stevens."
2000.00-492,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,759.627,768.626,"Well, it's clearly required if you read it literally, but you're sort of saying for this reason we should not read it literally and therefore it's not required."
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,768.626,769.741,--Right.
2000.00-492,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,769.741,770.401,Yeah.
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,770.401,770.401,"And of course this Court, at the time that this case was decided and at the time we were talking about whether or not Mr. Bozeman, whether his rights had been violated by the transfer, this Court had not decided New York v. Hill and decided whether or not waiver applied to the Act, and similarly the argument made there was that because the Act said that it shall be, that if there's a violation of the 120-day provision that the Act shall be... or the indictment shall be dismissed with prejudice, that waiver shouldn't apply because and that the Act specifically should say whether it should or shouldn't."
2000.00-492,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,770.401,804.004,"There was an enormous difference, Ms. Stewart, between that case and this one, and that is the defendant did something that caused... the defendant was sitting right there, and agreed to something."
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,837.441,852.756,"I think there is a significance in that that case involved waiver, but it's not for the purposes of the argument that I'm making which is that the IAD was silent on whether or not waiver principles applied to it, just as it's silent as to whether or not harmless error principles apply to it."
2000.00-492,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,867.988,900.022,"It seems it would apply then in every case, and here was a prosecutor who made a perfectly reasonable choice were it not for this IAD to say, we're going to turn him around in 24 hours, just want to arraign him and send him back, but the literal reading of this cuts the other way, and if you don't hold prosecutors to that literal reading, then every case would be harmless, and must, shall would have no teeth at all."
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,900.022,903.449,I don't think that every case would result in harmful error.
2000.00-492,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,907.247,909.355,I'm saying there would be--
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,909.355,922.274,"--Certainly there are cases where there would be harm to the defendant by the transfer, for instance in Alabama there are like 2600 inmates involved in drug programs, and there's currently a waiting list of 800."
2000.00-492,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,947.621,949.766,--But we're talking about a one day turnaround.
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,979.405,998.435,"--I do think that there is a situation where you could bring somebody just for one day and there could be harm to them, if they weren't involved specifically, say, it was the time to take a GED, for instance, was that day, and they couldn't take it as a result, and it wouldn't be given for, you know, another year or something along that lines, it would be harm to the defendant, so there could be harm from a single day transfer."
2000.00-492,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,998.435,1014.865,"Well, on that, even in this case illustrates the particular day, first it was one day, then another day, so it doesn't seem that the particular day is what's at issue."
2000.00-492,0,42094,sandra_jean_stewart,,1023.41,1026.464,That is certainly one of the issues that is encompassed.
2000.00-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1030.262,1031.627,"Very well, Ms. Stewart."
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1034.433,1048.012,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-492,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1064.61,1066.672,Why would a long interruption be worse?
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1066.672,1067.704,--Pardon?
2000.00-492,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1067.704,1070.304,Why would a long interruption be worse?
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1070.304,1071.419,"There are two reasons, Your Honor."
2000.00-492,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1078.356,1080.668,That's the... the interruption part wouldn't.
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1089.146,1091.11,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.00-492,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1117.116,1122.5,"But if your rationale is to protect the interests of the prisoner, why isn't the waiver the solution?"
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1122.5,1129.914,"--In an ideal world, yes, they would get waivers, but in our experience this situation arises because of miscommunications."
2000.00-492,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1148.535,1154.517,"But we can't make the law take care of miscommunication within the United States Department of Justice, can we?"
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1157.284,1179.658,"--Of course, Your Honor, but the rule of de minimis that when the event is so insubstantial in relationship to the purposes of the statute, the law does not take cognizance of it, and a single overnight transfer, like the one at issue here, is insubstantial in relationship to the purposes of the prohibition, and that purpose is to ensure rehabilitation of the prisoner and the prisoner's participation in the rehabilitation program."
2000.00-492,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1179.658,1193.776,"Yeah, but to the extent you rely on the interests of the prisoner, it seems to me that interest is totally protected by a simple requirement that he can waive because he would presumably have counsel to advise him, listen, you're better off if you go back and continue your program."
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1196.748,1198.977,"Your Honor, it's not a complete answer for two reasons."
2000.00-492,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1231.011,1245.045,"Was this the essential rationale for the Act, that the prisoner have these correctional programs or was it more the thought that a State should be entitled to impose its punishment for retribution purposes?"
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1245.045,1268.822,"--The Act has twin purposes, and the two purposes are, one, to set up a system of an expeditious system whereby States could obtain prisoners from other jurisdictions and exact their punishment or impose the penalties prescribed by law, and the other purpose was to ensure that while they were doing that it did not unduly interfere with the State that had the prisoner in its confinement and its programs of rehabilitation, so it should have been--"
2000.00-492,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1268.822,1279.475,"Would the Act have been complied with here if the prisoner, instead of being returned to Florida, the Florida prison, had gone to some other prison because it says he has to be returned to the original place of imprisonment?"
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1279.475,1293.054,"--Your Honor, if one were to read the language quite literally, they could have sent him to a Federal institution, for example, in some other part of Alabama, and it would not have invoked the literal language of the statute, and dismissal would not have been required."
2000.00-492,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1293.054,1294.995,Have there been any cases on that?
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1294.995,1299.991,"No, it is a rather poorly drafted agreement in that respect, but because it is an agreement, because it is--"
2000.00-492,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1299.991,1304.904,"Or they could just send him across the street to the Federal prison for a couple months, and there would be no problem."
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1304.904,1306.845,--I--
2000.00-492,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1306.845,1308.498,If that's not where he originally came from.
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1308.498,1325.132,"--That's not where he originally came from, and that situation occurs, for example, where the United States marshals retain custody of a high security prisoner, as they have the right to do, when they have concerns that the State may not have appropriate facilities, that they would retain that prisoner potentially in another location other than that one of original confinement."
2000.00-492,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1355.159,1361.003,"Why wouldn't the same argument have applied to the United States, but you got a special provision."
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1361.003,1369.714,"--Indeed, when Congress enacted that special provision, the courts were divided 4-2 in favor of that, the rule of de minimis or something similar to it."
2000.00-492,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1390.436,1401.089,"But States couldn't replicate that because they all have to be bound by the same, is that so or don't you know what is the answer to that?"
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1401.089,1434.564,"The Fourth Circuit has addressed that issue in a case called Bush v. Muncie, and it's not a matter of any clarity, but it appears that it would be somewhat difficult for a State to unilaterally amend its implementing legislation without withdrawing unless it, as Congress did in Section 7, had expressly reserved that right, and then if it had, if it did enact the provision that was inconsistent with the Agreement, there would be an issue among the States as to whether or not those States were willing to give that amending State the benefits of the Agreement, notwithstanding its departure in some degree."
2000.00-492,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1434.564,1461.275,"Wouldn't the easy way to do it, though, simply be to... for the States that wanted to at least to enter into a new pact sort of in the nature of a codicil, and put that before Congress in the contract clause... the compact clause, and at least as among those States that agreed to the amendment, I would suppose there would be no impediment to applying the same rule that the United States has."
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1462.678,1474.854,"Oh, for 48 states to arrive at the Agreement, to pass it as implementing legislation in each of those 48 states and to get Congress to pass on the compact is a somewhat arduous, although it is potentially viable prospect."
2000.00-492,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1502.225,1503.794,What's your best case from this Court?
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1503.794,1507.509,--Best case from this Court on de minimis or--
2000.00-492,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1507.509,1508.541,Your de minimis proposition.
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1508.541,1513.908,"--The case we cited on the first page of our argument section is Wrigley, but Wrigley cites about six other people."
2000.00-492,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1513.908,1515.311,I didn't think that was it.
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1516.443,1525.442,"Next best case would probably be Portland v. Retail Druggists Association, and the next case after that would probably be Anderson v. Yungkau."

2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1553.843,1568.87,"We don't believe it's a fundamental alteration in the design of the system, it is simply a recognition that there are some applications that are so far removed from the purpose and so insubstantial and some, in fact, that are so insubstantial in light of the purpose that they fall within the well recognized rule of de minimis and therefore should not be considered violations of--"
2000.00-492,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1568.87,1601.126,"But Mr. Lamken, you're really asking us for across the board approval of we could bring the person up for a reason other than trial, legitimate reason, to arraign the person, to be interrogated or whatever, a special purpose unrelated to trial, and yet the statute doesn't make any room for this, and I had... Ms. Stewart was speaking and she said the prosecutor made a mistake."
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1624.682,1635.418,"--This is, in fact, a trap for the unwary, but the Federal government does not have a way of knowing whether or not the individual was being brought, for example, back merely to plead guilty, in which case it would take overnight... it would cost a new trial."
2000.00-492,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1635.418,1639.504,"But the communication was, we want him for 24 hours."
2000.00-492,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1639.504,1647.595,"Correct, and in fact if he were pleading guilty and that were the arranged... the agreement was trial, 24 hours would have sufficed to complete the trial within the meaning of the statute."
2000.00-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1649.368,1650.667,"Thank you, Mr. Lamken."
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,1652.629,1657.087,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-492,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1711.618,1716.613,What's the purpose of the harmless error provision in the compact itself?
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,1716.613,1732.754,"Justice Souter, I don't believe that harmless error can apply to a situation like this where the statute is so explicit not only in what is prohibited but in the consequences if one violates that."
2000.00-492,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1732.754,1738.177,But do you get that from the text of the harmless error provision itself?
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,1738.177,1744.188,There is no harmless error provision in the IAD.
2000.00-492,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1745.386,1747.903,"Well, maybe I'm misunderstanding."
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,1753.726,1754.719,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-492,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1754.719,1756.327,Withdraw the question.
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,1756.327,1764.872,I will go on and state some of the reasons that I don't believe that harmless error does apply.
2000.00-492,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1819.296,1830.608,"Well, what happens if the State of Alabama picks up the prisoner at the Federal facility and starts a three hour journey, but after half an hour there is a big snowstorm and it has to go back?"
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,1830.608,1837.461,"That might be applicable in other States, Justice Kennedy, it's probably not in Alabama, but--"
2000.00-492,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1837.461,1841.094,"No, a tornado."
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,1841.094,1844.232,"--A hurricane, perhaps."

2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,1866.895,1867.843,Certainly.
2000.00-492,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1867.843,1869.867,God doesn't act in de minimis ways?
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,1869.867,1874.531,"Yes, it would not be de minimis and perhaps not harmless."

2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,1881.756,1882.787,"He was in Florida, yes."
2000.00-492,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1882.787,1885.759,"--Suppose they took him next to Marion, Ohio."
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,1889.475,1902.644,"Well, I think that liberally construing the statute as Article IX calls for means returning him to the original jurisdiction, not just to the original--"
2000.00-492,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1902.644,1911.023,"Well, you live by the sword and you know what else you do, if you're going to believe in strict construction here."
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,1914.45,1915.936,--Yes.
2000.00-492,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1915.936,1918.248,Where... have we said that or--
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,1918.248,1927.247,"Numerous courts have said that this is remedial, it benefits the prisoner and ought to be construed in favor of the prisoner."
2000.00-492,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1935.232,1941.836,--What's the authority of the council of State Governments as to interpreting a written document?
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,1941.836,1954.368,"It's somewhat weaker than most legislative bodies or so on, but it is the group that originally proposed the legislation and originally drafted it."
2000.00-492,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1966.794,1977.774,"And what was the position that the council of State Governments took, that it should be liberally construed to accomplish its beneficent ends or something like that?"
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,1977.774,1983.058,Liberally construed in favor of the prisoner as a remedial statute.
2000.00-492,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1983.058,1988.631,"But of course it had more purposes than one, did it not?"
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,1995.03,2010.922,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it also benefits the States, and that's what Ms. Stewart acknowledged in that it provides them with an expedited mechanism for getting prisoners without going through lengthy extradition procedures."
2000.00-492,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2026.897,2034.328,"Yes, and that's true of prisoners, too, I suppose, responding to Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, they return him to the original jurisdiction."
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2034.328,2051.418,"--And in fact most cases from all jurisdictions that refer to Article III where it is the prisoner who initiates the transfer, they have to follow the procedures quite strictly or they don't, do not get the benefits."
2000.00-492,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2055.216,2057.817,Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander?
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2057.817,2058.931,--Precisely.
2000.00-492,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2058.931,2066.815,"He doesn't actually literally, if you take, if you were a literalist, and you look at (e), it doesn't say where it begins to run."
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2117.758,2122.421,"Well, that running back would be the waiver, which Justice Stevens had proposed as--"
2000.00-492,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2122.421,2126.136,"But my question is, what triggers (e)?"
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2128.16,2133.938,"--The trigger is the change, the temporary custody pursuant to a detainer."
2000.00-492,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2140.337,2158.542,"All right, now, what they want to do is just say you're right, if significant temporary custody where significant is interpreted in light of the purposes of the law, that's what they want to do, and so literalism isn't going to help because neither literally is there."
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2158.542,2168.861,"--Well, the legislative bodies that have adopted this have made a legislative determination here."
2000.00-492,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2171.256,2181.37,"I'm sorry, my question is, what language says that you said if and your language was what?"
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2201.515,2210.266,"--My wording is in IV(e), prior to being returned, there must be a trial prior to being returned to the--"
2000.00-492,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2210.266,2214.89,"I know prior to being returned, but once what, prior to being returned?"
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2233.011,2234.597,"--I believe that you have to read it in context, you have to go up to--"
2000.00-492,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2234.597,2236.149,"Yes, exactly."
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2236.149,2236.149,"--(c), where--"
2000.00-492,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2236.149,2242.919,"You have to read it in context, and now my question is what are the words that you're reading in in context?"
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2242.919,2246.635,"--From IV(c), the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving State."
2000.00-492,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2246.635,2248.781,"All right, maybe that's it."
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2252.496,2254.808,I think so.
2000.00-492,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2283.786,2298.936,"May I ask you, if your reference to the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state in subparagraph (c) is that your response to Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, too, about the hurricane or the snowstorm in Alabama."
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2299.762,2305.995,"Justice Stevens, I believe that it has to be that if they cross the State line that--"
2000.00-492,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2305.995,2310.825,"--Well, but there are many cases in which the Federal prison is right across the street from the State prison."
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2310.825,2326.057,"--Yes, and there is a special provision in the IAD for that, Justice Kennedy, where the Federal Government can maintain custody of a prisoner and merely make them available for trial without turning over the temporary custody."
2000.00-492,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2336.088,2343.247,"Could there have been an argument here that there was, I don't know, continuous constructive custody by the Federal government?"
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2343.247,2344.816,"No, he was in the custody of the sheriff of Covington County."
2000.00-492,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2344.816,2347.128,Because they delivered him over to those--
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2347.128,2347.788,"Yes, sir."
2000.00-492,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2410.863,2437.053,"--Mr. Christensen, can I ask you, before you get on to that, why one couldn't read the statute as has been proposed by the appellant to say the don't return until trial is over kicks in only when the transportation is for purposes of trial, that is the Act simply does not apply to bringing somebody in for pretrial matters."
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2437.053,2451.731,"--I would disagree with that, Justice Ginsburg, because the Act itself says that it applies when there's a detainer and someone has been brought in for purposes of prosecution."
2000.00-492,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2470.678,2471.959,"Well, how could... how could this have been done?"
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2471.959,2474.931,--An arraignment is certainly part of a prosecution.
2000.00-492,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2474.931,2479.677,"This very case, here's the prosecutor says I want him here for one day."
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2490.906,2491.566,Certainly.
2000.00-492,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2545.891,2548.657,"I don't really see, still, the theory of (e)."
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2566.324,2583.209,"Well, and that's a presumption that is perhaps intuitive but one that I'm not convinced is borne out by the facts, and in the record below here there simply is nothing."
2000.00-492,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2586.198,2588.615,I'm asking for your experience as a criminal lawyer.
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2588.615,2604.385,"Mr. Bozeman has informed me that he lost his position as a barber in the prison at Mariana because of the one day transfer, so he was prejudiced, although that's not in the record below."
2000.00-492,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2607.191,2608.489,That's not what I mean.
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2632.821,2643.39,"--Well, no more than 120 days, Justice Breyer, and again I mentioned the short time periods that are involved here."
2000.00-492,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2669.602,2688.921,"But if you're bringing somebody in just for trial, presumably you're going to get counsel appointed if he's indigent only at the time he's brought in for trial, and is that going to be enough time for counsel to prepare?"
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2688.921,2697.094,"--Well, again, with the 120 days there is a provision that continuances can be granted for good cause shown."
2000.00-492,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2744.36,2747.787,"Well, I did have the same question as the Chief Justice."
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2759.221,2764.711,The more time to confer with his counsel or?
2000.00-492,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2961.865,2964.177,"Well, were these Federal prisoners?"
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2964.177,2965.497,"Yes, sir."
2000.00-492,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2965.497,2970.493,"So they could get, the State could get, the Government could get the advantage of the Federal amendment?"
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,2970.493,2975.9,"Yes, all these are cases where the United States was the receiving State."
2000.00-492,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3187.503,3191.136,Against the prosecutor or against the defendant?
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,3191.136,3192.416,Against the defendant.
2000.00-492,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3243.314,3247.773,"I'm not sure what the harm consists of if we had to look for harmless error, what would we look for?"
2000.00-492,2,35583,mark_john_christensen,,3250.662,3266.266,"I think that it would be something along the lines of rehabilitation, even though this purpose of the IAD is to resolve detainers, I think the background behind that is that detainers interfere with rehabilitation."
