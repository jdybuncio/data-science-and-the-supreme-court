2004.04-514,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.439,We'll hear argument now in Ricky Bell v. Gregory Thompson.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,62.442,68.047,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-514,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,122.19,131.566,"If you're... if you're going to... if you're going to consider something that wasn't a recall of a mandate as if it was, why don't you consider it as a rule 41(b) action?"
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,131.566,138.036,"Your Honor, we don't read rule 41(b) as allowing any sort of recall authority."
2004.04-514,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,139.182,141.011,"They didn't recall it, didn't... did they?"
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,143.384,145.853,--The mandate was not recalled--
2004.04-514,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,145.853,146.158,Fine.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,146.158,146.995,--because it was never issued.
2004.04-514,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,146.995,147.566,Correct.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,167.368,172.455,"Your Honor, that is not... not the rule applicable here because that rule applies in a different context."
2004.04-514,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,175.714,176.893,Where does it say earlier?
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,176.893,189.575,Rule 41(b) specifically deals with the 7-day period of... of time for issuance following the expiration of the time for a petition for rehearing or the disposition of that petition for rehearing.
2004.04-514,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,189.575,192.742,"And the court can... can extend it or... or in fact truncate it, can't it?"
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,192.742,195.462,"It can, Your Honor, at that point."
2004.04-514,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,195.462,199.392,What... what if the court then... I'm... let me just get to... and I think this is consistent with Justice Breyer's question.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,209.445,219.088,Because the more specific provision... what the court had actually done was to stay the mandate pending a petition for writ of certiorari.
2004.04-514,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,220.052,220.318,Oh.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,249.069,257.016,--I think that simply a plain reading of the rule and looking at the rule as a whole would preclude that result.
2004.04-514,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,285.346,286.834,"Well, there are... are they any--"
2004.04-514,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,286.834,293.58,"Well, you... you would make the same argument to that that... that you were making earlier, I assume, that to read it that way would... would be to nullify Calderon."
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,293.58,295.692,"That... that's exactly right, Your Honor."
2004.04-514,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,295.692,325.072,"--Well, are there any circumstances in which the court can... and let's again, as Justice Souter said, say that it put it on the record what it was going to do, that we hereby, after the Supreme Court has ruled in the case, will withhold... order that the mandate shall be withheld for a period of 30 days because there is a... a new case coming out on a different issue that may affect our... our holdings?"
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,325.072,325.846,The court--
2004.04-514,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,325.846,330.81,Or that a new case has been... has been released and we think that bears on... on the outcome.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,330.81,331.659,--After the--
2004.04-514,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,331.659,332.506,And we want to consider that.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,332.506,334.309,"--After the denial of cert, Your Honor?"
2004.04-514,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,334.309,337.396,"Yes, or after disposition by this Court on it--"
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,337.396,337.524,The--
2004.04-514,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,337.524,338.725,--when cert is granted.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,338.725,344.202,--The rule does not allow for that withholding of the mandate.
2004.04-514,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,344.202,356.815,No... so no circumstances can the issuance of the mandate be extended after this Court has denied the petition for writ of certiorari.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,356.815,357.535,If the--
2004.04-514,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,357.535,358.4,Under no circumstances.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,358.4,369.306,"--If the mandate has been stayed pending the petition for writ of certiorari and that petition has been denied, the rule requires the immediate issuance."
2004.04-514,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,371.881,378.093,"But... but you accepted the petition for rehearing in this Court would also count, although the rule doesn't say that."
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,378.093,379.975,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2004.04-514,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,379.975,395.574,"The rule speaks about the mandate should issue when cert is denied, but in this case, there was a further extension while this Court was considering a petition for rehearing."
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,414.891,415.035,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-514,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,416.726,418.843,So you say that that was wrong in this case too.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,418.843,422.202,--That was in excess of the court's authority under the rules.
2004.04-514,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,422.202,423.264,So... so your view--
2004.04-514,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,423.264,434.708,"I just want to get... if I may just get... you say there are no circumstances in which... where (d) is otherwise applicable, the mandate can... can be... the issuance of the mandate can be extended."
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,434.708,438.318,In our view the rule does not allow any other circumstances.
2004.04-514,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,441.986,450.37,Did the prosecutor... did the prosecutor object when there was a further extension given for the pendency of the petition for rehearing?
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,450.37,460.418,"--The State did not object to the... to the extension, Your Honor, because the... the mandate was of no consequence to the State in terms of the State's actual... a State court proceedings."
2004.04-514,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.768,474.38,I... I guess I'm... I'm not clear about the facts here.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,493.069,502.759,--The court simply ignored the... the... the process of... of the case... the extension ability in subsection (b) was never invoked by the court.
2004.04-514,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,510.151,514.811,So there... there is nothing from the court that... that says we... we shorten or extend the time.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,514.811,515.798,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-514,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,537.274,538.255,--Is that--
2004.04-514,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,538.255,548.814,"Then I guess that the... that the conclusion would be, if you read 41(b), that if the court has not shortened the time, the court's mandate must issue 7 calendar days after."
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,548.814,550.713,"--That is our reading of the rule, yes, sir."
2004.04-514,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,550.713,551.651,--But isn't that--
2004.04-514,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,551.651,558.599,Does that reading of the rule require that a decision to extend the time be set forth in any particular form of order or any written document?
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,558.599,566.013,It's our... it's our reading of the rule that... that the language employed in subsection (b) implies some affirmative action of... of the court.
2004.04-514,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,566.013,570.695,"Well, maybe they internally did affirmatively decide to extend the time, but they just didn't enter an order."
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,571.671,573.24,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2004.04-514,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,574.45,577.895,"What if they called counsel and said, we've decided to delay extending the time?"
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,583.448,585.48,--I don't think that would constitute an extension.
2004.04-514,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,589.304,590.225,It requires a written document--
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,590.225,591.019,--some affirmative order--
2004.04-514,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,591.019,592.306,--saying for how long it's going to be extended?
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,592.306,598.797,"--Some affirmative order of the court not only saying we're going to extend the... the time, but to give an alternative time."
2004.04-514,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.229,611.938,"Well, they apparently did decide to extend the time for whatever time it took them necessary to review the files that this particular judge became aware of during this period."
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,615.202,618.797,"All this record shows, Your Honor, is that the mandate did not issue."
2004.04-514,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,621.565,627.848,Did the court give any explanatory reason for what it did?
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,627.848,628.556,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.04-514,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,632.429,640.471,"No, but the opinion of Judge Suhrheinrich... I forget his name... explains in great detail why he thought they needed more time before the mandate issued."
2004.04-514,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,644.573,647.767,"But a single judge doesn't have the authority, does he?"
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,647.767,659.084,"Your Honor, I believe that a single judge would have the authority to extend the mandate, but a single judge would not have the authority to grant rehearing because that would be a determination of... of the case."
2004.04-514,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,659.084,673.014,"Ms. Smith, this... unlike the Calderon, which is a... was a... a court has authority to recall a mandate that has already issued, this seemed to be a really idiosyncratic case."
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,748.81,754.367,"It is an unusual situation, Your Honor, but the court did more than simply write an opinion."
2004.04-514,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,761.326,765.284,He couldn't have recalled the opinion because of the extraordinary circumstance.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,768.542,775.138,--The court always have the... the safety valve of... of its recall power under extraordinary circumstances.
2004.04-514,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,790.866,791.804,Let... let me ask you this.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,808.288,812.374,"--That's precisely what the court should have done in this case, Your Honor, in... in our view."
2004.04-514,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,828.448,829.718,--Have you surveyed the circuits?
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,866.843,870.246,"Your Honor, we have not done that type of... of inventory."
2004.04-514,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,870.246,883.962,"Well, if you have not, then my experience would be you're arguing for a rule that no appeals court follows, that... that all think they have power over the mandate, and that the question becomes one of whether or not there was a good reason for delaying the mandate."
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,883.962,884.784,Your Honor--
2004.04-514,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,884.784,888.276,"If there was a good reason, they could, and if there wasn't, maybe they couldn't."
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,914.495,916.713,"--Your Honor, our response to that is... is twofold."
2004.04-514,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,923.747,926.808,And all the circuits have just been wrong in their interpretation.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,926.808,930.781,"If the circuits are not complying with the plain language of the rule, then... then, yes, they have."
2004.04-514,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,930.781,932.973,We don't know that all the circuits have that interpretation.
2004.04-514,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,932.973,933.81,I don't either.
2004.04-514,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.81,937.112,Has Justice Breyer conducted the kind of investigation he asked you about?
2004.04-514,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,938.572,946.028,"Well, how many cases very similar to that... this exists?"
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,949.218,954.594,"This is an unusual case in the way that it's set out in Judge Suhrheinrich's opinion, Your Honor."
2004.04-514,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,993.401,998.328,Let's... let's take the hypothetical where there is an extraordinary... where it... it does rise to the very high level.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1013.173,1037.882,"Assuming there is an extraordinary circumstance, I think to prevent the result of having to issue and then immediately recall, I think the court in that circumstance, assuming there was actually an extraordinary circumstance, actual innocence of the offense or actual innocence of the death penalty, which we don't think was shown in this case... what the court could do in our view is to invoke its authority under rule 2 to suspend the rules for good cause."
2004.04-514,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1045.001,1053.117,"Well, it wouldn't have to suspend the rules for good cause since it has authority to extend the time for issuing the mandate."
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1077.325,1079.934,"I think that's one interpretation of the rule, Your Honor."
2004.04-514,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1090.728,1091.267,Tell me again.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1093.042,1096.584,"--We read the rule (b), the extension period--"
2004.04-514,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1096.584,1096.856,Yes.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1096.856,1108.706,--to be limited to the 7-day period after the expiration of the time to seek rehearing or the disposition of the petition for rehearing en banc or by panel or the disposition of a motion to stay the mandate.
2004.04-514,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1112.162,1115.852,"Well, it doesn't expressly say that in that last sentence."
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1115.852,1117.905,"It... it doesn't, Your Honor."
2004.04-514,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1117.905,1123.691,Are you going to address the seriousness with which this evidence should be viewed?
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1132.48,1141.414,"I would like to address that, Your Honor, because I think that... that the seriousness of this evidence has been vastly overstated in the concurring opinion of the Sixth Circuit."
2004.04-514,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1162.843,1164.208,Didn't she interview the... the petitioner herself?
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1166.939,1167.482,She did.
2004.04-514,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1167.482,1167.68,Yes.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1167.68,1169.626,She conducted some... some--
2004.04-514,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1169.626,1172.159,"At two different points in time, wasn't it?"
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1172.159,1191.177,"--Yes, she did, Your Honor, but her ultimate opinion was couched in the language of Tennessee's statutory mitigating circumstance, that... that Mr. Thompson at the time of the offense suffered from a mental illness or defect that... that impaired his ability to... to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, but that was not sufficient to meet the legal definition of insanity."
2004.04-514,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1199.71,1211.613,"Do you disagree with the factual point that I think one of the opinions made, that this study was not, in fact, known to exist by the members of the court of appeals panel who decided the merits of the case before the petition for cert was filed?"
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1211.613,1216.55,"Your Honor, there is a disagreement in the opinion itself that--"
2004.04-514,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1216.55,1217.709,As to how serious it was.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1242.747,1251.979,"--Judge Suhrheinrich represented that he was unaware of the deposition, and I have no way to dispute that except to say... I have no way to dispute his own personal representation."
2004.04-514,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1263.243,1263.594,How would it have been presented?
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1284.031,1285.113,It was a deposition.
2004.04-514,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1293.806,1297.838,So it wasn't... it wasn't in the district court record.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1303.16,1305.895,It was... it was before the court by way of that motion.
2004.04-514,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1311.522,1312.258,Was... was it before the--
2004.04-514,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1312.258,1312.546,But wasn't the--
2004.04-514,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1312.546,1318.929,--court of appeals in the petition for rehearing after the court of appeals made its decision?
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1318.929,1321.089,--It was quoted in the petition for rehearing.
2004.04-514,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1321.089,1322.917,So... so it was referenced in the petition for rehearing.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1322.917,1323.931,It was directly quoted.
2004.04-514,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1360.556,1367.208,You... you think it could not have been considered in mitigation in the decision whether to give a death sentence?
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1367.208,1371.463,"--Your Honor, I think it would have been one element of... that... that may have been considered."
2004.04-514,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.191,1384.3,"Calderon requires not just that it might have been additional mitigation, but that the defendant would have been ineligible for the death penalty."
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1384.3,1385.131,"That's... that's exactly right, Your Honor."
2004.04-514,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1385.131,1385.397,That's how I read the case.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1385.397,1394.676,"In Sawyer v. Whitley, this Court specifically said that and rejected the... the contention that additional mitigation... mitigating evidence would render a defendant ineligible of the death penalty."
2004.04-514,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1399.726,1420.664,"--Well, that... that may be but the... the fact that this sort of evidence would ultimately be kept out from the court of appeals and ultimately from the district court may be a very good reason for us not to adopt your analysis that what happened here is the equivalent of a mandate issuing and a mandate being recalled."
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1423.752,1433.746,"--Your Honor, we... we... it would be mere speculation to... for... for this Court or any court to... to conclude why this evidence was not presented to the district court."
2004.04-514,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1434.968,1437.208,We... we don't have to conclude why it was not presented.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1464.305,1465.869,Your Honor--
2004.04-514,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1465.869,1468.167,That's... that's my point and... and you may want to respond to that.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1468.167,1475.457,"Your Honor, my response to that is it is not that important, and when I say that, it is not that important because it would not even have defeated summary judgment."
2004.04-514,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1475.883,1488.564,"I... I presume your... your answer would also be that if it's a good reason for... for not issuing the mandate, as you're supposed to, it would equivalently be a good reason to recall the mandate."
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1490.906,1493.54,"--That is precisely the argument that we are making, Your Honor."
2004.04-514,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1493.54,1511.103,"--And I take it you also recognize that the bridge that we did not cross in Calderon was... # was in answering the question whether... in a case in which a court does not issue the mandate, we are going to construe the court's authority, its... its discretion narrowly or broadly."
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1513.209,1516.702,"It is, Your Honor."
2004.04-514,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1520.834,1529.35,What you're saying is... essentially is we should regard this as though what wasn't done had been done because it was supposed to have been done.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1538.7,1542.465,"That is what we're saying, Your Honor, because the effect on the State of Tennessee is precisely the same."
2004.04-514,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1551.399,1551.75,But let me ask you this.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1568.624,1574.196,"I do not think that that would be a sufficient reason, Your Honor, because--"
2004.04-514,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1574.196,1574.798,Why not?
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1574.798,1575.353,--the extension period--
2004.04-514,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1575.353,1577.093,Why does it have to be miscarriage of justice?
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1593.05,1597.156,--If the court felt... the 7-day period is not to allow the court to rehear the case.
2004.04-514,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1598.313,1598.435,I understand that.
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1598.435,1598.91,--a rehearing--
2004.04-514,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1598.91,1604.963,"I'm just asking whether if you were on the... on the court of appeals, wouldn't you think that would be a sufficient reason to say, hey, don't issue the mandate?"
2004.04-514,0,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1610.184,1611.176,--That would not be permissible.
2004.04-514,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1660.055,1661.191,"Very well, Ms. Smith."
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,1662.449,1671.777,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-514,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1687.793,1697.52,For how long after the judgment becomes final can a court engage in sua sponte consideration of whether to grant a rehearing?
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,1697.52,1708.448,"--Your Honor, if the court is acting pursuant to 41(b), which we believe can occur without a formal stay order, it... it can do that at any time before it issues the mandate."
2004.04-514,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1716.766,1725.242,What do you do about... about the provision not of 41(b) but of 41(d)(2)?
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,1729.082,1730.175,--That's correct.
2004.04-514,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1730.175,1730.286,Correct?
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,1730.286,1731.454,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2004.04-514,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1731.454,1744.291,And... and (d)(2)(D) says the court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme Court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari is filed.
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,1745.539,1746.936,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2004.04-514,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1803.512,1805.293,Don't you think it has to issue an order?
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,1835.662,1838.909,"Justice Scalia, it was proper for several reasons."
2004.04-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1870.333,1872.115,You're on... you're on the court of appeals.
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,1882.45,1886.956,"I don't think it's necessarily good practice, Justice Kennedy, but it is consistent with the rule."
2004.04-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1893.18,1897.984,It's consistent with the rule not to enter an order that you're extending the time?
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,1897.984,1902.694,"Absolutely it is, Justice Kennedy, because as I noted, the rule doesn't say by order."
2004.04-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1903.445,1904.592,That's a very strange reading of the rule.
2004.04-514,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1904.592,1919.647,"Do you know any precedent, any case, in which rule 41(b) has been invoked after there has been a petition for cert and petition for cert has been denied?"
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,1926.928,1933.657,"--Your Honor, there are cases we've cited and rules where the question comes up, does there have to be a formal order entered."
2004.04-514,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1955.205,1958.324,Were... were those cases in which they issued an order saying what they were doing?
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,1960.175,1966.633,"--Justice Souter, in the Sparks case, as well as in the Rivera case, no, there was no such order."
2004.04-514,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1985.892,1986.574,Is that... is that really true?
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2000.936,2010.679,"--Justice Ginsburg, it has some effects, but the... the critical point for this case is the power to reconsider is not eclipsed until the mandate issues."
2004.04-514,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2018.36,2024.205,Shouldn't the State at least be notified of the pendency of this sort of thing?
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2024.205,2029.928,"Mr. Chief Justice, the... the State was effectively notified when the mandate did not issue."
2004.04-514,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2029.928,2032.621,"Well, now, that... that really doesn't add up."
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2032.621,2034.093,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice--"
2004.04-514,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2034.093,2036.477,That might be a clerical error all by itself.
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2036.477,2055.083,"--It... it could be a clerical error, Mr. Chief Justice, and we... we think that's exactly why the advisory committee note... notes indicate that an attorney who believes that a mandate should have issued should confirm that he or she has secured a final judgment before assuming that the court of appeals jurisdiction over a case is completed."
2004.04-514,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2056.94,2060.481,But there was no doubt that there was a final judgment here in the death sentence.
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2060.481,2074.491,"For... for purposes of appeal, that... that would be true, but in... in this case, as we think the advisory committee notes made clear, the... the burden is on the party, seeking to secure a final judgment, to confirm that a mandate has issued."
2004.04-514,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2075.504,2088.393,"But it's so remarkable, isn't it, that the court did not notify the State and... and the defendant about what it was considering?"
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2101.465,2103.245,--Justice O'Connor--
2004.04-514,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2103.245,2113.699,And how... how could they possibly do the best job they could on the opinion without letting the parties know what they were trying to do and to address the issue?
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2113.699,2122.227,"--Justice O'Connor, the... the panel did get the decision right in the second case, and it did so in response to a thorough review of the entire record."
2004.04-514,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2128.69,2132.337,This was... this was how long after cert had been denied?
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2132.337,2137.328,--Cert. was denied on December 1st and the second opinion was June 23rd.
2004.04-514,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2163.311,2167.86,"But that's why I'm quite curious, but I only have experience in one circuit."
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2219.965,2232.274,"Justice Breyer, our understanding is that the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits, including the decision below, have all come to the conclusion that the ultimate decision of when to issue the mandate lies within the broad discretion of the court of appeals."
2004.04-514,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2232.274,2236.215,And they don't normally give notice or... or something like that?
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2240.429,2241.975,"That's correct, Justice Breyer."
2004.04-514,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2241.975,2244.731,"I think we might have handled it that way, but I don't know if that's the right way."
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2244.731,2253.814,"That... that occasionally happens, and... and there are some cases clearly where there is a formal stay order in place if the court is acting pursuant to (d), which we--"
2004.04-514,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2253.814,2260.053,They... they just do it even when they're delaying it for 18 months in order to reconsider the case?
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2283.408,2286.895,"--Justice Scalia, it... we're not... it's not regular practice."
2004.04-514,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2364.372,2385.454,"Well, to say there's no surprise to the State, that may be the State probably knew as much as the defendant about what was in the record, but certainly it was a surprise to the State to know that the court of appeals, after cert was denied, was pondering all this for that long a time."
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2385.454,2388.163,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe that was unfair surprise."
2004.04-514,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2400.286,2408.664,So the counsel should go to the... see the docket sheet regularly to see whether the court of appeals might be doing something?
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2408.664,2420.157,"--Mr. Chief Justice, at a minimum, an attorney seeking to secure a final judgment should check the docket sheet to ensure that a mandate has issued in accordance with when the practitioner believes the mandate should have issued."
2004.04-514,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2422.06,2430.609,And you say the State should have known what the court of appeals... before cert was ever considered because it was on a docket sheet.
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2439.313,2441.259,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe so."
2004.04-514,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2479.519,2485.673,What I don't understand is how your argument fits in with... with the rule that you can't recall the mandate.
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2527.751,2530.231,"Justice Scalia, I don't believe it's a technical difference."
2004.04-514,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2546.176,2547.718,"Yes, but they did grab it back from us."
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2567.402,2578.138,"Justice Scalia, I don't think that even the State's view would affect this Court's doctrine about what happens to the mandate if the Court grants cert because they're only talking here about cases in which cert is denied."
2004.04-514,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2586.693,2587.509,What if we had granted cert?
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2590.939,2595.055,I think it would depend on whether the mandate was stayed by the court of appeals.
2004.04-514,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2596.697,2597.198,It wasn't stayed.
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2598.114,2612.294,"--If the mandate hadn't been issued, then I think no matter how the Court decides this case, that depending on the circumstances, the court of appeals might be able to alert this Court to a... a change in the facts that might lead this Court to dismiss the petition as improvidently granted."
2004.04-514,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2707.181,2718.412,What if the court of appeals were talking about a point of law and the court of appeals issued an opinion saying we agree with three circuits and disagree with four others?
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2731.922,2736.514,"Mr. Chief Justice, we're not saying that this power is plenary."
2004.04-514,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2780.46,2782.198,But that's an intervening circumstance.
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2785.222,2797.766,"--That's true, Mr. Chief Justice, but... but we think that the fact that this is a single judge changing his mind is exactly why there is no abuse and why this isn't a case like Calderon where the full court stepped in 2 days before the execution."
2004.04-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2817.156,2820.505,"Well, we might address the... the issue of whether this is that extraordinary."
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2839.891,2845.629,"--Justice Kennedy, I don't think that's a reason that it is an abuse of discretion to fix that error."
2004.04-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2871.111,2873.996,"Well, but let's... let's assume for the moment... you may disagree."
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2883.771,2888.481,"--Justice Kennedy, I think that the Calderon standard should not be applied for several reasons."
2004.04-514,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2914.743,2915.584,So is recall permitted.
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2919.436,2920.699,"Justice Scalia, that's--"
2004.04-514,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2920.699,2923.386,--the same situation existed in... in Calderon.
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2923.386,2932.501,"--Justice Scalia, I think it's a little different only because in Calderon it was only an inherent power question, and this Court read the exercise of that inherent power in light of AEDPA."
2004.04-514,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2943.77,2946.612,Why wouldn't... but why wouldn't that be read in light of AEDPA as well?
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2953.732,2959.267,The abuse of discretion standard absolutely would vary depending on the facts and circumstances of a case.
2004.04-514,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2967.774,2976.855,"Of course, isn't it also true that in Calderon the Court didn't merely hold that it was an abuse of discretion, they held it was a grave abuse of discretion, but even... even more serious in that case?"
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,2976.855,2993.659,"Absolutely, Justice Stevens, and... and the Court's opinion suggests that even if it hadn't applied the miscarriage of justice standard, it would have had grave doubts about the exercise of that power precisely because it involved the extraordinary circumstance of reaching out and taking the case back from the State court system."
2004.04-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3003.649,3006.854,"Well, of course, this court... this... in this case the State court thought it was in the system."
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,3008.678,3019.136,"--Justice Kennedy, it did set an execution date but it was not informed either that the mandate hadn't issued or that there was a Federal court stay in place."
2004.04-514,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3043.274,3047.206,What was the... what court had granted the stay?
2004.04-514,1,36627,matthew_m_shors,,3047.206,3052.027,The district court on February 17th of 2000 had... had granted the stay.
