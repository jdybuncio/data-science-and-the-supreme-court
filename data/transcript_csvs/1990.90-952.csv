1990.90-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.787,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-952, Janice Clark v. Charles ""Buddy"" Roemer."
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,11.51,14.432,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-952,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,232.29,234.844,"Of course he hadn't disapproved any before then, anyway?"
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,234.844,235.183,That's correct.
1990.90-952,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.183,237.506,"I mean, he had always approved them?"
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,237.506,238.144,That's correct.
1990.90-952,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,380.13,383.924,On some cases should we be asking a different question?
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,447.707,462.289,"Not at all, because the Attorney General had no opportunity to examine the discriminatory intent that was involved in the creation of... or the expansion of the at large system to whatever number you had prior to the most recent change."
1990.90-952,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,462.289,463.358,"No, I realize that."
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,504.37,513.446,"Because the expansion of the at large system to that level had been motivated by discriminatory intent, and that's exactly what the Attorney General is empowered to stop under section 5."
1990.90-952,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,541.713,542.945,"Well, what does he do as a practical matter?"
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,566.66,573.916,"--No, I would think the Attorney General would then... I mean, obviously he could do what he wanted to, but I think he would object to both changes."
1990.90-952,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,577.068,583.764,"But he would at the same time be saying I agree with you, seven is the appropriate number, but because you failed in the past we will freeze it at three?"
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,584.905,587.546,"--No, Justice Souter, I don't think it's a matter of what's the appropriate number."
1990.90-952,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,614.884,617.137,"Well, but just tell me what he's supposed to do at that point?"
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,617.137,618.529,He's supposed to object.
1990.90-952,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,618.529,621.952,"Well, he objects, and what should the result be then?"
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,626.534,626.735,"Oh, no."
1990.90-952,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,640.596,645.861,Well why doesn't it comply with the Voting Right Act if they want to expand it to seven and there is no discriminatory intent?
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,645.861,649.852,Because there was a discrimination in the intermediate expansion to the level of five.
1990.90-952,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.381,755.232,"But McCain did not involve the kind of change that you and Justice Souter have been talking about, just adding another number where a prior number would be included within the later number."
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,757.135,760.848,Actually the subsequent change was a change in the number of seats--
1990.90-952,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,760.848,760.988,Right.
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,760.988,761.769,--plus a couple of other minor changes.
1990.90-952,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,764.372,765.112,Right.
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,769.556,779.483,"That's right, but McCain did not rest either on the dissimilarity of the two changes or any sort of... the dramatic nature of the prior change."
1990.90-952,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,779.483,786.926,"Yeah, but it's quite reasonable to say that a change in number does not approve a prior change in form."
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,792.821,796.964,"But, Your Honor, it's not just the number that's at issue here."
1990.90-952,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.87,831.285,"But what difference does it make if the change to four was bad, so long as you know that the increase to seven is okay?"
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,834.358,845.257,"Because you have an election system in that district, and a judicial structure in that district, whose expansion was motivated by discriminatory intent."
1990.90-952,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,856.644,859.017,Are you saying in this hypothetical that there are two questions?
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,863.141,863.611,Exactly.
1990.90-952,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,863.611,869.377,"And it's the second that you're concerned with, and it's the second that you find is a taint that will not go away?"
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,869.377,870.407,Exactly.
1990.90-952,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,878.541,888.077,"That still leaves you with the question of what you're going to do when the State comes back and says okay, you say number four was no good, I still want seven."
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,892.02,912.465,"--Well, the Attorney General objects to the voting changes because he has found discrimination, and then the State has to go back and if it wants to expand the number of judgeships in that particular election district it has to do it in a way that satisfies the Attorney General or the Federal District Court of the District of Columbia that section 5 is complied with."
1990.90-952,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,912.465,919.018,"So once it has made the mistake in going from three to four and not getting preclearance, it can never, it can never correct that?"
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,919.018,931.367,"Well, it can go back and submit the change from three to four to the Attorney General or to the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, and obtain preclearance, if preclearance is deemed appropriate."
1990.90-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,931.367,941.164,"Well, is that precisely... if you go from four to six, say, and that's a bad change, and that's not submitted, and then you go from six to seven and he approves six to seven."
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,959.106,960.698,Certainly.
1990.90-952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,960.698,976.85,"Could I ask you, what if we decide that the election was... permissibly went ahead, and that we say that the district... the court of appeals or the district court did not need to enjoin the election."
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,979.022,991.988,"Yes, you do, Your Honor, because the district court held that all of these prior judgeships did not even need to be precleared, they had already been precleared, and therefore the district court has said those judges can remain in office."
1990.90-952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1012.384,1017.497,"--But if the State wins in the D.C., all of these judges are going to be all right?"
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,1017.497,1019.477,If the State wins in D.C.--
1990.90-952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1019.477,1019.648,Yeah.
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,1019.648,1021.628,--All of these changes will be precleared.
1990.90-952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1021.628,1021.798,Yeah.
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,1021.798,1024.141,"Now, but if the State loses in D.C.--"
1990.90-952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1024.141,1024.621,"Well, I know."
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,1033.058,1033.996,"--Well, we--"
1990.90-952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1033.996,1034.858,Isn't that right?
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,1034.858,1037.442,--We have asked that the elections be set aside--
1990.90-952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1037.442,1037.952,I know.
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,1037.952,1039.765,--because the elections were illegal in the first place--
1990.90-952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1039.765,1051.662,"Well, I know, but if... you mean the elections would still be declared unconstitutional if the State wins in the district court here in the District?"
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,1051.662,1060.08,"--If the State were to win tomorrow, perhaps the courts could hold that it's okay to leave the status quo in place."
1990.90-952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1064.801,1064.951,"Well, I know, but--"
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,1064.951,1065.702,--judges should be left--
1990.90-952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1065.702,1071.077,--But if the State wins there's going to be no violation of the act.
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,1071.077,1075.861,"--There is a violation of the act now, because the elections went forward without preclearance."
1990.90-952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.861,1086.258,"Well, not if we hold that... not if we hold that the elections... that, just as a matter of equity, just as a matter of equity they didn't need to enjoin the election."
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,1086.258,1093.003,"There still... there still would have been a violation of the act, because State officials implemented it."
1990.90-952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.442,1120.341,"Well, so what would you do if the State wins in the district court here in the District of Columbia and that all, none of these needed to be... they needed to be precleared, but they are now cleared, you still think we would have to go back and set aside the election?"
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,1120.341,1122.895,"Well, I think you have to go back and set aside the elections now."
1990.90-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1126.417,1128.459,Answer Justice White's question.
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,1139.428,1140.938,"The Court certainly could hold that they could stand, yes."
1990.90-952,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1165.686,1171.11,"Well, is the matter of remedy one that we respond to in equity?"
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,1175.414,1190.945,"Certainly this Court has, and for instance in the Hampton County case, applied equitable principles, but only so far as to say that an unprecleared election should be set aside if the Attorney General's approval is denied."
1990.90-952,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1190.945,1199.32,And if that were done then all criminal convictions that had been obtained in the meantime in any of these courts would be set aside likewise?
1990.90-952,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,1199.32,1206.593,"Oh, no, not at all, just as all criminal convictions could not be set aside now, even though the elections were held in violation of section 5."
1990.90-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1206.593,1208.406,"Thank you, Mr. McDuff."
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1209.538,1218.825,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1251.527,1253.499,How many judges are involved in that group?
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1253.499,1258.121,I can't tell you the exact number.
1990.90-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1263.134,1274.984,"And if we say that those judges have never been precleared, suppose we accept your argument... I take you are going to argue that?"
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1274.984,1275.582,Yes.
1990.90-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1275.582,1279.526,What do we do then about those judges?
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1279.526,1293.875,"If they should have been precleared, it's our submission that because they should have been precleared and weren't, it will be up to the... the case would go back to the district court and it would be up to the district court to make a remedial determination of what the best course of action in this case is."
1990.90-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1311.928,1318.031,I suppose the State would just amend its petition in the court here in the District of Columbia.
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1318.031,1324.166,"The State could do that, but they haven't because the district court's judgment in this case was that those seats had already been precleared."
1990.90-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1324.166,1331.451,Now what about the... what about those judicial seats that now have incumbents that are among this group?
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1331.451,1336.957,"Well, it's... again, it's our submission that it's going to be up to the district court to make... it should be up to the--"
1990.90-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1336.957,1339.628,"Well, I know, but you're going to be down there arguing what should be done."
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1340.88,1348.045,--There... I think that it might not be possible to make a categorical judgment.
1990.90-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1349.907,1351.109,Is that what you're going to say to the district court?
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1351.469,1354.742,I think that we'll have to... it's certainly the case that--
1990.90-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1354.742,1357.914,"Don't decide categorically, just be with us, I suppose?"
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1357.914,1358.475,--No.
1990.90-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1399.243,1400.235,Enjoin them what?
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1404.168,1404.779,No.
1990.90-952,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1414.666,1428.534,"And if there are some that have been filled in this interim time, but weren't precleared, what about the actions taken by those people in the meantime?"
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1428.534,1434.949,"Well, it's our view that whatever... first of all, whatever actions have been taken by the judges in these seats are valid."
1990.90-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1443.855,1445.768,"It's... essentially it's a question of State law, isn't it?"
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1455.265,1469.853,"--I don't want to speculate about what State law is, but it would seem to me that as far as Louisiana law goes these judges are validly in office, and their acts should be--"
1990.90-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1469.853,1476.228,All you can really say is that it's not inconsistent with the Voting Rights Act to give de facto recognition to the acts of these judges?
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1476.228,1476.577,--That's right.
1990.90-952,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1524.224,1533.187,Are there ever reasons for a district court not to enjoin an election if the office has not been precleared?
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1533.187,1539.362,"Well, if you're assuming... assuming with the question that the plaintiff has made a timely motion, for instance I think--"
1990.90-952,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1539.362,1545.605,"Well, now, that was one... equitable considerations, I take it, pertain?"
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1545.605,1556.344,"--Well, the only one I can think of is where... and one of the cases, I don't remember which one, that this Court decided, the plaintiffs came in I think 2 days or 3 days before the election."
1990.90-952,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1568.721,1568.971,All right.
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1568.971,1579.921,"But once the district court has come to the determination that there is a violation of the Voting Rights Act, then I think... of section 5, that the seats haven't been precleared... then I think that an injunction is the appropriate remedy."
1990.90-952,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1579.921,1586.737,"And all of the reasons the district court gave, I think there were some five or six, were just improper as a matter of law?"
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1586.737,1588.049,I think so.
1990.90-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1678.231,1683.687,"Mr. Feldman, why does the Attorney General take the position that it's only the earlier approval that is invalid?"
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1704.775,1706.497,That's right.
1990.90-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1706.497,1712.01,"But since there was never a four, or a valid four, it seems to me those later approvals are invalid too."
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1724.237,1725.64,I think so.
1990.90-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1744.143,1746.824,Doesn't he know then how many judges there are?
1990.90-952,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1746.824,1748.385,He does know how many there are.
1990.90-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1769.0,1770.691,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1773.152,1786.091,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.003,1835.846,"Well, but there are some times you didn't make the request."
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1835.846,1836.647,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1867.357,1869.661,"Well, when you knew you hadn't precleared the sixth, though?"
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1869.661,1871.541,"--Well, I don't know that it was known, Your Honor."
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.837,1882.861,"Well, didn't you have to certify when you went for the seventh that you had precleared all your prior changes?"
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1882.861,1885.305,"--The 1987 regulations provide for that, Your Honor."
1990.90-952,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1969.605,1970.626,What is it... I beg your pardon.
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1990.511,1994.983,"There are several preclearance submission letters in the record, Your Honor."
1990.90-952,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2001.509,2003.879,Just mentioning the number that you want to add?
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2003.879,2004.03,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.784,2058.01,And you have... those aren't included in the... those aren't included in the... your action here in the District of Columbia?
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2058.01,2058.693,"No, sir."
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2074.12,2088.962,"Why haven't you gone back to the... now that the Attorney... you know that the Attorney General has a different view than you do, why haven't you asked that these prior uncleared positions be cleared?"
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2088.962,2091.231,"Well, we have now, Your Honor, and he said he won't."
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2091.231,2092.074,"Oh, I see."
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2092.074,2096.063,"And let me move into that, if I may give you one more statistic just so you'll know what's involved here."
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2096.063,2098.696,So does he say what the consequence is to his refusal?
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2098.696,2104.088,"He says that they are not precleared and therefore they can't, the election is improper and those judgeships--"
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2104.088,2113.986,I would have thought then you automatically right and there would have added those judges to your action in the district court.
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2113.986,2119.722,"--Well, what happened, Your Honor, is we went back to the Attorney General and asked him for preclearance."
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2121.332,2121.482,Yes.
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2121.482,2124.314,"--after this action was brought, we asked him for preclearance and it wasn't granted."
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2143.635,2144.036,Yes.
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2144.036,2147.719,But as of this point we didn't ask them because it has been granted.
1990.90-952,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2184.687,2187.939,What do you mean when you say Mr. Pugh?
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2187.939,2188.099,"--Well, Yes, sir."
1990.90-952,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2221.688,2227.591,Is there some evidence in the record that indicates that's the reason that the Attorney General declined to preclear?
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2227.591,2243.039,"--Your Honor, other than Mr. McDuff's statement a few minutes ago, I will cite to you the 9/23/88 Justice Department letter, it is refused because we are seeking to add elective judgeship positions under an election system found to violate section 2."
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2248.874,2250.536,That was before LULAC was decided.
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2250.536,2252.726,"Well, they have said the same thing since LULAC, Your Honor."
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2252.726,2253.427,"Oh, really?"
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2253.427,2266.417,"In fact if you look at the last footnote in their brief, which is the one that they say that the results test is under section 2(b), not 2(a), they also say that they don't intend to follow what this Court does in LULAC and Chisom, they say because it's a separate section."
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2271.58,2272.22,These are in the record?
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2272.22,2272.44,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-952,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2280.117,2286.983,"Of course if that was wrong, your remedy was in the District of Columbia, not by ignoring the disapproval."
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2286.983,2288.405,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1990.90-952,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2337.266,2338.137,Where did that come from?
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2338.137,2339.269,That was--
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.269,2339.83,How did that get here?
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2339.83,2342.013,"--That was a three-judge court action in Georgia, Your Honor."
1990.90-952,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.878,2489.737,What did the... what did the district court in this case... how did it decide that these positions at issue had actually been precleared?
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2489.737,2500.643,"The... they looked at the submission letters, they looked at the responses by the Justice Department, they looked at Louisiana law in terms of amending and reenacting statutes, and frankly--"
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2500.643,2511.59,"Did they suggest that the Justice Department's reasons for refusing to preclear were invalid or insufficient, or what?"
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2511.59,2512.05,"--No, sir."
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2536.261,2543.715,"Well, what business did this particular court have in... did they say these judges, they said these judges actually had been precleared, right?"
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2543.715,2543.865,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.865,2544.796,They had to say that?
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2544.796,2545.097,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2545.097,2548.82,They couldn't say as an original matter that we are preclearing them?
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2548.82,2549.591,That's right.
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2553.314,2555.675,"And what, on what grounds did they say that?"
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2555.675,2558.266,"--Well, Your Honor, they looked... several."
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.056,2585.245,"But isn't that kind of funny to say the Justice Department had actually precleared them when the Justice Department now says, now turns down, refuses to preclear these very positions?"
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2585.245,2592.241,"They said that the approval of a later position... of the later positions and the later increase in the number of judges constituted preclearance, Your Honor."
1990.90-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2592.241,2592.621,As a matter of law?
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2592.621,2603.83,"Well, actually they said a matter of fact based on the, both the nature of Louisiana submission letters, the nature of the Justice Department responses, and they also based it on a hearing, Your Honor."
1990.90-952,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2613.296,2618.091,Those letters were not about these.
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2622.263,2623.785,"Well, they were--"
1990.90-952,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2623.785,2624.757,Am I right?
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2624.757,2627.047,"--Well, they were about some of these, Your Honor."
1990.90-952,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2629.729,2630.958,"Well, let me see one about one of these."
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2630.958,2632.66,"Yes, sir, Your Honor."
1990.90-952,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2632.66,2637.133,Is it in the appendix?
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2637.133,2638.023,"Yes, sir, it's in the--"
1990.90-952,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2638.023,2639.085,"Okay, I'll find it."
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2639.085,2639.465,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1990.90-952,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2641.728,2642.517,I'll find it.
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2642.517,2645.421,Shortly after page 100.
1990.90-952,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2645.421,2645.78,I'll find it.
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2645.78,2651.306,"And again, what they said is they want us to adopt limited voting or cumulative voting, or something like that and--"
1990.90-952,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2651.306,2667.366,"Mr. Pugh, when we, when an agency does something for a wrong reason we normally... let's say denies an approval for an incorrect reason... we normally don't give the approval here, but we send it back to the agency."
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2686.999,2694.205,"--Well, I think, in the nature of this statute I think that's questionable, Your Honor, because this is supposed to be a short, 60-day approval process."
1990.90-952,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2708.216,2723.056,"Well, it may well be that the initial election can proceed, but your claim is that having used the wrong reason, the Justice Department is disempowered forever from passing upon the validity of the change."
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2723.056,2740.977,"Well, Your Honor, additionally given that they have conceded they have no problem with the addition of the number, that all that they don't like is the fact we elect them in Louisiana at large by designated post, I think they have conceded... now I guess one could argue that maybe they could try to show some discriminatory intent, but I think that's something that they could have done before."
1990.90-952,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2805.961,2808.232,What do you mean by limited voting?
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2808.232,2811.335,"Well, what... the Justice Department suggested that as a remedy."
1990.90-952,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2839.675,2842.086,"Well, by limited voting you don't mean subdistricting?"
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2842.086,2842.577,"No, ma'am."
1990.90-952,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2990.017,3009.197,"Mr. Pugh, I hate to take you back a little bit, but I'm not clear what kind of mistakes by the Justice Department you would acknowledge do not allow you to challenge their refusal to preclear in... back in the three-judge court."
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3012.4,3012.721,What can they make?
1990.90-952,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3012.721,3021.55,"Yes, what kind of mistake can they make which you would acknowledge can only be challenged in the District of Columbia, and not in the proceeding back home?"
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3021.55,3029.497,"I think if the Justice Department says mistakenly that we intended discrimination when we did not, that that's a de novo matter that goes to Washington."
1990.90-952,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3029.958,3032.859,Only factual... only factual errors by the Justice Department?
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3032.859,3039.503,"--I think if the Justice Department makes a decision erroneously on the facts in terms of effects it would make the same, Your Honor."
1990.90-952,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3049.32,3053.924,"Well, I understand that, but every time an agency makes a mistake of law it's acting ultra vires."
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3067.986,3070.016,--I don't... I wouldn't make it that broad.
1990.90-952,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3097.867,3114.459,"That really would upset Congress' scheme, though, to challenge the judicial review of the Attorney General into the District of Columbia, wouldn't it, if you adopted a rule like that that said, you know, for gross mistakes a three judge district court could correct the Attorney General?"
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3114.459,3119.982,"Well, Your Honor, of course you adjoined that dissent about the example that I gave."
1990.90-952,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3139.215,3153.885,"Well, but don't you think Congress intended, albeit by a de novo proceeding rather than by review of the Attorney General's act, to channel judicial determination of preclearances in the District of Columbia?"
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3153.885,3163.372,"Yes, sir, but I don't think Congress envisioned that the Justice Department was going to ignore this Court's decisions about what section 5 involves."
1990.90-952,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3189.311,3189.431,I would think you probably would.
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3189.431,3198.156,"But, you know, they have made the same argument and they lost in the D.C. court on the... in the Mississippi case that, you know, wasn't a retrogressive change."
1990.90-952,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3238.447,3240.948,I wonder if that really was a factual determination.
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3252.788,3254.347,"--Well, that's... yes, sir."
1990.90-952,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3254.347,3257.729,"Well, if... that really isn't a question of fact."
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3268.868,3281.357,"Well, Your Honor, in McCain v. Lybrand this Court held that the district court was clearly erroneous in determining that preclearance of the 71 act precleared the 1966 act."
1990.90-952,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3343.5,3347.213,You're now addressing yourself to a question raised in an earlier case?
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3347.213,3347.423,"--Yes, sir."
1990.90-952,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3349.306,3353.057,"I think that's probably not proper, because you opponent doesn't have any opportunity to respond."
1990.90-952,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3353.057,3353.267,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-952,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3354.629,3357.642,"Thank you, Mr. Pugh."
