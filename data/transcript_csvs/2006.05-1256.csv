2006.05-1256,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.28,We'll hear argument first this morning in Philip Morris v. Williams.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,6.389,20.944,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is here following this Court's remand to the Oregon courts to reconsider their decision in light of State Farm, a task at which we submit the Oregon courts completely failed."
2006.05-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,72.908,79.0,"Mr. Frey, are you talking about what is numbered, is it number 34?"
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,79.0,79.873,Yes.
2006.05-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,79.873,81.077,That's the--
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,81.077,81.795,Yes.
2006.05-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,109.861,126.372,"--You don't think that would confuse the jury if they are first told that they may consider the extent of harm suffered by others, and then the next instruction seems to say they can't?"
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,126.372,127.495,I don't.
2006.05-1256,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,155.516,157.499,Isn't that the problem?
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,176.789,188.002,"Well, the second part of it is, what punishment means is what would be done in a class action, for instance, to impose punishment for all the harm suffered by Oregon smokers."
2006.05-1256,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,188.002,188.268,Okay.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,193.157,198.06,"Well, let me say a couple of things about that."
2006.05-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,219.943,226.971,Where did the Oregon Supreme Court say it was proper to punish for harm to nonparties?
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,271.749,280.699,"Well, I would refer the Court to pages 20(a) to 21(a) of the appendix, where the court discusses, comes to its conclusion on this point."
2006.05-1256,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,343.018,346.922,Let me... let me... let me focus the problem that I have right now this way.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,381.94,382.362,--Well--
2006.05-1256,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,382.362,395.67,"So my problem is, if I think they really did have the wrong view of the law but the issue was focused at the trial court by a request for an instruction which I think was properly denied, what do I do?"
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,402.98,411.007,"--Well, I think what you do is decide the Federal issue, which I think is whether they were correct in the legal proposition that they asserted."
2006.05-1256,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,411.007,429.889,"But then they would respond, when they made that, when they gave that explanation in the Oregon Supreme Court, they were responding to a claim of error which was focused and raised at the trial level by the request for an instruction, which strikes me as probably an unsound instruction, an unsound request."
2006.05-1256,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,429.889,444.072,"Well, I guess we could leave it up to them whether they want to disallow the instruction for a different reason, but the fact is they disallowed it for the reason that you say."
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,444.072,444.712,That's correct.
2006.05-1256,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.712,447.196,And we can say that is error and remand it to them.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,451.974,452.224,That's correct.
2006.05-1256,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,452.224,455.192,"In effect, it would give you another chance in Oregon."
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,455.192,460.502,But I do want to question the premise.
2006.05-1256,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,468.343,470.311,It was a good thing we weren't instructing a jury.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,470.311,486.351,"Well, I don't think there is... the concept may be abstract, the difference between considering and punishing, but it's quite clear in this Court's jurisprudence and I think it can be made quite clear to the jury with the benefit of the proper instruction, and I don't... I don't have any--"
2006.05-1256,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,486.351,486.695,"Oh, I do too."
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,488.616,495.69,"--If we had this instruction, if we had this instruction which I believe is correct, there is nothing incorrect about this instruction."
2006.05-1256,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,504.28,506.218,"But it doesn't answer the question, if the juror were to speak up."
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,513.746,516.73,"--Well, I think the instruction said--"
2006.05-1256,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,516.73,517.433,Or not punish for other--
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,517.433,523.118,--I think the instruction says that you are to consider it in connection with determining the reprehensibility of the conduct.
2006.05-1256,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.118,523.399,--No.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,553.715,562.384,"Well, they do, because conduct that is more blameworthy, in terms of determining, as this Court has said in all its cases, and I know you don't agree with the whole inquiry--"
2006.05-1256,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,562.384,563.382,I don't.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,563.382,577.735,"--But as this Court has made quite clear, the reprehensibility of the conduct is an important factor in determining where along the scale of reasonable relationships in a particular case you might, the relationship might be reasonable."
2006.05-1256,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,593.198,597.822,"And when you do that, counsel, aren't you punishing the defendant for the harm to others?"
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,604.054,604.553,No.
2006.05-1256,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,604.553,605.834,--based on the conduct to others.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,608.036,608.27,I think you are--
2006.05-1256,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,608.27,608.724,--Excuse me.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,613.987,624.326,"--Well, I think that the semantical quibbling is not something that the jury would have difficulty with, in my opinion."
2006.05-1256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,731.034,731.768,"But, Mr. Frey, let me ask you a question."
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,752.009,755.679,"--It is similar, but what he can't do is punish for crimes B, C, D, and E."
2006.05-1256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,758.068,763.707,And if there was a second... the same defendant got convicted again for crime X.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,769.909,770.829,--That's true.
2006.05-1256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,786.619,791.852,That's not the same harm if it's a different defendant or a different plaintiff in the second case.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,803.097,824.401,"If this was a mail fraud prosecution for defrauding Jesse Williams into buying cigarettes and the punishment was five years for that, the judge could consider in setting the punishment between zero and five the fact that this was part of a scheme that was intended to or may have deceived large numbers of other people in setting the punishment between zero and five."
2006.05-1256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,840.878,847.407,"In that respect, how does the... there may not be a definitive authority by this."
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,857.029,857.56,Yes.
2006.05-1256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,857.56,858.216,--is my understanding.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,872.929,874.084,No.
2006.05-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,893.561,897.622,"But Mr. Frey, we don't know what Oregon law is on that point."
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,920.845,925.625,"--I don't, I don't think that... our complaint is not that the plaintiff is getting the money."
2006.05-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,931.404,947.49,"But if the law in Oregon were, plaintiff number two, you don't get punitive damages or you can get only the difference between what the jury awarded you and what Philip Morris has already paid out in punitive damages?"
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,947.49,951.411,"Well, first of all, that's not the law in Oregon."
2006.05-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,951.411,953.223,We don't know what it is.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,954.425,964.157,"Well, we have no... well, the Oregon Supreme Court did not rely on this, on this statute, for purposes of dealing with the harm to others, harm to nonparties problem."
2006.05-1256,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1034.846,1037.345,Can I ask you... are you finished?
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1037.345,1038.142,Yes.
2006.05-1256,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1048.747,1054.854,I wanted to know what you think about a suggestion that I got from something that Justice Scalia said.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1119.155,1125.169,"Well, I think the first part of your premise is clearly correct and totally consistent with the position we are taking."
2006.05-1256,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1167.23,1179.836,"Maybe, but it's possible the Oregon court would say: Well, no instructions are perfect, but... and no set of jury instructions is perfect."
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1204.543,1206.324,You're raising a question whether that would be an adequate--
2006.05-1256,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1206.324,1206.949,I don't know.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1231.642,1234.438,"--Well, I think this is a pretty fundamental principle."
2006.05-1256,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1257.585,1270.392,"Mr. Frey, I suppose your theory here depends on the nature of the underlying tort, I suppose, in that there are, you argue, defenses that might be available with respect to other, other individuals who are harmed."
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1270.392,1270.689,--Certainly.
2006.05-1256,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1270.689,1276.671,So this argument wouldn't apply in a case if the underlying tort weren't susceptible to those sorts of defenses.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1276.671,1286.261,"It would still apply because different factfinders, different juries, might reach different conclusions on the same evidence, assuming that a summary judgment for the plaintiff is not proper."
2006.05-1256,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1307.814,1311.86,The jury can't really find that other people were harmed.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1337.319,1342.285,"Accepting the premise, accepting the premise, we don't disagree with your conclusion."
2006.05-1256,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.47,1364.76,"--Yes, but I don't think I'm quibbling, but you seem to be conceding that this jury can decide that other people have been harmed and take into account the harm that it found other people suffered in deciding the penalty."
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1371.632,1375.77,It can certainly consider the scope of the intended scheme.
2006.05-1256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1386.548,1390.406,Isn't there a distinction between actual harm to others and the risk of harm?
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1394.748,1394.982,--Right.
2006.05-1256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1394.982,1396.731,"And he killed one, at least one."
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1405.633,1407.414,I think it is.
2006.05-1256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1408.694,1411.756,Would it be a proper consideration even if a second person brought the same action?
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1411.756,1417.973,"--Well, if there were more, if there were other people who had causes of action, then I think there is a problem."
2006.05-1256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1420.831,1424.345,But you're not asking to recover for the actual harm to the others.
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1434.825,1450.006,"--Well, that's what the Court said in BMW in effect, that the jury could consider even out of State conduct insofar as it revealed something about the blameworthiness of the defendant's conduct, the defendant's state of mind, the defendant's intentions."
2006.05-1256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1462.204,1465.688,Isn't the time to determine what to do with the second lawsuit is when the second lawsuit is brought?
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1465.688,1469.827,"--No, because the problem is a problem with the design."
2006.05-1256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1481.979,1484.056,"But can't I punish for the risk of harm to B, C, and D?"
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1484.056,1490.74,"--Well, if you're punishing for the risk of harm then the same punishment would be appropriate in B's case and C's case and D's case."
2006.05-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1490.74,1504.719,"But part of this award, at least according to the trial... there's a footnote referring to an Oregon statute that provides for the distribution of punitive damages between prevailing parties and the State of Oregon."
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1508.967,1510.905,"Well, it hasn't been paid yet."
2006.05-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1510.905,1512.56,But would it be?
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1512.56,1514.714,I think it would be subject to that statute.
2006.05-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1525.617,1538.079,"But if the State law provides that part of the recovery goes to the State, then at least as to the part that goes to the State you can say, well the State has recovered and you can't--"
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1538.079,1539.751,--But we have no protection for that.
2006.05-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1542.422,1546.702,--But then you can object in the next case if you're subjected to--
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1546.702,1552.747,"--And if we win the next case and we win the case after that and we win the case after that, when do we get credit?"
2006.05-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1552.747,1564.819,"--No, I mean when you lose the case on the merits and there's a determination of damages, Oregon says, we adjust for having a prior award."
2006.05-1256,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1566.74,1578.127,"Right, but the regime is flawed in its structure because it's a ratchet to get up to the highest possible level even though juries who understood the underlying constitutional principle might award less."
2006.05-1256,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1583.343,1583.999,"Thank you, Mr. Frey."
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1588.95,1591.574,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1678.07,1678.539,"You're losing me, counsel."
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1684.177,1686.129,--This instruction--
2006.05-1256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1686.129,1688.317,"As briefly as possible, one, two, three."
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1688.317,1705.107,--This instruction basically advises the jury to do precisely what Philip Morris argues before this Court it cannot do and that is to take into account the harm suffered by others in determining this disparity.
2006.05-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1705.107,1707.638,--you object to in this instruction.
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1718.29,1721.46,We don't disagree with that and that's precisely what the Oregon Supreme Court did.
2006.05-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1721.46,1732.705,"On the other hand, you cannot... on the other hand you cannot punish the defendant for those harms particularly in a case where the defendant might have defenses available with respect to those others."
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1748.606,1759.804,We submit that it was unsuccessful in conveying properly what this Court has held and that is sufficient grounds for the Oregon Supreme Court to uphold the trial court's decision.
2006.05-1256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1759.804,1790.683,"Would it have been a proper instruction if the second sentence had read, although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what the... what that reasonable relationship is, although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining how heinous the crime, the action of the defendant was, and hence... what, what that reasonable relationship is?"
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1793.511,1795.322,"Justice Scalia, if that--"
2006.05-1256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1795.322,1797.493,It seems to me that's all that's left out of it.
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1800.508,1809.457,"--Leaving that out made it erroneous because it said, not with respect to reprehensibility analysis but with respect to reasonable relationship."
2006.05-1256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1811.004,1816.032,Yes but reprehensibility analysis is part of the reasonable relationship.
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1822.265,1827.793,Let me take a step back because I think there is a confusion here over also the word punishment.
2006.05-1256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1855.703,1858.625,You're saying this instruction was too favorable to you--
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1858.625,1859.577,"No, I'm saying--"
2006.05-1256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.577,1861.124,--because it allowed them to consider harm.
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1861.124,1862.06,--this instruction--
2006.05-1256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1862.06,1864.606,"And you don't think they should have been allowed to consider harm, correct?"
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1864.606,1874.619,"--This instruction as the Oregon Supreme Court said, you know, doesn't provide the clarity that Philip Morris hoped to provide to the jury."
2006.05-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1882.365,1883.349,"Why, why... why though?"
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1991.15,1996.757,"Justice Breyer, if the instruction had been given the way you have just stated it we would have--"
2006.05-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1996.757,1997.132,I--
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1997.132,1999.1,--had no problems.
2006.05-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2001.068,2001.583,--Yes.
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2001.583,2002.443,And it's not what it does.
2006.05-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2019.217,2028.853,"Well, because the instructions indicate and juries often do this that punitive damages are certain multiple of the compensatory damages, and therefore that's what they are saying."
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2056.435,2061.652,"But, but juries don't look at punitive damages in terms of a multiple."
2006.05-1256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2075.897,2087.172,"Counsel, it seems to me the point you're making is not the basis on which the Supreme Court of Oregon said the instruction was properly disallowed."
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2097.685,2098.591,That is not the case.
2006.05-1256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2098.591,2098.935,Okay.
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2099.357,2109.337,"As Justice Ginsburg pointed out earlier, the citations that they have used in their brief are to the characterization of Philip Morris' argument."
2006.05-1256,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2129.922,2132.889,"And what about footnote 3, on page 18(a)?"
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2141.605,2143.697,And that's because of the nature of this conduct.
2006.05-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2199.815,2201.939,Because you read it's about harm.
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2218.543,2219.136,Right.
2006.05-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2219.136,2223.04,Now I think we all agree that that's an appropriate thing to say.
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2230.271,2233.77,"Well, that is precisely what we believe the Oregon Supreme Court did here."
2006.05-1256,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2246.124,2250.919,"What do you say, I mean Justice Alito asked you a question about the footnote."
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2314.831,2346.911,"I believe, Justice Souter that what the court was doing there which is somewhat similar to the analysis below in the Oregon Court of Appeals, was to talk about the prospective future victims of this fraud, that if it were not deterred which is a consideration that the Oregon statute makes clear, if it was not deterred then this kind of consideration for the same acts having the same effect on others then doesn't allow you to make sure that on that scale that this is at the high end of what we are--"
2006.05-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2395.314,2403.389,"One way to look at what it meant is what you argued below, I'm looking at the joint appendix page 199(a), the plaintiff's counsel in Oregon to the jury:"
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2430.05,2441.077,--Let me suggest that both the Oregon Supreme Court and the instructions that were actually given to the jury helped answer this by looking at the statutory criteria.
2006.05-1256,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2480.076,2484.044,May I just ask you what is the division?
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2485.261,2497.226,--60 percent of an award by statute goes to a crime victims fund of the State of Oregon and as soon as the judgment is rendered then the State becomes a judgment creditor.
2006.05-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2497.226,2499.724,That has no--
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2503.38,2520.935,"No, but the statutory criteria which requires that the jury find by clear and convincing evidence the following factors, which was given to this jury in the fashion that I'm about to tell you, constrains this award and I think properly makes it reasonable."
2006.05-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2584.643,2595.811,"The trouble with the more basic question, I don't know if you can answer it, but it is a problem, that when I... most States have factors like that, or many do."
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2649.632,2667.111,"But this last factor that I was about to get to, which I think provides a constraint that's unlike the ones that you've seen in other cases, and that is the total deterrent effect of other punishment imposed in any remedial measures the defendant has taken."
2006.05-1256,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2690.819,2692.928,Do you say this after the fact?
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2693.943,2694.943,The jury does not.
2006.05-1256,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2704.612,2710.172,It seems very odd that a major argument for constraint is something that the jury can't hear.
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2715.778,2731.116,"I would suggest it's not irrational because what you do is, you've given the defendant the option as a strategic matter either to present it to the jury or if they think that will guarantee an award of punitive damages against them, they can withhold it and present it only to the trial judge."
2006.05-1256,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2737.005,2738.425,May I ask this question?
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2757.636,2759.276,"That is correct, and--"
2006.05-1256,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2759.276,2773.178,"And is it also true that the part the Chief Justice quoted from 199(a), it seems to me that could be an argument that you should take into account the extent of harm to others, but it does not seem to me to be an argument that you can punish on."
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2784.72,2785.407,--There is not.
2006.05-1256,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2823.174,2841.746,"Do you think juries can, Oregon juries or juries anywhere can understand what they are told if they are told, you can take into account conduct directed at other people for the purpose of assessing how reprehensible the conduct is, but you can't punish for the harm that is caused other people?"
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2841.746,2843.324,--I believe they can.
2006.05-1256,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2848.351,2851.132,They can understand that distinction and--
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2851.132,2851.975,--I believe they can.
2006.05-1256,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2851.975,2853.63,--And you would have them apply that principle in this case?
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2853.63,2862.986,"They understood contributory or comparative negligence, and gave no award on the basis of negligence."
2006.05-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2873.575,2894.676,"Well, if they can understand that distinction, why wasn't the defense counsel entitled to argue to the jury just as you argued, you can consider the harm to others in assessing reprehensibility, why couldn't the defense counsel say, but, you can't punish for the harm to others, if as you answered to Justice Alito, a jury can understand that distinction?"
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2894.676,2899.034,I believe the defense counsel would have been entitled to make such an argument.
2006.05-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2911.873,2928.538,"So you think it would have been, putting aside what they proposed, if they had proposed an instruction that said, you may consider the harm to others in assessing how reprehensible the conduct is but you may not punish Philip Morris for the harm to others, you would have had no objection to that instruction?"
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2928.538,2930.146,I would have had no objection.
2006.05-1256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2930.146,2939.189,So your only objection is that they left out the reason why it is relevant to determining what the ratio should be?
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2944.906,2950.717,"I think it was critical and of course, you know, Oregon is entitled to run its court--"
2006.05-1256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2953.278,2954.012,But why was it critical?
2006.05-1256,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2954.012,2954.278,Why was it critical?
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2954.278,2958.074,Why was it corrected?
2006.05-1256,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2958.074,2958.324,Yeah.
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2962.649,2972.551,"Well, the answer is because, again, it was not directed for the specific purpose for which harm to others may be considered, and that's in the reprehensibility analysis."
2006.05-1256,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2975.832,2981.158,"You're saying, I think you're saying the jury couldn't have figured that out without somebody telling them?"
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2981.158,2982.533,But what this instruction told him--
2006.05-1256,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2982.533,2983.094,Isn't that what you're saying?
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2983.094,2984.078,"--No, I'm not saying that."
2006.05-1256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3003.196,3004.132,Too favorable to you.
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3007.38,3011.426,"You know, perhaps so."
2006.05-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3049.864,3059.624,"Can I make, just to get the ground rules here, you're not asking us to reconsider either State Farm, BMW, any of our punitive damages precedents?"
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3059.624,3061.343,"No, we are not asking you to do that."
2006.05-1256,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3111.089,3117.134,"--It depends when you say something about duplicative recoveries, because that seems to be a major concern."
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3117.134,3150.026,"This total deterrent effect requirement is the key here, that this is a part of a State statute that says that to the extent that there had been prior punitive damage awards that have operated to affect that deterrence that the State is interested in, to the effect that there have been other punishments, to the effect that there had been remedial measures taken to prevent such misconduct again in the future, then the judge is to reduce this award."
2006.05-1256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3165.879,3172.751,"But what if... your friend says, what if we never get assessed for any other case?"
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3175.125,3175.734,"--Well, you know--"
2006.05-1256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3175.734,3178.609,Suppose they win every other case in Oregon.
2006.05-1256,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3178.609,3188.949,"--Well, as a practical matter, they have been, they have lost both, the only two cases that have gone to a trial in Oregon."
2006.05-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3396.488,3397.285,"Thank you, Mr. Peck."
2006.05-1256,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3399.066,3401.191,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-1256,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3631.831,3632.768,"Thank you, Mr. Frey."
