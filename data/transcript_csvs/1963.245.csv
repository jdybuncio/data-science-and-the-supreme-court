1963.245,0,17956,bernard_b_polak,,151.844,155.076,"Well, that was because it was in the civil judgment docket."

1963.245,0,17956,bernard_b_polak,,165.841,167.202,"That is correct, Your Honor."

1963.245,0,17956,bernard_b_polak,,176.684,188.018,All of the judgment was entered in the file of the criminal docket against this defendant on -- on or as of April 24.

1963.245,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,205.223,206.092,(Inaudible)
1963.245,0,17956,bernard_b_polak,,206.092,210.853,"That appears in the original record here, Your Honor."
1963.245,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,280.704,290.031,When does the time for appeal start to run according to your -- your theory whether it's announced and opened -- a sentence then announced in open court or when it's -- it's --
1963.245,0,17956,bernard_b_polak,,290.031,290.906,Well it would seem that --
1963.245,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,290.906,291.684,-- reported.
1963.245,0,17956,bernard_b_polak,,291.684,294.726,-- from the weight of authority of this --
1963.245,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,294.726,295.475,I beg your pardon?
1963.245,0,17956,bernard_b_polak,,295.475,317.455,"From the weight of authority of this Court and of the Circuit Court of Appeals, we would have doubts as to whether we could rely upon the April 25th docketing of the fine as giving us a right to appeal."
1963.245,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,343.155,355.003,"Oh, they take the sentence as it was given in Court, why does it make any witness when -- when it was docketed after that?"
1963.245,0,17956,bernard_b_polak,,355.003,406.309,"Because the -- the docketing -- if the metaphysical concept of entry of judgment is to be considered, the actual entry into the clerk's docket as of the time when the clock starts to run, then it may well be that if the Government or the Court chooses to enter the judgment as a money judgment as well as a criminal judgment that the fact that this is effective the following day, at least gives him the right to appeal from the money fine or the judgment insofar as it is a money fine."
1963.245,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,406.309,413.68,"Well, on what -- what authority do you rely of the fact that the fine was a civil judgment?"
1963.245,0,17956,bernard_b_polak,,413.68,416.92,"I -- I have no authority, Your Honor -- I --"
1963.245,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,416.92,417.406,So why do you --
1963.245,0,17956,bernard_b_polak,,417.406,419.251,That -- that is an --
1963.245,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,419.251,426.247,"Why do you call it something different then, from the -- in terms of imprisonment?"
1963.245,0,17956,bernard_b_polak,,426.247,428.559,I would like to withdraw that.

1963.245,0,17956,bernard_b_polak,,472.853,473.806,"That is correct, Your Honor."

1963.245,0,17956,bernard_b_polak,,481.64,486.19,"That is correct, Your Honor."

1963.245,1,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,1815.762,1820.132,"On the -- the rule does not provide for vacation, Your Honor."
1963.245,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1837.917,1845.617,(Inaudible)
1963.245,1,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,1845.617,1846.857,"Well, that he can do any time."

1963.245,1,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,1882.281,1885.584,"Well, I -- I'm -- I'm not sure that you and I are talking about the same thing."
1963.245,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1936.217,1963.778,(Inaudible)
1963.245,1,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,1963.778,1966.563,I don't think it could be done in those terms.
1963.245,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1995.629,1995.881,Yes.
1963.245,1,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,1995.881,2019.593,"Once that's done, I would assume, although I think it -- it would take some peculiar and unique circumstances to -- as a matter of fact, I would be surprised to find a judge merely entering a judgment of acquittal except in the case where the indictment, let's say, was absolutely invalid and --"
1963.245,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2019.593,2019.981,(Inaudible)
1963.245,1,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2019.981,2032.741,-- and so that what you would get to eventually is that what -- what's happening in this kind of a case is that they got an illegal -- illegal sentence so there are a number of ways to get to this.
1963.245,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2032.741,2058.715,(Inaudible)
1963.245,1,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2058.715,2062.036,"Well, as I say I think that there are ways that this can be done."
1963.245,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2062.63,2063.175,(Voice Overlap) --
1963.245,1,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2063.175,2069.61,I have no question about its jurisdiction to do it if it's properly presented to him and I -- there's no --

1963.245,1,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2069.937,2072.079,I don't think that we've ever questioned this one.
1963.245,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2072.079,2084.139,(Inaudible)
1963.245,1,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2084.139,2084.969,I beg your pardon?

1963.245,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2308.161,2314.507,"Mr. Gilinsky, do you -- do you recall, I noticed the opinion doesn't indicate, what were the merits of Robinson's claim, were they constitutional?"
1963.245,1,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2314.507,2322.008,"There were no merits in -- in the -- in the case, Your Honor, because it arose on a notice of appeal."

1963.245,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2325.912,2327.088,What happened there is that it was appealed --
1963.245,1,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2327.088,2329.832,It was -- it was a manslaughter case in the District of Columbia.
1963.245,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2329.832,2332.396,It was a murder case in which he got a manslaughter conviction.
1963.245,1,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2332.396,2333.129,That's right.
1963.245,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2333.129,2334.359,We don't know what (Inaudible) --
1963.245,1,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2334.359,2334.576,What he would have raised.

1963.245,1,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2426.082,2427.297,That's right.
1963.245,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2428.551,2430.514,"So you'd be much better off without a lawyer, wouldn't you?"
1963.245,1,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2430.514,2431.887,That's right.

1963.245,1,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2527.769,2528.105,"Oh, yes."
1963.245,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2528.105,2530.264,Because of his lawyer's mistake here?
