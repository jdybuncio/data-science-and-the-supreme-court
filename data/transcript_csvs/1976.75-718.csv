1976.75-718,0,39546,richard_c_hotvedt,,50.96,54.756,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-718,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,189.876,193.672,"Now, did -- did San Antonio have road drivers?"
1976.75-718,0,39546,richard_c_hotvedt,,193.672,194.93,"It did not, Your Honor."
1976.75-718,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,209.415,212.124,What was the nearest terminal that had over-the-road drivers?
1976.75-718,0,39546,richard_c_hotvedt,,212.124,216.791,I think it was about 240 miles away elsewhere in Texas.
1976.75-718,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,255.08,259.66,There was no claim of any discrimination in their original hiring.
1976.75-718,0,39546,richard_c_hotvedt,,266.322,275.264,"And not only that, Your Honor, but at the trial, plaintiffs stipulated that they had not been discriminated against when they were hired at San Antonio."
1976.75-718,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,329.471,335.997,"Let me ask you a question, if I may, Mr. Hotvedt, about the class action aspect of the case in the District Court."
1976.75-718,0,39546,richard_c_hotvedt,,340.763,341.718,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-718,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,341.718,351.788,"Is it your position here, not only that there should have been no class certification on the merits, but that they were under some sort of obligation to file a separate motion during the trial?"
1976.75-718,0,39546,richard_c_hotvedt,,351.788,354.204,"We emphasize the second point, Your Honor."
1976.75-718,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,368.887,371.639,"Well, now, the -- those are two separate points, I would think."
1976.75-718,0,39546,richard_c_hotvedt,,389.565,407.29,"Well, Your Honor, it's our view that the -- that the burden for moving under Rule 23 to clear up the confusion in cases of this kind, should very well be placed upon plaintiffs whose responsibility it is to fulfill the internal elements of the rule as well."
1976.75-718,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,447.309,456.933,"But you still -- I understood the original statement this Court of Appeals could have said, that we will remand it for consideration."
1976.75-718,0,39546,richard_c_hotvedt,,456.933,458.345,Indeed.
1976.75-718,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,458.832,459.876,And they would -- they did --
1976.75-718,0,39546,richard_c_hotvedt,,459.876,459.88,They didn't --
1976.75-718,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,459.88,462.352,Was it argued in the Court of Appeals?
1976.75-718,0,39546,richard_c_hotvedt,,462.352,463.417,We did not.
1976.75-718,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,496.146,499.577,But in those -- I mean you're not limited to that.
1976.75-718,0,39546,richard_c_hotvedt,,504.386,507.648,"Well, is that -- for the reasons, I ask -- answer to Justice Rehnquist."
1976.75-718,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,507.648,513.669,"In -- in what respect would you have tried the case differently, had you not relied on the stipulation?"
1976.75-718,0,39546,richard_c_hotvedt,,513.669,517.16,If we had been assaulted frontally --
1976.75-718,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,517.16,517.169,Yes.
1976.75-718,0,39546,richard_c_hotvedt,,517.169,536.275,"-- with a -- with a pattern and practice type of case or with a broad class type of case, one brings to bear the kind of statistical and -- and expert evidence, it goes to the depth and breadth of one's trial preparation and -- and the extent to which one goes in handling the argument, Your Honor."
1976.75-718,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,673.582,677.015,And then what would you do after the Court made the determination of the class?
1976.75-718,0,39546,richard_c_hotvedt,,682.313,685.967,"We certainly would, but it would much depend on the shape of the class, Your Honor."

1976.75-718,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1059.29,1059.531,What --
1976.75-718,0,39546,richard_c_hotvedt,,1059.531,1059.664,-- within that zone.
1976.75-718,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1059.664,1062.986,"What the closest terminal that domicile drivers, over-the-road drivers?"
1976.75-718,0,39546,richard_c_hotvedt,,1062.986,1065.682,"About 240 miles away, Your Honor."
1976.75-718,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1124.187,1126.088,Mr. Penshorn.
1976.75-718,1,22935,edward_w_penshorn,,1126.088,1131.712,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-718,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1246.018,1249.688,"Mr. Penshorn, can you first give the jurisdiction --"
1976.75-718,1,22935,edward_w_penshorn,,1249.688,1249.95,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-718,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1249.95,1252.702,-- of the local?
1976.75-718,1,22935,edward_w_penshorn,,1252.702,1263.349,"The jurisdiction, the geographical jurisdiction, Your Honor, of Local 657 is bounded on the south by the Mexican border."
1976.75-718,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1275.79,1276.322,"No, sir."
1976.75-718,1,22935,edward_w_penshorn,,1282.944,1300.255,"As Mr. Hotvedt pointed out, Local 657 has no representation jurisdiction of any road drivers employed by East Texas because none was domiciled within the jurisdiction of this particular local union."
1976.75-718,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1300.804,1302.353,That means that whole area.
1976.75-718,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1302.353,1305.307,"That whole area, they were not within that area."
1976.75-718,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1305.307,1311.051,So the employees you represented were all city drivers or other city employees.
1976.75-718,1,22935,edward_w_penshorn,,1311.051,1311.415,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-718,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1327.634,1328.802,One other point.
1976.75-718,1,22935,edward_w_penshorn,,1334.236,1336.648,"It depends, Your Honor, upon where they're domiciled."
1976.75-718,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1354.873,1357.074,Not as domicile within your geographical jurisdiction.
1976.75-718,1,22935,edward_w_penshorn,,1357.074,1357.494,"No, sir."
1976.75-718,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1357.494,1362.089,Some drive through it and the -- the local to which they belong would depend upon where they're domiciled.
1976.75-718,1,22935,edward_w_penshorn,,1362.089,1364.75,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1976.75-718,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1593.165,1599.747,"You're not suggesting that the absence of such statements in a union meeting would be dispositive of this claim, right?"
1976.75-718,1,22935,edward_w_penshorn,,1599.747,1600.176,"No, sir."
1976.75-718,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1730.394,1737.273,"Very well, Mr. Penshorn."
1976.75-718,2,44068,william_baab,,1739.198,1742.198,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-718,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1781.706,1785.743,"Well, the company had a no-transfer rule on every terminal, doesn't it?"
1976.75-718,2,44068,william_baab,,1785.743,1793.079,"It lifted its no-transfer rule, as I understand it, at road domicile terminals for a short period of time in 1972."
1976.75-718,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1793.079,1793.692,Right.
1976.75-718,2,44068,william_baab,,1796.152,1808.694,"I would like -- although it's been discussed in the preceding case, again briefly, we address the issue of union liability concerning these seniority rules which are the same, of course, as there was any time you could see."
1976.75-718,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1866.67,1874.004,What do you understand to be the predicate for the Court of Appeals holding that the union violated the -- the Act here?
1976.75-718,2,44068,william_baab,,1874.004,1895.144,"Well, without putting it precisely, it states that because the seniority rules do not automatically grant to those who are alleged to be discriminatees, full carryover seniority, we quote, “Locked them in” and that under the Quarles line of cases violates Title VII."
1976.75-718,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1895.144,1902.643,But nobody has ever been transferred except for the -- if -- if the company discriminates.
1976.75-718,2,44068,william_baab,,1902.643,1903.955,But that -- that is the point.
1976.75-718,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.268,1916.731,But there's no special -- that's all there was in this case also.
1976.75-718,2,44068,william_baab,,1922.023,1923.182,And there could be none.
1976.75-718,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1923.182,1923.539,Yes.
1976.75-718,2,44068,william_baab,,1923.539,1927.743,Everybody admits it's neutral both in its origin and on its face.
1976.75-718,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1934.224,1936.936,And then -- I want to be sure what I understand.
1976.75-718,2,44068,william_baab,,1942.893,1943.447,Yes.
1976.75-718,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1943.83,1946.782,-- for the purpose of according adequate relief to the plaintiffs.
1976.75-718,2,44068,william_baab,,1946.782,1950.431,"Adequate relief based on, they found employer discrimination in a (Voice Overlap) --"
1976.75-718,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1950.431,1952.764,And assuming employer discrimination where --
1976.75-718,2,44068,william_baab,,1952.764,1952.985,Yes.
1976.75-718,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1952.985,1954.145,-- that will be found.
1976.75-718,2,44068,william_baab,,1954.145,1955.812,Yes.
1976.75-718,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1955.812,1962.139,"What could you have as a Rule 19 defendant then, ordered to do or not to do?"
1976.75-718,2,44068,william_baab,,1962.139,1964.861,"To honor the Court's award, like the place relief to those discriminating against (Voice Overlap) --"
1976.75-718,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1964.861,1970.314,"Oh, what do you -- what do you envision its rightful place relief in this context?"
1976.75-718,2,44068,william_baab,,1970.314,1983.452,"On a very general basis, as applied to this case, job bidding and layoff and recall, seniority and road jobs, that the discriminatee would have had but for discrimination against him."
1976.75-718,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1996.02,1998.122,On a ceratin -- at a certain date or --
1976.75-718,2,44068,william_baab,,1998.122,1998.47,Yes.

1976.75-718,2,44068,william_baab,,2002.047,2002.295,Yes.
1976.75-718,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2002.295,2005.378,-- over-the-road local would date from that time.

1976.75-718,3,43639,vilma_s_martinez,,2401.28,2403.748,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-718,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2416.412,2426.132,"Ms. Martinez, may I suggest that you lower the lectern so that you'll get the microphone if you'll lower the -- then you will be closer to the microphone."
1976.75-718,3,43639,vilma_s_martinez,,2426.132,2428.092,"I didn't know this is possible, Your Honor."
1976.75-718,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2428.092,2435.108,It's very flexible here.
1976.75-718,3,43639,vilma_s_martinez,,2435.108,2435.9,Is that better?
1976.75-718,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2435.9,2436.208,Yes.

1976.75-718,3,43639,vilma_s_martinez,,2538.795,2540.904,"-- the Southern Conference, yes."
1976.75-718,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2540.904,2541.483,-- or both?
1976.75-718,3,43639,vilma_s_martinez,,2541.483,2559.186,"-- Only as it relates to the States of Texas, we saw the class that would cover the employees in the -- in fact we saw the class covering applicants and employees in the State of Texas, the class was narrowed by the Fifth Circuit to city driver, Black and Mexican-American city drivers."
1976.75-718,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2559.186,2564.578,That makes quite a lot of difference in light of the argument you were just embarking on does it not?
1976.75-718,3,43639,vilma_s_martinez,,2564.578,2565.466,"Well, I think the statistic --"
1976.75-718,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2565.466,2567.134,How is it relevant?
1976.75-718,3,43639,vilma_s_martinez,,2576.896,2577.376,I'm sorry.
1976.75-718,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2668.129,2669.599,"Now, that's a company rule?"
1976.75-718,3,43639,vilma_s_martinez,,2669.599,2671.168,"Yes, there's a company rule, Your Honor."
1976.75-718,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2671.168,2673.848,The union had no part of that rule though?
1976.75-718,3,43639,vilma_s_martinez,,2673.848,2675.259,They did not.
1976.75-718,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2677.752,2680.38,I understand you're going to do the other two points now?
1976.75-718,3,43639,vilma_s_martinez,,2680.38,2680.78,Yes.
1976.75-718,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2680.78,2681.727,All right.(Voice overlap)
1976.75-718,3,43639,vilma_s_martinez,,2681.727,2687.573,But the -- my other point is that the other one is the petitioner's seniority system under the union contracts --
1976.75-718,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2687.573,2688.911,Where is that on this?
1976.75-718,3,43639,vilma_s_martinez,,2704.281,2707.324,That is precisely the thrust of our complaint.
1976.75-718,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2707.324,2715.111,"And now, why is that discriminatory on the basis of race, color or national origin?"
1976.75-718,3,43639,vilma_s_martinez,,2715.111,2716.645,"Because, Your Honor, in --"

1976.75-718,3,43639,vilma_s_martinez,,2720.083,2721.39,"Yes, I understand that."
1976.75-718,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2728.671,2729.052,Why?
1976.75-718,3,43639,vilma_s_martinez,,2729.052,2734.125,Because Whites could always get the road driver jobs at other terminals.
1976.75-718,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2739.208,2742.005,"Not one, but not a none in San Antonio."
1976.75-718,3,43639,vilma_s_martinez,,2742.005,2742.115,Not a one --
1976.75-718,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2742.115,2743.645,Because there were no jobs.
1976.75-718,3,43639,vilma_s_martinez,,2743.645,2745.407,There were no jobs in San Antonio.
