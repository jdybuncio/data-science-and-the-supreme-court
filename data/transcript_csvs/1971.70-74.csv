1971.70-74,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3676.209,3679.824,What kind of things?
1971.70-74,2,36768,morris_a_shenker,,3679.824,3694.333,"One of the things that contribute to the United Funds for instance as I recall I do not remember all the charities that contributed to various hospitals as I recall, I do not know if it was on the same years that contributed substantial sums to the (Inaudible) Foundation."

1971.70-74,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3730.278,3746.566,"Going back to this legislative fund, were they interested in supporting a legislation that affected the union or was it an activity like the League of Women’s Voters that is for everybody’s benefit?"
1971.70-74,2,36768,morris_a_shenker,,3746.566,3761.472,"I would say that it was for everybody’s benefit but naturally they were laboring people and undoubtedly they were interested in liberal legislation, legislation which would be good not necessarily for their union but for labor generally."
1971.70-74,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3771.13,3772.148,Thank you Mr. Shenker.
