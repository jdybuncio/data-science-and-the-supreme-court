1975.74-1492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.111,"We will hear arguments first this morning in number 74-1492, Washington against Davis."
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,15.047,24.585,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, at its threshold this case presents two highly important societal values."
1975.74-1492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,208.315,214.164,That is a total of 44% of all the applicants of both of all races were hired?
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,214.164,217.481,"No, of 44% of all the applicants were black."
1975.74-1492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,217.481,218.262,I see.
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,218.262,233.408,"54%, but this must be compared Your Honor; Mr. Justice Stewart with the blacks and the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area which is considerably lesser than the 50 mile radius from which the Department recruits."
1975.74-1492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,501.389,509.434,What did the majority held about Test 21?
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,509.434,521.393,"They said that in essence as we say that it is does not predict trainability, they took question where issue with is cut off score of 40 and they stressed the fact that since nobody fail a recruit school, we could not use it."
1975.74-1492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,535.138,536.94,Does he gear the policeman?
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,539.793,542.105,Is not gear the policeman Mr. Justice Marshall.
1975.74-1492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,578.422,587.142,"Mr. Sutton, the Court would never get to this question if you are right in your first point, is it not correct?"
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,587.142,588.038,That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1975.74-1492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,588.038,595.82,"The adverse racial impact, then any inquiry under the job relatedness of the test is never reached."
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,595.82,602.023,"That is correct, we would welcome holding a job relatedness as we can understand why the Court might not want to make one and if there is a slight impact and --"
1975.74-1492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,602.023,608.612,"If the Court does agree with in your first, on your first argument that is the end of the case, is it not?"
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,608.612,611.718,I submit that it is.
1975.74-1492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,611.718,614.709,"Our decision is construing the Statute it is, is it not?"
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,614.709,626.578,"Yes, Your Honor, Could I go to history, this test with its cut off score 40 correct out of 80 which the 50% passing score really, has been the existence for over 20 years."
1975.74-1492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,697.519,702.549,"But does not everybody pass recruit school, is that not indicated somewhere in the record?"
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,702.549,709.037,"Your Honor, the record indicates that everybody does ultimately pass recruit school but everybody does not pass recruit school tests."
1975.74-1492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,814.991,829.195,"Well, are we arguing as to whether it is a question for this Court as opposed to the District Court or this Court as opposed to Psychologist or the District Court as opposed to Psychologist, I presume it is basically a fact question is it not?"
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,829.195,849.338,"I think it is a question of rational basis Your Honor, and I think question in narrower stand to review, this Court can view the recruit school curriculum applied to what it knows about a policeman’s job and say that the rational relationship, that the question of whether there is a connection between what a recruit learns at recruit school and what he does on the job is legal one, not a psychological one."
1975.74-1492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,871.443,882.699,"Well, it seems to me, you can make your point, we can agree with you in that regard without feeling that this Court is the forum in first instance that ought to make these decision as to opposed to the District Court."
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,882.699,895.462,"But, counsel would have the District Court or Federal Counsel put the District to its psychological proof, to have a balancing of the evidence test, to have Psychologists take the stand and testify as to what a policeman’s job is like."
1975.74-1492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,897.031,906.659,"Well, but I think you would argue on better ground if you said it because it is a question of fact for the District Court not because it is a question of rational basis for this Court."
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,906.659,918.223,"I would be reluctant to say that Your Honor, I do not feel that in this area, we need to have questions of fact in the sense, so we have to put an evidence on both sides of the scale and build up a massive record."
1975.74-1492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,929.89,949.042,"Are you suggesting to the District Judge of the United State District Court who is dealing with Search and Seizure, Fourth and Fifth Amendment in Carey case and Miranda is better able to make an evaluation of what it takes to make a policeman than some clinical Psychologist is able to make."
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,949.042,953.027,That is exactly my position Your Honor and I only add to that.
1975.74-1492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1015.834,1019.947,Do we know what goes on the police academy?
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,1019.947,1030.303,"Your Honor, we have the curriculum before the Court and the curriculum shows what is taught there and this Court knows that what is taught there ties in with what the policeman does because this Court constantly reviews matters."
1975.74-1492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1032.3,1036.019,You must have been to a police academy?
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,1036.019,1037.532,Perhaps you have been Your Honor.
1975.74-1492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1037.532,1040.153,"I have, but I mean, do you know many other than that?"
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,1040.153,1041.042,No Your Honor.
1975.74-1492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1041.042,1045.108,(Inaudible) that is a good bet now as it is here.
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,1045.108,1047.108,"Not here, it is true."
1975.74-1492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1047.108,1050.726,Not in district either.
1975.74-1492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1050.726,1078.366,"Before you go on, This suit was bought in 1970 alleging violations of the Fifth Amendment, the Equal Protection aspect of the Fifth Amendment and 1981, you seem to be arguing the case on the assumption that Title VII applies, was the complaint ever amended?"
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,1078.366,1087.475,"No Your Honor it was not, but the District Court made Title VII applicable by analogy and Equal Protection kind of way and we think that is fair."
1975.74-1492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1101.195,1111.713,And it is applicable under the Equal Protection Clause or identical to the standards applicable under Title VII?
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,1111.713,1113.503,"I do not think they are, Your Honor."
1975.74-1492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1113.503,1121.213,All you have to show under the Equal Protection Clause would be the discriminatory impact?
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,1121.213,1133.723,"Let us say they are pretty close though and I think that the question is probably academic because we have gone further in this case and any Title VII private employee would go, I realize that --"
1975.74-1492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1133.723,1138.199,You are making no distinction between Equal Protection and Title VII in this case.
1975.74-1492,0,21554,david_p_sutton,,1138.199,1144.552,"Because we think -- no Your Honor, because quite frankly we think that the substance of Title VII has been complied with."
1975.74-1492,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2022.758,2030.92,"Mr. Justice Powell, I think that in essence, the standards are the same under Title VII as they are under the Equal Protection concept because --"
1975.74-1492,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2030.92,2039.254,"May I ask the question there; let us assume this way, an Equal Protection case is nothing else, when will the burden shift?"
1975.74-1492,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2039.254,2040.489,I think at the same point.
1975.74-1492,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2040.489,2050.406,All you have to prove under straight Equal Protection analysis is that mathematically more whites were being -- were passing this test and than blacks?
1975.74-1492,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2050.406,2057.101,I think the same analysis that this Court is adopted in Griggs under Title VII ought properly apply—
1975.74-1492,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2057.101,2058.57,This is not a Equal Protection case?
1975.74-1492,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2058.57,2063.117,"That right but it was a Title VII, but I believe that the analysis --"
1975.74-1492,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2063.117,2064.641,That is your case Justice Stewart.
1975.74-1492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2064.641,2067.589,Albermarle.
1975.74-1492,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2067.589,2070.018,"And I am thinking about that, I am thinking about sex discrimination."
1975.74-1492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2070.018,2070.94,Guilty.
1975.74-1492,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2070.94,2073.286,Guilty.
1975.74-1492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2073.286,2073.784,Guilty.
1975.74-1492,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2073.784,2076.492,That was an Equal Protection case.
1975.74-1492,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2077.702,2086.657,"Well, there was some question as to whether there was a discrimination found in that case or not."
1975.74-1492,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2086.657,2095.991,"Well, all one has to show in Equal Protection case is a mathematical impact that can be construed discriminatory."
1975.74-1492,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2095.991,2109.389,"Well I am not sure, I had be prepared the generalize question from Mr. Justice Powell, but I think in the context of a testing challenge, it is reasonable to make the same analysis that the Court made under Title VII, I mean the basic standard is the same."
1975.74-1492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2113.171,2120.513,"Well Mr. Evans, in Jefferson versus Hackney, we said that statistics standing alone were not sufficient."
1975.74-1492,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2120.513,2122.652,"Well, not sufficient for?"
1975.74-1492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2122.652,2132.14,Not sufficient to make out an Equal Protection Claim in the absence of a finding of intent to discriminate.
1975.74-1492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2132.14,2162.95,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1492,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2162.95,2166.358,"Well, I think that is right."
1975.74-1492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2166.358,2168.326,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1492,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2168.326,2173.665,"Well, frankly, have not addressed myself to this question because it has not been --"
1975.74-1492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2173.665,2178.842,I think it is important I mean that Title VII is the applicable now to the District.
1975.74-1492,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2178.842,2183.281,That is right and for the future Title VII standards govern for all public employers.
1975.74-1492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2183.281,2190.727,"So, it might be quite important in another context, but is it at least arguable here that we should apply a Title VII standard."
1975.74-1492,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2190.727,2211.68,"Well, that is the way I thought about the case and just the way the parties have approached it that this is basically a Title VII case and well, I have not fell through all the ramifications of applying a standard Griggs analysis to a case which was brought at the time when Title VII was not yet applicable to the District, given the nature of the issue for the future."
1975.74-1492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2216.357,2220.333,Is the compliant based wholly on the Equal Protection Clause of the constitutions?
1975.74-1492,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2220.333,2221.452,I believe it was yes.
1975.74-1492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2221.452,2225.063,On the Fifth Amendment?
1975.74-1492,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2225.063,2227.152,1981.
1975.74-1492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2227.152,2231.221,But substantively upon the Equal Protection component of Fifth Amendment.
1975.74-1492,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2231.221,2231.632,That is right.
1975.74-1492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2231.632,2232.787,Not at all upon the statute.
1975.74-1492,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2232.787,2233.234,That is correct.
1975.74-1492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2233.234,2234.739,Was the complaint ever amended?
1975.74-1492,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2234.739,2252.976,"I do not believe it was, I should add that there is one other complicating factor and that is that there is a statute which can be read as requiring the Civil Service Commission to ensure that all of its test are job relative regardless of any adverse impact."
1975.74-1492,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2269.122,2288.722,"Were the statute requiring the Commission to be sure that all of the test are job related tests unless there is an attack upon that -- can not one assume that the Commissioners have followed the law, does not help up defendants in this case?"
1975.74-1492,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2288.722,2292.26,"Well, I think there is an attack on it, at least to the point –"
1975.74-1492,2,40454,richard_b_sobol,,3484.809,3494.237,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, I would like to start with Justice Powell’s inquiry concerning the basis of the suit and to clarify, one or two misconceptions that have creped in."
1975.74-1492,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3629.188,3633.513,"Mr. Sobol your prayer in the District Court was basically for the declaratory judgment, was it not?"
1975.74-1492,2,40454,richard_b_sobol,,3633.513,3636.47,No sir for declaratory judgment and injunction in back pay.
1975.74-1492,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3636.47,3651.634,"Okay, well certainly so far as declaratory judgment and injunction are concerned, that has never been issued by the District Court in your favor anyway since 1972 to Title VII has applied."
1975.74-1492,2,40454,richard_b_sobol,,3651.634,3652.678,Yes sir.
1975.74-1492,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3652.678,3660.921,Any declaratory judgment that you would now get or injunctive relief that you would now get would have to based on Title VII was it not?
1975.74-1492,2,40454,richard_b_sobol,,3660.921,3663.679,"Well, not necessarily."
1975.74-1492,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3688.346,3705.352,"But what useful purpose or indeed what case or controversy would the District Court be deciding, if it were to now enter a declaratory judgment or an injunction one way or the other in this case based on the law that governed in the District of Columbia before 1972?"
1975.74-1492,2,40454,richard_b_sobol,,3705.352,3707.818,"Well, this law is still governs."
1975.74-1492,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,5928.756,5932.319,"A few brief points Your Honor, in an answer to the most recent question."
1975.74-1492,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5962.473,5966.491,"Well, if counsel found as an advocate by everything he may have said as an author, I would hope not."
1975.74-1492,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,5966.491,5971.736,"No Your Honor it is not, but it should be the --"
1975.74-1492,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5971.736,5973.538,You are simply saying he was right at the first time.
1975.74-1492,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,5973.538,5980.927,He was right the first time and we should not discount common sense in the handling of cases.
1975.74-1492,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5982.413,5983.93,Certainly it has a different point.
1975.74-1492,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,5989.265,5990.716,Right!
1975.74-1492,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5990.716,5996.275,"And so we tell by looking at this test whether or not it measures the ability to Shakespeare, the ability to read search warrants."
1975.74-1492,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,5996.275,6014.184,"Your Honor all I can say to you there is that the Federal Government putting an affidavit of a psychologist which counsel did not dispute, the affidavit of Diane Wilson, which equates the verbal ability with Test 21, with that require to get to recruit school, and that same psychologist analyze study materials."
1975.74-1492,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6083.371,6087.793,"By high school level, what do you mean nationwide?"
1975.74-1492,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,6087.793,6088.764,High School level Your Honor?
1975.74-1492,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6088.764,6089.534,Yes sir.
1975.74-1492,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,6089.534,6091.723,I think that we can be concerned with --
1975.74-1492,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6091.723,6096.163,"In this record what does it mean, because it poured all around?"
1975.74-1492,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,6096.163,6099.358,It means the proper high school education requirement.
1975.74-1492,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6099.358,6103.231,Involving that area?
1975.74-1492,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,6103.231,6105.806,"In general, we put --"
1975.74-1492,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6105.806,6113.551,"Suppose the high schools in this area are very low, would anything be done about that?"
