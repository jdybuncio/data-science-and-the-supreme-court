1977.76-1040,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,92.854,"We will hear arguments next in, 76-1040, Sanabria against the United States."
1977.76-1040,0,23805,francis_j_dimento,,96.15,99.134,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court."
1977.76-1040,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,499.898,514.433,"Am I correct that, so far, you admit that you started out in this case, decree the condition where you would have what you consider a full-proof double jeopardy plan?"
1977.76-1040,0,23805,francis_j_dimento,,514.433,515.4,I do not know.
1977.76-1040,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,518.255,520.916,You said you have made the specious argument and all that?
1977.76-1040,0,23805,francis_j_dimento,,522.258,531.416,I made a specious argument moving for judgment of acquittal when the proper motion should have been motion to dismiss the indictment.
1977.76-1040,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,591.241,605.663,"Your point was that since the indictment had not recited in detail each of the Massachusetts statute that was thought to be violated, and a necessary prerequisite for the federal offense, this motion was in order."
1977.76-1040,0,23805,francis_j_dimento,,605.663,607.087,"Not quite, your honor."
1977.76-1040,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,617.336,620.684,"When you say particularized, do you mean alleged in the indictment?"
1977.76-1040,0,23805,francis_j_dimento,,620.684,622.895,Particularly alleged in the indictment.
1977.76-1040,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,622.895,631.406,It was your view that the indictment to be sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss had to allege chapter and verse of the Massachusetts law.
1977.76-1040,0,23805,francis_j_dimento,,631.406,632.657,"No, not that either."
1977.76-1040,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,650.772,667.042,"It was a misleading contention on your part that since they did not have to specify anything but they did specify one section and, therefore, you have been more or less misled so that you were prepared to defend only as to that aspect?"
1977.76-1040,0,23805,francis_j_dimento,,667.042,676.637,I really did not think I had to show that I was misled or prejudiced because it is part of the due process that you prove what is charged and you charge what you intend to prove.
1977.76-1040,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,779.694,785.58,"But when you move, you in effect, waived your right to have the jury return that verdict."
1977.76-1040,0,23805,francis_j_dimento,,788.461,789.456,"I do not think so, your honor."
1977.76-1040,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,805.02,824.791,"In so far as the Double Jeopardy Clause protection though one of them has the right to go to the jury that is empaneled and have your determination come from that first jury, do you not think when you make a motion like you do, you waive that right in favor of some preferred method of determination?"
1977.76-1040,0,23805,francis_j_dimento,,824.791,826.359,I do not think of it as a waiver.
1977.76-1040,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,844.078,846.908,But you are not willing to let them arrive at.
1977.76-1040,0,23805,francis_j_dimento,,850.234,850.914,I would have been willing.
1977.76-1040,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,850.914,853.505,But you were not because you made the motion.
1977.76-1040,0,23805,francis_j_dimento,,853.505,855.19,Because I was following the rules.
1977.76-1040,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2047.142,2050.121,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1977.76-1040,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2110.601,2129.258,"I think we will pick up there at 1:00, Mr. Easterbrook."
1977.76-1040,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2132.625,2135.832,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1977.76-1040,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2226.277,2226.826,Wait.
1977.76-1040,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2232.591,2233.147,I think so.
1977.76-1040,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2243.619,2246.925,Do you suggest that that is a form of waiver?
1977.76-1040,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2246.925,2249.442,"No, I do not believe it is a formal waiver of any sort."
1977.76-1040,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2249.442,2256.016,"It is a form of, not formal, a form or a kind of waiver."
1977.76-1040,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2256.016,2258.952,"We have not relied on it as a waiver, your honor."
