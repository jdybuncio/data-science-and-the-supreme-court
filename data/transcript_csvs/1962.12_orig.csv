1962.12_orig,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1512.052,1513.014,That's correct.

1962.12_orig,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1559.79,1564.806,"Yes, that is our position your Honor."
1962.12_orig,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1757.266,1759.549,Is that in the record?

1962.12_orig,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1986.332,1996.799,"I think I do, because the defendant may have some other basis on which perhaps these lands will not be conveyable."

1962.12_orig,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2035.981,2042.299,I would think we could then get a mandamus Your Honor.

1962.12_orig,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2052.853,2058.251,No effort that has been organized along that line Your Honor.
1962.12_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2173.713,2177.664,Mr. Lyons you say you were relying on the plain language of subsection (c).
1962.12_orig,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2177.664,2179.398,Yes Your Honor.
1962.12_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2179.398,2190.929,Isn't the phrase set aside rather a little less than plain if we are talking about something which has been condemned by and is owned by the United States?
1962.12_orig,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2190.929,2192.199,"Your Honor, that is another --"

1962.12_orig,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2216.959,2226.641,Your Honor this I think leads us directly into another argument which the defendant makes about which I like to speak.
1962.12_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2241.437,2243.708,That it necessarily refers to ceded lands.
1962.12_orig,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2243.708,2269.146,"Well, that view was taken for a while by some of the agencies of the government, but the Solicitor General's position now as I understand it is that it applies both to the -- only to the territorial land and to the ceded land, those two categories, otherwise he is in trouble with definition in Section 5(g)."
1962.12_orig,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2821.449,2835.573,I'm going to ask you that's an argument has to be drawn [Inaudible]
1962.12_orig,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2835.573,2841.921,"There is really nothing of any consequence in the hearings, in the debates."
1962.12_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2862.192,2870.801,"There is a reference to your argument in the Attorney General's opinion but I suppose that's just responsive to your argument, rather than responsive to anybody in the legislative history."
1962.12_orig,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2870.801,2879.866,"Yes, he states that the -- somehow the house's declaration was negated by the fact that the Senate didn't take the position on the matter in the same year."
1962.12_orig,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2911.19,2922.598,[Inaudible]
1962.12_orig,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2922.598,2926.192,I think they were consulting throughout your Honor.

1962.12_orig,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2959.422,2969.123,"I believe that it did, but whether precisely the final form did or not I'm just not certain Your Honor."

1962.12_orig,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3028.414,3042.818,It has the right to make the determination whether it is needed or not and I would think that any attempt to review that question would entail the most serious of difficulties.
1962.12_orig,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3042.818,3045.099,[Inaudible]
1962.12_orig,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3045.099,3054.178,"There is no provision for judicial review in the Act, it is not an Act which sets up a series of private rights."
1962.12_orig,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3059.207,3063.36,Mr. Barnett.
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3063.36,3066.088,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1962.12_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3306.539,3314.489,Are you saying in fact that the (c) and (e) really could be reenacted -- these two sentences.
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3314.489,3316.883,These are the antecedents.
1962.12_orig,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3344.665,3347.214,[Inaudible]
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3347.214,3351.128,"That's right, this simply says it maybe taken for a use."
1962.12_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3520.475,3522.682,Where can we find these readily?
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3522.682,3527.277,"That's page, it is in page 3 of the State's, I think the appendix."
1962.12_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3527.277,3531.159,All right.
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3531.159,3542.391,So Subsection (a) gave to the state the territorial properties subject to the stated exception as provided in Subsection (c).
1962.12_orig,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3794.04,3797.45,[Inaudible] I think (g).
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3797.45,3807.811,(g); first to find public lands have been ceded and says that the term any land shall include that.
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3965.388,3968.334,What lands are given away?
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3968.334,3975.456,"By Subsection (e), the basic grant is of ceded in territorial properties."

1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4035.44,4038.206,I want to go through the paragraphs and show what the changes are.
1962.12_orig,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4135.192,4151.292,We will recess now Mr. --
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4151.292,4153.103,Mr. Chief Justice.
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4336.941,4341.49,"May I ask you Mr. Barnett, I'm not sure that is in history."
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4361.097,4377.226,The federal properties -- I am unaware of any case in which under a state land grant or properties purchased by the United States from private persons or condemned specific parcels have been given to the state.
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4417.233,4417.506,In other words –-
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4417.506,4418.428,-- the Surplus Prosperity Act.
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4418.428,4420.465,-- let me make sure I understand you then you go.
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4420.465,4421.073,Yes.
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4421.073,4440.894,"As I understand you, therefore the government has bought property for use for military installation or for a post office or for something of that kind, it has always owned that property, absolutely and to dispose of it even though the property cease to be used for the purpose for which it was purchased?"
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4440.894,4441.847,"Yes sir, quite true."
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4471.596,4491.732,"I recall we've had some cases that perhaps the reason the authority did, railroad, we had one case in particular, the problem was who the title would go back to if the railroad cease to use its property for a railroad that was quite a question, problem?"
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4491.732,4494.502,"I don't know the case, I guess it would come back to the United States."
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4494.502,4495.335,What is that?
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4495.335,4498.846,"I don't know the case, my guess would be it would comeback to the United States."
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4499.638,4501.867,"Well, this was not a United States case."
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4502.833,4502.981,I'm sorry.
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4502.981,4507.93,It came to us from Illinois where they were [Inaudible] some oil --
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4507.93,4508.852,No I think the federal land --
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4508.852,4510.867,Or right of way.
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4510.867,4513.26,They were made to support the building the railroads.
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4513.26,4518.275,What's the history and connection with the state condemnation than purchases of property?
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4518.275,4522.756,"Well, I don't suppose they would have a similar question, after -- before the --"
1962.12_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4522.756,4530.282,"Well Mr. Barnett I can tell you this, because that came up in my state when I sat on the New Jersey Supreme Court."
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4554.366,4558.553,They made a contribution -- well I don't still --
1962.12_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4558.553,4560.352,But that was the problem.
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4560.352,4565.834,"But no, is the status of -- well certainly the status can be --"
1962.12_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4565.834,4568.443,I don't remember how we decided it.
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4571.002,4576.129,"The status of the public land, the public lands of Hawaii are very different any other state."
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4614.409,4619.861,"Well do any of the other states, have any of them had an agreement of this kind?"
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4619.861,4629.716,"Oh, I grant you if this agreement encompasses this kind of property there is a reason apart from -- I hope to show that --"
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4629.716,4630.212,Yes I understand.
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4641.513,4646.665,I'm unaware of any possible or similar problem of that sort.
1962.12_orig,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4646.665,4654.785,At some point I wish you would come back to the small exchange we had and tell me why you think (g) is red herring?
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4654.785,4661.599,"The argument, they make -- the statute says any land, rather than I suppose what they mean they should say any public land."
1962.12_orig,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4661.599,4675.922,"Yeah, I know but (g) certainly shows apart from the arguments you are making that the Act was intended to cover the waterfront as one would suppose, Congress would do an important --"
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4675.922,4678.456,I would doubt that (g) shows that.
1962.12_orig,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4741.41,4752.308,[Inaudible] this controversy arose [Inaudible]
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4752.308,4753.37,Yes sir.
1962.12_orig,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4753.37,4768.801,And at least they were familiar with properties [Inaudible]
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4768.801,4773.654,Now I'm rather inclined to think that's what they meant to say.
1962.12_orig,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4810.948,4820.564,[Inaudible] as I recall Attorney General's opinion Congress of the United States have said that according to Senate Committee [Inaudible]
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4820.564,4821.046,"Oh yeah, yeah."
1962.12_orig,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4821.046,4822.982,[Inaudible] they didn't have time.
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4822.982,4825.839,"That's right, they just said -- they said we don't have time."
1962.12_orig,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4827.783,4830.02,Has anything happened since that time?
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4830.02,4832.269,Nothing officially.
1962.12_orig,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4832.269,4834.617,The committee has not [Inaudible]
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4834.617,4837.137,No.
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4837.137,4853.57,"Are we correct in assuming the only consequences of this lawsuit relate to whether the land the government doesn't need in Hawaii, it gives up because it doesn't need it."
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4858.679,4860.295,That is my understanding.
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4868.598,4870.757,Part of that –-
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4870.757,4875.088,"I don't know -- someone has suggested something $15 million, $20 million dollars worth."
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4875.088,4875.962,About what?
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4875.962,4882.479,"But I don't even want to give the figures since it's so much out of the air, something on the order of $15 million or $20 million is perhaps a guess."
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4882.479,4884.691,"So this is a lawsuit of over $15 million to $20 million, if that's about right?"
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4884.691,4888.812,"Yes, but that's what it's about."
1962.12_orig,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4903.55,4918.351,So Mr. Barnett what do you [Inaudible]
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4918.351,4926.254,"Perhaps you do, I'm confident that no one that sat down to draft a statute to talk about condemned lands, to use that language."
1962.12_orig,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4926.254,4928.689,How would you describe it in your own language?
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4928.689,4931.574,I would call it a purchase or a condemnation.
1962.12_orig,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4931.574,4935.934,What happens to the land [Inaudible]
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4935.934,4941.909,"I would not talk about transferring the use of it, I would talk about transferring the feasible ownership of it."
1962.12_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4941.909,4942.703,Acquisition?
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4942.703,4943.693,Acquisition --
1962.12_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4943.693,4950.904,"When you go to a shoe store you don't say I'm here to set aside a pair of shoes for the use of Mr. Barnett, you say I'm here to buy a pair of shoes."
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4950.904,4954.008,"That's right, that's right, but let me go into the other aspect of this --"

1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4955.056,4956.073,For use.
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5070.011,5072.584,What was the title of the act?
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5072.584,5076.764,"No, I agree that we have no trouble carving it down by an implication."
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5086.541,5090.656,Are you agreeing that literally that Congress has agreed to what they say?
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5090.656,5107.781,"Oh yes, but we say the – (c) and (e) are confined to Hawaii because (a) and (b) are confined to Hawaii, and if you read (c) as an exception to (a) and (b) you have no problem."
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5140.646,5144.216,Has the state indicated what it wants this property for?
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5145.462,5154.083,"No, they specifically pointed to four housing projects which they say are -- they would use as low cost public housing."
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5154.083,5156.61,State public housing?
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5156.61,5162.371,"As I -- I don't quite know what the arrangements would be, but they want to use it as low cost housing."
1962.12_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5162.371,5165.073,"Now existing federal housing projects, aren't they?"
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5165.073,5165.732,"Yes, they are housing --"
1962.12_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5165.732,5166.434,They have already been developed --
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5166.434,5169.655,"They were navy, for navy personnel originally."
1962.12_orig,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5169.655,5173.11,What this all comes down to as I understand it.
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5180.212,5181.301,I don't mean to be in agreement with that.
1962.12_orig,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5181.301,5182.042,Aren't you?
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5182.042,5183.94,I was just trying to show that it cannot be read that way.
1962.12_orig,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5183.94,5187.512,I thought what you answered Mr. Justice Black indicated that.
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5187.512,5193.887,"Oh no, I agree that if their position were otherwise right, I would have no trouble carving it down to Hawaii."
1962.12_orig,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5196.61,5197.937,"Well, that means that you can read the act --"
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5197.937,5198.748,I don't agree that --
1962.12_orig,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5198.748,5200.673,You can read the act the way they do.
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5200.673,5205.153,"No, I said if it is otherwise right, and otherwise is a big word."
1962.12_orig,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5205.153,5207.928,"I misunderstood you, I thought you agreed with it."
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5207.928,5208.135,Oh no.
1962.12_orig,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5208.135,5211.582,I thought it was right to this convention.
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5211.582,5213.846,"I hope not, no, no."
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5213.846,5217.146,I thought it was right if you read the language literally.
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5217.146,5220.768,"No, I say read it literally."
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5265.906,5268.689,[Inaudible] using your shoe example?
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5268.689,5274.359,"Well, the transfer of ownership includes use, I agree."
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5275.932,5286.851,"But you say, it's the same as if a man goes into the store in your shoe illustration and says I want to get to use those shoes while I need them, what do you charge me for?"
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5286.851,5288.625,You could say that I don't call --
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5288.625,5291.965,Would that be a sale or would that be a transfer too?
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5291.965,5302.279,"I think if Congress or the statute about paying the use of shoes, you would not read it as, one I'm taking about being title to shoes."
1962.12_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5302.279,5308.013,That indicates that there is some little doubt about definition of use.
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5308.013,5322.539,"Let me add on further text to our argument that under their reading of (c), the language in (e) that says lands retained pursuant to subsection (c) becomes surplusage."
1962.12_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5413.653,5420.493,"Mr. Lyon's point was I think that this was lifted right out of the Alaska Statehood Act, am I understanding it correctly?"
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5420.493,5425.877,"Right, I think -- I prefer not to answer that."
1962.12_orig,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5670.227,5672.077,By whom?
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5672.077,5676.993,"That is the important thing; by Mr. O'Brien, Mr. O'Brien of New York."

1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5920.977,5921.332,I think --
1962.12_orig,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5921.332,5928.518,[Inaudible] the state department which tells the Attorney General that this question ought to be decided in Hawaii [Inaudible]
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5928.518,5931.105,I think this time I can have my cake and eat it.

1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,5995.98,6004.227,"Yes, that was their primary concern, but none of them suggested that the purchased properties would ever be given to the State."
1962.12_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6027.184,6034.973,"But, Mr. Barnett, as my brother Goldberg suggest the Defense Department and I have an obvious interest in being sure that whatever they needed or thought they needed --"
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,6034.973,6035.836,Oh yes --
1962.12_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6035.836,6044.515,-- they get that but they wouldn't have any concern of whatever with what happened to that property which they didn't need and that's the only issue here before us.
1962.12_orig,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,6044.515,6046.454,Well I'm not sure that's right.
1962.12_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6053.091,6058.428,"And, one of the Surplus Property Act, you think possibly the proceeds might go back in the defense department?"

1962.12_orig,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6715.035,6720.833,"Excuse me Mr. Lyons did you say that, that Section 16(b) is a carbon copy from the Alaska Statehood Act?"
1962.12_orig,3,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6720.833,6736.931,"Yes, the only differences are where the Act, where the Hawaii Act says Hawaii, the Alaska Act says Alaska, and where the Hawaii Act says Republic of Hawaii, the Alaska Act says Russia."
1962.12_orig,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6766.533,6769.487,Was any of it paid to private parties?
1962.12_orig,3,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6769.487,6778.182,I believe that provision deals with the land that bought from the other -- from the colonial power from Russia.
1962.12_orig,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6778.182,6780.013,From Russia?
1962.12_orig,3,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6780.013,6797.783,"The situation in Hawaii on the other hand, was land that was taken over without the payment of compensation, which Congress and the Attorney General at once recognized was held in a very peculiar relationship toward the people of State of Hawaii, it was held in trust for them."
1962.12_orig,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6797.783,6807.869,"Well what about most of these lands were directly concern with [Inaudible] land, those acquired by the Federal Government by condemnation, purchase or other acquisition."
1962.12_orig,3,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6812.18,6839.763,"Yes they were, but it was to -- the only grants of purchased land that the United States could make in Hawaii would be the grants such as we claim are made by Sections 5(c) and 5(e) of the Act, the grants of the surplus after acquired property, and this -- at most covered 30,000 acres, most of which would never be declared surplus anyhow."
1962.12_orig,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6845.061,6849.661,So that's -- I suppose there is probably not 100 million acres in all of Hawaii.
1962.12_orig,3,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6849.661,6851.498,Right.
1962.12_orig,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6851.498,6857.743,You are comparing absolute figures between the state bigger even the Texas --
1962.12_orig,3,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6857.743,6877.835,"Yes, but we still have an enormous grants of purchased land in the case of Alaska and if the defendant is correct there is no grant of purchased land whatsoever in the State of Hawaii, if we are correct there is grants at the very most of 30,000 acres, very likely not --"
1962.12_orig,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6877.835,6888.774,"I think I understood you to say you are talking about two different things, in Alaska there was a grant to the new state of land which the United States purchased from Russia years ago under Secretary of State Seward."
1962.12_orig,3,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6900.263,6918.723,"Yes, but the equities in both cases are whether the United States paid money for the land and this is opposed to the situation in which the United States took Hawaii's land without paying compensation and immediately recognizing that equitably it belonged to the people of Hawaii."
1962.12_orig,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6919.783,6930.218,"The government's point is, as I understand it, that the truth comparison between the two states is that the purchased land in Alaska is the equivalent roughly of the ceded land in Hawaii."
1962.12_orig,3,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6930.218,6958.568,"Yes and I think the reason where that falls is that the land that was purchased in Alaska was – a valuable consideration was paid for it by the government and there was never any acknowledgment or any principle that land was held in trust for the people of Alaska, quite the contrary in the case of Hawaii, it was always understood that this land was held in a very special way for the people of Hawaii."
1962.12_orig,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7102.462,7103.907,That is not in your brief Mr. Lyons.
1962.12_orig,3,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,7103.907,7105.85,It is not Your Honor.
1962.12_orig,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7237.322,7245.611,Gentlemen there has been some discussion of the legislative history that is not included in your briefs.
