2018.17-1657,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.08,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 17-1657, Mission Product Holdings versus Tempnology, LLC. Ms. Spinelli."
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,10.08,24.4,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code lets the trustee decide whether the estate will become a party to an executory contract of the debtor."
2018.17-1657,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,93.2,134.2,"But you just said, and I think it's correct, that the debtor would be -- rejection means that the debtor has no obligation to perform future duties under the contract. But, if the debtor in this case, as the owner of the trademark in question, did not continue to perform quality control activities in relationship to the mark, would that not imperil the future of -- the -- the -- the validity of the mark? So how can -- how can the debtor not continue to perform duties under the contract?"
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,134.2,151.04,"So the -- the quality control obligation is an obligation that's imposed by trademark law, not solely by the contract and, in many cases, not at all by the contract. It is quite true that if --"
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,151.04,179.96,"How is that relevant? Meaning, yes, I -- I assume that there's both a contractual obligation and a legal obligation under trademark law, but to the extent that there's a rejection of the contract, the property owner is electing to say, as he -- as it is entitled to say under the law, I reject that obligation vis-a-vis you."
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,200.84,201.0,No.
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,205.52,205.96,Why?
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,205.96,206.36,When --
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,206.36,223.64,"Why? Why isn't that exactly how it works? Meaning, once I lend you something and say it's conditioned on my approval of what you're doing, and I withdraw that approval, haven't I withdrawn --"
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,223.64,224.56,No.
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,257.8,269.24,"One of the trademark amici briefs said, if you're the licensee, you don't have the right to produce an item."
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,285.08,287.36,Different license agreements work in different ways.
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,287.64,299.36,"I don't disagree, but the point is that you've been -- that by rejecting the contract, I've basically said you can't use my goods."
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,305.2,322.28,"Justice Sotomayor, let me explain why I think that's not correct. First of all, outside bankruptcy, as Respondent has conceded, the licensor's breach would not let it take away the licensee's right to use the mark."
2018.17-1657,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,329.28,335.88,"When -- when you say that, Ms. Spinelli, what law do you look to to find that, to find that principle?"
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,335.88,336.08,That --
2018.17-1657,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,336.08,337.84,"I mean, you say you look to outside bankruptcy law."
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,337.84,338.08,Correct.
2018.17-1657,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,338.8,342.72,Are you looking to state law? Is it a kind of common law?
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,342.72,355.12,"Trademarks are governed by state law, by federal -- and by federal statute, the Lanham Act, and the case law that's developed under the Lanham Act. So -- but this is actually a much simpler principle."
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,379.92,381.12,I do have a question about --
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,381.12,381.52,Of course.
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,381.52,384.04,-- 365(n).
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,384.04,385.0,Of course.
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,385.0,392.92,Which is 365(n) is not the default rule with respect to intellectual property.
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,400.76,401.88,That's correct.
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,401.88,437.52,"Seems counterintuitive to me or counterlogical, given the explanation that the Congress gave, that it understood that trademark owners would get more rights than (n) provides to other licensors in the intellectual property field. It mentioned the reason why the courts up to that time who had recognized rejection as termination, that trademark owners were different because they had quality control problems."
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,454.92,456.92,"Let me -- let me explain, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,485.32,488.76,But it didn't -- it didn't think it was wrong completely.
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,488.76,489.24,I --
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,489.24,496.08,"Because -- because it -- it did a sort of hybrid, giving more and less at the same time."
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,496.08,498.48,But it did completely repudiate the Lubrizol rule.
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,498.48,498.8,Not really.
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,498.8,499.64,It said --
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,499.64,505.6,It -- it -- it kept some of it and it rejected others because of the situational difference.
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,505.6,515.88,"No, with respect, Justice Sotomayor, what it -- what it did is it said that the licensee can retain its rights under the contract."
2018.17-1657,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,569.28,584.96,"Could one say it didn't take any position on Lubrizol one way or another in the trademark context? It did quite specifically in the patent context, but it didn't either approve or disapprove."
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,584.96,587.16,"One could say that, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.17-1657,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,619.52,623.72,"But -- but the difference -- it said specifically, didn't it, what the difference it thought there was, right?"
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,623.72,624.08,"Yes, it did."
2018.17-1657,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,624.08,625.96,Which was this quality control --
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,625.96,626.24,Correct.
2018.17-1657,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,626.24,628.88,-- obligation that Justice Alito started us off with.
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,655.48,664.44,There's -- I don't believe anyone would say that the entire contract can be unwound by the unilateral act of the licensor.
2018.17-1657,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,666.96,667.08,Right.
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,671.68,671.96,Not --
2018.17-1657,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,671.96,673.68,-- from normal contract law.
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,673.68,673.76,No.
2018.17-1657,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,673.76,674.68,That's the question.
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,674.68,679.88,And the answer is no. There is no support for that at all.
2018.17-1657,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,726.68,728.2,What would that -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,728.2,729.56,"I'm sorry, Justice Alito."
2018.17-1657,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,729.56,736.12,What would happen in this situation? So the debtor is the lessor of residential property.
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,745.36,745.76,Correct.
2018.17-1657,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,745.76,752.92,"-- in the residential property, and the lessor would be relieved of any further obligations under the contract?"
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,752.92,753.92,Correct.
2018.17-1657,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,753.92,756.24,But not statutory obligations?
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,756.24,757.24,Correct -- it -- correct.
2018.17-1657,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,757.72,767.96,"So if there was a statute that said that the -- any lessor of residential property has to provide heat, they would continue -- it would have to continue to do that?"
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,767.96,768.64,Precisely.
2018.17-1657,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,833.52,834.48,"I mean, just thinking --"
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,834.48,834.96,That --
2018.17-1657,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,834.96,835.52,I'm sorry.
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,835.52,837.44,"No, please, Justice Kagan."
2018.17-1657,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,837.44,871.44,"You know, just thinking about that example you gave, the analogy of the --- the lessor of real property, there is in many cities background law that says once the landlord stops maintaining the property, the city insists that the tenant leave because the property isn't safe anymore. And I guess one question is whether there might be or is a similar background rule with respect to what happens to a trademark where the obligation for quality control is not being maintained? Is that a silly analogy?"
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,871.44,883.0,"It's not a silly analogy at all, but there is not analogous law. It -- you know, the -- again, the licensor's breach doesn't entitle it to terminate the licensee's rights."
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,883.0,883.44,Before you --
2018.17-1657,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,883.44,891.4,Does -- does the licensee have any rights with respect to quality control if the licensor is not fulfilling its duty?
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,891.4,899.64,So the licensee frequently takes upon itself the great burden of quality control.
2018.17-1657,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,915.84,919.36,Can I ask you to address the mootness question in this case?
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,919.36,920.36,Of course.
2018.17-1657,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,920.36,925.96,So as I understand it -- let's put the exclusive distribution rights off the table.
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,948.88,955.6,Mission was injured because it was wrongly prevented from using the trademark on its goods post-rejection.
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,956.6,965.48,"But, wait a minute, it had stopped -- it had said two years before, leading up to the agreement, that it wasn't going to order any goods."
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,965.48,972.24,"Well, what happened, Justice Sotomayor, is that, prior to bankruptcy, Tempnology attempted to terminate the contract."
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,988.68,992.36,"Were you producing your own goods using their trademark, or were you just --"
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,992.36,992.52,No.
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,992.52,992.96,-- buying from them?
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,992.96,1001.44,"Oh, I'm sorry -- no. At that point, we were purchasing the goods from Tempnology, which was a requirement under the contract."
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1001.44,1003.88,So they no longer had to supply you with goods.
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1006.4,1007.88,They did have an obligation --
2018.17-1657,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1007.88,1023.64,"-- that's a brief -- they have -- they have -- they have an obligation and you're open to damages, but without an -- without you producing the goods, I thought that brief from the amici said that you're relieved from supplying goods, the lessor is relieved from supplying goods."
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1023.64,1033.4,"But, Justice Sotomayor, we had a right under the agreement, if Tempnology failed to provide us with goods, to source those goods elsewhere. May I reserve the remainder of my time?"
2018.17-1657,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1033.4,1033.72,Yes.
2018.17-1657,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1033.72,1037.92,Thank you.
2018.17-1657,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1037.92,1042.28,Mr. Tripp.
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1042.28,1045.28,Excuse me.
2018.17-1657,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1066.52,1068.32,I'm not going to interrupt you again --
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1068.32,1068.32,Yeah.
2018.17-1657,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1068.32,1073.16,-- but if you could add to that excellent list of things to do discussing mootness.
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1073.16,1073.88,Yeah --
2018.17-1657,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1073.88,1074.76,Thank you.
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1074.76,1077.0,-- I'll -- I'll start with the mootness.
2018.17-1657,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1095.88,1100.12,"Well, if we put aside the exclusive distribution agreement, and I -- I really don't want to belabor this --"
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1100.12,1100.36,Yeah.
2018.17-1657,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1100.36,1114.2,"-- but I'd like you to focus specifically on -- on the trademark license. If there was no order prohibiting Petitioner from using the trademark at any point, then where are the damages?"
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1114.2,1145.48,"But this part of Respondent's argument I'm -- I'm not sure I understand because it seems to prove way too much, because if it's right that you can't get damages even when there's a bankruptcy court order, basically a declaratory judgment saying that it would be unlawful for you to use the mark, then you wouldn't be able to get damages even under their theory of the case that you can take away the license in bankruptcy by rejecting it and terminating it; you -- you would leave the counterparty with nothing, unless they went back into court and asked for an injunction against the thing the court just told it was already illegal. It's a very strange argument, so I'm not sure I follow that."
2018.17-1657,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1145.48,1149.12,"The bankruptcy argument -- well, I'm not sure I follow you. So one of us is just confused --"
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1149.12,1149.44,Yeah.
2018.17-1657,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1149.44,1161.16,"-- and it may well be me, but if -- if the bankruptcy court is simply saying you've rejected it and if rejection only means that you don't have to perform and that you breached, does that prohibit --"
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1161.16,1163.6,"No, that -- that wouldn't have prohibited it."
2018.17-1657,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1174.2,1174.28,I see.
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1174.4,1174.96,And Petitioner --
2018.17-1657,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1174.96,1175.48,I under -- I track you now.
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1175.84,1177.8,And so Petitioner is saying there's -- there's money on the table.
2018.17-1657,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1177.8,1179.16,So go back to the argument you were making.
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1189.0,1189.12,"Well, they also --"
2018.17-1657,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1189.12,1199.84,"Because you're saying under their theory they can't move forward, they have a non-exclusive license, but if they're not getting goods, what's their -- why isn't this case moot?"
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1199.84,1206.16,"Well, at least as I understand Petitioner's theory, and, of course, we wouldn't have a position on -- on what's going to happen on remand."
2018.17-1657,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1263.44,1270.4,"Do you want -- do you want -- are you -- I mean, the main question that I have, I think, is the same that Justice Alito and Justice Kagan had --"
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1270.4,1270.52,Yeah.
2018.17-1657,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1270.92,1274.04,"-- where I think -- well, let me show you."
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1339.12,1340.28,Yeah.
2018.17-1657,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1340.28,1348.0,"This upkeep business is an essential part of one right, which is going to give you the house to live in."
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1352.48,1352.64,Yeah.
2018.17-1657,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1352.88,1356.96,-- at some point to tell me which is the strong -- why is it stronger when --
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1356.96,1357.0,Yeah.
2018.17-1657,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1364.2,1364.44,Yeah.
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1364.44,1406.28,"-- and maintaining the distinctiveness of the mark to consumers, that does not instantly destroy the mark, right? That is a process, gradual, it's over time. And then another thing that makes it different from your igloo example is that, at the end of the day, the licensee can still use the mark because the only thing that happens if you stop performing the quality control is eventually, at the end of the day, after some period of time, it'll be abandoned and returned to the public domain. And I -- I really think it's -- actually, it's a lot more like the situation in our brief, which we talk about, of leasing somebody a photocopier where you agree to maintain it over time. It may well be that if you stop the maintenance on the photocopier, that eventually the photocopier is going to -- going to eventually break down."
2018.17-1657,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1442.96,1446.84,"Except the report said exactly the opposite, that they weren't taking a position."
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1446.84,1448.08,"Yeah, so I -- I --"
2018.17-1657,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1448.08,1452.04,So it can't be that their entire -- their entire purpose was to overrule.
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1455.88,1456.32,Yeah.
2018.17-1657,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1456.44,1462.2,Because there are certain contracts they gave the lessees more rights or the lessors more rights.
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1469.08,1476.68,So I think that's -- I think really they overwhelmingly overruled Lubrizol.
2018.17-1657,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1586.64,1589.16,"I'm sorry, I don't really understand that argument."
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1599.4,1606.92,"No, I think what they really are are codifications of the background rule to clarify difficult situations that have arisen --"
2018.17-1657,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1606.92,1613.12,"That's what you think, but, you know, the greatest problem here is that rejection is not a contract term."
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1650.84,1652.68,If I could answer the question?
2018.17-1657,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1652.68,1652.96,Yes.
2018.17-1657,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1652.96,1657.0,"So just, I mean, (g) says that it constitutes a breach."

2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1748.44,1749.24,That -- that's right.
2018.17-1657,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1770.68,1786.28,"Why isn't that enough to have -- at least have an acorn of injury for Article III purposes, the uncertainty created by a declaratory judgment that effectively you can't use it?

2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1868.04,1895.16,"I'd -- I'd be happy to, Your Honor, because I think the photocopier example is actually paradigmatic. And there is -- we -- we mentioned that there's another section of the code, Section 542(a), that -- that provides for a party who's in possession of property of the estate to return that property to the estate upon the filing of the petition. And if the copier is held under a lease, then the copier is property of the estate."
2018.17-1657,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1934.28,1936.52,And the McDonald's franchise?
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1936.52,1944.76,The McDonald's franchise is an interesting exception because they highlight the million dollars perhaps or more that's been invested by the franchisee.
2018.17-1657,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2025.4,2029.56,And what do you say about the -- the example of the lessor and the lessee?
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2029.56,2037.8,"Well, Your Honor, ever since the 1934 Act, Congress has included exceptions that specifically deal with real estate."

2018.17-1657,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2143.24,2155.04,"Well, I just want -- I want -- I want you to tell me -- and I think this is consistent with Justice Ginsburg's question -- outside bankruptcy, what would be the rule in this context, in the trademark context?"
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2155.04,2168.04,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I think -- our view is that you would have a breach of contract claim, but you would not have an ongoing use of -- of the trademark because -- precisely because of the nature of the trademark."
2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2173.4,2173.76,All right.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2220.28,2222.8,"Well, in -- in our view, you -- you can't because --"

All right, but -- so -- so you say ""in your view,"" that means you're not certain? MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I -- I don't think that there's -- there's case law that's clear on this -- JUSTICE BREYER: No?"
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2245.04,2248.72,"-- but -- but the notion of the trademark as property, and McCarthy is very clear --"

2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2262.72,2265.8,"Because you couldn't -- at common law, you couldn't even license a --"
2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2265.8,2266.0,Okay.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2266.0,2269.88,"-- a trademark because it was the person, the owner's reputation."

2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2283.44,2284.96,-- but I want to keep the property.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2284.96,2285.16,I think --
2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2285.16,2287.28,There's just no good case that would help me?
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2287.28,2291.04,"Well, if we're talking about something other than -- other than trademark --"
2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2291.04,2293.04,Anything that you think is analogous.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2293.04,2301.76,"-- other than trademark, then you're right, that the -- the -- the non-bankruptcy law is that the counterparty gets to choose whether to treat that anticipatory breach as --"
2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2301.76,2302.12,Okay.
2018.17-1657,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2302.44,2302.48,Right.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2320.88,2322.6,I don't have a case to --
2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2322.6,2322.72,No.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2322.88,2323.4,"-- to that effect, Your Honor."
2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2323.4,2350.8,"-- you see then -- then the argument really turns down to, which is where I sort of felt after reading the briefs, well, is this continuous obligation to keep the trademark going, which is on me, the breacher, is that enough? And at that point, I become uncertain. And one of the things cutting against you is that the licensee can keep up the trademark himself."
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2354.84,2357.36,"No, but the licensee cannot keep up the trademark."
2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2358.6,2359.08,Right.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2359.08,2370.32,"The licensee, under the Lanham Act, the licensee may license the trademark as a ""related party"" and it's not meaning, you know, subsidiary."
2018.17-1657,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2390.64,2400.6,So the -- the license -- the licensee can't take any steps when a third-party is infringing the trademark regardless of what the licensor thinks?
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2400.6,2400.72,No.
2018.17-1657,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2401.2,2404.32,Because the licensee is certainly injured by those infringe -- infringing activities.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2404.32,2414.0,"It's -- it's the licensor who enforces the trademark because it is the licensor's reputation, and the -- and the law imposes on the licensor that responsibility."
2018.17-1657,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2414.0,2428.4,"Well, it may be the licensor's reputation, but it's the licensee's income, right? If the -- if the trademark no longer has value, that certainly undermines the value that the licensee saw in the original contract."
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2428.4,2443.4,"Well, it -- it may be, Your Honor, but, again, this is why McCarthy specifically warns against analogies of trademark to other forms of property, even those that look very similar, like patents, because trademarks require a unity of ownership."
2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2446.92,2447.44,All right.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2483.4,2490.36,"Your -- Your -- Your -- Your Honor, once -- once the trademark owner ceases to control the mark and enforce the -- the -- the quality --"
2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2490.36,2490.68,Yeah.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2491.72,2496.24,-- then it becomes an abandoned trademark and it loses its value.
2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2496.24,2500.44,But what happens to an abandoned trademark? Can you use an abandoned trademark?
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2500.44,2502.76,"Well, it's no longer a trademark."
2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2503.64,2503.72,No.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2504.2,2504.72,Yes.
2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2504.72,2504.92,Can --
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2504.92,2505.56,Yes.
2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2505.56,2506.24,"He can, okay."
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2506.24,2506.8,Yes.
2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2506.8,2513.28,"If he can, and here we're dealing with non-exclusive licenses, why isn't that his problem?"
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2513.28,2526.16,"Well, Your Honor, again, the -- the -- the rule, the general rule under the 365(g) is that all claims for breach of the contract have to be brought prepetition."
2018.17-1657,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2554.04,2554.24,Okay.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2577.8,2595.92,"What (g) says is that it constitutes a breach pre-bankruptcy. So the question is, what are the claims that have to be brought? Are they all claims? Is it a total breach and you have to bring the full value of claims, or there are some rights that -- that continue? If Congress thought that some rights would continue --"
2018.17-1657,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2595.92,2604.2,"But what -- but what you're saying, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, is that -- is that what (g) tells you is that you can unwind the entire deal."
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2612.92,2614.08,It -- it can be.
2018.17-1657,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2614.6,2614.88,Well --
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2614.88,2618.16,-- non-bankruptcy rule gives that choice to the counterparty.
2018.17-1657,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2624.76,2634.16,"Well, what language are you pointing to in 36 -- 365(g) that says anything other than we look to see what happens when you breach?"
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2634.16,2639.2,It -- the principal language is that it's a prepetition breach.
2018.17-1657,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2646.04,2647.4,"Well, I think we can understand it. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2647.4,2650.2,"I'm sure you can, but just to explain why it's going to take me some steps."
2018.17-1657,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2815.28,2815.8,How do you --
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2815.8,2817.24,-- had there been no exception at all.
2018.17-1657,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2817.24,2834.52,"-- how do you explain that the scholars in this field, the bankruptcy field, disagree with your interpretation and they say Lubrizol was wrong and Sunbeam was right? MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, it's not a uniform view."
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2859.92,2895.44,"But -- but it is absolutely not true that the views are unanimous in one -- in one respect. Among the amici that the other side have are the INTA and other organizations that have gone to Congress many times to ask Congress to adopt an exception similar to (n) for trademark licensees, and Congress has refused to do so. So now they're asking this Court to do what they have failed to obtain from Congress. But note when they went to Congress to ask them to adopt an exception, they understood that it had to be nuanced."
2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2929.44,2932.48,Let me -- let me be sure I'm not missing something.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2984.24,2993.8,"Well, Your Honor, previously I said that I was not aware of a case that specifically held that breach by a licensor ends the licensee's right to use the mark."
2018.17-1657,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2994.84,2995.28,Yeah.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2995.28,3030.6,"-- have reminded me of the Seventh Circuit's decision in Gorenstein Enterprises v. Quality Care-USA, 874 F.2d 431, which holds that it does end the licensee's right to use the mark. Again, I think that's because of the nature of trademark, that it represents the -- the owner's reputation, the unitary theory of ownership, which is unique to trademark, and the fact that without that control there is no related party to -- to use the -- the -- the mark and, therefore, it ceases to be effective."
2018.17-1657,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3030.6,3031.12,So this is --
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3031.12,3031.52,But --
2018.17-1657,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3031.52,3051.36,"-- a special rule -- we're outside of bankruptcy -- this is a special rule for trademarks? It's different from the rule that would apply outside bankruptcy for, let's say, leased property? And it's -- the reason why there's a different rule is because of the duty of the -- the licensor to maintain the quality control?"
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3051.36,3052.6,"Right, right. There's --"
2018.17-1657,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3052.6,3055.12,"I thought you were saying exactly the opposite, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier."
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3058.88,3059.16,In -- in --
2018.17-1657,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3059.16,3060.24,And your entire brief --
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3060.24,3062.64,"-- in bankruptcy, in bankruptcy, that's right."
2018.17-1657,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3064.08,3064.24,Yeah.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3064.96,3065.8,-- had to do with non-bankruptcy.
2018.17-1657,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3065.8,3092.44,"-- outside bankruptcy. So I -- I don't -- I don't understand why there would be a special rule for trademark, outside bankruptcy, that would be -- it would be predicated on the licensor's failure to exercise the quality control. And so, because -- because the licensor doesn't want to do that, the licensor in -- in breach of the contract gets a more favorable result."
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3094.32,3106.48,"Well, Your -- Your Honor, it -- again, I think it's because of the unique nature of the trademark as being only -- you can only have a valid license of the trademark if there is that control."
2018.17-1657,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3113.6,3114.28,I'm sorry --
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3114.28,3114.88,-- and so --
2018.17-1657,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3114.88,3120.24,-- but I don't know why that doesn't control non-bankruptcy rights.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3120.24,3121.56,We -- if -- if --
2018.17-1657,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3121.56,3127.72,"Your point would seem to control both, but it doesn't seem to. You're saying bankruptcy gives you more rights."
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3127.72,3212.32,"Well, what -- what we're saying is that there -- we think that with trademarks especially, you can't continue to exercise the trademark license after rejection and that -- because of the unique character of trademarks. But, under our view, it's true generally as well, because if you have a lease of a photocopier, it -- it -- the -- the general rule of 365(g) is that if you -- if you reject a -- a lease of a photocopier, that lease now is -- is effectively terminated. It's been reduced to a claim for prepetition damages. And 542(a) would tell us that the possessor of the -- of the photocopier has to return it to the estate, unless the -- the lease is assumed, which it normally is, because it's more beneficial. So the general rule is that these types of ongoing relationships are terminated, they're reduced to a claim for pre-bankruptcy damages, breach of contract damages that are paid pennies on the dollar, and that it's not up to the counterparty to decide they don't want pennies on the dollar, they would rather have dollars for dollar, because if that were the case, then no counterparty would bring a claim for pre-bankruptcy breach."
2018.17-1657,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3215.36,3237.04,"Do you have any argument that would limit a ruling in your favor just to trademark law? Because it seems to me that you're asking us to do exactly what the other side wants us to do, to announce a general interpretation of this provision that basically says these types of contracts actually do survive --"
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3237.04,3237.36,Well --
2018.17-1657,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3237.36,3243.0,"-- lessees have the right to terminate, in part, and keep other rights alive."
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3243.0,3243.92,"Well, Your -- Your Honor --"
2018.17-1657,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3243.92,3249.92,You -- I thought when I read your briefs that you had an argument as to why we should limit our ruling to trademark law.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3252.6,3253.44,"No -- no, Your Honor."
2018.17-1657,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3281.6,3286.96,That's somewhat different because that requires actual affirmative obligations by the employers.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3286.96,3287.56,"Well, Your Honor --"
2018.17-1657,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3287.56,3292.48,And you're not arguing the employer has to -- the trademark owner has to continue his rights.
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3292.48,3304.12,One -- one of the rights that was -- was deemed one that had to be brought as a prepetition claim in Bildisco was a -- a -- a claim based upon the loss of seniority rights.
2018.17-1657,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3354.72,3355.24,But -- so could I --
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3355.24,3356.48,-- that trademark is different.
2018.17-1657,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3356.48,3366.56,"-- understand the sort of nature of the argument? I mean, you have your general argument, and the way that goes is Ms. Spinelli says the effect of rejection is breach, and you say the effect of rejection is rescission."
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3375.88,3377.2,Prepetition breach.
2018.17-1657,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3377.2,3398.08,"So -- but then you say, even if Ms. Spinelli is right on that and we just look to what it means to breach outside non -- outside bankruptcy law, then you say we have a special rule for trademarks because trademarks are different outside bankruptcy law, and you point us to a single Seventh Circuit case, is that correct?"
2018.17-1657,2,20978,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3398.08,3401.24,And -- and -- and the nature of -- of the trademark.
2018.17-1657,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3508.16,3511.32,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Ms. Spinelli."
2018.17-1657,3,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3511.32,3512.76,Thank you.
2018.17-1657,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3581.24,3581.76,Could you --
2018.17-1657,3,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3581.76,3582.24,"So, just --"
2018.17-1657,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3582.24,3603.96,"-- answer just one question for me? If you continue using the mark, do the damages that you incur after the filing of the bankruptcy -- are they prepetition debt or postpetition debt? Are you going to get a priority for the damages that accrue after you declare bankruptcy -- after bankruptcy had been declared?"
2018.17-1657,3,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3603.96,3614.8,"In this case, Mission has an administrative claim stemming from the wrongful deprivation of its right to use the trademark post-rejection."
2018.17-1657,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3621.24,3621.4,So --
2018.17-1657,3,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3621.4,3621.48,-- claim.
2018.17-1657,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3621.48,3624.24,-- you're going to get more rights than (n) gives other intellectual --
2018.17-1657,3,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3624.24,3624.56,Yes.
2018.17-1657,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3624.56,3625.16,-- property.
2018.17-1657,3,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3625.16,3628.6,And let me explain why that's exactly what should happen.
2018.17-1657,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3692.6,3697.32,One quick question and then there's your third.
2018.17-1657,3,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3719.0,3719.24,No.
2018.17-1657,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3719.24,3719.92,-- gone?
2018.17-1657,3,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3719.92,3720.68,"No, it does not."
2018.17-1657,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3721.32,3721.56,Sure.
2018.17-1657,3,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3721.56,3725.16,"-- respond, Justice Roberts? No, it doesn't."
2018.17-1657,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3773.36,3774.16,"Thank you, counsel."
