1962.202,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,1984.074,1986.689,May it please the Court.
1962.202,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2436.008,2454.828,(Inaudible)
1962.202,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2454.828,2455.059,"No, it's --"
1962.202,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2455.059,2455.861,(Inaudible)
1962.202,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2455.861,2456.309,No.
1962.202,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2508.251,2511.404,So it thus required investigation or probation report.
1962.202,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2511.404,2516.17,"Yes, I -- well, I do know what's in the probation report, Your Honor."
1962.202,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2918.865,2926.364,(Inaudible)
1962.202,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2926.364,2927.549,Right.
1962.202,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2939.981,2944.635,(Inaudible)
1962.202,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2944.635,2962.141,Conclusive must be read in the light of all the factors and I think that conclusive means -- conclusive is conclusive enough so as not to shed a doubt on the voluntariness of the plea.
1962.202,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3028.921,3032.214,With this I gathered (Inaudible)
1962.202,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3032.214,3034.884,"Well, I think the District Court had the right to consider that."
1962.202,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3080.567,3088.201,(Inaudible)
1962.202,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3088.201,3118.589,I think that on the basis -- I do think that on the basis of this record and the care of the judge plus the fact that all the petitioner alleges is that between the date he was arrested and the date he was sentenced is very unspecific as today that he was given narcotics which is as I say per se does not establish incompetence.
1962.202,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3192.318,3223.445,May I ask you (Inaudible)
1962.202,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3223.445,3232.578,"Well, I think so as we point out in our brief, there is no legislative history specifically on this clause."
1962.202,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3350.457,3378.634,"Ms. Rosenberg, may I ask you (Inaudible)"
1962.202,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3378.634,3380.415,Not necessarily.
1962.202,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3382.825,3383.033,But your --
1962.202,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3383.033,3392.833,-- except that obviously we think it is relevant that he didn't raise it before.
1962.202,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3450.3,3467.434,"Putting a -- putting a legal label on it, does your position come down to this that in a successive petition, 2255 petition, the judge must exercise a discretion but his scope of discretion is broader than it is on an initial application."
1962.202,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3467.434,3475.096,Yes and that he is entitled to view the second petition with somewhat more degree of skepticism than he does the first.
1962.202,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3475.096,3477.464,"Skepticism is part of discretion, isn't it?"
1962.202,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3477.464,3478.658,Yes.
1962.202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3673.58,3677.443,I didn't get though what the sequel to the Catalano case was.
1962.202,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3677.443,3683.525,It's at 311 F.2d 186 has just been reported and the District Court's opinion --
