1976.75-1906,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,40.311,"We will hear arguments next in 75-1906, Henderson against Kibbe."
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,41.745,44.947,Thank you.
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,267.678,270.199,What was first added two things.
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,273.295,276.258,They advised him to get inside so that he would not freeze to death.
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,276.258,277.75,"What, inside his clothing or…"
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,277.75,280.673,"No, they advised him to get inside somewhere, they did not…"
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,280.673,282.048,"There was no inside, was there?"
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,282.048,283.499,"Well, this is the point."
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,300.146,302.373,"The gas station was,in any event, on the other side of the road?"
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,302.373,303.487,That is the critical point.
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,325.263,330.728,"Since I have interrupted you, I did not understand you, what you told us about falling into a snow bank, who did that?"
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,330.728,337.71,"Stafford, when he left the car, fell into a snow bank of which I think is some indication of the drunken condition in which he was."
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,337.71,342.444,"But he did not leave the road very far, did he?"
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,342.444,346.681,"No, apparently he could not leave the road very far, because it was snow banks on both sides of the road."
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,348.242,351.132,"Into, but not down the bank?"
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,351.132,352.169,Not at all.
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,352.169,353.883,So far has anybody observed?
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,353.883,356.781,"No, there is no intimation of that in the record."
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,358.258,362.438,"Was this, what kind of a road was this, a state two-lane road?"
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,362.438,363.973,I gather it is a county road.
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,363.973,365.504,Monroe County?
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,365.504,372.866,"Yes, and the main feature from our standpoint that is relevant is, that it was a two-lane highway and that there was no artificial lighting over here."
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,372.866,375.036,But I was wondering about how much traffic there was on?
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,375.036,381.476,"Well, there is testimony on traffic, although respondent disputes the amount of traffic."
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,413.318,414.674,That was the rush hour this was what 9 o’clock at night?
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,414.674,424.81,"This was 09:30 in the evening, so that it may not have been a rush hour, but on the other hand it was not in the early morning hours when you would expect there would be very little traffic on the road."
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,437.311,439.274,Krall was not a party to this?
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,439.274,447.83,"No, apparently he filed the petition jointly when this first begun, but I do not know that he apparently withdrew."
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,447.83,448.915,Record does not show?
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,448.915,454.89,"No, I do not know the answer I am afraid, but he did not pursue it to the Second Circuit."
1976.75-1906,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,473.927,475.963,Let me get this in setting a little bit.
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,478.893,479.612,Yes.
1976.75-1906,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,479.612,480.782,And there was a conviction?
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,480.782,481.105,Yes.
1976.75-1906,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,481.105,484.039,Then it was reviewed by the Appellate Division?
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,484.039,484.324,Yes.
1976.75-1906,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,484.324,485.827,And they affirmed the conviction?
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,485.827,486.374,They did.
1976.75-1906,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,486.374,487.374,And then what happened?
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,488.567,489.768,Then it went to the Court of Appeals.
1976.75-1906,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,489.768,491.028,And they affirmed the conviction.
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,491.028,492.091,They affirmed the conviction.
1976.75-1906,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,492.091,498.759,"And then it went to United States District Judge on Habeas Corpus, so that is the fourth time around."
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,505.23,517.193,"Well, I think ultimately what is critical is that he looked at the alleged error in this case, and he felt that it was not a substantial violation and that he was simply being called upon to review jury instructions that that was not the province of habeas corpus review."
1976.75-1906,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,517.193,525.222,"It is only on the fifth time it got into one of the fifth courts of the judgment, the trial court was..."
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,525.222,532.745,"Must set aside, and I might add with one dissent that it was not unanimous decision by the Second Circuit."
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,595.869,602.447,"Mrs. Cohen, was there any question in this case as to the immediate cause of death i.e. the being struck by the (Inaudible)?"
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,602.447,605.56,"No, that was firmly established."
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,605.671,609.713,No suggestion that he died from poisoning or for injuries received anywhere?
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,609.713,611.21,"Nothing extraneous, no."
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,614.073,615.544,That was the sole immediate cause?
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,615.544,618.593,The sole immediate cause of death.
1976.75-1906,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,654.918,657.242,And they neither raised in the Appellate Division either?
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,657.242,664.097,"No, they did not, and it was the same lawyer at least representing respondent Kibbe who represented him on this direct appeal."
1976.75-1906,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,712.122,725.314,"The prosecutor on the contrary has emphasized to the great extents, the conduct in leaving the man out on the road and accountability that he would be exposed to great danger."
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,725.314,731.357,All of the arguments in this case are very emotional in that sense.
1976.75-1906,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,857.464,859.093,There was nothing very new about that idea.
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,859.093,869.675,"No, the Court used the words, ""fundamental principle"", it took it as a given, and in doing so emphasized the relevance of the witness’s testimony and the relevance of the arguments of counsel."
1976.75-1906,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,967.278,985.634,We will resume there up to 1 o’clock Mrs. Cohen.
1976.75-1906,0,34237,lillian_zeisel_cohen,,988.744,992.636,"Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-1906,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,1982.349,2157.84,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-1906,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2157.84,2162.841,You mean it is not foreseeable that some automobiles would be traveling on that road?
1976.75-1906,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2162.841,2176.067,"Well, Your Honor, the requirements of foreseeability in this case are that the defendant be aware of the risk of death by the specific agency that actually inflicted the harm."
1976.75-1906,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2176.067,2186.523,"Well, if the defendant was driving a car there, why should it not be foreseeable that other people would be driving there, when the road is provided for that purpose?"
1976.75-1906,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2186.523,2230.789,"Well, that is true Your Honor, but it was a narrow roadway."
1976.75-1906,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2230.789,2238.85,I am very interested in the awareness of a drunken man.
1976.75-1906,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2238.85,2247.709,"No, Your Honor I think that there is some dispute about that."
1976.75-1906,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2247.709,2256.149,"Well, do you see several people walking around on a public road with no boots and pants on, is that normal?"
1976.75-1906,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2256.149,2277.786,"Your Honor, I have to dispute the fact that Stafford did not have his pants on."
1976.75-1906,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2277.786,2289.548,Is there any contradiction that at least two bars interested in making money refused to serve him for the reason that he was drunk?
1976.75-1906,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2289.548,2291.962,"No, Your Honor, the record does establish that but the…"
1976.75-1906,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2291.962,2297.984,"Well, do you consider that a person in that condition is “aware”."
1976.75-1906,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2297.984,2309.574,"Well, Your Honor, I would say that it depends on the individual."
1976.75-1906,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2309.574,2312.925,"But the record does not show that; it said, because he was drunk."
1976.75-1906,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2312.925,2315.781,"Well, but the record also shows Your Honor that the medical examiner..."
1976.75-1906,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2315.781,2317.959,Are you disputing that he was drunk?
1976.75-1906,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2317.959,2319.041,Excuse me Your Honor.
1976.75-1906,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2319.041,2321.041,Do you dispute that he was drunk?
1976.75-1906,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2321.041,2355.274,"Yes, Your Honor, I will."
