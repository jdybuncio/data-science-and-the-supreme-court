1965.46,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,40.547,"Number 46, United States, Appellant, versus General Motors Corporation et al."
1965.46,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,41.684,45.692,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.46,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,158.876,162.295,Are you asking relief against the association or not?
1965.46,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,162.295,166.427,"Yes, we are asking relief primarily against General Motors, Mr. Justice."
1965.46,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,166.427,171.235,Well -- but you -- yes you are asking relief against the association?
1965.46,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,171.235,175.188,"We are, yes Mr. Justice."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,3654.49,3655.768,Thank you.
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3838.046,3839.345,Where does Orange begin?
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,3839.345,3840.653,Where is Orange County?
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3840.653,3842.75,"Begin, I know where it is but I can't see the beginning."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,3842.75,3847.516,"Well, Mr. Justice Clark, it comes down in a jagged line there."
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3860.182,3862.172,New Port is in -- that's in Orange isn't it?
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,3862.172,3863.799,"New Port is in Orange County yes, but they --"
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3863.799,3866.039,Then that takes Huntington?
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,3866.523,3867.524,Is in Orange County.
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3881.158,3886.837,"Now, the left of that you have two together in one of the -- which county is that in?"
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,3886.837,3888.202,Two together --
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3888.202,3889.608,Two red ones and then one above it.
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,3889.608,3892.149,Two red ones together that's in Orange County.
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3892.149,3894.145,The one above is in Orange too?
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,3894.145,3896.826,"Well, maybe we're not looking at the same one Mr. Justice Clark."
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3908.645,3911.172,"What about Long Beach, it's in Los Angeles?"
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,3911.172,3914.077,"Los Angeles County, yes sir."
1965.46,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3914.077,3925.516,I don't know that it has any materiality but why is it cost more -- why does it cost more for a Chevrolet from a dealer in Orange County than from a dealer in Los Angeles?
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,3925.516,3929.032,There's no evidence to support that statement of the Government at all.
1965.46,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3929.032,3930.01,I see.
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,3930.01,3946.867,"You can not ascertain -- the Government has tried to ascertain the price of Chevrolets by looking at the dealer's gross profits, the dealer's gross profits on new cars."
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4222.632,4224.403,"The dealer could discount it too, couldn't he?"
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4224.403,4225.382,Yes he can.
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4225.382,4227.159,He can up the price with the -- I mean --
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4227.159,4239.805,"The dealer can do the same thing and in order to find the dealer's price, Mr. Justice Clark, the true price you must make a careful study which we did of the dealers who sold through discount houses."
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4254.87,4257.874,Well on the basis -- excuse me Mr. Mitchell.
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4257.874,4258.6,Yes sir.
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4258.6,4288.816,"On the basis of what you say as a typical discount house transaction, would it be within reason in legal logic, in your opinion, to regard the discount house as either an independent contractor here or as agent for the buyer?"
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4288.816,4292.216,"No, he's really the agent for the -- he's the agent for anybody."
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4296.612,4297.14,But he's doing --
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4297.14,4301.976,"But you could try to turn it upside down, I suppose if you want to, but the --"
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4301.976,4303.019,I don't want to --
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4303.019,4305.583,"No, I mean if -- well I don't mean --"
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4305.583,4306.891,I'm just trying to get this straighten out.
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4306.891,4323.626,"I don't mean that personally, I mean it's possible to argue it upside down but the reality of it was that the dealer made an arrangement with the discount house to whereby the discount house would dispose of the dealer's cars for him."
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4325.44,4341.555,And then he obtains a power of attorney from the buyer and he proceeds to obtain the car pursuant to that power of attorney and he also proceeds to make the arrangement at the finance company.
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4341.555,4343.013,"Yes, he does."
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4343.013,4356.478,"And so I suppose -- well, we all know how vague these concepts are and how difficult it is to make legal characterizations in this field."
1965.46,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4370.745,4384.092,"Well, what if he were one of those that Mr. Justice Fortas suggests Mr. Mitchell, what then under your franchise agreement?"
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4384.092,4393.502,"Well, the franchise agreement contemplates that the dealer shall have a place of business agreed upon."
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4393.502,4394.879,I understand that.
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4394.879,4400.442,And that's for -- not for any competitive purposes but for competitive purposes.
1965.46,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4422.814,4433.947,"Well, what if the discount house just went to the dealer and said, “Sell me ten cars a month, and sell them to me."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4438.587,4440.867,Nothing in the franchise agreement prevents that but --
1965.46,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4440.867,4442.091,Would you prevent it?
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4444.861,4447.773,"I think we're legally entitled to do so, but --"
1965.46,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4447.773,4450.03,Contrary to what Mr. Friedman said.
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4450.03,4453.118,"Contrary to what Mr. Friedman said, yes."
1965.46,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4463.776,4471.754,"Or on the antitrust laws down here, it shouldn't make much difference to you whether this fellow was an independent contractor, an agent or anything else."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4483.896,4491.714,"Well, as for the first part we certainly tried to stop him as a violation of the agreement."
1965.46,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4498.469,4515.097,"Well yes, but as Mr. Justice Fortas suggest you've got sort of at least a mixed transaction here whether discount house actually assumes some risk in the matter and does a little bit more than just selling like an ordinary salesman does."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4515.097,4526.865,"Yes, he's more and some instances, the one that I was describing to Mr. Justice Fortas, it's more like a broker which is a form of an agent."
1965.46,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4555.313,4563.371,Some judge somewhere might think that what actually is going on there is pretty much like it as if they actually sold it through discount houses.
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4563.371,4570.159,"Well, if they sold it to a discount house for resale, it tends to become a used car."
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4576.732,4582.087,"Mr. Mitchell, would that effect the servicing of the car?"
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4582.087,4595.636,"Well sure, if they are the sale to someone and the title to the car is gone, there's no obligation on the dealer to worry about that car anymore."
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4595.636,4602.89,"It might be that this, the method that they use in order to save the servicing in the new purchaser."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4602.89,4604.639,"Yes, that might be sir."
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4605.815,4610.945,I wondered if the salesman on the dealer and I was --
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4610.945,4611.656,I didn't understand you.
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4611.656,4622.278,"Suppose I was the dealer in Los Angeles and I knew that there was an organization, we'll say, of Standard Oil station employees and managers."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4654.168,4658.724,"Well, it might under these circumstances."
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4736.411,4743.88,"They don't have any cars, no salesman, they don't have any place where they show the car --"
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4743.88,4755.331,"No, but if they advertised cars are available here for purchase, you know, I'm -- the reason I don't answer your question directly because I don't what those Standards Oil dealer or service station men are going to do."
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4755.331,4761.025,"Or they just -- can that and they say, “Say, a truck pretty old, it got a lot of knots in it."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4771.309,4773.916,I don't think that violates the location clause.
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4809.767,4813.394,"They don't have any exhibit room, a studio or showrooms?"
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,4813.394,4824.863,"No, there was some exhibiting of cars done, but some do -- I can't answer the question directly because some showed cars."
1965.46,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4995.448,5001.535,Let's suppose I'm not in the business of renting cars like cars for someone.
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5056.041,5061.717,"I want -- he says to the dealer, “I want you to transfer title to my costumer.”"
1965.46,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5062.538,5067.656,"But I -- but he says, “I will already have paid you for them, you already have the cash in your pockets.”"
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5067.656,5077.417,"Yes, but if he's running that from a place of business and thereby selling cars for the dealer that violates the location clause."
1965.46,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5083.92,5104.628,"Well, you say that you could stop him under your present franchise agreement from doing that and do it legally, but you also say that you, General Motors, could come around to your dealer and say, “By the way, we know we can't stop you under our present franchise agreement, let's sign up a new one that says that you will stop and you'll never do it again.”"
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5113.1,5115.464,Stop the dealer from selling cars or will say --
1965.46,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5115.464,5125.629,"Well, the dealer sit down say a new agreement to say and the dealer promises faithfully he will never sell in that manner again."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5125.629,5132.177,"Well I think -- I personally think so, but we haven't studied that problem in this case, Mr. Justice White."
1965.46,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5140.449,5143.666,"Well, I'm not sure it becomes any different problem than what you have before us."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5143.666,5150.974,"Well, it does in the sense that the car tends to become a used car, and so --"
1965.46,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5150.974,5154.785,"Well, that isn't what I thought."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5169.321,5184.889,"Well, we do not stop them from selling cars for resale used or otherwise, I mean that problem was not involved here and is not involved in this case."
1965.46,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5184.889,5188.094,"And they can sell at any price, is that right?"
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5188.094,5190.855,Chevrolet dealers can sell at any price they want to.
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5237.554,5242.594,"They don't yet charge at any cheaper by the dozen, do they?"
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5242.594,5243.38,What is it sir?
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5243.38,5247.48,I say the dealer doesn't buy them any cheaper and in the number you buy them out?
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5247.48,5248.225,"No, no."
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5248.225,5249.728,Same price?
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5249.728,5250.496,Same price.
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5250.496,5266.094,"Mr. Mitchell, forgive me but to me, your response to Mr. Justice White's last question would be quite important as I see the case now and I want to be sure that I understand your viewpoint."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5274.501,5275.477,"Yes, yes dealers --"
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5275.477,5276.96,"Now, let us assume --"
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5276.96,5277.875,-- sell them to Avis.
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5277.875,5290.329,"Thats right, now let us assume, if you will, as to take Mr. Justice White's illustration that Avis decides to go into the business of reselling some of those cars."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5329.082,5339.538,"Another terms of the dealer selling agreement, Chevrolet cannot prevent its dealers and doesn't attempt to from selling cars to Avis."
1965.46,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5339.538,5340.874,"Well, is there any servicing --"
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5340.874,5349.704,Well they sell to Avis and if Avis wants to resale them under the terms of the dealer selling agreement that can't be stopped.
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5372.801,5385.007,"Alright, now tell me what, in your view, are the differences between that hypothetical situation and the one with which we're here confronted."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5413.247,5421.637,"Well, when Avis buys the car and takes title, any sale thereafter becomes a used car sale."
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5422.652,5423.619,I understand that you said it several times.
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5423.619,5424.421,Why?
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5453.684,5466.413,"So you think that discount houses could not use that double title of transfer device here because they wouldn't be able to represent that the car was a new car, is it?"
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5466.413,5466.438,That's one reason they couldn't.
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5466.438,5468.095,Is that what you're relying on?
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5468.497,5471.167,That's one reason they could not.
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5521.186,5525.477,"I'm really not interested in the commercial aspects of this, I'm sure you know."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5525.477,5526.67,Oh no!
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5573.513,5575.607,This is not a per se.
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5575.607,5575.727,Pardon me?
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5575.727,5578.331,"They don't claim this as per se violation, what is this."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5580.081,5581.933,"Well, it depends on what we're talking about."
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5618.01,5624.536,"Well, you talked about White that was per se violation."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5630.513,5632.425,"Yes, but I don't exactly see what you mean."
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5638.043,5640.041,"Yes, how they did it."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5640.041,5640.552,Yes.
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5640.552,5641.249,All about it.
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5641.249,5641.754,Yes.
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5641.754,5644.218,What effect it had on your dealership arrangement?
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5644.218,5646.182,"Yes, we showed that."
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5659.167,5664.827,"They did it in White and that was permitted, it went on the pleadings."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5664.827,5671.817,"Well, we put this in not to fight this vertical restriction Mr. Justice White, because they didn't even talk about this in the trial court."
1965.46,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5698.522,5702.975,"What part of the conspiracy, from General Motors?"
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5702.975,5708.919,Conspiracy to prevent sale through discount houses which they characterized as a boycott.
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5814.683,5820.709,What -- that was a letter telling them not to deal with discount houses?
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5820.709,5821.32,That's right.
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5821.32,5825.451,And they sent it to every dealer.
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5825.451,5828.545,"Every dealer in the United States, that's right."
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5831.728,5839.489,Did General Motors bring suit against any of these -- any of its dealers for violation of franchise agreement in this respect?
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5839.489,5840.586,"No sir, they did not."
1965.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5862.395,5864.206,I'm sure the feeling is mutual.
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,5864.206,5867.84,"Yes, I hope so."
1965.46,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6310.914,6312.81,So that in your view -- excuse me --
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,6312.81,6313.491,Excuse me?
1965.46,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6313.491,6321.102,"In your view, this really wasn't of -- the effectiveness of this arrangement wasn't price at all."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,6325.015,6326.177,There's no question about it.
1965.46,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6338.438,6346.826,"And the advantage of it was so that either was using it was that he didn't sell it in a lower price, he was just getting more value."
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,6346.826,6353.957,"That's why he got another outlet, he got another place of business just the same as if he did establish it himself, he got another outlet."
1965.46,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6353.957,6359.49,Or just likely his salesman that were cruising around in those other areas where he is specially affected.
1965.46,1,27705,homer_i_mitchell,,6359.49,6369.853,"Well, but salesman cruising around, Mr. Justice White, don't produce that psychology that drags people into discount houses thinking they can purchase for less."
1965.46,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6428.656,6430.323,Judge Hansen.
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6430.323,6435.267,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.46,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6679.768,6686.214,"Well, Mr. Friedman says the Government is still seeking relief against the association."
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6686.214,6712.214,"Mr. Justice White, I heard that, but there's nothing in their brief there's nothing in their argument, there's nothing in the evidence that would justify any relief and it's my understanding the rule is equally applicable to the Government as it's applicable to private parties that the Court will only consider those matters which are included in the question presented to the Court."
1965.46,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6729.189,6739.765,You don't think it's included in the idea that each of the dealers in Los Angeles conspired with General Motors if we're suddenly shown that the way they did it was through their association?
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6739.765,6745.436,"No, there's no showing that they did it through the association then all dealers are not members of the association."
1965.46,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6745.436,6753.327,"Well, that may be so and that may be the record, that may be what the record is but that's a little bit different from saying they're not entitled to urge it here."
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6753.327,6754.573,But they haven't urged.
1965.46,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6755.129,6761.322,"Well, I suggest they're urging it by saying that all of the dealers have conspired with General Motors."
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6761.322,6767.874,"Well, for the first time I heard it today that Mr. Friedman said that they were hoping to get relief against the association."
1965.46,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6768.084,6769.706,"Well, but may be the record --"
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6769.706,6769.708,Pardon?
1965.46,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6769.708,6776.73,"May be the record doesn't sustain their contention if you suggest, but you think they're even entitled to have us consider it here?"
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6776.73,6779.609,I don't think so because I don't think it's within the question.
1965.46,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,6795.376,6796.888,Are they a party to the suit?
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6796.888,6797.311,Pardon?
1965.46,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,6797.311,6798.755,Are they a party to the suit?
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6798.755,6801.744,They are not -- the dealers are not parties to the suit.
1965.46,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,6801.744,6801.846,I mean the --
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6801.846,6804.184,The associations are.
1965.46,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,6804.184,6812.053,They are the ones that are alleged who policed the understanding policy?
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6812.053,6820.659,"They were in the lower court were contended to be at parties that part of the alleged conspiracy, but not before this Court."
1965.46,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6820.659,6826.586,"Will you rely, Judge Hansen, primarily on the finding that there was no conspiracy?"
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6826.586,6837.012,"Well, the finding was the appellee dealer association, did not act in combination, conspiracy or concert with General Motors."
1965.46,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6878.388,6881.074,"Well, I suppose those findings were not acceptable?"
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6881.074,6885.633,"Well, my understanding is if they must be found to be --"
1965.46,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6885.633,6892.798,"Well, I know, clearly erroneous, but suppose on the premise that they were found to be clearly erroneous --"
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6892.798,6892.985,Well --
1965.46,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6892.985,6895.036,-- would then the association --
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6895.036,6895.222,-- but there is Your Honor --
1965.46,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6895.222,6897.189,-- adhere on the Government's argument?
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6897.189,6899.626,"There is no iota of evidence to show that, as a matter of fact --"
1965.46,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6899.626,6902.358,"I know, Judge Hansen, I know your position on it."
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6909.267,6910.316,I think not.
1965.46,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6910.316,6911.19,Not even that?
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6911.19,6912.169,Not even that.
1965.46,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6966.334,6978.606,"Is there finding -- Judge Hansen, is there a finding that the effect of the association participated in the inspection or policing or whatever it may be called?"
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,6978.606,6997.102,"The associations did after the policy had been announced the following year, did employ an investigator and did shop for the purpose of whether or not there were sales -- still sales through discount houses."
1965.46,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7022.315,7024.74,But what was that legislation?
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,7024.74,7029.068,The legislation was promotion or establishment of the commission.
1965.46,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7061.099,7066.086,"Well, that doesn't make this whole question practically academic?"
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,7066.444,7072.615,Not here because it passed the lower house but did not pass the Senate.
1965.46,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7084.617,7094.843,"Now, did the associations also advise General Motors of the results of the surveys made by their hired man?"
1965.46,2,43611,victor_r_hansen,,7094.843,7114.984,"They did after, not the association as such, but members of the association did advise General Motors of it but only after the alleged conspiracy to call General Motors to prevent dealers from selling through discount houses."
1965.46,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7118.614,7119.51,Mr. Friedman.
1965.46,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7119.51,7121.197,"Yes, I believe, I have a couple of minutes."
1965.46,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7121.197,7122.067,Yes you have.
1965.46,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7122.067,7137.286,"Just like, two things, first to refer briefly to this question of the participation of the associations, I'd like to provide the Court's attention to Finding 42 which specifically refers to the association's participation in the policing."
1965.46,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7146.839,7148.754,"Pardon, just one last thing, Mr. Friedman."
1965.46,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7157.332,7162.377,"Well, 42, we think, supports us because it shows that the associations did participate in --"
1965.46,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7162.377,7166.81,My question is does anything have to be done the finding in 44 can stand and yet you say --
1965.46,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7166.81,7167.397,Yes.
1965.46,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7167.397,7168.076,Alright.
1965.46,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7168.076,7178.295,"Now, the final thing -- point I'd like to make is this, there's been a lot of discussion here as to whether discount houses do give peoples bargains or don't give people bargains."
1965.46,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7326.655,7329.294,"Mr. Friedman, just one question."
1965.46,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7344.724,7353.277,"No, I think as far as the franchise agreement is concerned, we do not -- that is not -- would not give us relief against the associations, because the associations we don't think --"
1965.46,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7353.277,7356.801,Your conspiracy case has to stand before you reach the association.
1965.46,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7356.801,7358.704,"Yes, I think so."
1965.46,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7358.704,7363.191,"Well then, I don't follow, yet you say we can let Finding 44 stand."
1965.46,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7363.191,7365.221,That's my -- what it confused me --
1965.46,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7365.221,7368.748,That -- I'm sorry -- as far as the --
1965.46,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7368.748,7377.622,Can you prevail under conspiracy aspect of your case if we don't disturb Finding 44?
1965.46,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7377.622,7379.484,"No, I'm sorry Mr. Justice."
1965.46,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7386.193,7389.112,And the finding in policing in 42 does you no good.
1965.46,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7389.112,7389.817,"That's right, because --"
1965.46,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7389.817,7391.826,Without upsetting Finding 44.
1965.46,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7391.826,7392.183,That's right.
1965.46,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7392.183,7396.948,"So that you got to upset 44 to reach the association, that's the short of it, isn't it?"
1965.46,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7396.948,7400.613,"That's right, but not to reach General Motors on the franchise."
1965.46,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7400.613,7402.638,You mean just as to the conspiracy?
1965.46,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7402.638,7403.183,Pardon?
1965.46,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7403.183,7404.359,You mean as to the conspiracy?
1965.46,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7404.359,7406.686,"Yes, yes."
1965.46,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7406.686,7428.607,Very well.
