1996.95-813,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.037,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 95-813, Brad Bennett v. Michael Spear."
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,9.598,13.18,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-813,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,30.062,33.335,"We're talking about the granting of a motion to dismiss here, aren't we?"
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,33.335,33.615,That's correct.
1996.95-813,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,33.615,38.069,"So, we're talking about the... how you construe allegations in a complaint basically."
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,38.069,39.919,"In part, that's... yes, absolutely correct."
1996.95-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.113,130.461,Mr. Wilkinson--
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,130.461,131.354,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,131.354,151.047,"--the Solicitor General in response apparently chooses not to address the merits, but does raise an issue about whether the petitioners have Article III standing and an issue about whether the claims are cognizable under the statutory scheme."
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,157.96,161.142,"Justice O'Connor, the Article III arguments were raised below."
1996.95-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.049,174.452,You mean in response to the petition on certiorari?
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,174.452,175.534,"--That's correct, yes."
1996.95-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.108,191.195,And do we have before us today any issue on the APA claim?
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,191.195,200.661,"The APA arguments as well were not raised below in our view by the Government, and consequently also are not properly before you today."
1996.95-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,200.661,205.343,"Mr. Wilkinson, jurisdictional issues are always properly before us."
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,213.169,215.13,"Oh, Justice Scalia, yes, I believe you can."
1996.95-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.915,273.048,"Assuming we agree with you on the prudential issues, would you want us to resolve the Article III issue or remand to have--"
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,273.048,280.815,"We would prefer, if you are with us on the prudential issues, that we are still in this case, that you go forward and try and resolve the Article III issues."
1996.95-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,298.527,310.484,"--Well, now, is the Article III standing issue... does the resolution of that depend at all on who it is the petitioners sued, what agency?"
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,310.484,311.937,--We don't believe that--
1996.95-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,311.937,316.21,Does that enter into the calculus of the Article III standing question?
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,316.21,318.661,"--No, Your Honor, it doesn't as far as I'm concerned."
1996.95-813,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,319.942,332.923,"Well, apparently the suit below was not brought against the Secretary who has the final determination."
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,332.923,335.727,--Actually the suit below was brought against the Secretary.
1996.95-813,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,357.739,366.185,"The problem that's bothering me... maybe I'll set it all out... is that suppose I think this isn't ripe, this case."
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,405.133,405.714,Your Honor--
1996.95-813,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,405.714,409.214,--and without knowing what your basis for attacking the Secretary's action is?
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,431.67,438.486,"--Let me deal first with the situation that exists in this case, and then I'll deal with your hypothetical."
1996.95-813,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,465.966,470.119,"Mr. Wilkinson, could you just clarify what you mean by comply?"
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,475.454,477.075,"Yes, he has, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.95-813,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,499.381,508.198,"So, you say the ripeness question is something that needs to be aired in a court of first instance, but that you have--"
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,508.198,515.664,"We believe that we have satisfied in this case already, on the basis of the pleadings before you, the issue of ripeness."
1996.95-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,515.664,519.895,--It can be contested later in more detail I assume.
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,519.895,520.186,"Certainly, and--"
1996.95-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.186,525.719,"At the summary judgment stage and at the merits stage, even more evidence can be brought in on that."
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,525.719,526.45,--That's correct.
1996.95-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,526.45,530.403,"But you're saying that at the pleading level, you've done all that's needed at that point."
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,530.403,530.954,That's correct.
1996.95-813,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,530.954,534.314,"Yes, but you just recited some facts that are not included in your pleading."
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,534.314,538.959,We never had the opportunity to raise those issues.
1996.95-813,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,538.959,547.324,"Well, but if you want... it just seems to me if you want the issue decided on the complaint as it now stands, I don't see how you can tell us facts that are not in those things you say should be dispositive."
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,547.324,561.806,In our complaint... it's page 40 of the petition appendix... we alleged that the restrictions on lake levels imposed in the biological opinion adversely affect plaintiffs by substantially reducing the quantity of available irrigation water.
1996.95-813,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,565.777,569.439,"Yes, but the Government points out there's no allegation that you're going to even lose a gallon of water."
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,569.439,570.431,Well--
1996.95-813,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,570.431,576.204,"And theoretically under your pleading, all the harm could be suffered by other water users."
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,576.204,581.187,"--Well, the Government is not, I'm afraid, being straight with you in terms of how this project operates."
1996.95-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,620.794,627.409,Did you allege that the Secretary accepted the opinion and was proceeding in accordance with the opinion.
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,627.409,627.679,We did.
1996.95-813,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,627.679,628.48,Is that in your complaint?
1996.95-813,0,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,628.48,630.632,We alleged on... this is at petition appendix--
1996.95-813,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1670.75,1670.95,Yes.
1996.95-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1757.87,1769.177,"But even if that were true, the Administrative Procedure Act would provide for a suit against Government action, action that couldn't be taken by private individuals--"
1996.95-813,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1769.177,1769.418,--That... that's--
1996.95-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1769.418,1773.8,--but can be taken by Government so long as the individual is within the zone of interest.
1996.95-813,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1773.8,1774.18,--That's correct.
1996.95-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.18,1783.437,"And if the statute requires economic considerations to be taken into account, a person who would be favored by taking them into account is certainly within the zone of interests."
1996.95-813,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1783.437,1786.378,"Yes, but that would be a suit under the APA."
1996.95-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1786.949,1788.551,Which is not eliminated by the--
1996.95-813,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1788.551,1790.052,--Right.
1996.95-813,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1797.717,1814.738,"--But in short, you under the Endangered Species Act, although without talking about zone of interest, reach really the same conclusion as the Ninth Circuit, namely, that this is an act that works only one way for those who are protecting the endangered species and not for economic interests that are injured."
1996.95-813,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1814.738,1822.334,That's... violations are categorized as things that harm the species.
1996.95-813,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.366,1825.607,Excuse me.
1996.95-813,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1837.944,1839.216,"Well, yes."
1996.95-813,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1857.789,1858.019,"Well, I don't understand."
1996.95-813,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1874.739,1875.079,--Right.
1996.95-813,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1875.079,1892.671,"The reason that it is illegal, says the plaintiff, is because they received a report that was not prepared as the statute requires; i.e., it did not use the best scientific commercial and... scientific and commercial data available."
1996.95-813,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1900.718,1906.822,"They would bring a suit against the action agency, not against the Fish and Wildlife Service, and they would have that--"
1996.95-813,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1906.822,1907.033,No.
1996.95-813,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1927.227,1927.437,--No.
1996.95-813,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.492,1933.941,They would name the Secretary.
1996.95-813,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1934.372,1938.956,"--They would name who was ever responsible for operating the project on the ground, not whoever gave the advice."
1996.95-813,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1938.956,1943.699,Could the suit be brought under the citizen suit provision of the Endangered Species Act?
1996.95-813,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1943.699,1943.919,No.
1996.95-813,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1946.44,1953.745,What is it in the Endangered Species Act that limits the ability to bring the suit that we're hypothesizing?
1996.95-813,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1953.745,1971.046,Because again in our view the citizen suit provision of the Endangered Species Act like citizen suit... other citizen suit provisions are designed to allow private persons or the Government as the plaintiff to sue whoever might be causing pollution or harming a species.
1996.95-813,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1972.939,1973.559,But it doesn't say that.
1996.95-813,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1975.591,1990.64,"It's the word violation because the word violation in our view and enforcing the act, which is another word that the citizen suit provision uses, suggests law enforcement against people who are taking actions--"
1996.95-813,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1990.64,1993.261,--Could we consider the language of the statute?
1996.95-813,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2038.722,2047.067,"--Justice O'Connor, there are a number of provisions... a number of aspects of the citizen suit provision which we think cut strongly the other way."
1996.95-813,2,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,3336.279,3336.839,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1996.95-813,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3366.499,3369.55,You mean the archaic procedure that's used everywhere else in the Government.
1996.95-813,2,26274,gregory_k_wilkinson,,3372.964,3376.407,"Not in this statute, Your Honor, it isn't used."
1996.95-813,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3383.234,3384.226,"Thank you, Mr. Wilkinson."
