1997.96-1133,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.465,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1133, United States v. Edward G. Scheffer."
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,7.777,10.829,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1133,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,82.616,96.646,Would that have been the... was that the consequence of the Armed Forces Court of Appeals opinion here that the validity of each individual polygraph examination had to be tested in each case?
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,96.646,98.876,"I think that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-1133,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,129.827,136.201,How is it handled in other jurisdictions where there's no per se rule in effect?
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,140.774,143.157,"It is not, Justice O'Connor."
1997.96-1133,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,156.625,163.731,"And so from your research no State is treating it like other expert testimony, in effect."
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,163.731,164.322,One State is.
1997.96-1133,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.279,179.802,But even New Mexico doesn't follow the typical expert testimony approach.
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,179.802,180.981,--I think that that's fair.
1997.96-1133,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,182.914,183.235,Right.
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,183.235,188.016,--far greater degree of specificity than for other expert testimony.
1997.96-1133,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,189.438,204.138,"Daubert, of course, is in the civil context, but would you say that the petitioner's... pardon me, that the respondent's position here is consistent generally with what we held in Daubert?"
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,204.138,209.701,--I think the respondent's position here is... goes quite a bit further than Daubert.
1997.96-1133,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,224.401,225.3,I recognize the difference.
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,233.698,235.828,That is--
1997.96-1133,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,235.828,247.465,"I recognize one's civil, one's criminal, one's constitutional, one's evidence, but so far as the thrust of what the Court was talking about so far as sound management of trials, isn't there some inconsistency with your position in Daubert?"
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,247.465,249.937,--I don't think there is any inconsistency.
1997.96-1133,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,314.409,330.429,"Mr. Dreeben, when the Government itself is responsible for the polygraph, and the Government is attacking the credibility of the defendant, isn't that a different situation?"
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,353.535,373.459,"Justice Ginsburg, the Government might have had a particular defendant interviewed by a psychiatrist if the defendant consented to that, and the psychiatrist might say, based on my expert opinion and analysis of this particular person's responses in the interview, I can render an opinion that he was quite certainly deceptive or not deceptive."
1997.96-1133,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,395.353,396.305,"Mr. Dreeben, can I ask you this."
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,424.664,425.225,--Yes.
1997.96-1133,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,434.031,435.43,Even if completely reliable?
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,435.43,441.034,"--Well, completely reliable, I think that no form of scientific tests will ever be viewed by any--"
1997.96-1133,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,441.034,444.286,"Well, at least as reliable as fingerprints or DNA or something like that."
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,444.286,455.926,"--Even if it had achieved that degree of reliability, which I think there's no reason to believe that it has, and there's no reason why the President as a matter of constitutional law must assume, it still has a different character--"
1997.96-1133,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,455.926,456.376,I understand.
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,456.376,458.72,--than other forms of scientific evidence in two key respects.
1997.96-1133,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,482.633,483.124,But why doesn't--
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,483.124,483.674,We don't have that--
1997.96-1133,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,483.674,494.202,"--Why doesn't fingerprint do the... evidence do the same thing if the witness says... gets on the stand and says, I was never in the place where the crime took place, and somebody says, well, your fingerprints were there."
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,496.644,497.065,--No.
1997.96-1133,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,555.522,567.129,"Well, this rule cuts both ways, because there might be times when the Government would like to produce a polygraph test in court because it shows the defendant is lying."
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,567.129,568.311,"--That's correct, Justice--"
1997.96-1133,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,568.311,571.373,"And under the military rule, the Government can't do that."
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,573.294,577.477,"--It does, and I think that that largely reflects the fact that we take a consistent position on this."
1997.96-1133,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,584.33,588.233,What... under what authority did the President adopt the rule?
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,593.998,623.466,"--The President is delegated authority under Article 36 of the U.C.M.J., which is reprinted in footnote 2 on page 5 of our principal brief, and it says that pretrial, trial, and post trial procedures, including modes of proof, may be prescribed by the President by regulations which, so far as he considers practicable, apply principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in a trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts."
1997.96-1133,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,623.466,642.079,"Getting back to your colloquy with Justice O'Connor just a moment ago, I think perhaps the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces might have taken a different view if the Government had sought to introduce the polygraph test, because they seem to base their constitutional decision on the defendant's right to call witnesses in his favor."
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,642.079,644.9,"That is absolutely right, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-1133,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,661.1,662.792,"Well, the President could change that, the scope of--"
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,662.792,663.913,--The President could change that.
1997.96-1133,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,697.414,715.557,"--Mr. Dreeben, as to the truth-telling identification that the polygraph is offered for, it's been traditionally allowed to have a character witness for defendants."
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,722.493,723.692,--Correct.
1997.96-1133,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,723.692,733.689,"Well, isn't the polygraph far more reliable than just any character witness the defendant wants to present?"
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,733.689,763.679,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think that that assumes that there is scientific validity and accuracy to the polygraph, which we dispute, but more importantly, the system of rules of evidence that we have in courtrooms specifically right now allows opinion evidence and reputation evidence about a trait of character of a witness, but it does not allow specific instances, and it certainly does not allow a witness to say, I know this person, he did denied committing the crime to me, and I believe him."
1997.96-1133,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,768.763,772.414,"No, but it's reputation as to credibility that the character witness testifies to."
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,772.414,777.91,--The character witness testifies only about what the individual's reputation--
1997.96-1133,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,777.91,778.729,As to credibility.
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,778.729,779.881,"--As to credibility, and--"
1997.96-1133,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,779.881,780.311,Right.
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,784.302,793.559,"--I think there's an important distinction, Justice Stevens, and that is the polygraph examiner will not render an opinion that I believe that this person is generally credible."
1997.96-1133,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.856,832.194,"Yes, but there's a difference as to the degree of reliability between the two, obviously, and... but your position as I understand it is, even if it were totally reliable, you would still take the same position it's inadmissible."
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,832.194,833.456,"I do, Justice Stevens."
1997.96-1133,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,833.456,834.196,Yes.
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,834.196,840.91,"I recognize that the Court might view that as a somewhat different case, and I think that if, in fact, there were a 100-percent reliable--"
1997.96-1133,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,840.91,851.867,"But then how do you... but then are you saying that the scientists who filed a brief saying it's 90-percent accurate if conducted properly, that we should disbelieve the substance of that brief?"
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,853.048,870.86,"--I think all the Court has to do is realize that this is an area of extraordinary scientific polarization, and that a reasonable system of evidentiary rules is entitled to deference in the conclusion that polygraph has not progressed to the point where its reliability justifies--"
1997.96-1133,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,870.86,871.17,Well--
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,871.17,874.744,--that we litigate about this in every single case where the defendant wants to present it.
1997.96-1133,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,874.744,878.734,"--we don't ordinarily make findings of fact on the basis of briefs, I guess."
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,878.734,881.827,I think that that is certainly an additional point here.
1997.96-1133,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,883.85,890.502,"No, but it is true, is it not, that we can take judicial notice of the practice of the Government itself in routinely using its experts for this very purpose?"
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,890.502,895.447,"--Well, I think equally pertinent is the fact that we take the position that it should not be admitted into evidence."
1997.96-1133,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,896.656,897.047,Mr.--
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,897.047,905.612,"--uses of investigatory tools such as the polygraph, which then do not come into evidence because they are either not sufficiently reliable or not needed, are common."
1997.96-1133,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,934.781,937.833,"--Mr. Dreeben, could you go back to your use of the polygraph itself?"
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,956.837,959.919,"--I want to be clear about this, Justice Souter."
1997.96-1133,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,975.57,977.45,Not even to hire or not hire someone?
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,977.45,988.336,"Not even to hire or not hire, except in extraordinary circumstances, and I certainly don't want to say that it never would be relied on as a sole factor, but it primarily is used in personnel screening in this way:"
1997.96-1133,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1030.786,1038.382,"So basically you use it as a kind of a tip-off of something, as a means of putting somebody on the spot, legitimately, but that's as far as the Government goes?"
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1038.382,1042.093,--I don't want to be categorical and say that's as far as the Government goes.
1997.96-1133,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1042.093,1045.704,"No, I realize there may be exceptions, but in sub... substantially, that is the only kind of use that's made."
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1045.704,1049.308,Substantially in the personnel screening area that's the use that's made.
1997.96-1133,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1049.709,1051.018,"In criminal investigation likewise, I assume?"
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1051.018,1056.233,"--In investigations, the polygraph is an extraordinarily productive interrogation tool."
1997.96-1133,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1103.474,1105.635,It's the tainted morsel of the 20th Century.
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1106.246,1120.395,"Well, it has a certain use in that respect that would suggest that the Government continues to use it, but at the same time, it's not arbitrary to say that, look, not everything that we do in the investigatory phase should come into admission in evidence."
1997.96-1133,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1120.395,1126.84,"Are there instances in which an employee is terminated for failure to take a polygraph, Government employment?"
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1126.84,1136.774,"My understanding, Justice Kennedy, is that in the... certain national security agencies if you're not willing to take a polygraph, then you won't be able to work at that agency."
1997.96-1133,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1255.322,1277.257,"Mr. Dreeben, why doesn't it work the other way with respect to the military courts, because my understanding is that the courts martial, the equivalent to the jurors, are of a certain high level, perhaps higher than the ordinary jury that would sit in a Federal court in a criminal case."
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1277.257,1293.967,"Justice Ginsburg, I wouldn't want to disparage the ability of the courts martial members to understand and deal appropriately with scientific evidence, but it is still true that the military conducts an inordinate number of court martial proceedings around the world."
1997.96-1133,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1320.786,1327.1,"Well, it seems to me you're somewhat deflecting the thrust of Justice Ginsburg's question, and I notice this in your brief, too."
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1337.595,1341.679,"That is true, Justice Kennedy, and I don't disagree with that submission."
1997.96-1133,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1355.019,1360.682,"Well, that may be true, but it doesn't go to the point of the differences in the trier of fact Justice Ginsburg was referring to."
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1360.682,1371.579,"--The triers of fact may or may not be superior in the military, but the point is that this particular form of evidence, unlike most other forms of evidence, doesn't have a track record."
1997.96-1133,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1371.96,1377.893,"Well, I suppose one could argue that if the triers of fact are indeed superior, they need less help from this sort of evidence."
1997.96-1133,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1377.893,1382.796,"--Mr. Chief Justice, that is certainly an additional consideration that supports the rule here."
1997.96-1133,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1422.773,1423.842,"Very well, Mr. Dreeben."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1426.233,1432.13,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1477.929,1480.85,"Those... those other uses you're referring to, I mean they are very common."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1485.553,1486.935,"No, Your Honor--"
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1486.935,1490.367,Or for whether you're going to let a murderer back... back out on the streets.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1490.367,1495.34,"--No, Your Honor, they're very different uses, but... but they are also very important uses."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1506.198,1517.775,"Well, but, you know, I mean, I... I might exclude somebody from the sensitive secrets of his... of the Nation if his... you know, if his... if his uncle is a... a Chinese Communist."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1531.514,1532.455,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1534.266,1537.598,"So, then, all of these uses are really... don't... don't establish your point at all."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1537.598,1546.834,"--Well, what the uses establish, Your Honor, we would submit, is this... if this polygraph were so unreliable, why are millions of tax dollars being spent for it?"
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1550.117,1555.619,"I don't think they deny that it might have a certain level of reliability and... and, just in case it does, they... they use it."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1571.251,1583.917,"Well, Your Honor, we would submit that it's at least as reliable enough... well... well, first off, on sending people to jail, the use we're talking about here is basically coming in, in an exculpatory sense, not in an inculpatory sense."
1997.96-1133,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1583.917,1589.503,"Yes, but I think you can't just close the door at that point."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1589.503,1589.823,Yes.
1997.96-1133,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1589.823,1596.166,"Because the President would be free to say, okay, all bets are off, and the next case, there is no rule."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1614.339,1616.332,"Yes, Your Honor, you're absolutely right."
1997.96-1133,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1649.922,1658.458,"Would your rule extend to a crucial defense witness as well, whose credibility is attacked?"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1658.458,1659.84,It would--
1997.96-1133,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1659.84,1668.994,"Here is... here is the state, has the burden of proof, brings in a crucial witness, who says, I saw the defendant stab the victim."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1677.089,1683.394,"--Well, Your Honor, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces specifically limited their holding to a polygraph examination of the defendant."
1997.96-1133,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1683.394,1685.494,"And what would your position be, logically?"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1685.494,1685.945,Your Honor--
1997.96-1133,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1685.945,1688.928,"From the position you're taking here, it's part of the defense?"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1688.928,1689.449,--Right.
1997.96-1133,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1693.329,1694.09,"Well, it's critical."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1694.09,1694.571,--I... I--
1997.96-1133,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1694.571,1695.202,This is the eyewitness.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1695.202,1699.953,"--Your Honor, then I would say you would have to... you would have to do the same balancing we're doing here."
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1708.239,1712.112,So we'd have a big evidentiary hearing in every case where the polygraph was used?
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1712.112,1718.447,"--It would call for evidentiary hearings where there was an exculpatory polygraph, Your Honor, or one in favor of the defense."
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1759.162,1759.583,But--
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1759.583,1761.144,--be disposed of pretrial--
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1761.144,1771.622,"--But how... how about a defendant, before the case is brought, who fails a polygraph test; there may be other reasons now why the... the... the Armed Forces would say, let's not bring this guy to trial."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1775.913,1777.666,"--Yes, Your Honor, it does right now, as well."
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1777.666,1781.079,And don't you think that might lead to more cases being brought?
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1781.079,1784.811,I would not think so.
1997.96-1133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1799.599,1832.032,"How... how would you avoid the endless hearings that would... or the disputes before the jury about whether the polygraph is given in the best possible way, of whether it is in fact, in this instance, how probative, of whether or not polygraphs, in general, are reliable or even if they are, in general, often reliable, whether this is the kind of one that is really that reliable or not, all of which, before a finder of fact that's not necessarily sophisticated in scientific matters?"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1832.032,1833.551,"Well, Your Honor, a... a couple of points."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.799,1847.45,I don't understand what you mean.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1848.512,1849.113,"--Well, basically--"
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.113,1854.415,"The issue for the jury, it seems to me, is whether this person who administered the polygraph test is any good."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1854.415,1856.927,"--Yes, Your Honor, but a lot of--"
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1856.927,1857.979,How can the judge decide that?
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1857.979,1865.903,"--Well, at the preliminary hearing, under... on 102, he is going to make a determination of whether or not it should even go to the jury, like was done in this--"
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1865.903,1874.478,"Yeah, but once it goes to the jury, the ju... the jury is certainly entitled to come to the conclusion that this person who administered the polygraph test is a hack."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1874.478,1876.629,"--Yes, Your Honor, they certainly could."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1876.629,1878.722,And comes to the wrong conclusion most of the... isn't the jury entitled to do that?
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1878.722,1879.22,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1879.22,1882.192,So aren't you entitled to put in evidence to show that this person is a hack?
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1882.192,1883.233,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1883.233,1883.894,Okay.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1883.894,1884.185,I--
1997.96-1133,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1884.185,1884.946,"Well, I don't know how you avoid that."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1901.187,1910.021,"--No... no, Your Honor, because at least... the... the problem with this rule is there's no exceptions, no matter how qualified."
1997.96-1133,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1910.021,1910.391,I understand.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1922.0,1927.052,"As long as the standards were not arbitrary and disproportionate, Your Honor, we would... we would not be doing that."
1997.96-1133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1953.359,1957.452,"Well, is there any basis in the law... suppose we adopted your reliability test."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1978.067,1978.848,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1997.96-1133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1978.848,1981.219,And there would be no rule of law that I'm aware of that would stop it.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1988.742,1989.062,--Yes.
1997.96-1133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1989.873,1993.216,"--the... the prosecution... defense can do it, the prosecution can do it."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,1999.911,2000.279,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2014.55,2016.952,"In this case, it was the govern... government's own--"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2016.952,2018.081,"Yes, ma'am."
1997.96-1133,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2018.081,2018.552,--test.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2018.552,2019.463,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2019.463,2022.947,And we could presume that that would meet whatever standards one might set up.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2057.036,2058.379,"Your Honor, we submit no."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2066.293,2068.815,I don't understand this constitutional rule you're asserting.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2086.797,2087.658,"Your Honor, he could hire someone on his own."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2092.862,2093.161,No; I understand.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2112.445,2114.246,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.287,2115.478,--I don't think so.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2115.478,2120.751,"--not that it must be admitted... simply that he has the opportunity for his hearing, for his day in court."
1997.96-1133,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2120.751,2121.052,"Well, the--"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2121.052,2122.694,To show that his test was reliable.
1997.96-1133,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2122.694,2141.043,"--Isn't it also the logic of your position that if we agree with you to exactly that extent, we would also have to strike down a rule, a per se rule, that excluded the opinions of psychiatrists or psychologists on the specific truth telling of a witness?"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2141.043,2142.495,"Well, Your Honor--"
1997.96-1133,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2142.495,2145.858,"We would... we would... we would have to say, well, the door is not entirely shut to that."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2145.858,2148.86,"--Well, Your Honor... and... and... and that is a tough issue."
1997.96-1133,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2149.882,2150.18,"Well, what's the answer?"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2150.18,2150.52,--Well--
1997.96-1133,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2150.52,2151.492,We'd... we'd have to... we'd have to--
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2152.801,2155.745,"--Well... well, Your Honor, perhaps and perhaps not."
1997.96-1133,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2191.516,2211.341,"Yeah, but you can make the same argument, absent the... the... the mechanics on... on the part of the psychiatrist, a psy... or a psychologist, with... with long clinical experience, and the opportunity to verify the stories of the... of the people interviewed, with... with independently verified facts."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2223.089,2227.861,"Yes, Your Honor, the... the courts don't allow that now."
1997.96-1133,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2234.907,2235.167,But--
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2235.167,2237.087,It's a hairline difference between what they actually can get in.
1997.96-1133,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2237.087,2253.658,"--But... but you really... therefore, if we accept your position, we're... we're going to make a determination not only about polygraphs, but I suppose we would be making a... a kind of sea change in... in... in a... in a constitutional evidence rule."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2275.763,2283.087,"Well, Your Honor, I... I would think that the... the... whether or not it's a sea change is going to depend on how narrowly or broadly this Court chooses to view this."
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2297.168,2308.345,"Yet... but your point in... in response to some of the questions, Ms. Sheffield, has been, you know, we don't ask that it be admitted, we just ask that it be submitted to a judge to decide."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2327.897,2336.174,"Well, Your Honor, I'm glad... I'm glad you mentioned the hearsay, because the thing with the other evidentiary rules, designed to ensure reliability and other reasons, all of them have exceptions."
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2337.283,2337.934,Of course it does.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2337.934,2346.549,"--and... and if there is a case, I believe, where the defense thinks their case is strong enough and there's enough indicia of reliability, they will probably make a proffer, under the residual exception."
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2352.143,2356.648,"But, nonetheless, there... the rules tend to be categorical."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2368.503,2369.214,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.489,2376.44,"Is your argument, every rule has to have an exception?"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2379.541,2396.883,"--Well, Your Honor, what we're saying, basically, is, one, when... when a defendant's constitutional rights are clearly at issue, where he has a Sixth... an arguable Sixth Amendment right that's at issue, a per se rule... you... you have to see if it apply... if the reasons for the per se rule apply in his case."
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2401.115,2404.029,But Rock... Rock was the defendant's own testimony.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2404.029,2404.727,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2419.386,2421.128,Are you talking about the other case or about Rock?
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2421.128,2421.539,--Okay.
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2448.286,2451.738,"Well, that... you... you're entitled, certainly, to take an expansive view of Rock."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2454.73,2455.11,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2455.831,2467.758,"Really, the... the... the key difference between... between all of these... all of these other rules of admissibility and... is what Justice Souter was inquiring into."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2492.664,2494.397,"Your Honor, I don't--"
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2494.397,2497.579,"I mean, if it's lower than 90 percent, maybe we should just dispense with juries and have polygraphs."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2499.139,2506.775,"--Well, Your Honor, to me, the... the most perplexing argument is this idea that the jury can determine credibility and the polygraph usurps their function."
1997.96-1133,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2518.225,2531.072,"I thought that the argument that Mr. Dreeben was making was not that it usurps the jury's function, but that it's unnecessary, since juries, from time immemorial, have been judging questions of credibility."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2536.615,2540.068,"Well... well, Your Honor, we... we submit that it's not unnecessary."
1997.96-1133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2593.414,2598.347,"Well, of course, they... they weren't purporting to be experts, reaching a conclusion as to credibility?"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2598.347,2599.439,"No, Your Honor, they were not."
1997.96-1133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2599.439,2600.528,All right.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2610.706,2614.61,"Your Honor, I'm not familiar with State proceedings enough to answer that."
1997.96-1133,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2628.377,2643.397,"May I ask what the rule is in the military, if there is one, in cases involving very young children who might have been cla... claim to have been sexually abused or something of that kind, who recount the instance to a... a caretaker soon after the incident occurred."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2650.082,2651.392,"Not as to the truthfulness, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2664.872,2670.315,I'm slightly curious how they know what... whether these are reliable or not.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2694.371,2695.021,Yes.
1997.96-1133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2704.34,2706.63,"Yeah, but my question is, how do they get these numbers, the accuracy rate?"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2706.63,2707.101,Your Honor--
1997.96-1133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2707.101,2710.063,"I mean, you'd have to have, like, a laboratory or something."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2722.111,2722.661,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2740.734,2744.637,"Yeah, but a confession wouldn't work in a case where a person is innocent."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2755.765,2756.646,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2756.646,2759.406,So how would you know in... how would you ever... how do they ever go about figuring this out?
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2759.406,2762.408,And... and that's one of the problems with nailing it down.
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2762.809,2768.653,"Ms. Sheffield, a moment ago, you were... you read a quotation from Taylor against Illinois."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2771.324,2772.285,"--It was a dissent, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2773.247,2774.316,I think you should have made that clear.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2774.316,2775.327,"I apologize, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2775.327,2797.674,"Ms. Sheffield, what do you make of the... the... of the information provided in one of the government briefs... I forget which... to the effect that less than one-third of the members of the two major polygraph examiners' organizations are of the opinion that their... that their... that their opinions should be admissible in evidence?"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2797.674,2803.727,"Well, Your Honor, that came from a study... a survey that was conducted by Dr. Licken... Dr. Lykken... I'm not sure which the correct way was."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2879.788,2894.918,"Ms. Sheffield, if... if we agree that polygraphs have to be used in the... as... that the Constitution requires polygraphs to be used in military trials, I suppose it would follow that... that they have to be used in civilian criminal trials."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2901.774,2902.876,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2902.876,2911.151,"--in... in Federal District Courts, we have... what about civil cases, is there any reason why the constitutional requirements wouldn't apply to civil cases?"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2911.151,2915.354,"Well, Your Honor, I... I wouldn't think that the Sixth Amendment would be implicated in a civil case."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2915.354,2926.09,"Is that right, there... there are no... there... there are no restrictions on the processes that... that can be used in... in civil trials--"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2926.09,2926.62,Your Honor--
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2926.62,2930.021,"--especially in those civil trials in Federal courts, where a jury is required?"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2930.021,2936.106,"--Well, Your Honor, it's my understanding that... that it does come in, in civil trials, even in some jurisdictions that don't allow it in criminal."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2940.409,2941.989,"Well, I... I would expect the same argument to be made."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2946.614,2947.335,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2947.335,2952.818,And you're excluding perfectly relevant evidence that... that the Constitution requires to be allowed in criminal trials.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2957.229,2961.212,"But... but, again, we're not asking this Court to hold it has to be admitted."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2962.233,2962.604,"Yes, it--"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2962.604,2963.385,--in his case.
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2963.385,2968.979,--it... it has to be admitted if the judge finds... finds that this is a good... a good enough expert.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2968.979,2970.178,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2970.178,2975.613,"It would be a strange rule that said you had to admit it, even if you found the expert was a fraud."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,2975.613,2977.444,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2990.603,3003.17,"Well, if... if... if we were the co... Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and... and there weren't any Rule 707 promulgated by the President, your presentation cert... certainly would make a great deal of sense."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,3015.709,3016.33,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3031.032,3031.663,"Well, let... let me ask you."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,3031.663,3032.023,--Yes.
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3032.023,3043.671,"Is there any way of... of limiting the rule adopted by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces to military criminal trials, as opposed to civilian criminal trials?"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,3051.887,3053.218,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3057.632,3058.93,How... how would you suggest that we do it?
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,3058.93,3063.994,"--Well, basically, the reasons that are problems for a lot of the States are not present for us."
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3095.115,3102.92,"But then what... but you would still have to derive it from the same constitutional principle, wouldn't you... the right of the defendant to call witnesses in his defense?"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,3102.92,3103.731,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3127.576,3134.589,"Well, if those safeguards were... were eliminated, the Army could... could then no longer admit polygraph evidence?"
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,3134.589,3137.073,--They would--
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3137.073,3146.089,"I mean, if... if we rule that it must be admitted only because there are all of these safeguards, the military could get them unadmitted again by simply eliminating all the safeguards."
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,3146.089,3148.322,--If they wanted to throw their... their thou--
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3148.322,3148.563,Yes.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,3148.563,3150.824,--hundreds of thousands of polygraphs into disarray.
1997.96-1133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3150.824,3151.144,Yeah.
1997.96-1133,1,34001,kim_l_sheffield,,3154.316,3158.207,"And... and, you know, what's interesting about the colander theory is that confession would be admissible."
1997.96-1133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3166.535,3167.082,"Thank you, Ms. Sheffield."
