1999.98-7809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,5.836,We'll hear argument next in No. 98-7809.
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,62.523,65.745,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-7809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.156,171.401,What is the constitutional basis for your claimed right of self-representation on appeal?
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,175.312,178.664,"Justice O'Connor, it's... it's the Due Process Clause."
1999.98-7809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.53,187.911,It's not the Sixth Amendment you rely on.
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,187.911,188.602,"--It is not the Sixth Amendment, no."
1999.98-7809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,188.602,191.685,And it's not the Equal Protection Clause.
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,191.685,192.874,It is not the Equal Protection Clause.
1999.98-7809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.874,197.328,"So, due process you fall back on."
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,197.328,198.197,That's correct.
1999.98-7809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,198.197,200.25,Could you spell that out a little bit?
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,200.25,200.851,I will.
1999.98-7809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,293.652,307.851,"Well, in a sense, I thought Evitts perhaps derived from the Equal Protection Clause, that an indigent defendant have... should have the same right to an effective appeal as... as a non-indigent defendant."
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,315.187,343.874,"Evitts, indeed, traced the... the rationale for the right to counsel, but it was very careful to explain that the right to counsel had a rationale which really partook of both clauses, Equal Protection and Due Process."
1999.98-7809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,347.538,358.695,"And now... but you... you say for your claim, it doesn't depend on equal protection at all; it depends on the due process strand, or whatever you want to call it, of that decision and others."
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,358.695,359.847,That's correct.
1999.98-7809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,432.513,437.057,But the Court has never said that it's a constitutional right to a direct appeal.
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,437.057,441.021,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, absolutely."
1999.98-7809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,441.021,448.745,"So, there's quite a sharp distinction between a trial which surely is a constitutional right and an appeal which isn't."
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,448.745,471.369,"There is that distinction, but it's not a distinction that matters for our argument in this case because the right that we're talking about is... is a... a right to counsel or not to counsel or to represent oneself, which I maintain is all part and parcel of the same right."
1999.98-7809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,492.313,502.961,"Mr. Maines, we're now almost 10 minutes into your argument, and we've gotten to where the right... you've established the right to counsel."
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,516.351,518.172,That's exactly right.
1999.98-7809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,601.648,616.819,"Now, that... that's quite true and I don't think you will find the Court is doubtful at all of the Faretta ruling where we've said you have a right to counsel at... rather a right to represent oneself at trial."
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,675.427,681.531,"They don't make a difference, Mr. Chief Justice, because they're the wrong facts to be looking at."
1999.98-7809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,716.696,722.23,"That's certainly true, but how many laymen would rather litigate a... an appeal than a--"
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,722.23,749.327,"But... but if... if what we're asking what is... what is the... what is the... how do we quantify the... the folly or the lack of wisdom of a defendant who wants to represent himself at trial versus one who wants to represent himself on direct appeal, I don't think it's... it's necessarily self-evident that he's--"
1999.98-7809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,749.327,752.69,"--Well, except with... with a trial, the decisions have to be made."
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,781.803,808.601,"--You can except that, under one of this Court's rulings, the defendant on appeal has to forebear to a decision by the appellate counsel to not advance a position that the... that the defendant is interested in pressing."
1999.98-7809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,808.601,817.698,"But under the California system we're looking at, I take it the defendant can file his own... his own brief in tandem, or am I wrong about that?"
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,817.698,820.929,"No, he can."
1999.98-7809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,820.929,822.579,He can?
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,846.926,866.43,"I... I suppose that they could, but I think the... the critical question is that given the structure of the Court's precedents in this area... and this, Mr. Chief Justice, is really getting to the core point here."
1999.98-7809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,888.513,893.756,"Well, but Faretta doesn't extend to appellate representation."
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,893.756,896.197,"--It... it doesn't, but the logic of Faretta... but the logic of Faretta is important."
1999.98-7809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,920.844,922.925,"Well, but it... it doesn't have to be arbitrary."
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,940.797,955.957,"And I concede that if... if you can coherently argue, based on the pattern of this Court's precedents, that there is such a series of differences between the two stages, then our argument doesn't work."
1999.98-7809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,955.957,958.02,"Mr. Maines, why isn't this a difference?"
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,1038.194,1049.742,Suppose the defendant's motivation is that he doesn't want to run the risk of getting a bad court-appointed lawyer.
1999.98-7809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1069.844,1071.153,What happened to all the money he made?
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,1071.153,1071.714,--court-appointed or otherwise.
1999.98-7809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1072.395,1079.161,What happened to all the money he made?
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,1081.812,1086.945,"Then let me... let me give you this hypothetical, Justice Scalia."
1999.98-7809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1124.55,1132.867,"Well, if he's a member of the bar, he... he could represent himself without any special constitutional dispensation, I would think."
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,1132.867,1136.848,"Well, he could, but let's say that he's not a member of the bar."
1999.98-7809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1136.848,1139.299,"Well, then he wouldn't be a distinguished appellate--"
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,1141.392,1166.067,I was simply trying to pose to... to us a hypothetical in which one could reasonably have a motivation that doesn't necessarily focus on the fact that at the trial level I'm the defendant and I want eye-to-eye contract with the judge or with the jury.
1999.98-7809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1168.56,1170.493,Aren't we supposed to be dealing with the generality of cases?
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,1196.699,1212.211,--Why should our... our view on what the advantages may or may not be determine whether the defendant has the opportunity to do that if it's a--
1999.98-7809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1212.211,1220.546,It seems to me it goes to a... a systemic judgment about what... what the... the limits of fundamental fairness are.
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,1222.697,1223.317,--It... it does--
1999.98-7809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1223.317,1224.319,--for that judgment I would suppose.
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,1224.319,1224.847,--It does absolutely.
1999.98-7809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1284.056,1292.601,"But, Mr. Maines, that was... Douglas was so equal protection driven, the idea that you could get a lawyer if you could afford it."
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,1297.766,1299.296,We don't.
1999.98-7809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1299.296,1308.172,"So, I think that that reduces very substantially any reliance that you can place on Douglas and Griffin, that line."
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,1308.172,1328.095,"Well, I'm... I'm simply trying to pose to you, Your Honor, a... a situation where reasonable people can say, yes, looking at this thing systemically, it looks like a fair enough system."
1999.98-7809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1344.748,1351.964,"Well, Faretta... Faretta had elements that, it seems to me, this case does not have."
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,1427.534,1427.845,We do.
1999.98-7809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1427.845,1428.947,Could you comment on those two points?
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,1428.947,1429.197,I will.
1999.98-7809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1456.335,1471.876,"So, I take it the consequence of that is that in... in fashioning, in effect, due process solutions, the... the courts, if anything... this Court, if anything, is... is freer than perhaps it... it felt itself to be in Faretta."
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,1471.876,1475.068,--It... it is... it is freer.
1999.98-7809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1503.646,1506.879,"If we made a mistake in Faretta, we should make another mistake here?"
1999.98-7809,0,40034,ronald_d_maines,,1507.099,1507.55,--No.
1999.98-7809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1544.345,1545.587,"Very well, Mr. Maines."
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1547.547,1558.837,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1999.98-7809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1576.658,1589.154,"Now, California does allow a pro se appellant to file a brief in addition to that filed by the attorney?"
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1589.154,1591.437,"Your Honor, I wanted to correct the impression of this Court."
1999.98-7809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.639,1627.141,That's not essential as far as you're concerned.
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1627.141,1627.67,"--No, Your Honor."
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1708.613,1710.757,May I ask you on that... on that point?
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1719.232,1723.823,"--I would assume so, Your Honor."
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1735.623,1743.19,"I don't think there is an impediment, but I'm just... what if the State passed a rule saying only lawyers can file notices of appeal?"
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1745.69,1752.957,"--I think... I think that would be more difficult, Your Honor, because filing the notice of appeal in California is little more than saying, I want an appeal and signing your name."
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1766.599,1778.416,"So... so, you would agree that the... the defendant appearing pro se would have a constitutional right to file a notice of appeal even if California adopted a rule saying only... it will only be filed by lawyers."
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1778.416,1787.613,"Well, I think the filing of the notice appeal is different... is different from what we're talking about, the skills you need to--"
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1787.613,1788.644,"Well, it may be."
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1788.644,1788.943,--conduct an appeal.
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1788.943,1790.055,I'm just trying to understand your position.
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1793.297,1793.538,Right.
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1793.538,1798.543,Does his right to self-representation go at least through the right to file a notice of appeal?
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1798.543,1807.098,"Because in California the notice of appeal must be filed in the trial court, not the appellate court, I would... I would presume that that would be part of the trial process, Your Honor."
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1810.291,1816.384,"And then my second question is, if he then gets an appeal and they find an appellate lawyer from your appellate section."
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1826.251,1835.057,"Well, I'm not sure what his constitutional... in Anders you said, you give him the right to... him or her the right to file a pro se supplemental brief."
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1840.863,1841.044,And I understand.
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1853.57,1856.942,--A supplemental... you're talking about in the Anders/Wende--
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1856.942,1861.994,"After... he's told... he either gets the Anders brief or he's told by the appointed lawyer, I don't think you've got a case here."
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1863.216,1864.606,"--No, I don't--"
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1864.606,1866.048,--pro se defendant isn't convinced.
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1868.983,1870.893,"--I don't think it's a constitutional right, Your Honor, but--"
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1870.893,1871.443,"Well, but that's--"
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1871.443,1872.385,--this Court has said in Anders--
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1872.385,1873.156,--I understand.
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1873.156,1873.955,--you will do it.
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1876.449,1877.077,Right.
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1877.077,1885.796,"--that... that you wanted... I think your expression, Your Honor, was to give them the best shot so we allow that filing, both under California procedure."
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1885.796,1889.456,"But my question is, was the... does the Constitution require you to give him that shot?"
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1889.456,1890.497,"I don't think it does, Your Honor."
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1893.189,1893.579,"Yes, I understand."
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1893.579,1900.235,And that... that takes care of the... the idea of still giving him a methodology to get to the court.
1999.98-7809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1901.276,1907.849,What... what happens practically if the counsel has a fundamental objection to the attorney that's appointed?
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1907.849,1908.71,--I'm sorry.
1999.98-7809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1909.682,1909.962,If the counsel has?
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1921.631,1922.181,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-7809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1953.893,1956.705,"Well, that issue could crop up in trial too, could it not?"
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,1956.705,1956.926,"Oh, absolutely, Your Honor."
1999.98-7809,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2001.896,2011.472,"Are there any... is there any empirical evidence from any of the... I gather there are some States and circuits that have said, you do have a right of self-representation on appeal."
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,2015.025,2021.26,"--I have been unable to find any empirical data talking about what has happened in those situations, Your Honor."
1999.98-7809,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2021.26,2025.123,And do they often in trials... I know they appoint standby counsel.
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,2036.43,2038.012,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1999.98-7809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2060.319,2061.121,Mr. Foster--
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,2061.121,2061.371,Yes.
1999.98-7809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2061.371,2075.062,"--just to clarify that equal protection is not in this picture, which I think Mr. Maines conceded, suppose we have a very well-to-do defendant who wants to represent himself on appeal."
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,2078.705,2079.313,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-7809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2153.542,2163.64,"How... how much of that information should guide our decision in this case, Mr.... where we're presumably laying down a general rule?"
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,2163.64,2164.029,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2189.418,2192.259,May I throw out this... this suggestion for your consideration?
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,2192.259,2192.669,Your Honor.
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2192.669,2201.087,"I suppose one of the things that's at stake in Faretta is a sort of a feeling of autonomy, that the individual citizen ought to be able to do something stupid if he wants to."
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,2205.251,2205.782,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2205.782,2208.416,"So, I kind of agree with your basic principle."
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,2232.882,2234.825,"Well, I think there are a number of answers, Your Honor."
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2280.965,2291.513,"No, but he wants to have... you know, he wants to have enough to do with it at least to try for an appeal, but he just doesn't want to have... have everybody on his side actually paid for by his adversary."
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,2294.086,2301.701,"The idea that if this is a government lawyer, even though he or she says they're operating for me, they're really... well, first, I don't think that's a--"
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2301.701,2303.752,--And I'm sure a lot of defendants feel that way too.
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,2303.752,2305.645,"--Well, but I think that's a trial concern as well, Your Honor."
1999.98-7809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.785,2315.82,"But we match it in the trial concern by saying, well, you can represent yourself if you want to do that, be that... you know, not have confidence in the system."
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,2315.82,2318.962,"--I don't think that's a matter of constitutional dimension, Your Honor."
1999.98-7809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2339.505,2347.212,Another way of thinking about Justice Stevens' concern is that we essentially are in a regime of personal rights and personal rights can be waived--
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,2347.212,2348.14,Yes.
1999.98-7809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2348.14,2349.072,--for the jury trial.
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,2360.081,2360.953,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-7809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2360.953,2364.993,--almost... the way we define it going in solves that problem.
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,2364.993,2365.314,The way you set it up.
1999.98-7809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2406.714,2419.553,"Mr. Foster, are there any statistics from the California courts of appeals as to how many criminal appeals are... are... in how many criminal appeals oral argument is granted?"
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,2419.553,2422.213,"--No, Your Honor."
1999.98-7809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2433.141,2434.292,That's Los Angeles?
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,2434.292,2434.613,--I'm sorry.
1999.98-7809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2470.612,2480.316,"Are there any States which either permit or require the appellant, the criminal defendant, him or herself to be present?"
1999.98-7809,1,39203,robert_foster,,2483.659,2486.441,I know of no State that requires it.
1999.98-7809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2783.477,2785.299,"Thank you, Mr. Foster."
1999.98-7809,2,40034,ronald_d_maines,,2787.49,2811.256,"Almost any two categories can be distinguished if we... if we look at them in the right way, can be differentiated."
1999.98-7809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2950.322,2952.522,"Thank you, Mr. Maines."
