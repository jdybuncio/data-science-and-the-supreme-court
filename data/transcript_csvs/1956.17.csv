1956.17,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1635.813,1644.409,Does your interpretation leave the 1938 Resolution as meaning exactly the same thing as the 1885?
1956.17,1,28219,herbert_s_thatcher,,1644.409,1647.312,"No, it deals -- with an entirely different subject."
1956.17,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1688.176,1690.727,Where is the Resolution?
1956.17,1,28219,herbert_s_thatcher,,1690.727,1696.87,"It's set forth on page 2 of the Government's brief, page 2 in --"
1956.17,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1696.87,1714.459,"Well, the 1885 Resolution allowed certain holidays then 2 also says I shall receive the same pay as on other days."

1956.17,1,28219,herbert_s_thatcher,,1747.773,1766.483,"The 1938 Resolution states that the -- the Government per diem employee shall receive his holiday allowance only when -- or not only, but on the -- when working -- when he is relieved or prevented from working solely because of the occurrence of a holiday."
1956.17,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1766.483,1768.555,And shall receive the same pay for such days?
1956.17,1,28219,herbert_s_thatcher,,1768.555,1770.372,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1956.17,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1781.627,1783.07,Yes.
1956.17,1,28219,herbert_s_thatcher,,1783.07,1786.817,The 1938 Resolution does not touch that subject at all.
1956.17,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1786.817,1789.759,But the 1885 Resolution does.
1956.17,1,28219,herbert_s_thatcher,,1789.759,1792.043,"It does, Your Honor."
1956.17,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1798.318,1798.94,And the 1885 --

1956.17,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1799.21,1801.664,-- Resolution was repealed?
1956.17,1,28219,herbert_s_thatcher,,1801.664,1802.798,That is the question in this case.
1956.17,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1808.71,1816.744,"(Voice Overlap) Resolution, January 6, 1885, are here -- is hereby repealed."

1956.17,1,28219,herbert_s_thatcher,,1820.525,1823.349,"That -- that is correct, Your Honor."
1956.17,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1823.349,1825.74,You have to show a conflict between you.
1956.17,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1825.74,1826.409,Not you.
1956.17,1,28219,herbert_s_thatcher,,1826.409,1828.911,The Government has to show a conflict between them.
1956.17,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,1852.015,1858.751,As I understand that you -- you claimed the 1938 is partially inconsistent with the 1885?
1956.17,1,28219,herbert_s_thatcher,,1859.326,1859.538,Yes.
1956.17,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,1859.538,1861.91,-- on two specific points and not on the risk?
1956.17,1,28219,herbert_s_thatcher,,1861.91,1863.323,"That is right, Your Honor."
1956.17,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,1863.323,1865.484,And the one at issue is one of the risk?
1956.17,1,28219,herbert_s_thatcher,,1865.484,1867.189,"That is right, Your Honor."
1956.17,2,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,3262.27,3264.152,May it please the Court.
1956.17,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3294.747,3300.04,Just what is the -- is that part of a sentence or something?
1956.17,2,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,3300.04,3309.179,"The -- the sentences that Section 2 proposes and it's explanatory in Section 2 that it proposes to repeal the Joint Resolution of January 6, 1885."
1956.17,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3309.179,3310.221,Period.
1956.17,2,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,3310.221,3310.722,Pardon?
1956.17,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3310.722,3312.176,Period after that that you've just said?
1956.17,2,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,3312.176,3321.103,"It's -- I think -- yes, Your Honor, just had the -- then the only thing that was after that was the identification by U.S. Code section."
1956.17,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3321.103,3324.602,And it says nothing about your -- the other law?
1956.17,2,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,3324.602,3327.414,That's -- I think there was no reference if I recall correctly.
