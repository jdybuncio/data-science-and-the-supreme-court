1955.383,0,22836,edward_donald_moseley,,11.18,13.741,May it please the Court.
1955.383,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,199.445,203.217,It's subject to a servitude to the high-water mark?
1955.383,0,22836,edward_donald_moseley,,203.217,205.825,"Well, sir, I was going to get into that later."
1955.383,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,205.825,205.923,Well --
1955.383,0,22836,edward_donald_moseley,,205.923,228.768,"Under the specific law of Louisiana, there is a general servitude for levee purposes which extends not only to the area immediately adjacent to the levee itself but to whatever area may be reasonably -- reasonably necessary in order for the proper exercise of the servitude for flood control purposes."
1955.383,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,240.845,242.873,"Above high-water mark, far back at the water mark?"
1955.383,0,22836,edward_donald_moseley,,242.873,253.118,"It is far back as the reasonable necessities of the situation would require, sir, which could include property even beyond the levee on the landside."
1955.383,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,253.118,256.516,As I understand that applies both to timber and soil?
1955.383,0,22836,edward_donald_moseley,,256.516,256.86,"Yes, sir."
1955.383,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,518.962,520.863,With that two grounds?
1955.383,0,22836,edward_donald_moseley,,520.863,530.617,"Well, sir, the Fifth Circuit held that the property was situated on batture and which is property between the ordinary low-water mark and the average high-water mark."
1955.383,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,768.593,774.565,Did -- didn't it describe it generally like such grounds as maybe necessary for a levee?
1955.383,0,22836,edward_donald_moseley,,774.565,782.863,"I -- I believe, sir, it just merely said that the right-of-ways are available, ""We are happy to comply with your request and the right-of-ways are available."""
1955.383,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,830.534,833.62,"Well, wasn't a notice to the landowner some -- some place in there?"
1955.383,0,22836,edward_donald_moseley,,833.62,834.109,Sir?
1955.383,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,834.109,835.845,Wasn't a notice to the landowner?
1955.383,0,22836,edward_donald_moseley,,835.845,838.666,"There, I'm -- I'm coming to that in just a few minutes, sir."
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,3616.49,3619.794,May it please the Court.
1955.383,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3873.543,3875.787,"Mr. Hill, just a manner of interest."
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,3883.771,3885.347,I should think it well could.
1955.383,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3997.659,4003.855,What -- what is the authority for the last statement you made that he may sue the Levee Board subsequently?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4003.855,4017.948,"Your Honor, all of these -- almost by titles, all of these, the state decisions are an aggrieved riparian owner suing the Levee Board for what is alleged to be an unreasonable use of his land."
1955.383,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4017.948,4019.366,Such as this?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4019.366,4020.176,"I beg your pardon, sir?"
1955.383,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4020.176,4021.067,Such as this (Voice Overlap) --
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4021.067,4021.292,Such as --
1955.383,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4021.292,4022.008,-- claim here?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4022.008,4022.792,Such as this.
1955.383,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,4052.477,4057.035,The Levee Board involved in this litigation so that he would not still have that right?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4057.035,4060.885,The United States brought the Levee Board in as a third party defendant.
1955.383,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,4060.885,4067.257,"So that after this litigation, he will not be able to sue that the -- the Levee Board?"
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4067.257,4075.196,"Well, if he prevails here, of course, he'll get it from the United States and we might get it from the Levee Board."
1955.383,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,4076.231,4076.498,But it --
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4076.498,4077.43,-- bar his action against the Levee Board.
1955.383,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,4077.43,4084.409,"But -- but if he loses here, then he does there too?"
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4084.409,4089.201,"Well, that would be a question of whether the fact that the Levee Board being in this suit indirectly would bar him."
1955.383,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,4089.636,4090.912,That's not settled?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4090.912,4092.489,I'm not sure of that.
1955.383,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4092.489,4096.43,Is their judgment in connection with the Levee Board here as this case?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4096.43,4109.345,The District Court in its decision on rehearing held that the United States alone is liable and it may not recover over against the Levee Board.
1955.383,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4109.345,4115.2,They held that the judgment then for the Levee Board already?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4115.2,4115.701,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.383,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4117.268,4127.421,"You challenge that if -- if you're -- if the United States has held, if we hold the United States liable, you -- you think it should be remanded --"
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4127.421,4127.861,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.383,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4127.861,4128.036,-- for --
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4128.036,4128.615,We -- we believe --
1955.383,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4128.615,4129.937,-- consideration of that?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4129.937,4130.657,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.383,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4130.657,4131.857,The Court of Appeals didn't reach it?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4131.857,4133.777,It did not reach the question.
1955.383,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4133.777,4151.127,"Suppose the conclusion -- the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed filed with that and the case as to the Levee Board, do you think it would?"
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4151.127,4153.886,The -- the case that -- that petitioner might bring against the Levee Board?
1955.383,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4153.886,4154.996,"Yes, in here."
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4168.568,4169.13,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.383,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4170.935,4172.495,(Voice Overlap) United States?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4172.495,4173.564,That's correct.
1955.383,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4173.564,4177.593,And that is with reference to the Levee Board's liability to you?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4177.593,4178.729,That's correct.
1955.383,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4178.729,4188.777,Has there been any judgment against the owner of this land in favor of the Levee Board in this case?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4188.777,4193.096,"No, the question was not reached because the Court of Appeals --"
1955.383,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4193.096,4200.968,Or what you reach by the District Court insofar as the liability of the Levee Board -- the landowner here.
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4200.968,4208.112,I believe the District -- I believe the District Court held that the Levee Board would not be liable to the --
1955.383,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4208.112,4210.425,Was that appealed by the landowner?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4210.425,4211.406,"No, that was not appealed by the --"
1955.383,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4211.406,4219.595,"Now, the Attorney General of Louisiana is protecting that position, not as a matter of law but as a matter of position in his amicus brief."
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4219.595,4225.099,"Well, my understanding of the -- the purpose for the amicus brief was to protect the -- the principle that's involved."
1955.383,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4225.099,4230.137,"Yes, I'm -- not any judgment, but he's -- he's maintaining the legal position --"
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4230.137,4230.413,That's correct.
1955.383,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4230.413,4231.338,-- in Louisiana --
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4231.338,4231.589,That's correct.
1955.383,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4231.589,4233.949,-- and not liability of Louisiana as a matter --
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4233.949,4236.051,"That -- that's correct, sir."
1955.383,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4236.051,4239.613,"The Box Company did not sue the Levee Board, did they?"
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4239.613,4244.276,"No, the Box Company sued the United States and the United States brought the Levee Board in as a third party defendant."
1955.383,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4244.276,4256.291,"What the lower court must have held was, the United States has not recovered against lawsuits in the event the recovery was had -- been had, is that right?"
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4256.291,4259.996,"Well, the United States is -- is in opposition to the Box Company."
1955.383,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4263.909,4267.779,The United States may not recover against the Levee Board?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4267.779,4272.697,"The District Court held the United States may not recover against the Levee Board, that's correct."
1955.383,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4272.697,4275.773,The United States will take no appeal here?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4275.773,4283.197,The United States took a full appeal from the judgment of the District Court to the Court of Appeals.
1955.383,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4291.882,4292.891,That should be reversed.
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4294.744,4295.472,"Yes, sir."
1955.383,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4295.472,4300.801,(Inaudible)
1955.383,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4300.801,4311.304,"So, what I was wondering about was whether or not the question of their recovery against the Levee Board within their (Inaudible) at all so they never sued the Levee Board."
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4325.734,4329.139,"The -- the Box Company did not, no."
1955.383,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4329.139,4335.977,And your recovery was -- your -- the making of the Levee Board a party was merely to recover over against for yourself.
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4335.977,4343.036,That's correct in the event that we were adjudged liable.
1955.383,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4577.917,4582.497,Would that be the only basis on which they could do it that it was cheaper?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4582.497,4584.227,Or if they were going to use the trees?
1955.383,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4599.141,4612.183,"Suppose they just took them down in that manner because the Government wanted to take them down in that manner and they could have done it the other way, would that been a breach of --"
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4612.183,4614.655,I'll express an opinion on that.
1955.383,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4648.705,4655.264,"You know of no authority on that subject, Mr. Hill?"
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4655.264,4659.38,There's only one case that I found that expressly mentioned trees.
1955.383,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4915.813,4916.835,How long after that?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4921.305,4935.556,"The President's donation was June 12th, 1947 and were commenced -- the earliest work commenced on July 22nd."
1955.383,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4935.556,4937.836,July 1st was the date you say of --

1955.383,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4940.008,4941.033,June 12th?
1955.383,1,41463,s_billingsley_hill,,4941.033,4954.43,"-- was the date that the President took that action and a little over a month later, June -- July 22nd, the -- the first work began on one of the two tracts of land.In -- in August on the next."

1955.383,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5237.137,5238.259,To be what?
1955.383,2,38866,ross_r_barnett,,5238.259,5242.334,To be assessed to the Box Company.
1955.383,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5463.872,5480.418,"But if the State of Louisiana had the right, Mr. Barnett, to have this done and it conveyed that right to the Federal Government, why wouldn't the Federal Government have the right to do it without regard to -- to taking anybody else's property?"
1955.383,2,38866,ross_r_barnett,,5480.418,5481.218,If Your Honor --
