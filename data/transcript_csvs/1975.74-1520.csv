1975.74-1520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,52.119,"We’ll hear arguments next in Number 1520, Elrod against Burns."
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,52.119,56.066,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,166.621,168.123,They stated that in their complaint?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,168.123,170.441,"Yes sir, they did."
1975.74-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,283.249,300.443,"Can you tell from the Shakman case, Mr. Foran, whether a Republican might be employed in the tradition of the Sheriff’s Office by a Democratic Sheriff if he obtained a democratic sponsor?"
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,300.443,307.502,Mr. Justice Rehnquist the stipulation of the Sheriff’s Office and I think I can describe it in summary very quickly.
1975.74-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,375.861,393.078,"But now is it theoretically possible at least for a Republican employee within this 1200, when a Democratic sheriff comes to power, if he could get a sponsorship from a Democrat, he could be retained?"
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,393.078,396.37,"Oh, yes sir and it often does happen."
1975.74-1520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,396.37,398.114,That’s the record in this case shows that --
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,398.114,399.123,Yes sir.
1975.74-1520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,399.123,402.873,-- somebody was about to be terminated and the sponsorship came in the next day and he was put back on to the payroll.
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,402.873,404.237,That’s correct sir.
1975.74-1520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,404.781,413.375,"But there is a quid pro quo from that, I gather, from reading the record the -- along with the sponsorship, comes the obligation to the next election to work for the Democrat."
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,413.375,414.289,Yes sir.
1975.74-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,419.264,422.513,But is there a change of registration required?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,422.513,428.021,"No sir, not specifically nor is there any such allegation in the complaint."
1975.74-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,443.982,452.164,"Well, is it -- I realize there comes point at which probably a stipulation doesn’t exhaust -- doesn’t cover."
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,461.302,464.963,"That’s a hard question to answer, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1975.74-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,854.436,859.904,But I would have thought all this Court said in the Hatch Act cases was that Congress thought it was desirable?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,859.904,862.742,"Exactly, Mr. Justice, exactly."
1975.74-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,885.996,893.363,By implication they have said with the respect to the rest of them “He'd who lived by sword shall perish by the sword.”
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,893.363,895.806,"In effect, yes."
1975.74-1520,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,911.358,919.393,Suppose the Legislature of Illinois passed a statute which said only Democrats maybe employed in the Sheriff’s Office.
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,919.393,921.133,May be wrong.
1975.74-1520,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,922.843,924.362,And the difference is --
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,924.362,925.547,The difference is this.
1975.74-1520,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,925.547,926.455,The legislation didn’t work.
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,926.455,928.432,"Yes sir, and the difference is further than this."
1975.74-1520,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,928.432,931.992,But a state officer can do it?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,931.992,949.817,A state officer who is an elected public official under a -- in a political public office can with particular employees who have not been made a part of a nonpolitical public service.
1975.74-1520,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,949.817,951.326,But the legislature couldn’t do it?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,951.326,953.006,"Yes sir, could not."
1975.74-1520,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,955.454,959.411,Can the Governor do it?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,959.411,961.366,"A Democrat, yes sir."
1975.74-1520,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,961.366,962.122,A Democratic Governor?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,962.122,963.548,Or Republican Governor.
1975.74-1520,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,963.548,966.558,Could issue a proclamation saying that only Democrats can work?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,966.558,968.348,"Oh no, no sir."
1975.74-1520,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,969.729,974.031,"But county sheriff can, who else can besides the county sheriff?"
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,974.031,987.2,Any public official with respect to public jobs that are not designated as nonpolitical public jobs.
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,988.428,993.414,What state is the writ in that -- in having that to be the case?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,993.414,996.877,"Well, let me give this as the state -- as the state interest."
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,996.877,1002.113,I take it you -- you seem to say that it’s essential to find the state interest?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1002.113,1003.214,I think it is.
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1003.214,1003.674,You do?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1003.674,1010.245,I think it is essential to show that there is some state interest in partisanship.
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1010.245,1022.534,You don’t think -- you don’t think the Sheriff’s Office or Illinois is permitted to just say to these people “You’re just fired.
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1024.173,1026.406,"I think they could say that, yes."
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.022,1031.973,They said we are firing you because you belong to the wrong party?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1031.973,1036.813,"Well, they said you we fired you because you won’t switch over and help us politically."
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1036.813,1044.267,And you think to do that if you’re going to say that in they must find some substantial state interest of pretty strong one.
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1045.127,1045.731,Party.
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1064.072,1066.045,What is that growth system?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1066.045,1069.96,"To the growth and good operation, the efficient operation of the Government."
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1069.96,1072.927,You mean it’s essential into the elective process or essential to the --
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1072.927,1074.492,No to the operation of the Government.
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.492,1075.927,To the operation of the government.
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1077.333,1079.523,Because of the very human instinct.
1975.74-1520,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1079.523,1081.239,"It helps out the party, that’s why."
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1081.239,1084.655,"Well, much more than that, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1975.74-1520,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1086.275,1088.417,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1088.417,1135.394,"Well, not just the political argument, but the political argument -- well, the political argument is also a good one to this extent that the sheriff who has been elected by the people to exercise his management discretion, if he is to exercise his management discretion consisting with his commitment to the people who elected him, the people who work for him should be loyal to him and he should have faith that they are loyal to him and he should have faith that they are intending to encourage his reelection as the political figure that he is in that operation of the Government."
1975.74-1520,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1135.681,1145.441,"Would it be enough to protect your interest if you drew a line, if he divided the employees where it was important that obviously that they followed his lead and others that --"
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1145.441,1146.617,Well --
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1146.617,1150.541,"Apparently, the legislature -- the legislature thinks there is some way of doing that?"
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1150.541,1158.106,"Well, there is by the way some comment in the Lewis case about policy making, non-policy making, but I think that --"
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1158.106,1158.979,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1158.979,1165.356,"Well, but then by the way Mr. Justice White, I think does include a fallacy."
1975.74-1520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1191.958,1202.748,"Mr. Foran, if the legislature of Illinois wanted to, it could make all of the 3,000 employees of the Sheriff’s Office subject to their civil service, could they not?"
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1202.748,1203.681,Yes sir.
1975.74-1520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1203.681,1212.508,"They could make the sheriff, barring some provision in your Constitution, they could make the sheriff a civil servant, could they not?"
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1212.508,1219.477,"We do have that constitutional problem, Mr. Chief Justice, but they could with many officers, they could eliminate."
1975.74-1520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1221.064,1223.981,And you tell us that --
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1223.981,1224.56,They haven’t.
1975.74-1520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1224.56,1239.679,"-- 2800 of these people approximately or 1800 rather, about 1800 are freelancers and 1200 are subject to the civil service program."
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1239.679,1250.523,"Yes sir, the freelancers by the way include the policy makers Mr. Justice White and freelancers is a good way to describe it."
1975.74-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1250.523,1261.591,"Well, if you’re going to have a political organization in the city of the size of Chicago someone who is elected sheriff has to have some jobs to give out when he gets in, doesn’t he?"
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1261.591,1265.683,"That’s the way it’s always run and by the way not just in Chicago, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1975.74-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1265.683,1266.551,"Well, in lots of other places."
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1266.551,1270.987,"It has happened throughout the country’s history, throughout the country’s history."
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1297.19,1305.36,"I’m still waiting for you tell me state history is in having the elevator operator, be Republican rather than a Democrat, or a Democrat rather than a Republican?"
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1305.36,1308.535,"Well, when we say this Mr. Justice --"
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1308.535,1314.87,"Do you accept Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s statement, this is just essential to have the two-party system work?"
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1314.87,1315.658,I think it --
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1315.658,1317.613,This certainly isn’t essential for the Government?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1317.613,1321.403,"Well, I do believe it’s essential for the efficiency of Government."
1975.74-1520,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1376.858,1385.498,"Are you saying that on this record, the minorities are shut in or taken into this system, on this record?"
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1385.498,1386.175,Yes sir.
1975.74-1520,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1386.175,1389.238,Could you point out specifically where that is so?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1389.238,1390.262,"Oh, well on this record."
1975.74-1520,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1411.273,1428.026,"The civil service segment here, I’m zeroing then on your non-civil service people and I want to know whether your records here as constructed or shows that minorities and others are taken in as your other bland and broad remarks just now would indicate."
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1428.026,1431.309,Not under this record here Mr. Justice.
1975.74-1520,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1431.309,1437.188,What type of jobs do these 1209 civil service people hold?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1447.78,1467.719,"The civil service in the Sheriff’s Office are the County Sheriff’s police, and the corrections officers who take care of the county jail and the house of corrections and the juvenile court facility which are all under the jurisdiction of the sheriff."
1975.74-1520,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1467.719,1470.535,Are these categories as prescribed by the legislature?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1470.535,1475.222,"Yes sir, as a merit system of employment."
1975.74-1520,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1511.234,1513.926,Is it statewide in Illinois?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1513.926,1515.016,Pardon?
1975.74-1520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1515.016,1521.156,"Does the system you described apply statewide? Would you have this in Springfield, for example?"
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1521.156,1522.714,Oh yes.
1975.74-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1619.05,1622.584,"Well, there’s a more practical reasons than that too, aren’t there, Mr. Foran?"
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1643.159,1647.19,"Well, that’s correct but I don’t think that’s the interest that I’m talking of."
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1647.19,1652.231,How are we going to embrace this view that it’s essential to make the elective process work?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1657.242,1672.228,"Yes I do Mr. Justice White, because I say this when a man is elected by the people to operate a service Government, the people elect him to exercise his discretion as he sees fit."
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1678.578,1688.835,"If it is so important, I’m surprised the Illinois legislature has removed from this category these very important blocks of employees."
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1688.835,1691.661,"Well, I think because some particular jobs --"
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1691.661,1699.744,Those would be the very ones that you would like to know are supporting you “tooth and toenail?”
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1699.744,1709.666,"Partly, Mr. Justice White, there are certain types of jobs that simply should not be subject to political control."
1975.74-1520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1717.911,1720.401,For the last 100 years?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1720.401,1722.231,"Yes sir, since 1890."
1975.74-1520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1722.231,1724.331,"All political appointees, are they not?"
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1724.331,1724.992,Yes sir.
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1724.992,1733.298,If you want to -- if you’d like to have the unqualified support of some people in your office you’d like to have it from the policeman or other serving the people and state?
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1733.298,1735.892,"Well, that’s right but the legislature took it away from them."
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1735.892,1737.38,Yes.
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1737.38,1750.926,"And they took the FBI away and they took the CIA away and -- but the legislature did that, the legislature has the right to do that and the legislature has the right not to do it and in this case they didn’t do it."
1975.74-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1756.564,1765.84,"I understand that but the reason that you give, it seems to me is it considerably illuminated by what the legislature of Illinois has done."
1975.74-1520,0,42693,thomas_a_foran,,1773.04,1788.57,"I think, the necessity of generating consensus, Mr. Justice White is terribly important, the opportunity for a political official to have a chance to be reelected, to continue his progress."
