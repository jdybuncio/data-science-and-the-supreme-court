2009.08-998,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.237,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-998, Hamilton, the Chapter 13 Trustee, v. Lanning."
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,8.27,10.189,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-998,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,60.203,62.721,Which means -- which means what?
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,80.066,86.187,"What happens to her and what could have happened to her may be two different propositions, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-998,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,132.365,133.901,That's -- can you explain that?
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,153.129,167.372,"The part of the statute that you are referring to is under 523, and it essentially says that debtor shall file -- 521, excuse me -- shall file certain schedules and that would include the income and expense schedules, Schedule I and Schedule J."
2009.08-998,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,179.946,197.392,"What do you -- what do you do with the contention that the court is bounded by other requirements such as the timing of the meeting of creditors and the plan confirmation, that that binds the district court from resetting it?"
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,197.392,201.36,"Certainly all of those time frames can be moved, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-998,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,239.985,241.671,Moveable to where?
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,261.167,261.917,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-998,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,269.071,297.59,"But isn't it the case that before the 2005 amendments, bankruptcy courts were recognized as having discretion in calculating projected disposable income to take into account changes in the debtor's income after the filing of the plan, and shouldn't we presume that -- that Congress intended to continue essentially the same regime, unless Congress provided some clear indication that they wanted to depart from it?"
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,297.59,302.761,"Certainly prior to the 2005 amendments, your assessment is correct."
2009.08-998,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,345.004,358.248,It is odd that Congress provided this very detailed formula and -- and that they would provide such a detailed formula and then say: But the bankruptcy court can modify that based on a projection.
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,378.309,382.863,"Respectfully, Justice Alito, I don't any agree with the assessment that -- of what you just stated."
2009.08-998,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,407.079,412.982,But you say that that can be done only if the debtor fails to file a form that the debtor is required to file; isn't that right?
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,412.982,417.184,"In -- under 101(10A), the second part, yes."
2009.08-998,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,421.136,432.008,What do you do with the situation in which the change that is projected to occur and in fact may be almost certain to occur is one that causes an increase in the debtor's income?
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,448.536,450.286,"No, Your Honor, I would not agree with that."
2009.08-998,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,450.286,452.238,What is a creditor to do in that situation?
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,452.238,454.023,"Well, there -- there are a couple of avenues."
2009.08-998,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,488.094,498.636,"Counsel, why -- what commends going through all these machinations, all of these alternative ways of avoiding absurd results?"
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,534.059,541.479,"My answer, Justice Sotomayor, is that Congress provided the formula, and it's not up to the courts, I suggest, to modify that formula."
2009.08-998,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,542.248,543.798,There was a formula before.
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,568.815,571.081,"--Two points, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-998,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,598.048,600.333,But in a sense that cuts against you.
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,629.519,637.523,"My answer, Justice Kennedy, is that the definition of the word, quote, ""projected"", end of quote, has -- there's never has been one in the code."
2009.08-998,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,723.01,733.568,But you already told us that there could be a deviation through this 101(10A)(ii).
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,756.767,763.604,"No, Justice Ginsburg, and the reason is, is that that privilege is accorded only to the debtor to move that 6-month period."
2009.08-998,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,769.741,777.347,"Well, it could have been suggested to the debtor: You can accomplish what you want by using this provision."
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,777.347,779.214,The record is silent as to whether or not that occurred.
2009.08-998,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,779.214,781.883,What -- where can you move it?
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,797.094,802.462,"It would be up to confirmation, but the confirmation hearing could be continued as the court saw fit."
2009.08-998,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,802.462,807.616,The review of the determination or the request to move the period is -- is what?
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,811.752,814.22,"It appears to be so under the statute, Chief Justice Roberts."
2009.08-998,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,814.22,821.626,"So your objection to the fact that the judge has more discretion with respect to defining ""projected disposable"" -- you don't mind the discretion on the other side."
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,821.626,827.53,"No, Your Honor, I believe the discretion is not in determining the income, only in determining the time period."
2009.08-998,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,827.53,832.399,"Right, but the only purpose of moving the time period is to change the income."
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,832.399,833.318,That's true.
2009.08-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,844.339,847.308,There is another discretion that you don't seem to object to.
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,865.42,868.372,"Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,868.372,874.526,What constrains the judge in allowing or not allowing the revision?
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,885.314,886.749,"Justice Scalia, I don't think so."
2009.08-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,904.878,924.172,"But that's the same thing that's being argued here, that -- that you start with the fixed calculation based on the 6 months before and then you have to show that there were some extraordinary circumstances that justify a change."
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,925.624,933.128,"There may not be, except that there is a statutory requirement as to how that is accomplished and that's where the 101(10A)(ii) comes into play."
2009.08-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,935.447,950.005,"What your case comes down to is the bankruptcy court can do this, but it has to do it by simply revising the plan, not by establishing the plan initially but by revising it."
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,950.005,951.873,"--Not necessarily, Your Honor."
2009.08-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,953.659,954.359,Maybe?
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,954.359,955.409,"It may be, yes."
2009.08-998,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,956.61,966.882,"Well, that's a good answer, isn't it, because your point would be the statute does not allow that exercise of discretion with respect to projected disposable income, but it does in the other areas."
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,966.882,969.632,"Well, again I respectfully disagree, Chief Justice Roberts."
2009.08-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,970.6,972.334,That was a friendly question.
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,972.334,973.202,--I'm sorry?
2009.08-998,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,974.686,987.094,"No, my -- my point and what I thought your point would be is that the fact that there is exercise of discretion in two different areas is not the problem."
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,993.699,995.565,I agree.
2009.08-998,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,996.651,1007.59,But can the -- can the plan be modified based on -- can the plan be modified based on something that was known before the plan was confirmed?
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1007.59,1011.994,"That depends on which jurisdiction one would be in, Justice Alito."
2009.08-998,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1013.877,1017.315,"Well, if it can't, then how is this modification remedy going to work?"
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1017.315,1018.198,--I think it should be.
2009.08-998,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1044.715,1059.975,"Your argument is that the Court has to confirm a plan that is really not confirmable because the debtor can't possibly make the payments under the plan, but then can turn around immediately and modify the plan so that it does call for payments to be made."
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1059.975,1060.475,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-998,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1061.192,1063.377,"Well, I thought that -- explain it, then?"
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1063.377,1074.167,"Well, what we are saying is that this plan cannot be confirmed as it stands because the debtor would have to be able to make those payments and the debtor obviously is not capable of making those payments."
2009.08-998,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1077.553,1084.773,"But let me just stop you there, because then the answer you gave to the Chief and to Justice Scalia doesn't fit."
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1099.969,1101.752,"--Well, I agreed with that."
2009.08-998,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1112.792,1123.334,"Well, what in addition to -- you brought up the 101 solution that she doesn't do what the statute tells her to do, so she's able to move it if the judge agrees."
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1125.4,1126.536,Yes.
2009.08-998,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1166.011,1170.046,"But then the creditors would have been a lot worse off, would they not have been?"
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1170.046,1175.45,"That's very possible, but it's a formula that Congress thought to place into effect and it's not--"
2009.08-998,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1175.45,1203.284,"Well, why would -- why would the trustee be urging the possibility that it would be okay for her to file under Chapter 7, in which case the unsecured creditors would get very little, but it's not okay for her to use chapter 13 with a plan that would give the unsecured creditors substantial payments?"
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1203.284,1211.79,"--Here, Justice Ginsburg, the reason is plain and simple, and that was I sought to enforce the rule of law in order to have the courts determine how the rules were supposed to be interpreted."
2009.08-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.246,1222.762,Can I--
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1222.762,1223.764,And here she didn't turn the engine on.
2009.08-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1223.764,1233.886,--Can I come back to Justice Ginsburg's question about whether there would ever be the opportunity to adjust the confirmed plan?
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1270.043,1271.829,Maybe not -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1271.829,1284.986,"In other words, is your response to Justice Ginsburg ""always"", that it will always be the case that where there would be an adjustment under this theory, there would not have been a confirmation in the first place?"
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1284.986,1294.842,"If the plan is not confirmable by an analysis of Schedules I and J, which are the income and expenses statutes, I am not going to recommend confirmation, and nor do I think any trustee would."
2009.08-998,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1333.317,1357.249,"Isn't that -- wouldn't that amount to just a -- a waste of everybody's time, to dismiss it and then refile it, and then she gets a time period that doesn't -- why -- why not just drop out those 2 months that are not representative of her income?"
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1357.249,1360.034,"Because, Justice Ginsburg, the statute does not permit that."
2009.08-998,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1377.077,1389.654,"But the thing is -- but you have explained, your number one solution for her is this 101 route, which is -- gives lots of discretion in the court."
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1389.654,1393.356,"Only in moving the 6-month period, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-998,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1393.356,1393.906,Yes.
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1393.906,1396.974,That would be the only discretion that the statute would appear to accord to the court.
2009.08-998,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1396.974,1401.675,"Where is that, by the way, the provision that allows it to move the 6-month period?"
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1401.675,1428.993,"It's in 101(10A) and it provides that the term 6-month period ending on -- and then we come to subsections (i), little (i) -- or (ii)."
2009.08-998,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1435.599,1439.634,What do you say about cases in which moving the 6-month period can't solve the problem?
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1468.153,1490.733,"Well, Justice Alito, I think I would tie in 1323 with respect to the first proposition, and that is if the debtor's circumstances have markedly changed, then the debtor has the ability to file an amended plan; and that amended plan could ask the court to move that time frame forward to a confirmation hearing that would take into account the drop in income."
2009.08-998,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1523.388,1538.464,"How do you file an amended plan and have the court restart the clock, when 101(10A) says only if the debtor has not filed a schedule of current income?"
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1545.236,1546.169,Those are--
2009.08-998,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1546.169,1547.736,You don't do one without the other.
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1547.736,1549.569,"--Those are two different propositions, Your Honor."
2009.08-998,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1567.548,1569.149,Forget about 1329.
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1587.277,1589.96,"--I don't agree with the word ""jurisdiction"", Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-998,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1589.96,1591.562,"Well, it can't under 101(10A)."
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1591.562,1597.066,The debtor would certainly have the ability to ask the court to be excused from that requirement given a change in circumstances.
2009.08-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1601.551,1603.653,"Can I ask -- yes, there is one more question."
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1603.653,1604.32,--Okay.
2009.08-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1604.32,1612.558,"Can I ask whether 1323, which you have now invoked, does not provide the same kind of discretion to the court that you are objecting to?"
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1621.181,1621.964,No.
2009.08-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1633.27,1636.974,"Well, then -- then -- okay."
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1646.245,1648.345,I haven't said that it gets me out of the formula.
2009.08-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1668.909,1669.528,Okay.
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1672.011,1673.247,"I believe so, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.247,1674.713,--subsequent to the filing.
2009.08-998,0,30894,jan_hamilton,,1674.713,1678.217,"If there are no other questions I would like to reserve the remainder of my time, Chief Justice Roberts."
2009.08-998,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1678.217,1679.084,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-998,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1681.419,1683.586,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.403,1945.355,You -- you -- you have lost me.
2009.08-998,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1945.355,1945.838,--Okay.
2009.08-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1945.838,1946.888,Where is the 6-month--
2009.08-998,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1946.888,1947.473,Sure.
2009.08-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1949.373,1950.873,"--No, I got -- I got it there."
2009.08-998,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1950.873,1951.189,Okay.
2009.08-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.531,1963.981,I -- I -- I see.
2009.08-998,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1964.497,1966.649,"See, that's mostly where it matters."
2009.08-998,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2000.268,2001.87,"Without the word ""projected""?"
2009.08-998,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2001.87,2002.886,I'm sorry?
2009.08-998,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2002.886,2004.405,"Without the word ""projected""?"
2009.08-998,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2004.405,2004.972,That's exactly.
2009.08-998,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2013.011,2019.997,"Why don't you follow his suggestion and just move the 6-month period, because the statute specifically grants that authority to the judge?"
2009.08-998,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2019.997,2020.447,Sure.
2009.08-998,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2077.431,2078.298,Can I ask you this?
2009.08-998,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2110.502,2113.704,The contrast between 1325 and 1329.
2009.08-998,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2254.375,2258.778,"Well, I think -- I think that's exactly right when you look at term ""projected disposable income""."
2009.08-998,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2258.778,2259.195,--Yes.
2009.08-998,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2259.195,2261.461,"But if you look as ""disposable income""--"
2009.08-998,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2261.461,2261.98,Yes.
2009.08-998,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2261.98,2268.967,"--as a defined term and then add ""projected"", I think it's a different -- different -- different argument, different kettle of fish."
2009.08-998,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2282.561,2286.429,"And that is exactly, Mr. Chief Justice, why I started with the definition of"
2009.08-998,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2343.698,2357.523,"What if you -- you wanted to achieve your friend's result and you had a definition of disposable income, and you wanted the court to -- you don't want to say project that forward, what -- what word would be more natural than saying projected?"
2009.08-998,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2357.523,2360.641,--I -- I -- I would use the language that Congress did in 707.
2009.08-998,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2367.231,2371.599,"No, that's altering disposable income -- the definition of disposable income."
2009.08-998,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2380.888,2382.638,Multiply.
2009.08-998,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2404.586,2405.636,"Thank you, Counsel."
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2411.907,2414.209,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-998,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2443.794,2448.08,But do you think bankruptcy courts are supposed to be economic forecasters?
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2481.754,2483.086,"Certainly not, Justice Alito."
2009.08-998,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2483.654,2484.205,"Well, why not?"
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2489.24,2494.561,"--Well, bankruptcy courts -- we are not saying that bankruptcy courts should ever speculate about what might happen in the future."
2009.08-998,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2523.746,2531.066,"Well, ""know will happen"" is quite different from ""likely to happen"", and I thought your test was likely to happen."
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2531.066,2534.185,"Well, likely to happen based on what you know now."
2009.08-998,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2537.654,2541.006,"Not -- not likely, based on what you know."
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2544.41,2544.876,--Right.
2009.08-998,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2563.205,2565.906,Is there a difference between your test and the Respondent's test?
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2565.906,2569.525,Not according to what I heard Mr. Goldstein say at the argument.
2009.08-998,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2573.077,2580.666,"His words were ""known to a virtual certainty"", which are -- likely to happen is different than likely to happen."
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2580.666,2584.785,"--I think, in part, it depends on what type of change you are talking about."
2009.08-998,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.474,2624.26,"That's -- that's ""know will happen""."
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2633.616,2634.966,"--Well, again, in this--"
2009.08-998,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2634.966,2640.286,"I mean, to -- you know, to look forward and say: Is it likely or not likely?"
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2646.09,2646.507,--Okay.
2009.08-998,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2659.683,2674.526,"It seems to me that, particularly since you are adopting a fairly broad -- well, depending on how broad a theory you are adopting of what's projected and what's not, that you are taking into account a lot of things that are more properly taken into account when it comes to whether the plan should be confirmed or not."
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2674.526,2676.076,"Well, this is--"
2009.08-998,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2676.076,2676.326,What's going to happen?
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2686.598,2695.388,"--Well, except that if the creditor or a trustee objects, then the calculation of projected disposable income is one of the conditions of confirmability of the plan."
2009.08-998,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2697.322,2707.345,"Well, is that -- I mean, let's say your friend wins up to the point and somebody else, when it gets to confirmation, can say: Well, look, you know, there was this big payout before the filing."
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2712.599,2715.717,"--I'm sorry, if she got a higher-paying job just before?"
2009.08-998,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2716.517,2721.103,"Well, whatever the situation is, can't that be taken into account when it comes to confirmation?"
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2721.103,2737.464,"Well, it could affect the -- well, one thing that is important to note that hasn't been brought up is under Section 1325(a)(6), the court is actually -- which is the feasibility provision -- the Court is actually required to think about what is going to happen in the future, whether a debtor is going to be able to repay her creditors."
2009.08-998,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2754.276,2766.067,"What if the debtor is a waiter and during the last month of the 6-month period, because of some change of the economy the waiter's tips have gone up either way up or way down?"
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2767.5,2775.672,"--Well, I think one purpose of having the 6-month lookback period in the calculation of current income is exactly to take into account those situations."
2009.08-998,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2819.115,2823.686,How do you deal with the Petitioner's -- the two arguments Petitioner makes?
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2834.727,2844.25,"Well, the special circumstances exception comes in, in the calculation of the debtor's current disposable income, but it doesn't tell you what to do in terms of projecting that disposable income."
2009.08-998,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2860.961,2879.523,What about the argument that this is a simple thing; she didn't have to file the plan -- she didn't have to file the petition at a time when those two months would be in the 6-month lookback.
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2880.506,2884.577,"Well, that is certainly true of this debtor, of the Respondent in this case."
2009.08-998,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2941.477,2945.198,"Well, the creditor has the option of objecting the confirmation of the plan."
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2945.198,2948.081,"--They can object to confirmation of the plan, but on what -- what basis?"
2009.08-998,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2966.878,2972.849,They can't say: I object because the 6-month period is unrepresentative because of this particular event?
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2972.849,2977.551,"They could say that, but it's not clear in the code that that is a basis for refusing to confirm a plan."
2009.08-998,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2978.836,2980.621,Does the government have a position on that?
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,2980.621,2990.993,"--I think unless there were bad faith it's not clear how that can be a basis for not confirming a plan, and that was the -- the reason that my friend on Petitioner's counsel suggested."
2009.08-998,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3015.509,3017.395,You can finish the sentence.
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,3017.395,3017.945,--Okay.
2009.08-998,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3029.952,3030.97,"Thank you, Ms. Harrington."
2009.08-998,2,41459,sarah_harrington,,3030.97,3031.57,Thank you.
2009.08-998,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3031.57,3034.089,"Mr. Hamilton, you have two minutes remaining."
2009.08-998,3,30894,jan_hamilton,,3034.089,3035.939,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-998,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3136.705,3137.657,"Thank you, counsel."
