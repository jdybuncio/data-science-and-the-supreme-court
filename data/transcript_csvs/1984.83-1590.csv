1984.83-1590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.727,We will hear arguments first this morning in Francis v. Franklin.
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,14.172,27.989,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, there are the major points that are the question for the Court's resolution in this case, and I'd like to briefly outline those points before going back and addressing them in more detail for the Court's consideration."
1984.83-1590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,233.252,237.456,"You mean an internal, intra-circuit conflict?"
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,237.456,238.577,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,248.032,253.668,"What before or after we divorced the East Divison from the West, the Eleventh--"
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,253.668,255.809,"--It was after it was the Eleventh Circuit, Your Honor."
1984.83-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,267.556,273.339,"--May I ask a question about... maybe it's a question of Georgia law bock, because each case has somewhat different facts."
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,276.852,277.333,Yes.
1984.83-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,277.333,279.064,"When the door slammed, then the gun went off."
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,290.511,297.166,"What the courts have held, the Eleventh Circuit held in the Holloway case that there are three essential elements to murder in Georgia."
1984.83-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,320.911,322.441,I still don't know the answer to my question.
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,330.227,330.608,No.
1984.83-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,332.468,334.319,Does that mean he had to intend to kill the victim?
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,334.319,335.12,Yes.
1984.83-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,337.341,343.345,So that... and you think it's frivolous to suggest that there was any possible state of facts whereby he didn't really intend to kill the victim?
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,343.345,352.792,"Yes, I do, Your Honor, basically because it seems like that present counsel is now saying that the gun could have accidentally discharged as a result of the slamming of the door."
1984.83-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,368.522,370.163,"Of course, the second shot went through the roof, I guess."
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,370.163,380.571,"Yes, it did, Your Honor, but Mrs. Collie, the victim's wife, said that when she came from her bedroom, where she had been at the time that her husband was killed, back into the living room, that that's when he fired the second shot."
1984.83-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,394.799,399.532,"But, just to make it perfectly clear, you agree that the intent was intent to kill?"
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,399.532,400.573,Yes.
1984.83-1590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,400.573,408.778,"And, to some extent, intent is mixed up with how good a marksman the man is."
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,408.778,419.214,"Whether or not the shot actually killed anyone would not be... of course, the homicide would be necessary for it to be murder, of course."
1984.83-1590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,530.919,533.651,How many shots hit home?
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,533.651,535.063,Only one hit home.
1984.83-1590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,609.249,624.75,"Well, assume we look over the entire set of instructions and conclude that a reasonable juror could have believed that all the prosecution would have to prove in light of these instructions was that he pulled the trigger?"
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,624.75,625.511,If you--
1984.83-1590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,625.511,633.255,"Now, do you object to that test, that we look to see what a reasonable jury might conclude after looking at all the instructions?"
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,633.255,633.875,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,646.705,652.478,So the Court of Appeals applied the right test and you think they just came out wrong.
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,652.478,662.213,"I think their analyzation of the test was wrong, Your Honor, because what they started out with was an assumption that that language was mandatory, and therefore a federal habeas corpus relief should be granted."
1984.83-1590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,668.247,669.059,"So they just misapplied the test, you say?"
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,669.059,670.11,Yes; correct.
1984.83-1590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,722.755,738.807,"Ms. Boleyn, when we talk about the reasonable juror test, do you think of that as yielding only one result in a given case, or do you think it could yield several different results?"
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,766.452,775.389,"I think that in reviewing this case, there is no question but that the application of the reasonable juror test would compel the conclusion that it was not mandatory."
1984.83-1590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,813.025,825.401,Don't you think it would be possible for two jurors to have different views of the instructions as a whole and both be very reasonable?
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,825.401,826.422,"--Oh, yes, Your Honor, I think--"
1984.83-1590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,826.422,827.053,All right.
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,866.029,875.535,"--I suppose my answer to that, Your Honor, is that this Court has held that it's the possibility that the presumption influenced the verdict that the Court's examining when it applies the reasonable juror test."
1984.83-1590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.572,893.807,In my hypothetical there are eleven reasonable jurors who have one view and there's one reasonable juror who has another as to the meaning of the instructions.
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,907.366,930.981,"--I guess, Your Honor, since you have to have unanimous verdict in Georgia, of course, that the possibility that one might have interpreted still wouldn't invalidate it unconstitutionally, though: that what you're doing is... of course, we can't go back and determine how many of the jurors thought... but what you're doing is, under these instructions, eliminating the possibility or making it so small that any reasonable juror would find it to be permissive."
1984.83-1590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,935.666,939.058,"--Well, three of... this was unanimous below, wasn't it?"
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,939.058,940.098,"Yes, it was."
1984.83-1590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,940.098,943.39,So three Court of Appeals judges are unreasonable.
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,943.39,954.249,"Well, Your Honor, I think what happened is, then they considered on virtually the same language in the Corn case and three other judges of the Eleventh Circuit said that it wasn't unreasonable."
1984.83-1590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,960.651,964.454,Let me pursue the question that Justice White asked you.
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,983.908,992.073,"No, Your Honor, I'm not; because I think that when you start saying what one particular juror would think, you're not applying the reasonable juror test anymore."
1984.83-1590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,992.073,996.355,--So you say the reasonable juror just gives you one answer.
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,996.355,997.046,Right.
1984.83-1590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,997.046,1001.65,"It isn't a question of a reasonable juror could have said this, but another reasonable juror could have said that."
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1001.65,1017.859,"That's correct, because what you're doing, of course, in federal habeas corpus review, the federal habeas court is looking for denial of fundamental fairness, and because of that, you're not trying to determine what individual jurors might think, but trying to place yourself in the position of one reasonable juror."
1984.83-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1017.859,1023.913,May I go back for a moment to your argument based on the Corn case and the 31 other cases?
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1043.007,1047.399,"There's a comparable instruction in the case on the malice part of it, Your Honor."
1984.83-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1067.22,1075.966,"Yes, but does that go to the point that presumption doesn't arise until after malice or intentional killing, which they said in the Corn case?"
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1075.966,1081.72,"I think what they did in Corn, perhaps I can make myself clearer if I indicate to the Court what my idea of what they did."
1984.83-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1109.309,1110.571,"Well, I don't know about that case."
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1114.802,1116.154,"--Yes, it was."
1984.83-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1148.616,1158.953,"May I return, before you go to on, to the statements you made at the beginning, that the Sandstrom type instruction was commonplace at the time of this trial."
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1162.704,1164.056,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1164.056,1165.927,"I knew he was indicted, but I didn't--"
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1165.927,1167.029,The trial was in April of '79.
1984.83-1590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1176.085,1177.985,--He was tried in January?
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1177.985,1179.407,--He was tried in April.
1984.83-1590,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1180.927,1181.598,"Oh, tried in April?"
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1181.598,1182.369,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1590,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1182.369,1183.992,When did we hand down Sandstrom?
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1183.992,1186.981,"In June of... June, after the trial being in April."
1984.83-1590,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1194.377,1200.441,"Yes, but when did this Defendant first raise the Sandstrom question?"
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1200.441,1202.602,On direct appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.
1984.83-1590,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1202.602,1203.413,Initially?
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1203.413,1204.483,Yes.
1984.83-1590,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1223.877,1226.969,Was the Sandstrom charge presented to us in either one of the prior petition?
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1226.969,1234.072,"Yes, it was presented in the initial petition for certiorari from the affirmance of the conviction by the Georgia Supreme Court."
1984.83-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1485.559,1488.441,May I ask a question on the harmless error inquire?
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1496.566,1501.49,I think that I would advocate a reasonable juror test and the harmless error situation as well.
1984.83-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1501.49,1511.676,"Well, if we focus on the jury, would you care to comment on the fact that the jury came in at the end and said we want another inspection on an accident and intent and all?"
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1511.676,1515.99,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, they didn't ask for a reinstruction on the challenged presumption."
1984.83-1590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1515.99,1516.741,I understand.
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1516.741,1519.553,They asked for a reinstruction on malice and accident.
1984.83-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.481,1557.667,"You think they could have asked for that clarification, even though they thought the absence of intent defense was really a frivolous defense?"
1984.83-1590,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1557.667,1563.09,--I think the fact that they asked for reclarification doesn't indicate that they were confused by the current instructions.
1984.83-1590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1667.857,1669.7,Very well.
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,1674.332,1685.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I'd like to address first the issue of whether this charge was unconstitutional under Sandstrom, and later cover the harmless error point."
1984.83-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1886.491,1895.86,"Well, let's presume the presumption... everybody would agree that the instruction indicated a rebuttable presumption."
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,1898.699,1903.113,"In that case, I would say that there is a Sandstrom violation."
1984.83-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1905.134,1917.853,"Yes, but would you say that the instruction should... in order to violate Sandstrom, would have to tell the jury that in the absence of any evidence by the Defendant, you must find intent?"
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,1917.853,1919.172,--I would--
1984.83-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1919.172,1930.372,"Or, would you say that it's enough to violate Sandstrom to tell a jury that in the absence of any evidence from the Defendant, you may infer intent, but you are not required to?"
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,1930.372,1932.272,"--Well, Justice White, I--"
1984.83-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1932.272,1934.603,Or do both violate Sandstrom?
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,1934.603,1937.275,--My view is that it would violate Sandstrom.
1984.83-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1987.648,1992.833,You don't think this putting a burden of production on the Defendant is unconstitutional?
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,1992.833,1997.855,"--Well, in some circumstances, putting a burden of production can be unconstitutional."
1984.83-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.855,2005.71,"Well, what if the jury is told that you must infer intent unless the Defendant produces some evidence?"
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2005.71,2010.672,"Well, if the State had produced no evidence, then I would say that that would be unconstitutional."
1984.83-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2010.672,2015.066,"Well, but the State produces the evidence on which the presumption is built; he pulled the trigger."
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2036.401,2048.579,"Well, if they were instructed that you must find intent, I would believe that the charge would be constitutional, but if there had been no evidence, I still would say that it would be harmless error."
1984.83-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2048.579,2049.24,Why is that?
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2049.24,2051.421,Because the--
1984.83-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.421,2056.463,Why must the Defendant come forward with some evidence?
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2056.463,2097.881,"--Where the... it is necessarily true with every presumption, but if under the... I'm thinking of a different line of cases where we don't have the... where it's just a burden of production, and in that line of cases, where sometimes a reasonable person could make the presumption as a matter of logic and it is merely either permissible or it definitely only raises a burden of production and there is no question that that's all that it does, and that any evidence could satisfy it, the Court has looked to whether it is reasonable, either if it's a statutory presumption in cases in general, or they might look at the particular case."
1984.83-1590,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2104.155,2129.371,"Is the burden suggested by Justice White's question any different from the ""burden"" that this Court has placed on the person found in possession of recently stolen property, and from evidence that the Defendant was found in possession of recently stolen property, the jury may infer that he was the thief?"
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2129.371,2131.501,That is the kind of case--
1984.83-1590,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2131.501,2136.556,Does it shift the burden any more in the case I've just cited than in the one Justice White propounded?
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2136.556,2160.491,"--Well, Justice Burger, it was... the kind of case that you were referring to is the kind of holding of this Court that I was thinking of that is different from a Sandstrom context in which it is slightly different from, I believe, the hypothetical, because in the hypothetical Justice White posed, at least one of the examples said that any evidence would be enough to respond to it."
1984.83-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2229.736,2236.841,"But this instruction didn't say that the Defendant had to bear the burden of proof, did it?"
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2236.841,2239.392,"Did not specifically say that, but--"
1984.83-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.392,2241.182,It just talked about a presumption.
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2241.182,2243.025,--It did talk about a presumption.
1984.83-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2243.025,2244.425,And it was rebuttable.
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2244.425,2268.422,"It was rebuttable, just like the presumption in Sandstrom could have been construed as being, and just like, if Your Honor will recall, the Hankerson case where the jury was told with respect to self-defense that the Defendant had to... that presumption would apply unless the Defendant satisfied the jury on the issue of self-defense."
1984.83-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2268.422,2278.198,"Well, the jury is told that you may infer or presume intent from the pulling of the trigger, this is a presumption, but it's rebuttable."
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2285.372,2289.626,"If that had occurred, there would be several distinctions from this case."
1984.83-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2328.601,2329.482,That isn't this case.
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2329.482,2330.222,--That is certainly not.
1984.83-1590,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2606.181,2622.193,"Mr. Tabak, in the... I think it's the second footnote to the opinion of the Court of Appeals, which is at 37a of the Joint Appendix, the footnote says:"
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2645.589,2657.797,"I believe that at least one of the asterisks deals with the charge on the kidnapping claim, and so that is the asterisk on page 38a."
1984.83-1590,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2672.457,2676.478,Do you have any idea how long the jury charge took to give?
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2676.478,2682.342,I believe it was certainly no more than a half hour and probably was less than that.
1984.83-1590,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2717.544,2726.15,"Before you go into that, counsel, the Court of Appeals stated that the Defendant admitted that he fired the gun."
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2744.522,2753.138,--This was a revolver and it was one where testimony was that the Defendant had it cocked before he got to the door.
1984.83-1590,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2753.138,2755.962,"What is the purpose of that, unless he intended to shoot somebody?"
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2755.962,2756.32,No.
1984.83-1590,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2771.961,2774.942,"He did threaten one of them, the daughter."
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2774.942,2782.556,"He did threaten... he threatened two people, but the fact is they did not give him what he wanted, and he did not fire that gun, even though the gun was cocked."
1984.83-1590,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2795.516,2797.487,How would you account for him cocking it the second time?
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2797.487,2803.481,--I would account for it by the fact that he was startled by the first shot.
1984.83-1590,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2811.865,2814.008,Do you think he was unfamiliar with guns?
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2816.349,2822.724,"--it doesn't indicate he was totally unfamiliar with it, but he was not as familiar as he might have been."
1984.83-1590,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2822.724,2827.597,"Well, you have just told us that he habitually cocked a gun when he was carrying it around."
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2827.597,2830.298,"On that day, I said, Your Honor, not habitually."
1984.83-1590,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2830.298,2830.879,"Oh, I thought you said habitually."
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2830.879,2831.51,No.
1984.83-1590,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2941.981,2948.246,"So the question that he didn't know much about guns, but he did shoot the man through the heart, didn't he?"
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2948.246,2950.919,He did shoot the man through the heart.
1984.83-1590,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2955.34,2962.314,"I'm only getting to your one point that you've been making, that he doesn't know anything about guns."
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2962.314,2965.977,"--Your Honor, that... I didn't say he doesn't know anything about guns."
1984.83-1590,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2970.371,2982.208,"The story is that this man admitted that he, one, he carried a gun that day, the purpose for which he carried it, and that he kept it cocked."
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,2994.835,3005.874,"--Your Honor, to answer the question directly, he testified that the purpose of cocking it was to frighten people, and in any event--"
1984.83-1590,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3005.874,3010.336,"Well, in the dark, the people can't see whether it's cocked or not, can they?"
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,3010.336,3012.526,--I... in the dark they cannot.
1984.83-1590,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3072.907,3075.088,One other problem I have.
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,3084.495,3088.048,"--I recognize the difference, but the--"
1984.83-1590,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3088.048,3089.668,"One is, it could be accidental, couldn't it?"
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,3089.668,3090.619,--Yes.
1984.83-1590,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3090.619,3093.02,But you say you pulled the trigger.
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,3097.764,3102.516,"The actual statement of the Defendant was,"
1984.83-1590,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3111.533,3118.939,How do you compare that with his statement that he was in for life before he had made this escape?
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,3122.422,3123.701,"Well, the--"
1984.83-1590,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3123.701,3127.655,Don't you think there's a little inconsistency with your analysis and his own statement?
1984.83-1590,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,3127.655,3128.336,--No.
1984.83-1590,2,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3421.746,3459.582,"Your Honor, we would just like to reiterate for the Court's consideration that in considering both whether or not there was an initial Sandstrom violation and in considering the harmless error issue, that our view of the evidence is that it overwhelmingly showed the Respondent's intent to kill and that the true argument of defense counsel in his behalf was that he did not intend to kill anybody when he went to the house; that the purpose in going to the house of Mr. Collie was because there were three cars sitting in the yard, and he thought he could get a set of car keys to these cars at gunpoint and by cocking the gun and frightening these people."
1984.83-1590,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3466.637,3467.458,"Thank you, counsel."
