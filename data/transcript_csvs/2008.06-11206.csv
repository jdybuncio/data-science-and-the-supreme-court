2008.06-11206,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.154,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-11206, Chambers v. United States."
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,8.137,23.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Failure to report is not a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act because it presents neither a serious potential risk of injury to others nor involves violent and aggressive conduct."
2008.06-11206,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,81.462,88.116,I take it you concede that a breakout as opposed to a failure to report would be covered by the statute?
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,88.116,90.752,"Yes, Your Honor, I think it would."
2008.06-11206,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,130.645,133.014,But suppose it were shown -- this is hypothetical.
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,149.691,151.225,--This case?
2008.06-11206,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,151.225,151.792,Yes.
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,151.792,157.577,"Well, since -- I think since this is not a prison breakout case, I don't know whether data about breakouts--"
2008.06-11206,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,157.577,167.218,Do we look to the crime to see generally whether or not it involves violence and serious risk of harm?
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,167.218,170.502,--I think you -- I think the categorical rule does require you to look at--
2008.06-11206,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,170.502,176.589,"So that, in my hypothetical, it would be a more difficult case than the case we have here or would it be the same?"
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,176.589,181.458,"--I think in your hypothetical, where a prison breakout -- where a prison breakout is involved--"
2008.06-11206,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,181.458,181.875,No.
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,191.647,196.183,--I don't think that you look to the universe under the escape statute.
2008.06-11206,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,197.551,199.587,But that's what we looked to in Begay.
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,199.587,215.346,--But the issue under Shepard and the approach under the categorical rule requires you -- allows you to look at a narrower subsection of the statute if the charging document and other reliable indicia indicate that.
2008.06-11206,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,228.67,239.776,"Maybe -- I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I thought what Justice Kennedy was asking is what if you have a statute that is just escape or whatever and doesn't break it down like that?"
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,251.766,252.283,--Yes.
2008.06-11206,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,289.206,290.539,I'm sorry.
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,306.066,312.821,"--But here the charging document was clear, and under Shepard the charging document is something you're also allowed to take into consideration."
2008.06-11206,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,318.273,321.891,What was the sentence for that?
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,321.891,325.343,It -- the sentence appears that they extended his probation.
2008.06-11206,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,331.764,333.783,But he didn't get any extra jail time?
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,333.783,336.901,"He did not get any additional jail time as far as I can tell from the record, Your Honor."
2008.06-11206,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,336.901,341.352,There is really a problem about -- about what you suggest.
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,383.715,389.535,"I think this -- I think this Court took that step in Shepard, and it did it in a very narrow and circumscribed way."
2008.06-11206,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.807,399.39,Okay.
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,409.496,420.452,"--If the jury instructions were clear, if it's clear that the jury had to find that the presence of a firearm -- and I think it complicates -- that is, I think some courts refer to it as the modified categorical rule."
2008.06-11206,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,420.452,421.886,It has to be an element of the crime.
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,427.373,430.409,If -- if -- correct.
2008.06-11206,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,443.198,445.066,"Okay, but it doesn't have to be an element."
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,459.993,465.313,--I don't think that Shepard permits you to look into trial transcripts of evidence that was presented.
2008.06-11206,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.502,476.785,"Well, that sounds like an element."
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,477.62,479.47,"I think it is elements, but if you look--"
2008.06-11206,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,479.47,480.004,Well--
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,480.004,481.672,"--Please, continue."
2008.06-11206,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,481.672,492.296,"--If you look at the cases that we've had to decide under this statute in the last couple of years, do you think they illustrate that the categorical approach just doesn't work in this situation?"
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,539.491,573.331,"I think there are two problems with that approach, Your Honor: First, as the Court said in Shepard, the categorical rule, which was adopted way back when the Court first confronted the statute and has been consistently applied ever since, more or less anticipated the Sixth Amendment Apprendi concerns that might come from digging in and trying to attribute conduct which has not been found by a jury, which doesn't have that level of reliability, whether it's an element or was on a special verdict form or some -- or some other -- or was admitted to in a plea colloquy."
2008.06-11206,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,573.331,574.231,Isn't that a separate question?
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,578.033,587.84,"Well, if it was submitted to the jury, then I think under Shepard it's something that could be considered, and that would be part of what's referred to as the modified categorical approach."
2008.06-11206,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,614.574,625.597,"Well, it could, and if it had read these cases and it was paying attention to this problem, you would think it would go through a list of crimes and say, these fall within it and these don't fall within it."
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,627.132,631.583,"--I think that would make everybody's job, the bar and this Court, much easier."
2008.06-11206,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,631.583,636.404,"Well, it might not, if it just said ""escape"", and then you'd have this same problem."
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,636.404,657.818,"That might be the case, although if it just said ""escape"", I think I'd actually have a substantially harder case than what we have here, because what we have here doesn't resemble the kind of violent, aggressive conduct that this Court in Begay said is going to be the standard and exemplar of the sort of conduct that Congress was thinking about."
2008.06-11206,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.574,704.513,"Surely it depends upon how, how, what should I say, how often that prospect is realized."
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,704.513,706.982,--There is no doubt.
2008.06-11206,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,708.934,722.158,"I mean, the statute itself lists robbery and robbery very often doesn't involve any threat of injury, but all and all we think it does."
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,723.343,733.116,"--Well in the -- I actually think robbery would satisfy under the first clause because it has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another."
2008.06-11206,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.382,785.665,I didn't mean to say robbery.
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,789.517,791.136,I think the reason is because--
2008.06-11206,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,791.136,795.154,"I mean, burglary by its nature is -- you do it at night."
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,800.075,801.825,--I assume that--
2008.06-11206,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.825,803.193,Robbery is violent or aggressive.
2008.06-11206,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,805.043,809.68,"When you say burglary, if you're at home, if you're at home it's going to get violent and aggressive."
2008.06-11206,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,809.68,816.084,"Yes, but -- that may be, but it does not in its nature indicate violence or aggressiveness."
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,816.084,819.036,"--I think, Justice Souter, has it exactly right."
2008.06-11206,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,849.056,850.606,It gets you right back into the soup.
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,862.379,871.485,--What it -- what it requires is the conscious creation of circumstances that you have good reason to believe is going to ignite in violence.
2008.06-11206,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1026.612,1031.199,That doesn't square with the answer you gave me with regard to burglary.
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1035.885,1036.318,No.
2008.06-11206,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1069.688,1073.973,"So invading someone's space, so trespass would be covered by this statute?"
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1076.609,1080.211,"--If it's -- if it's felonious, trespass might be."
2008.06-11206,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1119.169,1129.275,"Your argument is that the failing to report is not violent and aggressive and therefore, no matter what degree of risk the statistics might show, it would not qualify?"
2008.06-11206,0,39470,robert_n_hochman,,1129.275,1131.227,"I'm making both arguments, Your Honor."
2008.06-11206,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1137.131,1138.031,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1143.451,1159.227,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Failure-to-report escape qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA's residual clause because it creates a serious potential risk of physical injury that's comparable in both kind and degree to the risk that's created by the enumerated offense of burglary.
2008.06-11206,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1166.381,1171.035,"Mr. Roberts, wouldn't that be so of any crime?"
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1191.079,1191.781,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.06-11206,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1227.586,1228.136,Say that again.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1229.319,1229.621,--Okay.
2008.06-11206,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1240.661,1244.296,What's that got to do with increasing the risk of violence?
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1252.032,1254.884,It shows the close connection between the two.
2008.06-11206,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1273.298,1277.433,"--Yes, but the crime is still -- the crime that we are concerned with here is still essentially a passive crime."
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1278.683,1279.452,--Well--
2008.06-11206,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1279.452,1292.025,"And given, you know, the close logical connections, I don't see that the close logical connections convert the passive crime into a higher degree of resisting arrest from any other."
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1293.575,1305.167,"--To address the -- the passive point, deliberately failing to comply with your legal duty to report to prison is not -- it is not doing nothing, as Petitioner says."
2008.06-11206,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1307.1,1309.1,"Well, you know, you may precisely be doing nothing."
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1324.11,1330.179,It's purposefully inviting the violent confrontation when the law enforcement officers come to terminate--
2008.06-11206,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1330.179,1334.798,You can say the same thing about failure to respond to a traffic ticket.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1334.798,1335.648,--No.
2008.06-11206,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1358.831,1363.651,The offender is prone to react violently if he doesn't respond to a traffic ticket?
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1363.651,1364.085,--No.
2008.06-11206,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1379.994,1382.594,What is your understanding of the Illinois statute?
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1387.981,1388.933,This--
2008.06-11206,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1388.933,1392.302,"What about like, you know, you've got to see your probation officer every--"
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1392.302,1397.956,"--This offense that he was convicted of is failure to report to a penal institution, failure to report to prison."
2008.06-11206,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1397.956,1401.24,--And you concede the probation or parole situation?
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1401.24,1405.359,I think a probation violation is different -- different circumstances.
2008.06-11206,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1412.346,1424.154,"So we need not so many -- not so much statistics about how many times violence results, but statistics about how serious the police are about picking somebody up?"
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1424.154,1426.039,"--I don't think you really need the statistics, Your Honor."
2008.06-11206,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1435.795,1452.44,But it's not common sense that the person who has been guilty of a crime so gentlemanly that they only made him report to prison on the weekends would confront the policeman with violence when he comes.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1459.577,1460.112,Well--
2008.06-11206,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1460.112,1463.647,"But did he get additional time, by the way, when -- when they finally brought him back?"
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1463.647,1476.538,"--When he was sentenced -- when he was convicted of escape, he was sentenced to six months in prison -- in jail, that was stayed; probation for 30 months, and he violated his probation and he ended up in jail for 5 years."
2008.06-11206,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1476.538,1479.573,So he just -- he just had to make up the weekends that he had lost?
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1479.573,1479.823,No.
2008.06-11206,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1482.223,1484.223,That's what Mr. Hochman told us--
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1484.223,1485.023,"I know that, Your Honor."
2008.06-11206,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1485.023,1485.758,--when I asked that question.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1485.758,1490.543,But I don't think that's accurate for the sentence for escape.
2008.06-11206,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1511.206,1513.872,"Well, this guy doesn't sound to me like Jack the Ripper."
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1514.574,1519.526,"You know, we are not supposed to be looking at the individual offender here."
2008.06-11206,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1539.274,1544.344,But would the statute apply if -- say he is supposed to go in on the weekends.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1556.068,1562.555,"--First of all, while he is out on the binge, people could be coming and looking for him and the violent confrontation could occur."
2008.06-11206,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1586.402,1591.686,Can you -- can you tell me: The U.S. attorney has this case.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1608.648,1610.517,I think generally the policy--
2008.06-11206,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1610.517,1612.817,--What goes through the mind of -- of a prosecutor?
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1623.008,1625.527,"--Well, Your Honor, he is -- he is looking at his whole--"
2008.06-11206,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1625.527,1635.465,What -- what does a -- are there many instances where you think in a case like this a U.S. attorney would just elect not to file that charge?
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1635.465,1636.932,--I--
2008.06-11206,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1636.932,1641.369,"Or do you think they automatically file it every time; and if not, how do they define it?"
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1641.369,1656.796,--I think generally that -- that they look at the conduct that's been committed and they -- that the policy is to charge the -- the maximum charges that are supported by what the -- what the defendant has done.
2008.06-11206,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1657.779,1660.014,Do they ever look at the -- do they ever look at the attorney?
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1671.27,1675.023,--I'm -- I'm not aware of that.
2008.06-11206,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1703.274,1704.107,I understood your friend -- excuse me.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1710.363,1713.398,"--That's -- that's also incorrect, Your Honor."
2008.06-11206,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1736.661,1737.763,So you have -- so you have two examples.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1737.763,1738.63,We have those two examples.
2008.06-11206,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1743.751,1744.751,You haven't gone out and looked for other -- I'm sorry.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1747.303,1748.819,"In -- in addition to those, no."
2008.06-11206,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1767.013,1767.68,Mr. Roberts--
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1767.68,1772.567,"--But it's 11 percent of the people violently resisted, and they were charged with assault and battery on a police officer."
2008.06-11206,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1778.388,1784.042,"--Mr. Roberts, have you had occasion to look at the -- the recent figures compiled by the Sentencing Commission?"
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1784.042,1785.775,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.06-11206,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1800.469,1802.337,Is the magnitude of the risk relevant?
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1808.94,1813.811,"--We don't think that you should be looking at the statistics at -- at all, Your Honor."
2008.06-11206,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1826.036,1829.654,But the potential risk is based on an empirical assessment.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1833.456,1841.379,What James says is that you try to assess whether the degree of risk is comparable to the degree of risk presented by one of the enumerated offenses.
2008.06-11206,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1843.331,1848.651,But isn't that's based on our experience because we have these cases; we've been lawyers; we know what they usually involve.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1849.717,1851.234,--Yes.
2008.06-11206,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1851.234,1854.721,--an instinct or a basis for making a judgment.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1854.721,1855.221,Yes.
2008.06-11206,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1855.221,1858.34,"If statistics can inform that, why ignore the statistics?"
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1858.34,1863.411,"I'm not saying that you should ignore the statistics, but the statistics are neither necessary nor dispositive."
2008.06-11206,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1875.117,1881.289,"But your argument goes simply to whether there is potential and the statute says ""serious potential""."
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1891.561,1893.763,"--Well, I think James addresses that, Your Honor."
2008.06-11206,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1902.952,1905.654,They were taking as examples cases in which there was serious potential.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1911.992,1913.258,It has -- it has to be more than a potential.
2008.06-11206,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1920.998,1926.902,What one are we to do with -- Justice Stevens -- I think you should address the statistics in the sentencing report.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1926.902,1927.602,Okay.
2008.06-11206,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1927.602,1938.875,"As I read them, they put together -- if you put together failing to report and failing to return, you get 160 cases in their sample."
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1957.587,1958.456,That's right.
2008.06-11206,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1958.906,1959.506,All right.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1960.206,1974.048,--It's a 3.1 percent -- 3.1 percent rate of having this dangerous weapon when he is being -- being taken into custody for -- for this offense.
2008.06-11206,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2010.268,2022.076,"You had every opportunity, when we have 160 cases out of the universe -- I guess I don't know what the universe is, but sampling proceeds through a small amount of cases."
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2036.317,2038.169,"--Well, no, Your Honor."
2008.06-11206,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2045.775,2046.459,No.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2060.701,2068.188,"--Because my point is that -- take the 42 failure-to-report people, which is the offense here, okay."
2008.06-11206,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2088.436,2089.069,But they didn't use a gun.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2089.069,2092.237,3.8 percent in -- in household burglary.
2008.06-11206,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2098.493,2099.093,"--I'm sorry, counsel."
2008.06-11206,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2101.445,2104.563,The problem is you say if he had used a gun.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2115.586,2120.49,"Well, Your Honor, the statute again talks about the potential risk."
2008.06-11206,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2128.013,2134.499,Do you think those statistics show a greater danger than the dangers from drunk driving that were involved in Begay?
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2134.499,2135.399,--No.
2008.06-11206,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2179.361,2181.48,"Well, of course, that's the point."
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2187.551,2188.217,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.06-11206,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2218.336,2228.775,"The distinction between this crime and crimes in general is that this person has shown that he or she doesn't want to go back into custody, is that--"
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2228.775,2236.798,"I think it's -- it's numerous things, but the avoidance of custody is sort of a categorical difference between this and all the other crimes, Your Honor."
2008.06-11206,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2253.259,2257.128,"--There is -- there was, this case comes to us from the Seventh Circuit, right?"
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2257.128,2257.611,--Yes.
2008.06-11206,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2257.611,2270.888,"And am I correct in understanding that since this case was decided, the Seventh Circuit has changed its position and has gone the other way?"
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2270.888,2271.521,Yes.
2008.06-11206,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2310.379,2325.939,"The first time around, didn't one of the judges suggest that there ought to be a study comparing the frequency of violence in escapes from custody to the frequency of violence in failure to report, and isn't that what we now have from the Sentencing Commission?"
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2325.939,2326.975,--Yes.
2008.06-11206,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2374.372,2380.276,May I -- may I -- may I ask you just to get some sense about what will qualify?
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2417.366,2435.41,"What -- we wouldn't sweep in any crimes based on arrest if the crimes don't themselves involve as part of the crime the avoidance of custody, because that shows the close link between the crime that I was explaining before."
2008.06-11206,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2468.049,2469.583,They are going to be in category one.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2469.583,2470.167,Right.
2008.06-11206,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2471.619,2472.285,Yes.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2472.285,2485.177,"So you know, one, we think there is a categorical difference between this kind of crime which has as an element avoidance custody, and all of the ordinary crimes that you're talking about."
2008.06-11206,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2524.754,2535.86,Do you happen to know how many additional crimes are likely to raise issues like this under the residual clause?
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2535.86,2542.632,"Not -- you know, how many could be covered altogether?"
2008.06-11206,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2543.116,2549.802,"Well after we decide this case, how many more cases like this do you anticipate that we're -- we may get under ACCA?"
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2549.802,2561.11,--Well I'm hopeful that the Court won't have to decide too many other cases with the guidance that will be given by Begay and James and now -- and now this case.
2008.06-11206,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2581.907,2587.411,"Mr. Roberts, I'm sorry; do you think a soldier who is AWOL commits a violent crime?"
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2587.411,2601.235,"--I think a soldier that goes AWOL -- I mean, the soldier that goes AWOL does probably invite somebody to come after them."
2008.06-11206,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2607.139,2608.172,"Well, he has to be a recidivist."
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2615.376,2618.494,"Well, when he did it first -- he could have done it in his first crime."
2008.06-11206,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2623.112,2624.731,It would only be a crime if it's his third crime and not if it's his first.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2624.731,2633.42,"Well, you don't look to the individual person; we're looking to the ordinary case and we know from the elements here that you have a recidivist -- you have a recidivist felon."
2008.06-11206,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2641.507,2642.192,Sure.
2008.06-11206,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2642.192,2649.446,"I just don't think it's quite as -- as clear a risk as it is -- as it is here, but you know, I would have to say that there is some risk."
2008.06-11206,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2721.36,2722.811,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.06-11206,2,39470,robert_n_hochman,,2726.096,2728.215,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.06-11206,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2784.718,2786.552,What was he serving those weekends for?
2008.06-11206,2,39470,robert_n_hochman,,2787.337,2791.806,"That was the armed robbery -- the robbery crime, not armed robbery, the robbery crime."
2008.06-11206,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2794.074,2797.526,He just gets weekends for that?
2008.06-11206,2,39470,robert_n_hochman,,2798.26,2799.228,11.
2008.06-11206,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2799.228,2801.012,Pretty good deal.
2008.06-11206,2,39470,robert_n_hochman,,2803.346,2811.969,"Second, with respect to the anecdotal cases, you know, we looked at them; you could look at them."
2008.06-11206,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2878.597,2884.048,Statistics show that the number of robberies increases during the holiday season.
2008.06-11206,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2888.135,2889.835,I thought he did this four times.
2008.06-11206,2,39470,robert_n_hochman,,2890.737,2896.475,"--There were four periods from the end of November, four consecutive weekends from the end of November into December."
2008.06-11206,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2903.329,2906.781,"Well, there is no indication he meant to spend time with his family over the holidays."
2008.06-11206,2,39470,robert_n_hochman,,2907.281,2907.697,--Not in the record.
2008.06-11206,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2967.235,2967.952,"Thank you, counsel."
