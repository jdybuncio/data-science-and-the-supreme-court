2013.12-158,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.82,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-158, Bond v. United States."
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,7.937,10.972,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-158,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,47.314,64.356,"But, Mr. Clement, you said that -- that the treaty is valid and the implementing legislation seems to largely copy the words of the treaty without adding anything."
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,79.116,94.545,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I guess I would quarrel with your premise, which is, it is true that the convention in the statute used similar terms and terminology, but there's one very important difference between the convention and the statute and that actually differentiates this case from Missouri vs. Holland."
2013.12-158,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,103.983,113.439,"But the convention -- but the convention tells the State parties, go regulate individual conduct in exactly the way that this convention regulates State parties."
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,122.979,131.585,"--Well, Justice Kagan, to be quite precise, though, what the convention says -- and this is Article 7, Section 1, it's 33-A of the blue brief appendix."
2013.12-158,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,164.989,165.322,Why not?
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,165.322,166.639,--as we promised with our--
2013.12-158,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,166.639,168.874,"Mr. Clement, why not?"
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,226.894,228.345,"--Well, I think--"
2013.12-158,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,228.345,235.932,I don't understand where the disconnect is in terms of our Federal or State system.
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,235.932,249.426,"--Well, Justice Sotomayor, I think it really gets down to the difference between Raich on the one hand and Lopez on the other, which as this Court has held, that it is a classic and rational way to regulate commerce to basically prohibit certain items from commerce."
2013.12-158,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,249.426,257.865,"So why isn't this saying, there's no dispute that these chemicals were transported against -- along interstate lines."
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,261.567,267.302,But I don't think it was really disputed in Lopez that the firearm would have had to cross State lines.
2013.12-158,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,276.327,280.712,"Well, we didn't take this case to -- to decide the Commerce Clause question, did we?"
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,289.568,291.337,"That's right, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-158,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,306.529,316.718,"Do you think -- do you think, Mr. Clement, and this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question, could the -- could this treaty have itself regulated individual conduct?"
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,320.02,326.51,"--Well, I think that's an interesting question, and I don't think the Court needs to answer it."
2013.12-158,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,343.535,345.502,Where would you find that in the Constitution?
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,366.233,372.389,--I would find that limitation in the structural provisions of the Constitution and the enumerated powers of Congress.
2013.12-158,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,374.072,375.607,But this isn't an enumerated power.
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,382.527,388.165,"--Well, I think where that it would come from, again, is the structural provisions of the Constitution."
2013.12-158,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,401.888,404.923,"Well, don't you think the word “ treaty ” has some meaning?"
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,465.893,468.193,"I think that's right, Justice Alito."
2013.12-158,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,492.378,499.132,"If you had been the President's counsel, would you have advised him that it was unconstitutional to sign this treaty as written?"
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,499.132,500.132,--No.
2013.12-158,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,535.555,545.78,"Mr. Clement, there's an irony in what you just said, because the victim, many times, went to the State police and said, please help me."
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,572.597,580.617,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, one way to understand that is that the State of Pennsylvania exercised its prosecutorial discretion not to pursue this matter."
2013.12-158,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,601.198,603.483,"Mr. Clement, could I make sure I understand your test?"
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,619.994,622.294,"No, that's not my test, Justice Kagan."
2013.12-158,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,650.712,656.365,"Well, I guess I'm still looking for a test and I thought that the test that I just articulated was really directly out of your briefs."
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,668.356,673.493,It's whether the Federal statute exercises a general police power.
2013.12-158,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,674.71,676.445,That sounds like a facial challenge.
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,683.016,688.92,"--Well, that's because the only relief I'm seeking is to have my client's conviction vacated."
2013.12-158,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,703.679,712.285,"So you're saying if the statute extends to things that we've generally thought of as part of the police power, that's sufficient."
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,712.285,727.045,"--I would say that if a Federal statute exercises the police power, by which I mean it criminalizes conduct without regard to jurisdictional element or some nexus to a matter of distinctly Federal concern, then that statute exceeds Congress's power."
2013.12-158,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,733.716,734.065,Okay.
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,769.572,778.996,"It does, Your Honor, and it would be valid legislation precisely because Sarin is something that clearly Congress could prohibit in all its uses."
2013.12-158,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,811.634,816.352,So but this is -- in my hypothetical -- and you didn't run away from it at all; I applaud that.
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,868.904,871.02,"Well, Justice Kagan, I would beg to differ."
2013.12-158,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,908.295,909.795,And do you think it would be difficult--
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,909.795,914.699,"And think about the convention that was before this Court in the Medellin case, the Vienna Convention on Consular Notification."
2013.12-158,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,949.789,969.702,"--Do you think it would be difficult for a judge to ask, is there any possibility that there is any other country in the world that has the slightest interest in how the United States or any of its subdivisions deals with the particular situation that's involved in this case?"
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,969.702,973.237,"Justice Alito, I think that would be one way of approaching the question."
2013.12-158,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,974.121,981.008,Do you think that would be beyond the -- that would be beyond the ability of Federal judges when they -- when a case like this comes before them?
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,981.008,983.31,--I don't think it would be beyond their ability.
2013.12-158,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1026.056,1051.838,"Is it -- is it one way to characterize your argument or is it too unfairly confining to your argument to say that what you're suggesting is something like a clear statement rule, that if the treaty intends nation states to have their own constitutional structure superseded at a minimum it has to say so, and then we will come to the question of whether or not they can do it?"
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1051.838,1057.993,"--I think that would be a fair characterization of our argument, but only to add that this would be the anti-clear statement case."
2013.12-158,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1092.749,1097.802,"Mr. Clement, I -- I don't understand how -- how you distinguish Sarin gas."
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1101.604,1110.793,Because Sarin gas is I think more equivalent to something that the Congress would try to deal with like the way it dealt with marijuana in Raich.
2013.12-158,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1196.399,1202.217,Is the chemical used here one of the chemicals that's listed in the annex to the treaty?
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1202.217,1203.419,I don't believe so.
2013.12-158,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1253.401,1258.989,"Counsel, we permit that in all sorts of definitional sections of the criminal code."
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1279.053,1279.769,Well--
2013.12-158,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1279.769,1283.788,So I'm -- I'm having a problem with this noun-verb distinction.
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1299.966,1300.732,--A couple points--
2013.12-158,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1300.732,1303.251,You want to add on the war-like purposes.
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1308.738,1310.855,"--Justice Sotomayor, a couple of points."
2013.12-158,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1333.804,1334.371,The treaty power.
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1334.371,1337.154,"--Well, I don't think that the treaty power--"
2013.12-158,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1337.154,1338.056,That's what was said in the--
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1338.056,1348.629,"--especially when there's this much of a disconnect between what the treaty power does and what the statute does, which is the treaty, again, does not directly regulate at all individual conduct."
2013.12-158,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1376.448,1389.456,"--So if a terrorist took these chemicals and put it on every doorknob in Boston, that wouldn't be regulated by this or -- the very exact same chemicals."
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1389.456,1390.624,--Right.
2013.12-158,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1394.592,1395.776,Because it's war-like.
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1395.776,1396.792,Because it's a war-like use of the chemicals.
2013.12-158,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1396.792,1397.142,All right.
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1397.609,1407.248,We would also point out for the record that that same conduct would obviously be covered directly by Federal statutes that target terrorism directly.
2013.12-158,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1448.325,1465.87,"Well, but, Mr. Clement, it's absolutely clear that the treaty was after enforcement as to individuals with respect to all the prohibitions, that the treaty said: Go enforce this as to individuals and do it consistent with your constitutional processes."
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1474.559,1477.844,"Two things, Justice Kagan, neither of which will surprise you, I suppose."
2013.12-158,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1481.296,1482.648,I guess I'm still trying to figure out why.
2013.12-158,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1522.959,1532.065,"Justice Kagan, I think you have to read Missouri v. Holland both in the context of the treaty that the Court had before it and the argument that it had before it."
2013.12-158,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1579.876,1581.061,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1586.632,1589.132,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-158,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1617.834,1634.446,"General, let's suppose there's a multilateral treaty, the -- the international convention to ensure that national legislatures have full authority to carry out their obligations, i.e., that the national legislature has the police power."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1645.486,1647.338,There may well be.
2013.12-158,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1661.697,1664.915,It also seems unimaginable that you would bring this prosecution.
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1666.999,1669.634,And that does go to the point--
2013.12-158,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1669.634,1675.455,"And just to press it further, the -- the point is that it's a transfer of authority from the States to the national legislature."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1678.657,1688.43,"--Well, the framers thought that the two-thirds guarantee -- the two-thirds ratification requirement, was an important structural guarantee to protect the interests of the States."
2013.12-158,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1688.43,1691.299,At a time when the Senate was elected by the State legislatures.
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1691.299,1692.799,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-158,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1714.832,1720.067,"So your answer is if -- if that unimaginable thing should happen, it would be okay?"
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1720.067,1720.45,No.
2013.12-158,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1720.45,1720.7,All right.
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1720.7,1737.66,My answer is this: That the Court has said that there is an inquiry into whether the -- it is a proper subject of a treaty and that that inquiry could take into account whether it is imposing a fundamental change in the character of the government.
2013.12-158,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1754.571,1757.223,I don't know why it would not be a valid exercise of the treaty power.
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1788.509,1788.993,--All right.
2013.12-158,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1800.132,1800.415,"No, no."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1801.067,1805.785,"And therefore -- and therefore, that may be a question that the Court would have to answer in a different case."
2013.12-158,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1809.171,1823.163,--So the -- the purpose of my hypothetical was try to find out if there's any situation in which you believe an erosion or intrusion by the Federal Government on the police power could be a constraint against an international treaty.
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1823.163,1827.634,"There -- there may be an outer bound, but this case is nowhere close to it."
2013.12-158,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1833.788,1846.362,"Well, it seems to me that if you say there may be an outer bound but this case isn't one of them, you're subjecting yourself to the same criticisms that have been leveled against the other side, that you're proposing a case-by-case evaluation with respect to each treaty."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1846.362,1846.779,No.
2013.12-158,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1861.206,1870.727,"I'd like to -- I'd like to explore that, your proposition that there's no daylight between the treaty itself and the implementing legislation."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1965.689,1969.224,"Your Honor, I'd like to make a structural point and then a specific point about this case."
2013.12-158,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2010.234,2011.718,I don't think it has to be the case.
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2035.283,2037.735,"--Well, with respect, now the point with respect to this treaty."
2013.12-158,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2064.768,2065.118,It is?
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2204.976,2215.183,"--This is a very important point here, and it gets I think to the heart of what the national interest is in this case with respect to this treaty and this implementing legislation."
2013.12-158,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2231.71,2231.926,"No, no."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2239.263,2240.113,"--No -- no, I'm not."
2013.12-158,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2240.113,2240.646,Okay.
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2264.261,2270.848,"We can -- we can talk about hypotheticals, but the key point about them is that they're hypothetical."
2013.12-158,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2270.848,2272.348,"No, no."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2275.417,2279.354,"The vinegar and the goldfish is not a real case, and I would submit that de minimis non curat lex."
2013.12-158,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2279.354,2283.406,They're not real -- they're not real cases because you haven't prosecuted them yet.
2013.12-158,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2301.801,2303.569,If her child had died--
2013.12-158,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2303.569,2311.825,"This statute has an enormous -- an enormous breadth, anything that can cause death or injury to a person or an animal."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2322.014,2326.999,"Your Honor, I understand the point."
2013.12-158,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2326.999,2328.418,On Halloween we gave them chocolate bars.
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2333.153,2336.774,"I think de minimis non curat lex would take care of that, but this -- there is serious -- this is--"
2013.12-158,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2336.774,2338.09,--There's chocolate all over the place.
2013.12-158,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2339.39,2341.592,Do horses eat potatoes?
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2343.177,2344.143,--This is serious business.
2013.12-158,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2348.079,2354.316,"No, I'm not -- I want your answer to the line -- my question was a question to get your answer."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2386.37,2387.722,"--I understand that, Your Honor, but the law--"
2013.12-158,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2387.722,2388.756,So what is your answer?
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2389.789,2408.803,--If you will permit me to answer the question this way: The line that the Petitioner is asking courts to draw is whether the particular use is warlike or whether it constitutes a peaceful purpose under this convention and under the implementing statute.
2013.12-158,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2452.082,2456.534,Why don't you tell us -- can you tell us what the line is that we're trying to draw?
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2456.534,2469.524,--And the -- the -- the framers of the convention and Congress in implementing the convention made a judgment that there needs to be a comprehensive ban and that you can't be drawing these kinds of lines because you can't--
2013.12-158,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2469.524,2471.126,"Well, General, could I ask why that is?"
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2497.444,2512.037,"--Well, with respect to the chemicals, I think they made the judgment because you can't predict in advance how chemicals are going to be used and how toxic they will be in particular combinations and how dangerous they will be in particular combinations and therefore you need a comprehensive definition."
2013.12-158,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2512.037,2515.589,"Well, look, also if you' telling me I am attempting to draw the line."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2546.025,2553.03,"Well, I think there is a -- I think there is a real risk in courts getting involved in defining the line between warlike and peaceful purposes--"
2013.12-158,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2553.03,2553.43,You're the one--
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2553.43,2557.416,--and the meaning of the convention when the -- when the convention is purposely drafted broadly.
2013.12-158,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2578.08,2586.768,But you did not give the line to the Chief Justice's question where there was a treaty that intruded on the Federal structure.
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2599.761,2628.345,"--Well, I -- what I think it would, Justice Kennedy, would suffice to decide this case, were the Court to conclude that the “ too local ” limit that the Petitioner is advocating here as an as-applied, case-by-case “ too local ” limit is not one that is inconsistent with the constitutional structure because if you go back to the framers, it is clear from the era of the framing that the framers intended to give the national government the power using--"
2013.12-158,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2628.345,2633.249,"Well, is it your precept, then, that a treaty cannot be inconsistent with our constitutional structure?"
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2633.249,2647.826,"--This Court has said that the -- this Court has said that, in dictum, repeatedly, but it has said that the -- the treaty -- there's a question in a treaty power case of whether the subject matter of the treaty is a proper subject for a treaty."
2013.12-158,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2664.688,2673.626,"But there are a lot of treaties, particularly I think Justice Alito pointed out, after the World War II era where you have international conventions affecting everything."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2717.053,2723.657,"If the -- if the treaty -- well, the way I would answer that, Mr. Chief Justice, is if the treaty is valid--"
2013.12-158,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2723.657,2724.475,Okay.
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2725.309,2736.382,--then implementing legislation that doesn't go beyond the treaty is valid even if it addresses a subject that would otherwise be within the police power of the States.
2013.12-158,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2736.382,2737.016,Okay.
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2737.016,2739.751,That is the judgment the framers made and that's what -- that's this case.
2013.12-158,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2750.709,2762.517,"So you would rather have the Court determine, if we're concerned about the intrusion on the police power, whether treaties are valid or not than whether -- determine whether particular implementing legislation is valid or not."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2762.517,2764.384,--No.
2013.12-158,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2781.661,2782.195,I know this case.
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2804.361,2809.765,"So there is a structure of limitations, you know, as I said earlier."
2013.12-158,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2843.567,2843.917,"--Oh, no."
2013.12-158,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2844.752,2845.969,It's -- it's kind of question begging.
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2865.415,2867.165,"--I doubt that, Your Honor, because--"
2013.12-158,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2867.165,2867.615,"No, no."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2868.464,2876.068,--Nobody -- no -- nobody would -- we're not saying -- and I don't think anybody would say that -- that whether or not Ms. Bond is prosecuted would give rise to an international incident.
2013.12-158,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2896.048,2896.798,That is the question.
2013.12-158,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2896.798,2913.591,"And, General, don't we have an amicus brief from almost all of the legal counsels of the State Department, Republican and Democrat, talking about how if Petitioner's argument were accepted, it would severely damage the United States' ability to enter into and to negotiate treaties."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2913.591,2914.01,That's right.
2013.12-158,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2917.811,2927.1,"--I'm sure that the people who've worked in the national branch of government, particularly for the State Department, would like to have as much authority as they can get to negotiate treaties."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2937.791,2944.029,"Your Honor, this convention is a convention that all but four nations on Earth have signed."
2013.12-158,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2952.218,2972.73,"--Whenever -- when this Court has issued decisions in recent years holding that there are some limits on Congress's power, cases like Lopez and Morrison and City of Boerne, there have been legal commentators who have written articles saying that could be circumvented to -- through the use of the treaty power."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2973.398,2977.266,I don't think there's a yes or no answer to that.
2013.12-158,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2987.489,2987.891,Could you -- all right.
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3002.484,3007.719,--I think the question in that case would be whether the treaty is a valid exercise of the treaty power.
2013.12-158,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3007.719,3008.119,"Oh, it is."
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3097.878,3100.58,"I understand the point, Justice Breyer, I do."
2013.12-158,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3136.352,3152.113,"General Verrilli, before your time is out, you haven't answered directly why the Bill of Rights does constrain the treaty power, the implementation of it, Reid v. Colbert?"
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3169.675,3177.079,"--There is a historical answer to that question, Justice Ginsburg, which is that that's how the Framers understood it."
2013.12-158,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3206.764,3209.983,All of those quotes pertain to self-executing treaties.
2013.12-158,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3246.575,3260.916,"--Your Honor, so long as the treaty -- it's a valid exercise of the treaty power, I think a fortiori if all you do is implement the treaty in haec verba, it's a valid exercise of Congress' power."
2013.12-158,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3380.045,3381.178,"Thank you, General."

2013.12-158,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3544.636,3554.508,"I would say it's not, but I think it has to do more with the particular qualities of sarin gas, the fact that it's on Schedule A, the fact that nobody can possess that for any lawful use."
2013.12-158,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3613.38,3617.249,A clear statement about the treaty -- I'm sorry.
