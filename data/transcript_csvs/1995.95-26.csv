1995.95-26,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.487,"We'll hear argument next in No. 95-26, Herbert Markman and Positek v. Westview Instruments, Inc.--"
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,22.486,28.229,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1995.95-26,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,101.017,105.14,I had a little trouble finding that confirmation that you seem to have found.
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,114.767,115.255,Yes.
1995.95-26,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,115.255,115.666,All right.
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,116.808,122.381,It... Judge Hand indicates that the issue is a question of fact.
1995.95-26,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,122.381,131.288,"I have no doubt about that, but where does... the question of how people in a particular industry see a particular word and interpret it is a linguistic question."
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,133.658,133.988,Yes.
1995.95-26,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,133.988,135.621,"That's true, but where does that get us?"
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,135.621,138.563,That gets us under the Seventh Amendment.
1995.95-26,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,138.563,138.871,Why?
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,172.013,173.255,For two reasons.
1995.95-26,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,176.968,178.028,What is the... fine.
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,199.912,214.883,"--Under the understanding... under the jurisprudence of the Seventh Amendment under decisions of this case, factual issues on the merits of a claim are for the jury."
1995.95-26,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,218.225,218.863,I know that's the conclusion.
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,247.474,264.244,"--On that precise point, we go back to the common law practice where in Liardet v. Johnson, Awkwright v. Nightingale, and other cases at common law the meaning of patent terms were submitted to the jury."
1995.95-26,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,289.359,314.366,"But your opponents argue, if I understand it, that there is an issue today, the issue in this case, that was not a jury issue, in fact was not understood as an independent issue at the time that you refer to as your standard of practice, and that was there was not the modern notion of patent claim, and therefore there was not an issue of construing a patent claim."
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,324.982,326.825,"Yes, whether there was sufficient disclosure--"
1995.95-26,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,326.825,327.506,Right.
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,327.506,341.675,"--whether it was an advancement of novelty in a prior art, and those kind of issues were left to the jury which necessarily involved the jury interpreting what the specifications mean in order to decide whether--"
1995.95-26,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,341.675,352.12,But they say the specifications that you're talking about are simply different kinds of statements from the statement of claim.
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,371.943,372.724,--Yes.
1995.95-26,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,382.271,384.101,Was that a physical description of the invention?
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,384.101,384.532,--Yes.
1995.95-26,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,387.012,389.416,"You know, this is a box and it has a crank and a door--"
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,389.416,390.315,And so on--
1995.95-26,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,390.315,390.806,--and so on.
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,390.806,391.447,--the way you see in patents.
1995.95-26,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,391.447,391.917,Okay.
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,396.008,396.479,"No, I don't think it is."
1995.95-26,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,396.479,396.899,Okay.
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,396.899,398.8,And let me explain.
1995.95-26,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,424.008,425.368,What words did you say they ended with?
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,425.368,426.119,--Pardon?
1995.95-26,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,426.119,429.161,What words did you say that they ended with?
1995.95-26,0,45499,william_b_mallin,,429.161,429.952,I claim.
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,1587.413,1601.262,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1626.159,1635.385,Do we have to decide this case on as global a basis as the Federal circuit decided to say that it's always thus or it's never thus?
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,1635.385,1646.283,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, because in this case there was no question about the meaning of the language in the patent... no real question about the meaning of the language used in the patent."
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1660.35,1665.986,"But if that were going to be our basis for decision, we wouldn't be deciding very much, would we?"
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,1681.675,1682.726,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1682.726,1689.93,"So, if we don't decide on that extremely narrow ground, do we have to decide as globally as the circuit did?"
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,1689.93,1695.874,"No, you don't because I think it is taking it... looking at the interpretation of the claim."
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1703.499,1704.02,No.
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,1714.797,1717.879,--I don't--
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1717.879,1721.282,I understood your argument to be... I understood you to be arguing two things in your brief.
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,1744.987,1745.948,--That is correct.
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1745.948,1747.709,"The latter is your position, isn't it?"
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,1747.709,1748.25,That's correct.
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1748.25,1749.749,And that's the global position.
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,1749.749,1750.6,That's the global position.
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1750.6,1765.27,"So, if we're not going to decide this as simply a case about the particular evidence going to this dry cleaning patent, then your position is we do have to decide it as globally as the circuit did."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,1765.27,1766.051,"Yes, sir."
1995.95-26,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1766.051,1771.014,Is that... suppose I thought this hypothetically.
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,1774.236,1778.019,"I'm not completely familiar with it, but I understand it."
1995.95-26,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1816.145,1778.019,All right.
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,1841.179,1853.588,"If that were my belief as to what the law would be, I would get there in this case by exactly the same route that the district judge did here."
1995.95-26,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1853.588,1856.85,The circuit seems to say it's never a question for the jury.
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,1864.294,1888.08,"It's difficult for me to consider because I... that's not my view of what the law is or ought to be, and it's a tough question for me to stand here and come up with an answer for you because I think that under this Court's decisions and under a proper Seventh Amendment analysis, this issue of what is the meaning of words, what's the definition of a term is a question of law for the court."
1995.95-26,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1896.167,1903.861,"Mr. Griffin, do I understand correctly that the division in the Federal circuit... they took this case en banc because they were internally divided."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,1903.861,1905.203,"That's what I understand, Your Honor."
1995.95-26,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1905.203,1911.297,"And one took the position that it's always for the jury, and one took the position that it's always for the court."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,1916.179,1919.001,"I did not see anything in between either, Your Honor."
1995.95-26,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1919.001,1924.104,No discretion left to the district judge.
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,1935.842,1942.007,"In none, and it would appear that the concurring judges would in some instances."
1995.95-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1976.32,1979.281,Then why do you ever hear evidence about it?
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,1979.281,1986.143,"Because sometimes, Your Honor, the court needs to go outside of those documents to learn about the meaning of terms."
1995.95-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2004.246,2012.211,"Well, why couldn't a fairly narrow instruction be submitted to the jury as to which of the... if there are two experts, as to which of the two experts you credit?"
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2012.211,2030.032,"I don't think it should get down to that, Your Honor, and I don't believe that it does get down to that because the question isn't one which is a typical issue of credibility of experts on the stand."
1995.95-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2031.454,2033.466,"Well, suppose in a particular case it is."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2052.429,2078.585,"--If there were such an instance, that would be a difficult question, sir, but I don't believe that when you look at the meaning of the term within the context of the patent, the claim, the prosecution history, and the information that's received, that you will get to a point where credibility determinations are going to be what a word means to a specific--"
1995.95-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2078.585,2086.63,"You know, they say figures don't lie, but liars do figure, and occasionally you do get experts whose credibility may be in doubt."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2086.63,2089.145,--I think that that is something that happens quite often.
1995.95-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2089.145,2092.217,Why shouldn't a question like that go to the jury?
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2092.217,2096.339,Because the issue is not... is one which is peculiarly for the judge.
1995.95-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2103.864,2112.97,"But why shouldn't it be a question of credibility of in-court testimony if the finder of fact, whether it's a judge or a jury, decides that one of the experts is simply lying?"
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2112.97,2128.369,"--That would be the same instance in a question of foreign law, sir, if there was one expert who was telling the court that the law of France meant one thing and another saying it meant the other."
1995.95-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2128.369,2133.874,"So, you see this as simply taken out of the normal factual review by a jury."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2137.495,2138.286,"Yes, sir."
1995.95-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2138.286,2147.763,"Mr. Griffin, I was surprised to hear you say that, you know, there were really significant... didn't you say earlier if there were a significant credibility problem, it would go to the jury?"
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2147.763,2150.203,I said... I was asked to assume that there might be.
1995.95-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2177.943,2182.828,"You... so... but were that the case, you'd be willing to entertain the notion that a jury would decide it."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2182.828,2183.075,No.
1995.95-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2184.057,2201.309,"I thought that was your position, and I thought one of the reasons you said it has to be left to the judge is that if you leave it to a jury, you can get divergent results as to the meaning of one patent all around the country and no court would be able to reverse it because it could be a reasonable determination either way, and so you would have to affirm the jury finding."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2201.309,2202.269,That's correct.
1995.95-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.269,2204.432,And you have a patent that has different meanings throughout the country.
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2204.432,2205.781,"Well, you would end up with a patent--"
1995.95-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2205.781,2214.197,"Whereas if the judge decides it, ultimately if it's a question of law for the judge, it can be established as the rule nationwide."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2214.197,2216.568,"--Be established as a rule and would be reviewed de novo, and that is--"
1995.95-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2216.568,2218.641,"Well, that is a very important factor it seems to me."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2218.641,2220.251,"--That is a policy reason... very much, sir."
1995.95-26,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2225.714,2237.403,What other cases are there in which you have experts with conflicting opinions called by both parties where the judge makes the decision?
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2242.737,2243.736,"Well, the best--"
1995.95-26,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2243.736,2246.678,"In the malpractice case, I think we all would agree that it goes to the jury."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2246.678,2254.384,"--The best analogies that I can think of... and I don't believe that analogies really control in Seventh Amendment analysis, Justice."
1995.95-26,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2258.186,2264.91,Which often can turn on credibility because the judge may not be able to read the language of the law.
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2277.609,2279.87,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1995.95-26,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2285.684,2286.826,"Well, let's put it this way."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2300.283,2313.173,"--That is, Justice, if those who draft patents don't comply with the requirements of section 112 to make them definite and to define the terms which they use."
1995.95-26,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2313.173,2321.196,Can you give me some idea of how often conflicting expert testimony is presented in a patent case on the issue of the meaning of the patent?
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2321.196,2331.204,"I cannot from my own experience, although I can tell you from the suggestions that have been made by the petitioner that it is an issue in virtually every case."
1995.95-26,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2331.204,2333.075,That's what I would have thought.
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2333.075,2335.677,The--
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2335.677,2337.66,"So, your... I want to make sure."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2347.157,2348.435,"--Well, it should be an issue--"
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2348.435,2350.246,Is that a fair summary of what you said?
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2350.246,2352.048,--That's one of the reasons why it should be an issue.
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2352.048,2352.499,All right.
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2400.4,2409.925,We argue that the distinction between patents and contracts is that the patent document is required by statute to be definite.
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2409.925,2411.537,"Well, it's supposed to be."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2411.537,2412.148,It's supposed to.
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2412.148,2415.378,"You know, statutes are supposed to be definite too, and they're frequently not."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2431.531,2459.988,"The real world question of how do you determine what they mean when you can't figure it out is exactly what the patent statute is supposed to guard against, which is that it should be a definite claim, that it should be concise, that it should enable one skilled in the art to understand the metes and bounds of the invention so the public can stay away from that monopoly if the public chooses or the public can license that--"
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2459.988,2473.638,"Well, I understand that, but we get into court because there is a dispute about what a phrase means or a sentence means or a word means, or at least there is a claim of a dispute about that."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2486.645,2496.633,"--Because a contract... with contract, the question is the subjective intent of the parties, and with a patent document, we're not dealing with a question of subjective intent."
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2498.563,2500.366,Isn't the claim a matter of subjective intent?
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2500.366,2502.506,--Not as far as the public is concerned.
1995.95-26,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2505.379,2511.262,Are you saying because it's the PTO's job before it accepts the statement?
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2525.281,2525.741,--Yes.
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2531.665,2537.311,"So, it seems to me that your second reason, if you will, is basically a variant on the first reason."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2574.967,2575.467,That is correct.
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2575.467,2583.843,"In other words, your... so, your first argument for uniformity is buttressed by, in effect, what you say is the intent of the patent statute and that is to provide some uniformity."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2588.155,2589.086,That is correct.
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2589.086,2589.657,"Yes, okay."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2601.364,2608.807,"I think that is a result of patent practice, Mr. Chief Justice, and I don't think it should be the practice."
1995.95-26,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2608.807,2615.062,"How do you distinguish the questions of non-obviousness, enablement?"
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2621.507,2636.698,If I can recall the question of... non-obviousness I believe is a question... my mind is... I don't know the answers.
1995.95-26,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2636.698,2654.419,"Because that's... one of the concerns is if you could narrow what the Federal circuit has done to the question of how do you read a term of the fact... of the claim when the overall scope of the claim is for the court, that's one thing."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2660.694,2670.822,"If we got to a question of what is the patent anticipated by prior art, that would be a question of fact."
1995.95-26,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2678.535,2686.392,"But if the question is what does the term mean to someone ordinarily skilled in the art, okay, why shouldn't the obviousness question go the same way?"
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2693.946,2707.995,"--The issue would be what does the patent claim mean, and then with the other evidence of obviousness it becomes a question then of what... would it have been obvious to one skilled in the art."
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2710.726,2711.117,Excuse me.
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2718.954,2719.853,--That's correct.
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2719.853,2722.924,"However, if you do leave it open to jury findings, what happens to uniformity?"
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2745.49,2748.423,"If the only argument is the uniformity argument, that is correct."
1995.95-26,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2748.423,2755.106,But can you distinguish this question of what does the term in the claim mean from non-obviousness as one?
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2761.981,2769.216,"Well, enablement I believe today is treated as a question of law."
1995.95-26,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2776.66,2780.633,What is the precedent that tells us that today it's treated as a question of law?
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2780.633,2785.446,"--I believe that that is the holding of the cases, and I don't have them with me--"
1995.95-26,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2785.446,2787.178,How is that consistent with the Seventh Amendment?
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2790.238,2830.696,"--That would get me back to the... the Seventh Amendment analysis here, that is... is one of whether... we start with the proposition that this is a case which is tried to a jury, and so this Court's historic analysis and the cases, the so-called law equity cases, that the Court has dealt with in determining whether a jury trial itself is applicable is not necessarily determinative in a case where there is a jury trial of what issues will be eventually given to the jury and what issues will be reserved for the judge."
1995.95-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2867.32,2871.054,--That sounds like a very strange interpretation of the Seventh Amendment to me.
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2881.032,2897.621,--Congress could and Congress in the patent setting could enact a statute which says that the... all questions of patent infringement or validity are to be tried by an Article I court and that would not violate the Seventh Amendment.
1995.95-26,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2897.621,2914.644,"Didn't the Seventh... I mean, if you go back to the English practice, my impression in reading this... but you know it better and will correct me... is that questions like originality or non-obviousness, et cetera, were quite close if they weren't directly the kinds of things that they did leave to a jury."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2914.644,2916.014,That's correct.
1995.95-26,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2923.891,2916.014,Is that right?
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2925.331,2926.673,I do not believe so.
1995.95-26,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2926.673,2938.56,"But is it the case that for you to win this case, we also have to decide the question of whether originality, et cetera, or non-obviousness is for a judge or a jury?"
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2938.56,2939.051,No.
1995.95-26,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2939.051,2939.882,Why not?
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2939.882,2947.937,Because the issue that's presented in this case is the question of whether the interpretation of the meaning of the words used in the patent claim--
1995.95-26,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2947.937,2948.267,Yes.
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2948.267,2949.139,--is appropriately--
1995.95-26,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2949.139,2952.481,And how do you distinguish it from all those other issues which probably were sent to the jury?
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,2952.481,2963.741,"--Because, well, in the first instance the juries in common law England were not asked to interpret the words of a patent, and that was for practical reasons as well as legal reasons."
1995.95-26,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3001.286,3010.413,"So, what we'd like to find is someone who once went to an English judge in 1780 and said, judge, you're supposed to decide whether this document before you is non-obvious."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,3021.949,3024.52,--I did not see anything like that.
1995.95-26,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3024.52,3031.624,Could you give a sensible reason why you would put these things on different sides of the line?
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,3031.624,3032.755,No.
1995.95-26,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3032.755,3038.73,Wasn't that a major concern here that you've got something that is an action at law?
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,3048.537,3062.015,I don't believe that that is a valid concern because the Federal circuit has taught us that there are a number of issues that are to be left to the jury.
1995.95-26,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3078.147,3080.558,I thought that at least everybody in the Federal circuit agreed that there is.
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,3090.385,3090.816,That's correct.
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3153.625,3157.599,"Let me ask you another analogy question, and I should have done it before but I didn't think of it."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,3286.446,3286.867,No.
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3289.528,3291.338,Would you explain that?
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,3295.673,3313.935,--I think it is a weak analogy because the question of what a specific term used in a contract to the requisite community which is skilled in that is something which does not exist except for the patent documents themselves which frame the--
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3313.935,3318.419,"Yes, you wouldn't use the term if you weren't writing a patent."
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,3318.419,3320.09,--And it frames the inquiry.
1995.95-26,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3354.771,3355.281,Well--
1995.95-26,1,23982,frank_h_griffin_iii,,3355.281,3356.103,--from the four corners.
1995.95-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3356.103,3358.074,"--Thank you, Mr. Griffin."
1995.95-26,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3360.638,3363.419,Quickly then.
1995.95-26,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3453.121,3453.581,"Well, surely--"
1995.95-26,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3453.581,3454.51,It would be held invalid.
1995.95-26,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3454.51,3456.804,--Surely there's a separate issue of whether there has been an infringement or not.
1995.95-26,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3468.231,3469.991,That still could be the case but it's more theoretical than real.
1995.95-26,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3478.358,3478.889,It seems to me a big question.
1995.95-26,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3480.972,3486.435,"--In most cases, I would suggest, Your Honor, that there is very little left."
1995.95-26,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3486.435,3492.53,"That's just like saying the contracts case is over once the court tells the jury what the contract means, and thereafter there's nothing left."
1995.95-26,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3496.142,3506.257,"There's a lot more left in a contract case, Your Honor, but it isn't the same thing in a jury case where the term analysis, what does that cover?"
1995.95-26,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3514.292,3515.413,"Thank you, Mr. Mallin."
