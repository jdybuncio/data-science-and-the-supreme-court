1974.73-1446,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,47.682,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1446, Roe and others against Doe."
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,49.748,55.245,Mr. Chief Justice may I please the Court.
1974.73-1446,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,92.446,100.71,Is that conceded that the usual steps were taken?
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,100.71,109.961,"It is conceded that that is what was held by the justice presiding its special term in New York county, Mr. Justice Silverman and its set forth of page 883 in the record, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1974.73-1446,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,109.961,118.363,Where in the appendix do we find that or is it there?
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,118.363,122.284,"The words appear at 883, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-1446,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,314.416,318.335,Is that a trial on the preliminary or in the permanent too?
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,318.335,325.584,"On a permanent injunction, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I presume is an injunction f a trial and they're all the rights, which would normally take place on the trial."
1974.73-1446,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,325.584,330.262,"But the preliminary you can hear on affidavit, you can hear just on the affidavit?"
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,330.262,335.838,That is correct Mr. Justice Rehnquist and that is what happened in this case and that is indeed is the usual practice in New York.
1974.73-1446,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,516.813,537.996,"This actual representations that you're making Mr. Karpatkin, are you thereby implying if there had been identification, the publication of this book could have been enjoined?"
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,537.996,539.9,No court has ever so held.
1974.73-1446,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,539.9,540.439,"Well, what's you're --"
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,540.439,561.265,"Mr. Justice Stewart, my submission is that if there would be a complete and total identification such as for example, if the identifying information in the Kinsey Institute of Sex Research files were suddenly to be made public."
1974.73-1446,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,574.667,595.386,"Or let's you got the idea of writing a book, does the secrets of my clients, and wrote it up and had it printed, do the publication of such a book being enjoined if you identified all your clients, disclosed all their incompetencies, they have reposed in you?"
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,595.386,609.232,If there was a sufficient identification in breached of a professional attorney-client relationship where in fact that identification have been established and where in fact it was not consent.
1974.73-1446,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,613.963,619.58,"And nothing in the constitution at least would prevent the injunction of a publication of such a book, that hypothetical book?"
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,619.58,619.867,We do --
1974.73-1446,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,619.867,620.945,Why hypothetical book?
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,620.945,623.7,"Yes, we do not maintain, Mr. Justice Stewart as --"
1974.73-1446,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,623.7,632.218,"It's not say that the plaintiff won't have any constitutional right to have the book going but that would be up to the state, wouldn't it?"
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,632.218,645.08,"It would be up to the state, your Honor, but it would be subject to any cause, any underlying cause of action being subject to constitutional limitations which would not impermissibly infringe on first -- guarantees."
1974.73-1446,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,645.08,680.327,"My hypothetical case of these authors, actually it is closing conceitedly disclosing the identity and thereby violating the confidences of their patients or in the attorney of hypothetical case of view the author of the book, the secrets of the clients of the lawyer's lifetime, you would concede that there's nothing in the constitution that would prevent a state from enjoining the publication of such a book, if the state shows to do so, would you?"
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,680.327,682.633,I would say that it would have to meet all of the standards with this --
1974.73-1446,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,682.633,684.229,"Well, what would meet then?"
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,685.022,688.723,"The procedural standards, Mr. Justice Stewart which this Court has said, must be met --"
1974.73-1446,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,688.723,694.294,"Well, let's say after a full hearing, this was found."
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,694.294,701.348,I would agree with you your Honor's hypothetical suggestion that it would be within the power of the state to --
1974.73-1446,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,701.348,705.94,I thought that the command of the first amendment was in terms absolute.
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,705.94,709.714,The command of the first amendment Mr. Justice Douglas is in terms absolutely.
1974.73-1446,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,709.714,717.133,"So, you're talking about a water down version of that -- it has been adopted by a constitutional convention, assembled here today?"
1974.73-1446,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,717.133,721.537,That was the First Amendment directs itself to Congress and we're not dealing it with literally.
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,723.98,732.531,"For purposes of my argument, Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Stewart, I must take the First Amendment as it comes to me in decisions of this Court beginning with Near against Minnesota."
1974.73-1446,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,732.531,737.885,Seeking would make it applicable to the States?
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,737.885,742.81,"Again, I would have to say that in Near against Minnesota this Court sat down."
1974.73-1446,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,774.427,795.211,"Mr. Karpartkin, is there any rule of New York practice that would have prevented you or the respondents for that matter, while you are appealing the preliminary injunction up to the New York appellate system from asking the case to come on for hearing on the final injunction before the Supreme Court?"
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,795.211,804.612,"No, there is no such rule and indeed the justice its special term and the appellate division indicated that either party or both parties could apply for a preference of the trial if they wish."
1974.73-1446,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,804.612,809.882,"Well, why didn't you do that, if you are concern about getting the book on the street service?"
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,809.882,816.038,"Because of the unique circumstances of this case, Mr. Justice Rehnquist was such."
1974.73-1446,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,852.194,858.693,Can't you get pretrial discovery in connection of the injunction action in New York?
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,858.693,871.208,"I would assume that the answer to that would have to be yes, but that would have to be under the direction of the justice to whom the application for preliminary injunction has made."
1974.73-1446,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,871.208,874.942,Do you think he would have granted it in this case?
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,874.942,884.391,"Again, I would have to speculate but obviously there was a great push on the part of my advisories for the quick as possible decision by the justice's special term."
1974.73-1446,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,884.391,885.649,"Well, I can see their point of view."
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,900.32,912.742,After having read the preliminary injunction what I might say was respect to the justice's special term the baseless preliminary injunction and opinions supporting it and the opinion of the appellate division.
1974.73-1446,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,927.179,934.376,In that connection I think in what you're saying would satisfy any requirement of finality for fair view.
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,934.376,964.715,"I think that's clear Mr. Justice Blackmun and under the decisions of this Court and I think that this Court has held that a decision of a State Court even though a nominally interrogatory, is final for purpose of Section 1257, if it concerns an important question of national policy and I believe that's precisely what this Court held in the Kiff case, and it's difficult to conceive of anymore important national policy I respectfully submit."
1974.73-1446,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,971.949,991.488,"Now, which way do you think the time factor works again in relation to the Kiff case, as I recall it in the Kiff case the temporary injunction have been in effect for about three years, here it's a little bit over one year."
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,991.488,997.578,"I would say yes your Honor, it's a year and five months."
1974.73-1446,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1008.165,1031.746,"As same question that Mr. Justice Rehnquist is passing to you, whether you have a final judgment in the Kiff case, I think the Court took on pains to say or indicate that temporary injunction having continued for three years that was reasonable, so that was quite permanent."
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1031.746,1052.213,"I think it is deeply reasonable to assume Mr. Chief Justice, then the light of the opinion on special term the unanimous decision of the appellate division, the unanimous decision of the Court of Appeals that it would be most unlikely are in the Court, rather this Court, to have dissolve the injunction before the case have gone its way."
1974.73-1446,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1052.213,1076.417,"May I attend to what Mr. Justice Stewart's question or questions, let's assume for the moment that your clients on that day, patient's identity had been disclosed clearly unequivocal in this book, would you be here today in that situation?"
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1076.417,1080.405,I do not think I would be here today to answer your question Mr. Justice Powell.
1974.73-1446,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1080.405,1089.722,"In other words, it's a basis of your case, that as matter of fact the patient's identity was not revealed in this book?"
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1089.722,1125.004,"Well, I respectfully submit that my argument is more than that, it is not just that as a matter of fact but its that as a matter of law, a prior restraint preliminary injunction cannot be entered on the basis of a record which has as deficient as this record is, and that any underlying cause of action whatever it is and I doubt if anyone can read the mélange of opinions from special term and from the appellate division and ascertain what the cause of action was suppose to be."
1974.73-1446,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1152.567,1168.675,"But that's under rule, that's under the federals rules as civil procedure, we're administrating a very explicit system of rules, over courts which we have supervisory authority, but we don't have supervisors there over the New York Courts."
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1168.675,1183.466,"That is of course correct Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I think it is possible to at least see some due process laws or some notions of due process laws at least in some of the words of Mr. Justice Roberts in Mayo against Canning Company."
1974.73-1446,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1226.844,1262.042,"I wonder, back in response to Mr. Justice Stewart you indicated that under that thing and the attorneys example he gave that there state would have power who in such injunction, was that answer based on the reach of the confidential relationship that was inherit in Mr. Justice Stewart's questions or was it the nature of the disclosure, so that would be upon fully aside from whether they would have reach any confidential initiative?"
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1262.042,1282.689,"I don't wish to be vague in answer to your question Mr. Justice White but all that I can say is that learning amicus representing the American Psychiatric Associations and two other world organizations have postulated five different possible theories of liability, and said that it's unclear which of them or which combinations of them would be involved."
1974.73-1446,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1282.689,1290.439,"Well, you gave-- you answered Mr. Justice Stewart however, I wondered what's basis was?"
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1290.439,1317.912,"I would suppose that it would be possible for a State Court to formulate a standard of liability based on the breach of the confidential relationship between a professional person and someone coming to see the professional person, assuming that all of the standards have been met and that all of the procedural necessities have been met."
1974.73-1446,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1317.912,1335.748,"Well, if the state might assert a variety of interest or maybe the same interest expressed a variety of ways one like the breach for confidential relationship, another way of perhaps putting the same thing as the violation of an implied contract."
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1403.09,1406.91,"Well, I submit that those are the issues which are in the case --"
1974.73-1446,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1406.91,1419.485,"But the state interest—it's not for us to say what the ground the state might put as centers now, that's not a constitutional question, the question is does the constitution permit the state from enjoining the publication?"
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1419.485,1428.228,My advisory has suggested in this brief and that there might be a constitutional right of privacy which we justify and action by the --
1974.73-1446,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1428.228,1434.204,"-- it's a state cause of action under the state tort law, isn't it?"
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1434.204,1446.539,But as -- that is the way the cause of actions is played Mr. Justice Stewart but to indicate the difficulties and attempting to comprehend what happened in the State Courts of New York.
1974.73-1446,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1461.39,1469.222,Was it suppose to little early to expect that read Mr. Justice Stewart's opinion in the case that came down this morning or perhaps you did --
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1469.222,1470.839,"I was able to glance at it, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-1446,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1470.839,1473.055,You read that during lunch hour.
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1489.271,1511.295,The Kent Roe case Mr. Chief Justice turns on one of the recognized subdivisions which has been establish in the state law of many states and I believe appears in the reinstatement of the false light notion of a cause of actions for privacy violation.
1974.73-1446,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1538.469,1544.445,You said we don't even have to consider that question because in this case the Court follow time --
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1544.445,1545.954,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart and we urge --"
1974.73-1446,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1545.954,1548.529,Or you read it essentially correct I mean.
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1548.529,1570.493,Thank you and we urge that the standard of Time against Hill which is the only occasion when this Court posited a standard of liability in the case of a confrontation between an alleged violation of right or privacy and the First Amendment is the only standard which is applicable here.
1974.73-1446,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1570.493,1578.637,"Well, your case is stronger too, is it because here you were enjoined and then 2614 was an action for damage, and it Time against Hill it was action for damage."
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1578.637,1583.655,"Yes of course, but I do agree that the case is stronger but --"
1974.73-1446,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1583.655,1587.056,Don't overlook the --
1974.73-1446,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,1587.056,1591.547,"I -- I've not overlooked it, Mr. Justice Douglas."
1974.73-1446,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1643.348,1650.893,Very well.
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,1653.708,1658.247,Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.
1974.73-1446,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1832.004,1839.799,"Do you disagree with that challenge that figure 3,000 volumes copies of the book come in than published?"
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,1839.799,1846.326,"I don't know your Honor, I think as the statement made by the psychiatrist here and we have no --"
1974.73-1446,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1846.326,1847.567,Do you have that in the record?
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,1847.567,1847.914,Pardon me.
1974.73-1446,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1847.914,1849.725,Isn't that in the record?
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,1849.725,1870.444,"Oh, it's a statement made which we haven't verified as yet, and I'm going to come to this question of the status of the case and why we are so little advance and why a year and half had past since the preliminary injunction was granted."
1974.73-1446,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1989.167,1997.119,"Under New York law did the trial Court not lose jurisdiction, and some hasn't appeared in this file?"
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,1997.119,1999.754,"Well, retain jurisdiction of the case you Honor."
1974.73-1446,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1999.754,2007.407,"Well, but who's jurisdiction in the sense of being able to do anything about it without leaving the Appellate Court?"
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2007.407,2015.06,I think it would have been necessary to apply to the Appellate Court for stay but those stays are automatically granted.
1974.73-1446,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2162.128,2164.282,Why are you making this argument?
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2164.282,2173.623,"I wanted to show that there's a factor of base for identification because Mr. Karpatkin and says if there is identification, then there is an end to the matter."
1974.73-1446,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2173.623,2189.673,"What do we do with this--how do you characterize this statement of the special term, where the judge says, “I think these steps reasonably meet the usual standards for such disguising of the patient's identities.”"
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2189.673,2197.326,"Mr. Karpatkin failed to indicate that that was modified by the appellate division, and it's no longer a holding that --"
1974.73-1446,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2197.326,2207.435,You think it was modified by the statement which characterize the publisher acts has an attempt to disguise her identity?
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2207.435,2218.966,"No, it what it says that the claim justification for publication, the attempt to disguise her identity does not provides sufficiently valid --"
1974.73-1446,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2218.966,2228.415,"Well, that maybe so but do you think that is appellate position's rejection of this factual?"
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2228.415,2235.72,I think so but I think we can go great deal further your Honor and say that it is a matter of law.
1974.73-1446,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2235.72,2242.786,"Oh, I know but on that basis, this just becomes a fact bound case that may not --"
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2242.786,2243.744,Certainly not.
1974.73-1446,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2243.744,2245.421,Interest a lot of people.
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2245.421,2245.9,May I --
1974.73-1446,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2245.9,2262.6,"Your suggesting, I'm just -- are you -- Let us assume for the moment that we accept the finding of the special term, I guess that's the finding that this meets the usual standards for disguising identity."
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2262.6,2273.726,May I say your Honor that as I understand the law you should not and may I expand on that for just a moment of does your Honor have some other question?
1974.73-1446,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2273.726,2290.071,"No, you go ahead but you might get back to telling me at some point what if we do except that finding in the special term, what happens to your case if anything?"
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2290.071,2293.664,"Well, I still think we have a cause action your Honor."
1974.73-1446,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2295.82,2298.368,So did both of the lower courts.
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2298.368,2301.101,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1446,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2312.526,2340.898,"When I -- Mr. Karpatkin, the question that you just referred to whether or not he conceded it if after full due process procedures there were a finding that this book did identify your client and did disclose and publicize the confidentiaries repose by your client and the defendant authors of the book."
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2369.741,2370.28,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1446,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2392.832,2395.606,"Disclosure implies identification, doesn't it?"
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2395.606,2408.181,"No, no, no, I don't think so your Honor, I think that the cause of action exist and I think that the cause of the action exist just by the publication because the patient has been injured by that publication."
1974.73-1446,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2408.181,2424.007,"Now, that wasn't my question, my question wasn't whether or not a cause of action might exist in—under the statute or common law in New York, but whether or not such a cause of action could constitutionally exist if there were no identification whatsoever of your client."
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2424.007,2426.51,"Again, the answer I believe --"
1974.73-1446,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2426.51,2434.702,"And the answer isn't that New York gives this cause of action, because the question does not have to do with the law of New York it has to do with the constitution of the United States."
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2434.702,2446.771,As I understand the First Amendment it applies to speech but where conduct is prohibited by a lawful statute.
1974.73-1446,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2478.005,2482.412,"Well, here the conduct is writing and publishing a book is that conduct?"
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2484.987,2490.915,The conduct is the disclosure of the patient's secrets.
1974.73-1446,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2505.035,2512.688,My hypothetical case was one which there was no violation of any confidences because there was no disclosure.
1974.73-1446,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2547.572,2564.2,"You are saying in effect to the actively publishing of this book, or I'll put it as a question, are you saying that the act of publishing this book was the same as taking all of these notes and files, and putting them in the public library where everybody could look at them."
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2564.2,2565.578,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1974.73-1446,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2565.578,2568.195,"That's your thesis, that is conduct not reference."
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2568.195,2570.53,"Yes, Your honor."
1974.73-1446,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2578.611,2584.599,"Now, if you were right, then this means that there could be no publications of this nature by any psychiatric authority?"
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2584.599,2587.953,"Of this particular nature, I think not your Honor."
1974.73-1446,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2587.953,2589.737,By any psychiatric authority.
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2589.737,2590.995,Not without the agreement --
1974.73-1446,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2590.995,2601.938,"That Freud himself could have published what he did published, because he did to his very level best to obliterate any identification or identity."
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2609.343,2610.708,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1974.73-1446,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2610.708,2611.906,Well then I misunderstood you.
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2611.906,2635.779,"I've quoted Dr. Freud to the effect that no matter what happens, one must not do anything to betray the patient, and if one is faced with the necessity of not publishing or betraying the patient one does not publish."
1974.73-1446,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2763.913,2781.419,"It seems to me that special term may have found I have suggested, but it went on to say that it didn't think that this disclosure would really identify plaintiff as the patient to someone who did not already know that plaintiff was a patient."
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2787.452,2788.039,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1446,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2791.44,2802.327,"And they might be able to identify the patient through some of these events, but they certainly wouldn't know everything that was disclosed."
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2809.74,2816.686,"We, we, we could Your Honor but we can go very much further because we say that the patient --"
1974.73-1446,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2816.686,2826.422,"Why you -- I don't know, why you don't stop there for at least, but just to say that that is--you should be able to win your case on that --"
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2826.422,2847.424,"I think we do Your Honor on that alone, but it does go much further and may I just speak once again for a moment about this statutory presumption that the identification was found and that the Court of Appeals is bound by that."
1974.73-1446,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2942.949,2962.291,"Mr. London, before you leave that, I'm puzzled about your explanation of New York practice because I'm trying to agree with what I think is Mr. Justice White's view that the special term found the issue of disguising against you --"
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2962.291,2965.36,I'm just trying to say you find it my favor.
1974.73-1446,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2965.36,2974.33,Well partially implied -- applied there was identification for perhaps with respect with anybody else.
1974.73-1446,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2974.33,2985.588,"Okay, well -- now is it your position that it's that finding that is controlling on us or that's something more favorable of you -- wait, wait till I finish my question."
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2985.588,2986.474,I'm sorry.
1974.73-1446,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2986.474,2993.95,Or that something more favorable to you happened in the appellate division and then if that finding that's binding us.
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,2993.95,2999.111,I think it is the much more favorable finding that is binding upon --
1974.73-1446,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2999.111,3003.329,And that's in the opinion of the appellate division?
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,3003.329,3004.562,"No, no."
1974.73-1446,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3041.919,3051.721,"Well, let me again, give you this example, supposing that the special term had refused an injunction and specifically found there was no irreparable injury."
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,3071.745,3079.064,"No, Your Honor, because Your Honors assuming a situation which I would representing the appellant."
1974.73-1446,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3159.185,3168.195,What aspect -- fact finding why this case comes to us based on what you find in the special term and the appellant division opinion.
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,3168.195,3169.321,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1446,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3169.904,3174.727,"No, I mean what -- how does the case come to us with respect to the facts?"
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,3174.727,3186.045,"The case comes to you as to the facts with the appellate division opinion, which modified the court at special term and in addition --"
1974.73-1446,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3186.045,3192.616,"Well, summarize, just for me, what is the fact finding with respect to identification?"
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,3192.616,3210.232,"The fact finding with respect to identification is that the patient was readily identifiable from the text of the book and anyone who knew the patient, although the name did not appear in the book would immediately know that she was the subject to the book."
1974.73-1446,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3210.232,3212.241,Now that's the extent of it?
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,3212.241,3218.397,That is the extent of it and no less Your Honor.
1974.73-1446,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3218.397,3229.142,I take it that you are arguing from that this would mean her identity would be widely known in the psychiatric circles.
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,3229.142,3238.51,Widely known and certainly in any people who knew her and who knew the events of her life.
1974.73-1446,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3238.51,3251.124,"Specifically that group if she was identifiable to some psychiatrist it would readily expand, I take it that's part of your case."
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,3251.124,3266.272,"Well, that would be it but it would be known I think to anybody who knew that her husband was a man who began to practice the law at the age of 50 and prior at that time had been a speech writer and that she had a son that was a musical prodigy."
1974.73-1446,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3270.011,3274.602,Mr. London gets me back to basics here.
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,3296.193,3305.157,"I don't see that we have a final judgment Your Honor, but I think this comes within the exception that case law has made."
1974.73-1446,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3308.331,3318.798,"Well, It seems to me all these question are asked because of something must done a -- than what we would have after a full trial."
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,3318.798,3319.277,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1446,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3337.948,3341.062,"How is it by stipulation either, isn't it?"
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,3369.014,3369.373,"Oh, no."
1974.73-1446,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3373.206,3379.048,"As you say you've been actively engaged on it until a week ago, wasn't that it?"
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,3379.048,3379.707,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1446,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3393.647,3401.839,"Yes, to this supplement, you're in respond to the reply brief."
1974.73-1446,1,22639,ephraim_s_london,,3401.839,3411.567,I would just like to add one word with respect to the procedures that are followed before preliminary injunction is granted.
1974.73-1446,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3522.168,3524.623,"Thank you, Mr. London."
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3529.24,3530.696,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-1446,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3591.429,3603.573,"Mr. Karpatkin, it seems to me that you have said at least that whether there's identification or not, it's a rather important fact in arriving at some resolution of the case."
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3603.573,3604.339,Absolutely.
1974.73-1446,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3604.339,3620.567,"And if it's awfully hard to tell what the facts are from the opinions as the case comes to us, if it's rather hard to grapple with some legal issues."
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3620.567,3624.519,"I do not say that it is awfully hard to tell, what I do say that it is impossible --"
1974.73-1446,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3624.519,3637.004,"Well, I know, but at least special term did not find that your client or that the plaintiff could not be identified them on prints."
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3637.004,3641.675,"Sir, special term did not find that the plaintiff could be identified by anyone Your Honor."
1974.73-1446,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3641.675,3642.202,"Oh, I know."
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3642.426,3644.406,You can't find a law in there which even hits that.
1974.73-1446,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3644.406,3657.867,I know but special term did indicate that the normal precautions to avoid identification --
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3657.867,3658.664,Had been taken.
1974.73-1446,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3658.664,3659.424,That's right.
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3659.424,3661.149,"That it had been taken, that's right."
1974.73-1446,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3662.754,3664.778,"Well, but then you went beyond that."
1974.73-1446,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3664.778,3665.664,You went beyond that.
1974.73-1446,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3665.664,3673.933,You went beyond that and qualified to this finding and let's assume hypothetically that you went to trial on that permanent injunction.
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3688.505,3689.164,The fact is Mr. Chief Justice --
1974.73-1446,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3689.164,3690.948,"Now, what you have then?"
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3690.948,3692.326,That Mr. London had three months.
1974.73-1446,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3698.542,3703.593,You don't always try a permanent injunction on that matter of affidavits do you?
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3703.593,3707.593,"In that is the customary, if not the required practice."
1974.73-1446,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3707.593,3708.371,Not always though.
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3708.371,3709.629,The preliminary injunctions in New York.
1974.73-1446,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3709.629,3710.875,I'm speaking of permanent injunction.
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3710.875,3711.522,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1446,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3712.468,3719.847,"If he could, he would be, and he certainly could not be denied the opportunity to bring him 25 witnesses could he?"
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3719.847,3721.943,"Of course not, Mr. Chief Justice --"
1974.73-1446,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3721.943,3731.237,"Let's assume that though, for all the assumption that the 25 witnesses said yes, I read this book and never heard about it before Mr. London asked me who he is."
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3739.604,3750.922,"I assume that these witnesses would be subjective to cross examination of course, and I presume that the trial of the facts would have an opportunity to evaluate this --"
1974.73-1446,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3750.922,3767.389,"As Mr. Justice White has suggested presumably make some findings of fact and then we wouldn't engage in this extensive cross examination that both of you gentlemen to try to find out some of these things, would we, if we need to?"
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3767.389,3777.928,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would say that your argument follows completely if this were not the case --"
1974.73-1446,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3777.928,3779.485,Question maybe
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3779.485,3781.162,Prior -- I beg your pardon.
1974.73-1446,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3801.273,3805.419,Whose burden was it to hurry that case on for trial?
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3808.146,3810.319,"Mr. Chief Justice, yes it certainly was."
1974.73-1446,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3826.175,3832.542,Were any request for a stay of the injunction turned down or pending to you?
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3832.542,3835.744,"No application was made by me for a stay of the injunction, because --"
1974.73-1446,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3835.744,3837.759,And you didn't make any here?
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3837.759,3844.966,"No Mr. Justice White, but we did go to the appellate division on to the Court of Appeals on an expedited preferred schedule."
1974.73-1446,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3844.966,3868.144,"I take it if one your possible arguments would mean that unless and until the plaintiff who brought this suit convinces a Court to make the kind of findings that would work a prior restraint, that there shouldn't be a prior restraint pending in appeal."
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3868.144,3870.235,"Certainly, unless the findings have been made, yes Your Honor."
1974.73-1446,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3870.235,3872.547,But you haven't asked for any stay of--
1974.73-1446,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3872.547,3881.619,"No, I have not asked for a stay, I have relied on seeking appeals on the merits as quickly as possible."
1974.73-1446,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3882.897,3883.529,"Thank you, gentlemen."
