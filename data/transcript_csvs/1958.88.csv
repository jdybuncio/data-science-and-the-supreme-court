1958.88,0,23739,fred_h_caplan,,33.048,38.787,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,3631.345,3635.827,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court."
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3705.646,3721.449,"There's -- I want to know, there's an early case Ms. Graney, Cary and Curtis way back which allows administrative restraint for money going through that, is that still the law?"
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,3721.449,3722.384,I don't know about that case --
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3722.384,3724.669,(Voice Overlap) I think.
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,3724.669,3738.097,"-- but I do know that in 1926, a provision was specifically inserted in the revenue laws to permit the enforcement of levies when the property was held by third persons, and that is the statute."
1958.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3909.354,3912.58,"Before you proceed Ms. Graney, may I ask you one question."
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,3930.0,3931.112,"No, Your Honor."
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4021.401,4030.25,"Well, the number of instances, Ms. Graney, which this Court have held that a state is a person, the Safety Appliance Act and so on."
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4054.189,4054.739,Yes.
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4054.739,4056.61,It was -- has not been the approach in the cases.
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4056.61,4057.15,Yes.
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4057.907,4076.615,"Now -- so that -- so that the burden really rests on West Virginia or any other State that the bar of this Court will say, there are reasons that would negative the purpose of that statute for the inclusion of the state as a person is that their way of putting the problem?"
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4076.615,4078.27,I think so.
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4099.133,4100.846,You mean the general definition statute --
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4100.846,4101.424,Yes.
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4101.424,4102.314,-- or the Revenue Code.
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4104.076,4104.915,Revenue Code.
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4104.915,4107.912,The Revenue Code includes the definition of person?
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4107.912,4108.353,Yes.
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4108.353,4109.466,Would you mind giving it to us?
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4109.466,4114.028,"Section 7701, defines a person."
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4115.243,4116.554,(Inaudible)
1958.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4116.554,4118.961,What page?
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4118.961,4122.082,Page 23 in the footnote.
1958.88,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4122.082,4127.587,This suit is not based on the idea that the state is a person and it's not against a state.
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4127.587,4139.283,"No, it's not against a state but we have assumed that an agent of the state could not be held personally liable unless the principle were also subject to the statute."
1958.88,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4143.283,4149.5,(Inaudible) statute is not a private state without applying the (Inaudible)
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4149.5,4152.087,We think the statute applies to both.
1958.88,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4154.028,4159.651,But you're only -- what you have sustained here is the idea that applies to the auditor --
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4159.651,4160.39,Yes.
1958.88,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4160.39,4163.59,"-- not that it applies to the State, applies to the auditor."
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4163.59,4175.212,"Well, perhaps we have to show that it also applies to the principle, because Mr. Sims possession and obligation was as an agent of the State."
1958.88,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4184.569,4190.567,It's creates a little more problem to me for you to hold individually about it.
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4196.58,4199.504,"No, we have not preceded against the State."
1958.88,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4269.708,4272.507,(Inaudible)
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4272.507,4274.238,That's right.
1958.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4301.166,4309.92,"Ms. Graney, you -- you do have to put it in other words simply because the statutes doesn't cover Mr. Sim's literal points, doesn't it?"
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4309.92,4311.232,"No, specifically no."
1958.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4311.232,4312.691,Yes.
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4312.691,4320.334,"But here again, the word includes, Your Honor, should not be taken to mean to exclude other things --"
1958.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4320.334,4322.72,An exclusive definition.
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4322.72,4326.05,And of course --
1958.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4326.05,4333.744,Because you're -- you're not of course -- you're not -- are you contending that a state is a corporation?
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4333.744,4334.891,Not -- pardon?
1958.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4334.891,4336.916,It's not your argument that a state is a corporation.
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4336.916,4339.261,"Oh, no, no."
1958.88,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4365.675,4370.922,(Inaudible)
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4370.922,4377.091,"The pertinent Treasury Regulation, and that became effective January 1, 1955 --"
1958.88,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4377.091,4377.186,Although --
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4377.186,4379.903,-- prior to the levies here.
1958.88,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4380.328,4384.932,Any reason why so long (Inaudible)
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4384.932,4388.332,"No, except that the Treasury likes to be specific."
1958.88,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4388.332,4394.719,"No, I just wondered, the statute would -- had been applicable many years before 1955, isn't it?"
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4394.719,4406.552,"Yes, but I would also say that it did not become applicable to state employees until 1938 when this Court held that state employees were subject to the federal income tax."
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4484.255,4499.943,"Ms. Graney, could you please tell me why -- I think you do not make your problem more complicated than it needs to be, and -- and it could be specific."
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4611.71,4613.884,That's right.
1958.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4634.262,4637.727,(Inaudible)
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4637.727,4639.444,Yes.
1958.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4640.913,4649.518,"Yes, but as -- therefore, your argue -- your argument intend on showing that the state as a person, does it not?"
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4649.518,4650.698,In the final analysis because --
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4650.698,4652.898,But I don't see why you say that.
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4652.898,4654.874,"Well now, I may say this."
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4685.19,4688.969,(Voice Overlap) perfectly in getting at it.
1958.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4688.969,4700.13,"But the argumentation in your brief depends, does it, on (Inaudible) a state as a person, within --"
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4700.13,4700.65,Yes.
1958.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4707.387,4709.496,(Inaudible)
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4709.496,4713.245,If -- as the state as a principle and of Sims as an agent.
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4713.245,4719.044,I'm sure I have great respect to your brief but I don't think I can raise res judicata.
1958.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4719.044,4721.423,And that's also the argument (Inaudible)
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4721.423,4721.669,Yes.
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4721.669,4722.683,Yes.
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4724.219,4731.904,But the whole point is whether we're arguing more than we have to.
1958.88,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4735.189,4740.645,"Covered, (Inaudible) a person, do you think he's in possession of the property?"
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4740.645,4747.172,He is -- the person who is obligated with respect to the accrued salaries of the delinquent taxpayers.
1958.88,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4747.172,4751.594,But do you think -- do you think he's the person who's in possession of the property -- of properties?
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4751.594,4753.972,"Well, you can put it that way."
1958.88,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4754.961,4759.678,I'm not sure you can (Inaudible)
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4759.678,4763.028,The statute also says “or obligated with respect to”.
1958.88,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4763.028,4765.05,(Voice Overlap) not obligated.
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4776.236,4777.032,Principle.
1958.88,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4777.032,4780.083,The State of Virginia.
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4792.212,4801.146,"Well, I think the language in possession of or obligated with respect to is about as broad as it could be made in the circumstance of a statute of this nature."
1958.88,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4811.083,4827.385,"Well, if -- if that means with reference (Inaudible) that suppose an agent is the person who owes the debt, he's liable in his pretty broad interpretation of the statute."
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4827.385,4853.45,"Well, I think that interpretation is required by the definition of a person contained in subsection (c) and it's defined for the purposes of subsection (a) as including a person acting in a representative capacity, who as such officer, employee or member is under a duty to surrender the property."
1958.88,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4853.45,4864.227,"I don't -- I -- I don't think -- it seems to me like the statute (Inaudible) is on that property, isn't he?"
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4869.867,4870.342,Oh.
1958.88,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4870.342,4874.04,"Of course, he doesn't have any money particularly in his possession."
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4880.348,4886.718,Any person in possession of or obligated with respect to property or rights to property.
1958.88,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4894.305,4896.358,Of course the paper wouldn't -- the paper wouldn't be enough.
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4901.753,4906.445,"The State Auditor doesn't issue the warrants, the employee doesn't get paid."
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4912.859,4919.768,"I want to put it to you, obligated with respect to, obligated with respect to --"
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4919.768,4920.116,Property or properties.
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4920.116,4926.371,-- is not an actual phraseology to express if a man owes a debt.
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4926.371,4926.415,That's --
1958.88,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4926.415,4944.157,"If I go off to -- to ascertain, he should lie for the next two years, and (Inaudible) of a big bank, (Inaudible) a big concern and leaves money with the bank as a dispersing agent to pay my employees in my absence."
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4952.728,4952.901,That's right.
1958.88,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4952.901,4960.384,"And then, I suppose (Inaudible) obligation to local office with respect to the payments for these moneys for the employees."
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4960.384,4961.883,"Yes, he is the proper officer."
1958.88,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4963.291,4965.112,(Inaudible)

1958.88,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4967.349,4971.509,"But for these purposes, in the obligation with respect to --"
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4971.509,4972.613,We think so.
1958.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4972.749,4981.439,(Inaudible)
1958.88,1,35907,melva_m_graney,,4981.439,4983.822,There's just one other point I'd like to make.
1958.88,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5018.345,5020.278,Very well.
