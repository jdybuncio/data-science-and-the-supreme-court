1983.83-173,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,78.1,"Mr. Moskowitz, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,78.1,79.116,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1983.83-173,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,271.458,277.279,Did your client request that kind of consideration from Judge Roettger?
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,277.279,288.587,"In the colloquy back and forth... I didn't represent him in that proceeding, but in the colloquy back and forth, Justice Rehnquist, before Judge Roettger the government made some kind of statement about the pending case."
1983.83-173,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.212,328.497,And in your view that was not improper?
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,328.497,331.699,Improper in what way?
1983.83-173,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.699,334.484,For the judge not to consider it?
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,334.484,337.77,Under Williams v. New York he certainly could have considered it.
1983.83-173,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,347.541,350.843,But you concede that he could have considered it?
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,350.843,353.112,He could have considered it if he had chosen to.
1983.83-173,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,353.112,357.766,A pending charge or the facts behind the pending charge?
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,357.766,359.599,"Well, he could have, yes."
1983.83-173,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,359.599,363.253,And if he had would this case be a different case?
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,363.253,379.097,"This case probably, I am sure, would be a very different case because he certainly... his basis... I will get to that in a moment, but his basis for enhancing after the second trial was that I didn't consider it the first time around."
1983.83-173,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,391.237,393.856,Do you see something illogical about that?
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,393.856,396.908,That he didn't consider it?
1983.83-173,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,396.908,402.712,"That the first time, since it's only a charge, why the sentencing judge will not consider it."
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,413.603,417.472,"It's... based on the rationale behind Pearce, it's not illogical."
1983.83-173,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,418.405,419.257,It's not?
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,419.257,420.757,--It's not illogical.
1983.83-173,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,505.613,510.315,"Well, you're saying in effect that the judge only gets one bite at the apple."
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,530.061,530.728,No.
1983.83-173,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,533.43,541.536,"Well, what, then, is the inference that you want us to draw from saying that Judge Davis had already taken the mail fraud into consideration."
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,545.321,546.107,--That's right.
1983.83-173,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,553.976,570.472,"But that would be true of every single conviction that there ever was, I would think, for which a person was sentenced to anything, that the judge would have taken into consideration the nature of the charges upon which the jury returned a guilty verdict."
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,570.472,571.455,--Yes.
1983.83-173,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,571.455,587.434,And you're saying that that having happened another judge trying him for an independent offense cannot take into consideration the fact that he was convicted of a wholly independent charge in setting the sentence.
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,587.434,587.934,Not at all.
1983.83-173,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,607.661,610.697,"Well, the Pearce rule may be one thing."
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,626.309,627.392,Not at all.
1983.83-173,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,651.257,667.136,"But that doesn't answer the argument, I think, of whether in the passport violation charge at some point the... either the pending charge or the conviction for the mail fraud misdemeanor should be considered by the judge sentencing for the passport fraud."
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,676.491,677.507,"No, no."
1983.83-173,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,697.286,721.436,"No, I don't read Judge Markey's language in the Court of Appeals as suggesting that the defendant was complaining or that the state was complaining that the mail fraud would never be considered on the substance, but that so far as augmenting is concerned, first it was too early and then it was too late."
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,725.888,728.173,Except for the fact--
1983.83-173,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,728.173,729.773,"You're entitled to differ, obviously."
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,729.773,746.818,"--Except for the fact that under Pearce at the first go-around for Judge Roettger he chose not to consider it, and again I readily concede I think that he was right in choosing not to consider it at that time."
1983.83-173,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,746.818,748.67,Because it was not--
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,748.67,753.574,Because it had not... because it had not ripened into a conviction.
1983.83-173,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,754.624,760.794,"--In other words, he was giving the man the full benefit of the presumption of innocence, wasn't he?"
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,760.794,762.244,That's correct.
1983.83-173,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,762.244,776.088,But you then say later on he cannot take the conviction into account when the presumption of innocence has been merged and washed out by the conviction.
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,776.088,784.943,"Well, we are talking about in this particular case the language in Pearce and when that conduct occurred."
1983.83-173,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,814.029,816.981,What vindictiveness do you spell out here?
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,827.455,851.988,"--Pearce had a two-pronged holding, or two-pronged reason for its test: one, that we want to keep judges from being vindictive; and, two, we want defendants who when choosing to take an appeal should not be fearful of a judge coming back and being vindictive against him."
1983.83-173,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,851.988,853.94,Where do you see the vindictiveness here?
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,853.94,860.344,I don't think I necessarily have to see the vindictiveness.
1983.83-173,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,881.257,903.587,"So you think that the prophylactic nature of the Pearce rule is such that if at the initial trial the trial judge takes into effect those prior convictions shown on the rap sheet, he's got two, say, he's got two and he takes those into account."
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,932.19,934.558,It depends on--
1983.83-173,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,934.558,936.075,"Well, what could it depend on?"
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,936.075,938.594,--When the conduct that gave rise--
1983.83-173,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,938.594,946.532,"Well, the conduct has all happened before... all those convictions happened before his first conviction?"
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,946.532,949.567,"--Under the prophylactic rule in Pearce, yes."
1983.83-173,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,949.567,963.577,"So he may never, ever then have a sentence at the second trial that takes into account all of what would have been valid considerations at the first; is that--"
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,963.577,969.148,"That's true, except for the fact that it misses the point that the defendant is not escaping punishment."
1983.83-173,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,971.398,980.17,"--Well, he's escaping the punishment that could have validly been imposed on him at the first trial, except for some other trial error."
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,980.17,981.289,--Okay.
1983.83-173,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,983.089,983.908,Yes.
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,988.443,990.727,The prophylactic... well--
1983.83-173,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,990.727,1000.417,--Forbids at the second trial taking into account things that could have been taken into at the first trial but were erroneously excluded.
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1000.417,1001.4,--I read Pearce--
1983.83-173,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1001.4,1029.187,"Mr. Moskowitz, what is some event occurs after the first trial that's favorable to the defendant, for instance a prior conviction is reversed and set aside by an appellate court and so by the time of the retrial in your situation the sentencing judge after the retrial, can he consider the fact that now there is one less prior conviction?"
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1029.187,1030.637,--I certainly think he could.
1983.83-173,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1030.637,1032.304,"It helps the defendant, doesn't it?"
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1032.304,1033.404,"Certainly, certainly."
1983.83-173,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1033.404,1035.923,"Well, then why isn't the reverse true, too?"
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1038.542,1058.456,"Getting back to the reason behind the rule set out in Pearce, the reason, as this Court enunciated in Pearce and in prior... in subsequent opinions from Pearce was to take fear of vindictiveness out of the defendant's mind when he chooses whether he should take an appeal or not."
1983.83-173,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1058.456,1069.328,"Well, he ought to be able to be at peace with the knowledge that whatever happens afterwards the court can consider it, whether it helps him or hurts him... any event."
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1069.328,1071.43,"Whatever happens, whatever he does."
1983.83-173,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1071.43,1072.314,In any event.
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1072.314,1080.135,"The way I read Pearce is essentially it puts the ball, so to speak, in the defendant's lap."
1983.83-173,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1101.449,1114.125,"Well, of course, literally read in this case what was taken into account was something that happened after his first conviction."
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1127.85,1129.718,It certainly is an event.
1983.83-173,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1132.42,1133.77,It is conduct on his part.
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1133.77,1138.074,"Well, we come right down to the meaning of--"
1983.83-173,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.074,1138.691,Isn't it?
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1138.691,1141.776,"--We come right down to the meaning of the word ""conduct"" in Pearce."
1983.83-173,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1141.776,1152.25,"But if you read Pearce as trying to set up barriers to vindictiveness, how can you spell out any vindictiveness on the part of the judge here, possible vindictiveness?"
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1152.25,1166.658,"Well, if you'll... in the case, in the recent case in this Court of United States v. Goodwin, the Court pointed out how difficult it is to prove vindictiveness."
1983.83-173,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1195.66,1214.991,"I take it you then would also say Pearce would prevent the trial judge taking into account another conviction that occurred while the case was on appeal, based on conduct that was never known at all until after his first conviction?"
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1214.991,1215.958,Well--
1983.83-173,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1215.958,1223.264,Based on conduct that occurred prior to his first conviction but nobody'd ever heard of it when he was first convicted.
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1228.918,1231.87,"--Yes, with a qualification to your question."
1983.83-173,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.52,1292.174,"That may be barred by some principle, but not by Pearce."
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1292.174,1297.645,"--Well, I think it's an improper pyramiding."
1983.83-173,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1297.645,1338.222,"You're saying in effect that if your client, Mr. Wasman, is convicted of robbery in one court and a false impersonation in another court and the two cases go on pari passu and the jury returns a verdict of conviction on each count on the same day... let's assume that he was able to go to one court in the morning and one court in the afternoon and the court could schedule it that way... then neither judge or at least both judges could not take into consideration both the fact of the conviction returned in their court and augment it by taking into consideration the fact that another conviction against the man was returned in another court."
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1338.222,1340.122,Either one of them could.
1983.83-173,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1340.122,1341.924,"Well, that isn't Pearce, though, is it?"
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1344.209,1344.793,They could.
1983.83-173,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1345.443,1347.161,"Well, then what's your objection?"
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1353.982,1364.706,"Well, when I raised that before, Justice Rehnquist, was in response to the question about his having his cake and eating it, too."
1983.83-173,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1408.699,1430.149,"But the have your cake and eat it, too, argument is that in respect to this particular passport conviction that it shouldn't be allowed a defendant to say first it's too early to consider this charge because it hasn't ripened into a conviction, and then it comes around again now it's too late to consider it because you could have considered it before."
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1430.149,1435.017,"No, I think that certainly Judge Roettger had a right to consider it the first time around."
1983.83-173,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1547.273,1555.379,"But up to that time, the very instant of the nolo plea, he was clothed with the presumption of innocence, wasn't he?"
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1555.379,1559.248,"In the, what was originally the mail fraud case, yes, he was."
1983.83-173,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1559.248,1563.817,And that disappeared somewhat by the nolo plea.
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1563.817,1565.134,That's correct.
1983.83-173,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1618.052,1633.748,"On the contrary, his position, the judge's position, that he would not take it into account when it was only a charge, an indictment as distinguished from a conviction, suggests that he wasn't a judge that harbored vindictiveness, does it not?"
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1633.748,1636.398,"--At the time, no."
1983.83-173,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1695.785,1697.571,Let me ask this one question.
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1704.475,1705.041,No.
1983.83-173,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1705.041,1707.443,You don't attach any significance to the fact that it was just a nolo plea?
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1710.379,1715.033,I don't think it makes that much... this is more than just a nolo plea.
1983.83-173,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1735.161,1737.196,You'd make the same argument for a guilty plea?
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1737.196,1738.312,I think the case is--
1983.83-173,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1738.312,1743.533,"I asked you a while ago, and you did make the same argument based on a guilty plea."
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1743.533,1744.266,--Yes.
1983.83-173,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1750.456,1751.606,Or a conviction?
1983.83-173,0,31687,jay_r_moskowitz,,1751.606,1754.158,Or a jury?
1983.83-173,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1761.595,1763.764,Very well.
1983.83-173,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1767.466,1772.87,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-173,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2029.068,2031.001,"The term was ""events""."
1983.83-173,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2031.001,2036.572,"Well, I was going to get to that a little bit later, but there are two separate statements in Pearce."
1983.83-173,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.699,2174.88,Even though the... after that decision defendants might have a realistic fear of being sentenced to a longer sentence after appeal.
1983.83-173,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2174.88,2175.913,--That's right.
1983.83-173,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2548.906,2562.165,"Well, logically it's events and information not previously available that must have been in the minds of the Court in Pearce."
1983.83-173,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2562.165,2564.815,"Well, I--"
1983.83-173,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2564.815,2569.819,It wasn't intended to be a mechanical rule where you just touch a computer.
1983.83-173,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2582.377,2587.281,"--Well, I hope you're right, Mr. Chief Justice."
