1972.71-36,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,18.92,"-- now in number 71-36, California against LaRue."
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,20.609,24.298,Mr. Chief Justice and may please the Court.
1972.71-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,111.346,117.04,"How does this litigation arise, is it an action for a declaratory judgment and an injunction by the --"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,117.04,131.656,"By certain licensees, attack both in the State and the Federal courts in California the regulations on the basis that they were invalid is infringing upon the First Amendment rights that the --"
1972.71-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,131.656,133.318,The licenses were the plaintiffs though?
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,133.318,138.262,"Licensees and certain employees, dancers and some of the licensees were the plaintiffs."
1972.71-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,138.262,142.891,Asking for the declaratory judgment that these regulations are invalid?
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,142.891,143.908,Invalid and to enjoin.
1972.71-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,143.908,146.347,And to enjoin their enforcement?
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,146.347,147.219,That's correct.
1972.71-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,147.219,154.803,Has there been any license revocation proceedings against any of these plaintiffs?
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,154.803,165.053,The regulations become effective in number of days after their promulgation and enactment and placement in the California in the administrative code.
1972.71-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,183.549,193.687,"I wondered if there were Younger problem in this case, Younger against Harris, are you familiar with that case and it's companions?"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,193.687,198.358,"Not completely, there was no -- I am not familiar with it."
1972.71-36,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,198.358,207.036,Well you said the State Courts refused to what render either a declaratory injunction or a declaratory judgment or injunction relief?
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,207.036,212.671,"Yes, the action for declaratory relief and injunction was brought in the State courts."
1972.71-36,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,218.752,222.332,"When you say refuse, you mean dismissed the proceedings?"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,222.332,225.987,These were on petitions.
1972.71-36,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,249.8,252.955,And discretion was exercised against entertaining the proceedings?
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,252.955,253.546,Against entertaining --
1972.71-36,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,253.546,256.86,"And not appeal, that was sustained, is that?"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,256.86,270.044,The plaintiffs then went to California Supreme Court and our office requested that the State Supreme Court take the case and take the challenge and decide it.
1972.71-36,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,273.918,287.475,"Well, then I take it as the case is here so far as the action of three-judge, Federal Three-judge Court is concerned, there is no pending state proceeding and can be none because the state courts have refused entertainment, is that it?"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,287.475,289.553,That's correct.
1972.71-36,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,289.553,300.642,Mr. Porter do draw any inference whatsoever from the refusal of the California Courts to take these cases up?
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,300.642,303.314,Only one perhaps in all honesty.
1972.71-36,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,326.666,334.198,"I understand that they in effect invited the department to issue, who formulate regulations of this kind?"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,334.198,347.774,"That is correct, they were disturbed according to their decision by the fact that there was no evidence, there were no regulations, just a sterile stipulation that topless waitresses were employed."
1972.71-36,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,347.774,350.242,And so I repeat my other question.
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,358.769,376.413,"That perhaps they just had a case where there was no evidence in the record, no regulations involved and they did not want to take on a subsequent case in the absence of what they might thought was an absence of the evidentiary record."
1972.71-36,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,376.413,383.192,"You don't infer that the in the eyes of the State Courts, the regulations are perfectly valid?"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,383.192,385.485,"That's possible, I would not --"
1972.71-36,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,385.485,386.3,You would not draw that inference?
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,386.3,389.342,I will not draw that inference.
1972.71-36,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,389.342,395.635,"Mr. Porter, do you regard this case as essentially a licensing case or an obscenity case per se?"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,395.635,405.435,Licensing.
1972.71-36,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,660.07,670.582,"Mr. Porter, does your argument here, does it based it all on the Twenty-first Amendment, dealing with the state authority over regulation of alcoholic beverages?"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,670.582,705.872,"Based to the extent that if we are in our First Amendment area, then as far as balancing the state’s interest, we submit that both the traditional power that a state has had over the conditions surrounding the sale of alcoholic beverages and the power given to the states under the Twenty-first Amendment must be considered in balancing the state interest that these are substantial and important state interests, where we are talking about the condition surrounding the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages."
1972.71-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,716.835,722.753,"Well, it has been held at the Twenty-first Amendment -- has overrode a great deal of the Commerce Clause."
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,724.774,726.828,Well --
1972.71-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,726.828,731.731,And it does by its terms?
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,731.731,733.43,"That's correct, but I --"
1972.71-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,733.43,746.159,"And it has been held that the Twenty-first Amendment overrode a good deal of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, isn’t it, as was in the Young's case?"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,746.159,753.003,"Yes, but I would submit that I would myself attempt to temper that somewhat to the extent."
1972.71-36,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,797.106,801.363,"Well, I gather Mr. Porter, that one your part at least, there is alternative argument, isn't it?"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,804.842,809.39,That's correct.
1972.71-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,920.84,934.167,"Well, a murder might not be a speech I suppose we could agree that it isn't and yet the depiction of a murder in a movie or a play, simulated, certainly is protected by the First Amendment, isn't it?"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,934.167,957.655,"Yes, but here we are dealing with regulations that do not want the sexually oriented entertainment, whether it'd be on film or whether it'd be live and we're not looking at -- to the context."
1972.71-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,962.594,975.771,"Now I will take off fellow or take accomplished works, dramas through the ages, those are certainly protected by the First Amendment, aren't they?"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,975.771,1008.246,"Alright and as to that, we'd say that, if it is within the First Amendment, that the state here could show a proper more significant interest to more out weighing interest in preventing the display of such films on premises where alcoholic beverages are being consumed, conceding that it would be First Amendment film, protected by the First Amendment."
1972.71-36,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1018.252,1026.355,And the Twenty-first Amendment does encroach upon the First?
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,1026.355,1035.086,Well it would have encroach in the sense that and that is the interest of the state involved here over the control of conditions surrounding the sale of alcoholic beverages.
1972.71-36,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1041.821,1047.24,Did the regulation prohibit the selling of books?
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,1047.24,1051.209,"I submit, if the legislative -- no regulations do not."
1972.71-36,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1051.209,1055.211,"The whole point is that you have to go as far as you are going, that's my only point."
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,1056.57,1063.128,"Mr. Justice Marshall, the regulations do not prohibit books."
1972.71-36,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1085.828,1089.717,That would only be under the Twenty-first Amendment?
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,1089.717,1096.543,"No, I submit that it would be under the state's traditional broad police powers over alcoholic beverages."
1972.71-36,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1096.543,1107.143,"Well, assume -- do you assume that at the present time there are some books that cannot be prohibited from sale in California?"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,1107.143,1109.373,Do I assume that there are books that cannot be prohibited from sale?
1972.71-36,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1109.373,1109.842,Yes.
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,1109.842,1110.488,Yes.
1972.71-36,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1110.488,1115.07,"Well, could they be prohibited in a bar and no place else?"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,1115.07,1117.148,"If there was a proper basis for it, yes."
1972.71-36,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1117.148,1123.775,"Well, what is that other than to try the Twenty-first Amendment?"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,1123.775,1140.343,"Well, I wonder under this Court's decision in United States versus O'Brien, I suppose if it was shown than whenever a certain book or certain types of books were present on a bar that resulted in, always in breaches of the peace."
1972.71-36,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1153.435,1162.254,You recognize that there is a difference between this tearing up a draft card and selling a book?
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,1162.254,1163.321,Yes.
1972.71-36,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1163.321,1165.657,Thank you.
1972.71-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1165.657,1181.998,It seems to me Mr. Porter that and I have this feeling reading through the briefs that this case turns around -- the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control has not prohibited these things going on in the state of California or anywhere.
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,1223.726,1225.221,"Oh, I would endorse it."
1972.71-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1225.221,1228.6,"Well, you don't say that anywhere in your brief very clearly?"
1972.71-36,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1228.6,1234.598,I thought that was the purport of my question to you whether this is a licensing cases or an obscenity case.
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,1258.623,1278.677,Yes.
1972.71-36,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1375.949,1395.126,"Mr. Porter, counsel for appellee has argued that these regulations or whatever else may be said for them or against them, are overbroad and vague, would you get a comment on that before you conclude your argument?"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,1395.126,1398.338,We submit that they are not overbroad and vague.
1972.71-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1405.748,1411.716,"I thought they prescribed the sale of liquor on certain premises, don't they?"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,1411.716,1418.08,"In their form, the regulation state that a on-sale license shall not be held on premises which offer the --"
1972.71-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1418.08,1420.896,Liquor by the drink shall not be sold in certain places?
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,1420.896,1426.536,Certain places that offer these specific acts and conduct.
1972.71-36,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1426.536,1439.005,"Well, isn't that under the same power that the state might exercise if it prohibited sale of intoxicating beverages within 500 yards of a school."
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,1439.005,1439.296,Yes.
1972.71-36,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1439.296,1441.932,Isn't it the basically the same premise?
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,1441.932,1446.383,Yes.
1972.71-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1446.383,1450.56,"I didn't mean to interrupt you in tour answer to Mr. Justice Powell's question, but I --"
1972.71-36,0,34971,l_stephen_porter,,1450.56,1485.844,"And in that respect, a specific -- they are not overbroad in that the regulations do not prescribe the holding of a license on premises that offer any entertainment or as they do not prescribe that such entertainment may not be offered in any premises in California, it's limited to on-sale alcoholic beverages where the customer's are breaking."
1972.71-36,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1489.642,1491.018,Very well.
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,1500.422,1513.321,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1564.444,1577.821,Do you think a State could validly say that no liquor by the drink should be sold in bookstores?
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,1577.821,1583.566,I don't believe that a State could validly say that liquor by the drink should not be sold in bookstores.
1972.71-36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1583.566,1585.816,How about across the street from the school?
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,1585.816,1596.904,"I believe they could stay that across the street from the school, as a matter of fact the State of California says within 600 feet of school or a church."
1972.71-36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1596.904,1603.651,How do you distinguish that from kind of a police power they are exercising here?
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,1603.651,1605.087,I say that is merely --
1972.71-36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1605.087,1609.784,"It's an environmental decision in each case, is it not on part of the State?"
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,1609.784,1619.956,"When you say that liquor cannot be sold at a bookstore, you're saying no differently than you can't read a book in a bar."
1972.71-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1625.483,1637.225,"Could the state say that liquor in our State is only going to be sold where only liquor is sold and nothing else goes on, no other commodities are sold?"
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,1637.225,1640.855,"Well, first of all these rules don't say that."
1972.71-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1640.855,1643.051,"No, but I am asking these questions just to test your argument --"
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,1643.051,1648.211,"Yes, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Stewart said, the rules turned around."
1972.71-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1663.921,1677.856,You don't have them in many Counties and many states because you don't have any bars and there is no question about the power of a state in its entirety or in some of these counties to not have any bars whatsoever?
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,1677.856,1696.431,"Mr. Justice Stewart, if you limit, you prescribe that liquor cannot be sold in a bookstore you are discriminating against those people who want to read books and exercise their First Amendment rights while drinking, those who do not."
1972.71-36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1710.589,1728.836,"What about, to go back this limitation that Justice Stewart is pressing at, could they validly prohibit the sale of gasoline and liquor in the same establishment, in other words selling liquor at a filling station?"
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,1728.836,1753.647,"If you can show State of California has scientific evidence in some kind of a legislative hearing that would constitutionally permit them to find that there were some logical and reasonable correlation between the sale of gasoline where liquor sold then I would say, yes."
1972.71-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1822.405,1826.697,How does prostitution get under obscenity?
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,1826.697,1828.495,Well --
1972.71-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1828.495,1830.176,That's one of the acts that you're talking about?
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,1830.176,1851.44,"I submit Your Honor, Mr. Justice Marshall, that these hearings, if the Court will refer to the entire text of them, you'll find that they invited every law enforcement officer, practically everyone, district attorney, city attorney and Attorney General to testify, and police officer."
1972.71-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1851.44,1860.496,"Well, isn't there a regulation in California that a bar which sells liquor and they have prostitution inside the bar and they lose their license?"
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,1860.496,1863.756,"You can lose your license, yes, yes there is."
1972.71-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1863.756,1867.572,"Well, has that ever been contested in court?"
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,1870.474,1875.372,No I have never gone after that regulation because appellate hearing --
1972.71-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1875.372,1878.576,"Well then they do have some power over the bar, don't they?"
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,1878.576,1878.728,Oh!
1972.71-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1883.427,1893.672,"Well, then the denial of Equal Protection that the only place to singled out is the bar, they don't see lot of bookstores that has the prostitution?"
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,1893.672,1899.623,"There is no question, but that there is a greater police power over the bar than there is over bookstore."
1972.71-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1899.623,1902.813,"Over any other place, isn't that true?"
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,1902.813,1906.455,I couldn't stand here and deny it Mr. Justice Marshall.
1972.71-36,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2072.503,2093.135,"Mr. Hertzberg, do you think the State validly could forbid the sale of liquor in the lobbies of all theaters, or the sale up and down aisles of all the theaters?"
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,2093.135,2131.635,My brother Schultz will probably argue that point in that we feel that the State could not validly exclude the sale of alcohol in the lobbies on the same theory that we argue here because there is no rationale or scientific showing that the drinking of that alcohol will result in any criminal activity.
1972.71-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2131.635,2134.937,Do you have any case of it?
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,2134.937,2143.327,"I have no case on it except this Court decided, in its variable obscenity cases, the Sam Ginsberg case in which --"
1972.71-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2143.327,2151.196,What has obscenity got to do with selling liquor in the lobby of a theater?
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,2151.196,2156.736,Obscenity really has nothing to do with selling liquor in the lobby of the theater.
1972.71-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2180.942,2193.7,"Well, how do you get to First Amendment right, a man taking a drink in the lobby of a theater, which show you an Opello (ph)?"
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,2193.7,2210.437,"Mr. Justice Marshall, it is true the way you pose your question, it doesn’t meet identically the rules in this case."
1972.71-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2233.445,2235.994,Is this Equal Protection you're arguing or First Amendment?
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,2235.994,2238.823,First Amendment sir.
1972.71-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2240.104,2255.683,"Well, suppose the state says you can't sell liquor in the entrance to an iron foundry, I’m trying to get somewhere away from First Amendment, we agrees iron foundries are away from the First Amendment?"
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,2255.683,2256.515,Yes.
1972.71-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2256.515,2259.033,Well could they do that?
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,2259.033,2260.506,I agree to it.
1972.71-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2260.506,2263.147,The state could do it?
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,2263.147,2266.0,"No, First Amendment right the state could do that."
1972.71-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2266.0,2270.534,Well is there any other reason they couldn’t do it?
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,2270.534,2277.179,"Well, other than the fact that it may discriminate against iron foundry workers under the Fourteenth Amendment, probably we will be able to look at that."
1972.71-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2277.179,2281.692,Well doesn’t that 2 O’clock closing rule discriminate against workers at night?
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,2281.692,2284.088,I think that’s a reasonable discrimination.
1972.71-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2284.088,2290.232,"Well, I see."
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,2290.232,2305.002,"If the Court please, historically -- well, what we have to argue at this time, the regulations as they come before this Court."
1972.71-36,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2341.442,2350.761,"Mr. Hertzberg, is -- then the California courts assign no reason for their refusal to consider your petition none of it, is that right?"
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,2350.761,2362.169,"No Mr. Justice Rehnquist, merely a postcard saying which I -- As the appellate herein says he requested a hearing along within us in Supreme Court, and it was denied on both sides."
1972.71-36,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2377.525,2380.648,"Mr. Hertzberg, do you have any comment on that refusal?"
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,2386.953,2400.118,"Well, I very honestly state Mr. Justice Blackmun, I know one thing that the California Supreme Court like this Court doesn’t like to give advisory opinions and whether that was their theory or not would really be conjuncture on my part."
1972.71-36,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2447.04,2461.859,Does California have a procedure whereby one can get a judicial review of administrative rule making which I take it was what you sought here rather than an administrative adjudication?
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,2461.859,2471.055,"I would have answered that question in this regard, I will defer the answer to Mr. Scholtz."
1972.71-36,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2745.29,2760.051,"Mr. Hertzberg, is it a summary of your position or is it not fair to say that you are contending that what the state because the state can't prohibit something in a theater, it can prohibit it in a bar either?"
1972.71-36,1,27221,harrison_w_hertzberg,,2760.051,2765.766,That is correct.
1972.71-36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2765.766,2767.337,Thank you Mr. Hertzberg.
1972.71-36,2,33996,kenneth_scholtz,,2769.688,2773.051,Mr. Chief Justice and may please the Court.
1972.71-36,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2930.947,2946.808,"Again, perhaps according to how you put it, but I thought this had to do with places where liquor could be sold, not to what conduct goes on inside of a building, but whether or not a liquor could be sold."
1972.71-36,2,33996,kenneth_scholtz,,2953.094,2954.146,I don't think it is.
1972.71-36,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2954.146,2958.436,And the question is would that violate the person's freedom of religion?
1972.71-36,2,33996,kenneth_scholtz,,2958.436,2959.221,I don't think it is.
1972.71-36,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2961.517,2962.714,No I am talking about the state had that kind of rule.
1972.71-36,2,33996,kenneth_scholtz,,2962.714,2964.757,Alright suppose the state has a rule.
1972.71-36,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2980.048,2981.433,"Depends upon how you put it, but --"
1972.71-36,2,33996,kenneth_scholtz,,2981.433,2983.089,No I think it is a question of where the class.
1972.71-36,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2983.089,2987.336,But this particular state agency has to do deal with the regulating the sale of liquor?
1972.71-36,2,33996,kenneth_scholtz,,2987.336,2989.637,That's correct and I think that --
1972.71-36,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2989.637,2992.557,"And that's all it is purported to regulate, isn't it?"
1972.71-36,2,33996,kenneth_scholtz,,2992.557,2993.202,No I don't think so.
1972.71-36,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2996.431,2999.283,The places where liquor can be sold?
1972.71-36,2,33996,kenneth_scholtz,,2999.283,3004.493,"What this rule says and I think this is important, I don't think its just a case of how you put it."
1972.71-36,3,34971,l_stephen_porter,,3378.496,3380.034,No.
1972.71-36,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3380.034,3381.573,"Very well, the case is submitted."
