1983.83-747,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.951,We will hear arguments next in Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority against Johnson.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,71.55,75.376,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.83-747,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.387,254.381,"Mr. Prettyman, does the same situation exist outside the Metropolitan Transit Authority in other construction contracts in areas covered by the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act?"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,254.381,257.068,Let me answer that in two ways.
1983.83-747,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,281.073,295.395,"But this question would have application beyond the boundaries of the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority, I assume, in other construction contracts under the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act?"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,295.395,303.049,"--Correct, Your Honor, and it also, of course, would apply in a limited sense in the maritime situation."
1983.83-747,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,317.653,321.448,You don't have too many subcontracts in the maritime business.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,321.448,322.369,No.
1983.83-747,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.415,334.738,Does the use of the wrap-up insurance result in lower premiums overall and lower administrative costs?
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,334.738,341.112,"--It results in lower administrative costs, but the premiums, of course, are quite high."
1983.83-747,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,346.562,353.904,Is that substantially less than it would have been if the individual subcontractors were all buying it separately?
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,353.904,355.825,I think it is substantially less.
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,423.063,424.532,"As an employer, Mr. Prettyman?"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,424.532,425.188,"I am sorry, Your Honor?"
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,425.188,426.515,"As an employer, or what?"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,426.515,427.499,"No, as a contractor."
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,427.499,429.139,"Yes, as a contractor."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,429.139,432.81,"And I will get to that specific language, but of course, as you know, the statute--"
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,432.81,439.151,But only because somebody else has not... did not have their own insurance?
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,439.151,441.635,"--Well, let me make it clear."
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,460.923,464.188,"Well, suppose the subs never changed."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,495.691,498.689,"--Well, Your Honor, first of all, the subs can do that--"
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,498.689,500.079,Can you answer that yes or no?
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,500.079,515.026,"--Oh, well, I would be making the same argument here unless the Court were to hold... it would be rather unusual under the circumstances here... if the Court were to hold that we were merely acting as an agent for the subs and that they really secured and we didn't."
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,515.026,524.492,"No, the general buys it, and everybody agrees they are going to buy it, and you will be... you are the one who will pay the... you will pay the employees."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,524.492,530.879,Then I think we are fulfilling our duty under the statute to secure.
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,534.831,544.249,"But then what if the subs... what if the employee of the sub is hurt, and turns to you for compensation and you pay him."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,544.249,544.874,--Yes.
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,544.874,549.561,Can the sub then... can the employee then... and suppose the sub was negligent.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,549.561,550.153,Right.
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,550.153,552.56,And was responsible for the accident.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,556.932,559.836,"Well, it depends on who you mean by the sub."
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,562.664,563.507,I am talking about the sub who was negligent.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,565.147,565.819,"Yes, the immediate employer."
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,581.095,583.22,Do you object to the dismissal of Bechtel here?
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,583.22,584.468,"No, of course not."
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,584.468,585.25,Why?
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,585.25,588.592,Because Bechtel was our agent under Section 80 of the compact.
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,588.592,592.371,"I know, but they were the... they were sued as a third party, weren't they?"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,592.371,593.917,"Yes, but they are not the employer, Your Honor."
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,602.039,609.958,So could they sue... you suggest that perhaps the subs who were possibly negligent could be sued.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,609.958,613.972,--Unless you adopt the modern theory that everybody gets immunity.
1983.83-747,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,687.192,689.786,"But, Mr. Prettyman, you didn't read the rest of the sentence."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,689.786,690.551,--Yes.
1983.83-747,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,690.551,691.144,"It says,"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,697.969,699.203,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1983.83-747,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,699.203,701.703,And therefore it is your position that the subcontractor is liable?
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,701.703,727.692,"Well, as I say, it may be in the next case that they are liable, but I would point out to you that the modern trend in this is to say that as soon as somebody secures at any tier, at any point, as soon as somebody secures, everyone up the line should be immune from tort suit thereafter because they are potentially liable in the even of the circumstance--"
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,727.692,737.859,"Well, that may be the modern trend in legislation or something, but it doesn't hardly square with the Longshoremen's Act, does it?"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,737.859,741.093,"--Well, I respectfully submit that that issue has not been decided--"
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,741.093,741.983,"Well, it may not."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,741.983,743.327,--and it doesn't have to he decided in this case.
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,750.65,763.474,"Well, if you have a duty and you have fulfilled it, the sub, the actual employer, didn't have a duty, and didn't fulfill it, and why should he have immunity under the Longshoremen's Act?"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,763.474,768.425,"--Well, because he was potentially liable in the case that something happens to our insurance."
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.471,772.798,Nothing happened to your insurance.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,772.798,773.61,--Pardon me?
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,773.61,775.11,Nothing happened to your insurance.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,775.11,775.922,"No, absolutely not."
1983.83-747,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,785.403,792.166,"Well, Mr. Prettyman, what if the subcontractor got the insurance, and the general contractor didn't?"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,796.243,799.336,"--Again, that is the next case where you may eventually hold--"
1983.83-747,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,799.336,799.679,"Well, but what do you think?"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,799.679,811.362,"--I think myself unless you adopt the modern view that we should be liable, absolutely, they should be able to sue us in tort if you do not adopt the modern view in the next case."
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,811.362,814.687,"Are we free to, as you say, adopt the modern view?"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,814.687,816.469,"Yes, it is wide open, Your Honor,--"
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,816.469,817.452,Why?
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,818.015,818.952,--because this hasn't been interpreted before.
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,818.952,822.904,"Well, it isn't if the statute doesn't permit it."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,822.904,825.2,But I think the statute does permit it.
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,907.198,908.292,"Well, you are just a gratuitous interloper."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,908.292,909.151,Pardon me?
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,909.151,911.353,You are just a gratuitous interloper.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,911.353,914.852,"That's right, a volunteer, as the Court of Appeals said, Your Honor."
1983.83-747,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,917.663,935.719,"Well, I suppose regardless of whose name is on the policy, the cost of the premium in one way or another is being shared by both the general contractor and the sub, either in the form of a lower bid by the sub if the general contractor gets it or vice versa."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,935.719,945.433,"Your Honor, the lower price that is submitted in the bids by the subs is applicable to everybody, everybody who comes along."
1983.83-747,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,957.663,967.878,The point is just that I think you might find that the cost of the premium is economically being shared by both the subcontractor and the general contractor.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,967.878,985.136,"Well, to be very honest, Your Honor, I think the cost of this premium is being paid by the public, because what happens is, while the bids are lower, the general contractor, WMATA, is paying these tremendous $177 million out in premiums, and that in turn is being paid by the taxpayers."
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.068,1074.724,Can't you be both?
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1074.724,1075.755,--Pardon me?
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.755,1076.52,Can't you be both?
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1076.52,1088.329,"You can be both an owner and a contractor, but I would point out to you that respondents were specifically asked that question by the Court of Appeals, are you suing them as an owner, and they said no."
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1099.401,1102.322,"You mean if you are not a what, a contractor?"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1102.322,1105.024,If we are not a contractor and we are an owner.
1983.83-747,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1152.77,1163.439,"May I ask, about this army of subs and sub-subs and all, supposing some of them in ignorance or whatever it might be had gone out and bought their own insurance."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1180.619,1180.978,Yes sir.
1983.83-747,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1180.978,1189.865,"And then as to them you would be secondarily liable in tort as to those... I mean, if they could identify such a situation, you would be a third party tort feasor?"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1189.865,1191.881,Unless you adopt the modern view.
1983.83-747,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1200.19,1217.948,"But under your reading of the statute, one or the other is... you are going to say unless we adopt the modern view, but you think the statute means one or the other is liable, and you, by buying the insurance first, prevented... I mean, you don't have to wait until they have had an opportunity to secure payment under--"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1217.948,1220.307,"No, because they can come in at any time."
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1222.026,1238.987,"--Well, Mr. Prettyman, why don't you... it seems to me you have already said that you as a general contractor and your sub could sit down and as part of your deal say that you don't carry the insurance, I do, which is what you have essentially done."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1245.046,1254.917,"--But it is important that the sub is free to come in at any time and get its own insurance, and what I was going to say was that this happened about a month ago."
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1259.885,1260.917,Why should it be free?
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1260.917,1266.211,Because the statute says unless the subcontractor has secured.
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1266.211,1274.615,"I thought a while ago you said that if by agreement he doesn't get it, he hasn't gotten it, and hence you can get it."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1277.114,1278.659,My argument is--
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1278.659,1280.081,It almost has to be.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1280.081,1281.657,--Let's take it from the beginning.
1983.83-747,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1328.951,1340.243,Why does that pose some sort of a continuing authority on the part of the sub to secure if you in fact have secured at the beginning?
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1340.243,1342.071,Maybe I misspoke myself.
1983.83-747,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1355.285,1358.518,You mean although it is already covered by your policy--
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1358.518,1359.189,Absolutely.
1983.83-747,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1359.189,1361.954,--it could in a kind of fit of absentmindedness get a policy of its own?
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1361.954,1364.092,"Well, as I say, it happened recently."
1983.83-747,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1364.092,1366.217,"Well, it is more than absentmindedness."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1382.914,1383.82,Of course they can.
1983.83-747,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1389.396,1399.376,"If on March 1st the project starts with this sub, and on that date the sub has not secured, WMATA goes out and secures."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1420.18,1433.456,"Up until March 8th they had secured, and at that point the sub comes in, and the caveat that Justice Stevens pointed out comes into effect and says, unless the sub has secured."
1983.83-747,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1439.408,1442.327,"Well, but is that something that can just change from day to day?"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1448.543,1454.759,"But that is the beauty of the wrap-up, because the wrap-up says you don't have to secure, we are covering you--"
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1454.759,1455.79,"Yes, but if they did."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1472.549,1473.049,--Of course not.
1983.83-747,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1475.471,1478.702,But then have you not secured so far as that sub is concerned?
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1478.702,1486.919,"--Well, so far as that sub's employee is concerned, in effect, we have both secured, but it has relieved us of our duty to secure."
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1486.919,1490.417,And subjected you maybe to a third party liability.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1490.417,1490.886,It is possible.
1983.83-747,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1490.886,1503.99,"I suppose the terms of your wrap-up policy recognize this, and recognize that on any given day somebody might opt in and then relieve the wrap-up policy of its liability."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1505.583,1507.771,We told them in the insurance specifications--
1983.83-747,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1507.771,1509.581,You tell them that when you get your wrap-up policy.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1509.581,1510.222,--Absolutely.
1983.83-747,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1514.048,1523.903,But the question that we don't have to answer here is whether immunity is granted all down the line for the general and the subs.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1527.074,1529.322,"Well, I see no reason to do it here."
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.678,1544.755,"Well, really, we should say with respect to the subs who didn't get their own do you have a duty."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1544.755,1547.816,"But none of them got them involved in this case, Your Honor."
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1549.581,1550.378,"We don't know that, do we?"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1550.378,1551.582,"--Yes, you do."
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1554.534,1554.69,None of them?
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1554.69,1555.424,None of them.
1983.83-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1555.424,1556.034,None of them did.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1556.034,1557.05,Involved in this case.
1983.83-747,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1589.005,1590.193,They don't even have the right to pay for it.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1590.193,1591.38,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1983.83-747,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1591.38,1593.707,"They don't even have the right to pay the premium, do they?"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1593.707,1594.816,"Yes, they do."
1983.83-747,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1596.55,1598.565,"No, I said on this particular policy."
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1598.565,1605.203,"Oh, on this, they do not have to pay... the way I would put it is, they are not forced to pay the premium on this policy."
1983.83-747,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1605.891,1608.749,"May I ask just one rather stupid question, I am afraid?"
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1608.749,1608.937,--Sure.
1983.83-747,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1608.937,1609.624,But the words
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1616.934,1628.056,"Yes, 932, Your Honor, defines securing, and it defines it either as being a self-insurer or as getting and maintaining insurance."
1983.83-747,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1707.728,1709.775,Let me ask one more question if I may.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1709.775,1710.758,Sure.
1983.83-747,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1710.758,1712.446,You mentioned the criminal responsibility.
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1719.208,1723.143,"None whatever, because we have relieved him of his responsibility to secure."
1983.83-747,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1731.421,1733.483,You say he has no independent duty to secure?
1983.83-747,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1733.483,1740.074,"--Oh, absolutely not, as shown by the unless clause, which clearly shows that they both don't have to get insurance for the same injury."
1983.83-747,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1741.199,1745.868,Mr. Mulroney.
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,1745.868,1750.711,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.83-747,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.563,1808.39,That is what employers usually do.
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,1809.406,1812.436,That is what employers normally do.
1983.83-747,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1906.492,1917.206,"Well, Mr. Mulroney, if the contractor gets the insurance, why doesn't the contractor become the employer for the purpose of this and the other sections?"
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,1921.126,1925.532,"Your Honor, because the statute does not make them an employer."
1983.83-747,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1949.661,1956.05,"But that answer doesn't make any sense to me in view of the dependent clause at the end,"
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,1960.204,1966.249,"Your Honor, that is because it is the primary obligation of every employer to secure compensation under this Act."
1983.83-747,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.996,2026.022,"Well, now, that may be one of the purposes, but the language is, it seems to me, quite clear when it says the contractor shall be liable for and shall secure the payment of such compensation unless the subcontractor has secured such payment."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2033.158,2039.11,"Your Honor, the way the statute is written, it comes directly from the New York law."
1983.83-747,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2039.11,2043.483,"Well, what have you got to say about the precise language that I just quoted you?"
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2043.483,2047.089,The precise language means that the contractor is to secure his secondary coverage.
1983.83-747,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2048.214,2049.136,"No, it doesn't say anything--"
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2049.136,2050.666,--It is all done by means of insurance.
1983.83-747,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2050.666,2051.557,--Just a minute.
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2056.351,2057.461,That's right.
1983.83-747,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2113.876,2118.155,"That may be a reason, but I think you are just making mincemeat of the statutory language."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2143.411,2144.082,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1983.83-747,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2144.614,2145.364,And suppose he did.
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2164.044,2165.497,"--Yes, he is, Your Honor, because--"
1983.83-747,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2165.497,2168.653,Even though he has secured the insurance and paid out the benefits?
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2168.653,2169.838,--That's right.
1983.83-747,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.932,2176.696,And I take it you say that the sub is immune.
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2178.898,2188.519,"--If the employer has not secured compensation coverage, he is not immune by virtue of the provisions of 905(b)."
1983.83-747,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2188.519,2192.674,So both are subject to tort suit then.
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2192.674,2193.267,That's right.
1983.83-747,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2193.267,2194.204,Both the sub and the general.
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2194.204,2206.903,"One is subject to an elective remedy under 905(b), and one would remain a third person because of the plain language of 905(a) and 933(a)."
1983.83-747,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2206.903,2214.352,"So the employer, because he wasn't... the general... you go ahead if you think you are wasting your time."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2214.352,2215.321,"No, I am--"
1983.83-747,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2215.321,2216.992,"I mean, you think nobody gets immunity?"
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2216.992,2220.599,"--Understand, Your Honor, if you understand the statute--"
1983.83-747,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2220.599,2221.443,That is an incredible proposition.
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2225.285,2240.311,"--Your Honor, the general contractor, when he purchases his insurance policy to cover his employees, every contractor insurance policy automatically covers employees of subcontractors."
1983.83-747,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2301.272,2309.659,"Well, if the employee ultimately recovers under the general contractor's policy, why shouldn't the general contractor have immunity?"
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2309.659,2312.876,Because the statute doesn't give it to him.
1983.83-747,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2321.732,2346.518,"Well, we are back to that same fruitless inquiry, I guess, but it seems to me that you are taking the position that the general contractor, if the subcontractor doesn't provide insurance, has the legal responsibility to provide the compensation to the injured worker, and becomes liable by virtue of the provisions of Sections 907, 908, and 909."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2359.935,2363.792,"--Your Honor, we are saying that employer means employer throughout the Act."
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2464.345,2471.375,Is there any way out of this other than for both of them to take out insurance?
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2471.375,2474.575,"No, Your Honor--"
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2474.575,2475.247,Under your plan?
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2475.247,2476.2,--but that... this is the way it works.
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2477.56,2479.825,"My question is, is there any way out other than that?"
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2479.825,2480.683,--No.
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2482.761,2482.808,They've got to take out--
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2482.808,2484.167,--A contractor's policy--
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2484.167,2487.588,"--Well, is the injured employee going to collect from both?"
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2487.588,2492.945,"--No, the injured worker makes his claim against the employer."
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2506.391,2508.751,"Well, isn't the employer insured?"
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2508.751,2512.25,The employer in these cases is insured.
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2512.968,2516.138,"And normally that would be it, wouldn't it?"
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2516.138,2525.697,"Against the employer, but the employee retains his third party rights of action against any person other than the employer."
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2525.697,2528.04,"But the other one has the same insurance, doesn't he?"
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2532.195,2535.053,This policy--
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2535.053,2538.521,"Well, that is the only one I am talking about."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2538.521,2545.063,"--For workers compensation, Metro is not covered under the principles of the coordinated insurance plan."
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2554.404,2556.59,I am talking about the coordinated insurance plan.
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2560.089,2565.758,"All the contractors are a party to the coordinated insurance plan, yes."
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2565.758,2567.618,But doesn't the employer pay the bill?
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2567.618,2569.366,No.
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2569.366,2570.757,Who pays the bill?
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2570.757,2576.927,Metro pays the premium for the benefit of the contractor.
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2576.927,2578.409,That's what I thought.
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2578.409,2583.673,The coordinated insurance plan expressly states that the policies are for the benefit of the worker.
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2583.673,2585.017,"The contractor pays, right?"
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2588.453,2590.624,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2590.624,2593.638,Who puts the money out for the policy?
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2595.793,2607.741,"No, Metro... normally, outside of the context of wrap-up insurance, the subcontractor purchases his own policy and the contractor purchases his own policy."
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2607.741,2608.335,I am sorry.
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2611.225,2618.674,"Under wrap-up, Metro pays the premium, but the policy names the employer as the insured."
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2630.497,2635.481,"There is also another reason, to make sure everybody is covered at all times."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2635.481,2647.46,"Your Honor, there is no evidence in the record at all that any default has occurred under Phase 1 of the Metro project."
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2649.865,2656.66,"Well, is my statement incorrect that it assures that everybody is covered?"
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2656.66,2658.205,The policy--
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2658.205,2660.189,Is there anything wrong with that statement?
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2660.189,2660.673,"--No, Your Honor."
1983.83-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2660.673,2671.06,"May I ask you... I have to get back to kind of elementary stuff... is there a definition of the word ""employer"" in the statute?"
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2671.06,2684.21,"Under the District of Columbia extension, the employer-employee relationship is explicitly limited to the traditional notion of master and servant."
1983.83-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2684.21,2686.257,"So your answer is no, I guess."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2686.257,2687.943,The answer is yes.
1983.83-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2687.943,2688.943,"Oh, I am sorry."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2688.943,2698.111,"The answer is yes, that an employer is defined as the person who employs and controls the activities of the employee."
1983.83-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2698.111,2700.063,What statutory section defines employer?
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2700.063,2715.058,"Under the District of Columbia Compensation Act, it is the actual extension itself that limits the definition of employer to the person who employs the person that works for him."
1983.83-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2715.058,2730.332,"Because nobody seemed to quote the definition, but it is beginning to sink through to me that perhaps the issue in the case is whether the word 905(a) includes someone who pays the insurance or just someone who hires the people."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2738.767,2750.403,"Under our statute, there is no indication in the plain language of the legislative history that the Congress intended anybody other than the employer to obtain the immunity in Section 905."
1983.83-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2750.403,2756.527,"So that you are saying that the general contractor, simply because he buys the insurance, he doesn't become an employer--"
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2756.527,2756.589,That's right.
1983.83-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2756.589,2756.917,--a statutory employer--
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2756.917,2758.089,That's right.
1983.83-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.089,2758.651,--or any other kind of employer.
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2758.651,2759.634,That is exactly what we are saying.
1983.83-747,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2759.634,2768.147,"Mr. Mulroney, there is a federal regulation that defines employer, isn't there, 70.1301(a)(13)."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2768.147,2769.412,Right.
1983.83-747,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2769.412,2770.412,Isn't that so?
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2770.412,2770.819,If you--
1983.83-747,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2770.819,2788.499,"And it basically defines employer as the person obligated to pay and secure compensation as provided in the Act, and under that definition, it certainly is reasonable to say that the contractor is an employer."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2788.499,2796.402,"--Your Honor, the employer is obligated as an employer to secure compensation."
1983.83-747,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2947.59,2959.82,"Well, if the purpose of the Act is to secure workmen's compensation for employees, it seems to me the Act's purpose is served by the wrap-up policy."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,2959.82,2961.741,"There is much more to it than that, Your Honor."
1983.83-747,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3246.784,3249.829,Are you opposed to workmens compensation?
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,3249.829,3251.079,"--No, not at all, Your Honor."
1983.83-747,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3319.02,3328.594,"Mr. Mulroney, is this your position, that Section 905 is the exclusivity provision that confers immunity."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,3354.381,3359.816,"I am saying, Your Honor, that 904 is the duty provision of the statute, and 905 is the immunity provision."
1983.83-747,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3367.001,3377.794,"--Mr. Mulroney, I would find it extremely helpful... I am trying to understand your... if you could answer questions instead of simply going into your own line of thought, but apparently you are either unable or unwilling to do that."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,3377.794,3378.699,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1983.83-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3378.699,3380.355,"Well, I am sorry, too."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,3390.678,3393.849,That's correct.
1983.83-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3393.849,3398.097,And therefore he is not an employer within the meaning of 905(a).
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,3398.097,3398.863,That's correct.
1983.83-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3398.863,3403.767,"And 904 deals with paying of premiums and getting insurance, doesn't deal with the immunity."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,3403.767,3404.595,That's correct.
1983.83-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3404.595,3405.484,"That's your whole case, as I understand it."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,3405.484,3409.984,"That's basically the entire case, and the statutory scheme is consistent."
1983.83-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3409.984,3423.665,"And that is why I asked you if there was a definition of employer, and you gave me an answer, but I don't know exactly where I am going to find it, still, because that would be helpful to me, because as I understand the case, the case turns on what the word 905(a)."
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,3423.665,3432.38,"That is essentially right, Your Honor, and the statute by its clear terms defines the employer as an employer."
1983.83-747,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3496.23,3499.51,Does the insurance contract identify the employer?
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,3499.51,3506.929,The policies are issued to the employers of the respondents.
1983.83-747,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3514.003,3517.034,Is employer defined or identified?
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,3518.985,3519.407,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-747,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3519.407,3521.751,Is there--
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,3521.751,3540.103,"In the joint appendix there is an example, on joint appendix Page 225 is a copy of the insurance certificate issued to the employer of a number of the respondents in these cases, to Ball, Healey, and Granite."
1983.83-747,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3560.86,3563.358,--Is Metro named in the policy?
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,3563.358,3568.154,--Metro is listed everywhere as a policyholder.
1983.83-747,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3571.091,3572.433,Is it ever listed as an employer?
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,3572.433,3573.448,"--No, it is not."
1983.83-747,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3573.448,3576.119,Is it ever listed as a contractor?
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,3577.978,3580.899,It is not listed anywhere as a contractor.
1983.83-747,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3580.899,3582.008,Who pays the premiums?
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,3582.008,3592.347,Metro pays the premiums for the policies for everyone insured under the coordinated insurance program.
1983.83-747,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3592.347,3596.407,"And it is named, but not characterized as to what its status is?"
1983.83-747,1,45401,william_f_mulroney,,3596.407,3609.247,"Your Honor, not in the insurance policies, but Metro's status is listed in the contracts as the authority."
1983.83-747,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3637.422,3642.529,"Mr. Prettyman, do you have something further?"
1983.83-747,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3642.529,3651.807,"Unless the Court has questions, I just want to read one sentence to you from respondent's brief, particularly in response to you, Justice O'Connor, and to you, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.83-747,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3682.013,3683.154,"Well, Mr. Prettyman, I do have a question."
1983.83-747,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3683.154,3683.732,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-747,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3683.732,3695.353,Why does the second sentence of Section 904 make a contractor who pays insurance premiums or who secures compensation an employer for purposes of the Act?
1983.83-747,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3695.353,3703.709,"The concept of statutory employer, Your Honor, goes way back in compensation law and comes all the way forward."
1983.83-747,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3704.318,3705.723,"Well, that doesn't answer the question."
1983.83-747,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3705.723,3706.551,"--Oh, I am sorry."
1983.83-747,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3708.191,3716.281,"Well, why does the second sentence make the contractor who secures payment an employer for purposes of 905?"
1983.83-747,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3716.281,3717.124,"Oh, I understand."
1983.83-747,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3734.056,3752.253,"Okay, but your opponent says, sure, they wanted the contractor to make sure that the subs had insurance, but the fact that the contractor was obligated to guarantee the presence of insurance doesn't mean that the contractor became an employer for Section 905."
1983.83-747,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3752.253,3757.171,"--Well, the important thing is not whether you call him an employer or a statutory employer."
1983.83-747,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3761.606,3766.184,"Yes, but that depends on language of Section 905, and all it says there is an employer."
1983.83-747,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3766.184,3784.582,"I understand that, Your Honor, but what I am saying is that it has to include WMATA in this case, the statutory employer, or none of the rest of the statute makes sense, because the whole rest of the statute says if you don't secure the employer you can sue."
1983.83-747,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3796.03,3796.872,"Thank you, gentlemen."
