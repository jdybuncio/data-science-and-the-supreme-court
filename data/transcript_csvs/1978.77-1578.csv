1978.77-1578,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.509,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Broadcast Music, Incorporated against Columbia Broadcasting and the consolidated case."
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,18.122,22.465,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1978.77-1578,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,164.294,168.384,"It is not percentage of gross receipts or anything like that, it is a fixed dollar amount."
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,168.384,180.391,"No Your Honor, in the licenses which we used as of 1969, it was a percentage, we thereafter with NBC and ABC went to stipulated dollar amounts."
1978.77-1578,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,183.325,186.49,How much money?
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,186.49,196.823,"NBC has something over $4 million a year, ABC something less than that ABC since come on rather strong but they got us when they were weak."
1978.77-1578,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,196.823,200.107,"The dollar figure for CBS, did you tell us that?"
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,200.107,221.523,"The CBS Your Honor had settled with us in 1969 for five years as I recall it leading up to 69 and the average for those, it was one lump sum, sums were allocated to each of the years but the parties agree that, that would not be referred to in any Court proceedings so I prefer not to say that but the average was something over $4 million a year for CBS also."
1978.77-1578,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,378.544,384.719,"Mr. Topkis, you answered earlier about the other two networks, apparently they have long-term licenses of four or five years."
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,384.719,389.982,"Yes although actually I think Your Honor, their licenses have now expired and they are proceeding on interim arrangements."
1978.77-1578,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,389.982,394.751,Does the record tell us how long the license of CBS was that expired in 69?
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,394.751,403.371,"We negotiated a deal with CBS retroactive through December 31, 69, retroactive to I believe 1962 Your Honor."
1978.77-1578,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,405.47,412.793,"You say take the situation in 1966 or so when they mind of started negotiating independently, were they been under a license?"
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,412.793,413.419,Yes.
1978.77-1578,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,413.419,414.756,Expiring when?
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,414.756,432.319,"Well, there was an interim arrangement Your Honor because the history of dealings between ASCAP and its television licensees has been studded by litigation but there was an interim arrangement under the amended final ASCAP amended final judgment."
1978.77-1578,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,434.908,439.986,When would the license that was in effect in 1966 or 67 expire?
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,439.986,441.647,It had no expiration date Your Honor.
1978.77-1578,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,457.3,466.126,"But were they obligated with the fee uncertain, were they obligated to comply with the blanket license for the next two or three years, 66 or 67?"
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,466.126,469.428,"No, they have the right to drop it whenever they wanted to."
1978.77-1578,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,469.428,470.501,Just term it at will?
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,470.501,470.99,Yes for our practical purposes.
1978.77-1578,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,470.99,473.084,I see.
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,473.084,478.384,"Retroactively, the court would still have the power to set fees but not prospectively."
1978.77-1578,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,478.384,496.367,"What I am concerned with is their argument, it does not make much sense to go out and get separate licenses when you are already obligated -- you already have the right to all the music under the blanket license and then the effect would be paying twice for the same music and I am just wondering were they obligated to pay under a blanket license during the period when you suggest they should have been negotiating?"
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,496.367,500.456,"No Your Honor, they could have cancelled and gone out into the market, they could."
1978.77-1578,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,518.525,526.718,Is there anything in the arrangements between ASCAP and its members which would preclude ASCAP from licensing a portion of its portfolio?
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,526.718,530.845,ASCAP undertakes the license all of the compositions of all of its members.
1978.77-1578,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,530.845,532.135,"No, that is not my question."
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,541.78,557.382,"Well, our agreement with our members provides that we will license all of the members, all of each members copyrights, now whether we could say to a member, we have decided only to license your music in most time or your music in --"
1978.77-1578,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,557.382,559.305,Now let us start my question.
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,566.095,566.543,Right.
1978.77-1578,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,566.543,575.421,Is there anything that would prevent ASCAP if it thought it would be advisable to license a package just containing vaults so to say?
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,575.421,601.339,"I do not know just how the amended final judgment would be read on that subject where it deals with the licensing of specified works but by category, that is I should think there would be no written bar, I can say it is never been done and I think the ASCAP members would regarded as a breach of their understanding with ASCAP."
1978.77-1578,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,609.056,627.478,"Say all of Irving Berlin's go in the same category, could you license a Irving Berlin and ten other composers as a separate smaller package without breaching an agreement with any of your members or is there an agreement among the members that you must license everything as a blanket, that is it?"
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,627.478,632.382,The agreement provides that ASCAP will license the members' entire repertory.
1978.77-1578,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,634.106,636.431,You studiously avoid answering the question.
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,636.431,652.395,"Not deliberately I assure Your Honor, but it is not a question that has ever been raised in ASCAP's history and all I can say is that I think it would startle ASCAP's members to be told that some of their works were being licensed and not others."
1978.77-1578,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,652.395,666.84,"But what you are telling us is that the CBS if it go to separate publishers and say we want a license your portfolio of music, I am asking you if they could say, go to ASCAP and say we would like to license just the music published by X?"
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,666.84,672.455,"As a matter of contractual right, I think the issue is in doubt Your Honor; that is all I can say."
1978.77-1578,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,680.723,682.886,"ASCAP does not promote at all, do they?"
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,682.886,688.136,"It does not promote in this, well, to a slight degree Your Honor, not significantly."
1978.77-1578,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,692.823,698.385,"I mean you do not say that we will take four records of selling to you, ASCAP can not do that?"
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,698.385,705.837,"No, we are after all, we speak for all of our members, not perhaps Justice Stevens goes to your question."
1978.77-1578,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,725.384,726.984,You are cutting into your rebuttal time.
1978.77-1578,0,33250,jay_h_topkis,,726.984,732.856,I am indeed Your Honor and I will close very quickly with just this reminder if I may.
1978.77-1578,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,844.995,847.676,Miss Kearse?
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,847.676,851.536,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-1578,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1101.714,1110.337,"Miss Kearse, there is nothing in the composer's contract with ASCAP and they would prevent them dealing directly with CBS?"
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1110.337,1114.664,Nothing at all Your Honor.
1978.77-1578,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1155.096,1161.542,So that factual question is covered by the findings of the District Court with respect to ASCAP?
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1161.542,1162.688,Yes it is Your Honor.
1978.77-1578,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1189.492,1198.966,"We have been told that CBS did not seek direct licensing, did other users do that?"
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1198.966,1206.469,I know of no instance in which a television network has actually sought direct licenses.
1978.77-1578,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1206.469,1217.061,Do you know of any instance or does the record show any instance in which a party who has entered into one of these blanket contracts sought direct licensing?
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1217.061,1231.273,"We have in the record Your Honor, two evidence with respect to two experiences in direct licensing or attempted direct licensing."
1978.77-1578,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1277.652,1283.736,"When you speak of 3M, you are not speaking of Minnesota Mining?"
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1283.736,1293.548,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, I am speaking of Minnesota Mining, it has come to be called colloquially 3M."
1978.77-1578,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1298.461,1306.177,"Miss Kearse, before you leave that, whether the 27 out of the 35 did sign up, but there were eight that refused do it, did not they?"
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1306.177,1310.516,There were eight that did not eventually enter into agreements.
1978.77-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1310.516,1332.91,"Is there any finding in the record that the judge did find that there would be publishers who would lineup at CBS door, but is there any finding with respect to what percentage of the total inventory of music could be obtained by direct licensing if they cancel the blanket license which I suppose they would have to do before they would wanted to do any separate licensing?"
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1332.91,1351.692,I believe there is no finding in the record as to the exact percentage or the approximate percentage that would be available by direct licensing but we must remember that most of the music that is used on CBS television network is composed specifically for the program.
1978.77-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1351.692,1356.891,"But the problem I take it is with the feature music primarily, the feature programs?"
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1356.891,1365.401,The feature music most of it is composed by persons outside of the program packager's control.
1978.77-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1365.401,1366.484,Right.
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1366.484,1377.259,A great deal of evidence was introduced by both sides at trial as to the proportion of CBS's programs that used feature music.
1978.77-1578,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1384.955,1390.303,But that makes sure that the feature music was small and percentage but extremely significant?
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1390.303,1403.377,"That it was very small in percentage, it is significant but in that the program packagers already are in touch with the copyright owners of that music that it would not be --"
1978.77-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1403.377,1413.464,"Is there any finding as to how much of the feature music that would be needed for their programming, they could obtain through direct licensing if they cancel the blanket license?"
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1413.464,1414.85,I do not believe there is a finding on that so far Your Honor.
1978.77-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1414.85,1420.499,"Findings don't differentiate among who would be lining up at CBS's door, do they?"
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1420.499,1428.905,I think the judge concluded that publishers and writers in general would lineup at CBS's door.
1978.77-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.579,1514.726,How do they police it now?
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1517.098,1526.673,"After the three-year period was over, only about a third of the purchasers of the tapes renewed their licenses."
1978.77-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1540.214,1546.98,Does not ASCAP generally police the transmissions and music such as that?
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1546.98,1577.408,"ASCAP generally polices performances of music but I believe that it took the position that with respect to the granting of direct licenses, it would not be appropriate for it to expend the funds that would normally be expended for the whole membership to police for a few and even when it does police, I gather there is evidence in the record to the effect that it looses money on the infringement suits that it brings and the policing that it does."
1978.77-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1585.439,1588.279,I had some problem understanding the whole policing concept.
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1604.487,1620.936,"I assume that if ASCAP knew about it, it would do something about it but in that instance I think it would have a much easier road to travel against 3M rather than against the 20,000 doctors and dentists."
1978.77-1578,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1620.936,1631.329,"Is there evidence in the record as to how ASCAP goes about policing, do they send patients to the doctors' offices?"
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1631.329,1635.197,I believe that ASCAP has not policed the doctors and dentists.
1978.77-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1691.053,1697.896,"Miss Kearse, in the Warner Brother situation where the broadcasters who are not interested in dealing directly, do they have blanket licenses already?"
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1697.896,1700.213,They had blanket licenses from ASCAP.
1978.77-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1700.213,1700.563,Yeah.
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1700.563,1705.901,Their blank licenses did not cover the Warner catalog because Warner withdrew its catalog from ASCAP.
1978.77-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1705.901,1708.895,"I see, so they would had to choose in effect between --"
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1708.895,1710.834,They would not have --
1978.77-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1710.834,1711.202,They could have had them both.
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1711.202,1712.466,They could have had both.
1978.77-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1739.114,1743.928,Does the record tell us why the broadcasters would not take the Warner portfolio?
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1743.928,1745.767,I do not believe the record tells us that.
1978.77-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1749.066,1753.27,Then what inference do you draw from the refusal for them?
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1754.424,1767.364,"I think the appropriate inference to be drawn is that it is the users' choice, which transactional method he uses to get his music and if the music is not available by the means the user wants --"
1978.77-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1767.364,1770.632,But may they are charging too much money or they did not like the music.
1978.77-1578,1,16379,amalya_l_kearse,,1776.65,1787.877,I think these two instances together show that fairly clearly Your Honor and I think there is nothing else in the record to indicate to the contrary.
1978.77-1578,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1796.825,1806.92,Mr. Easterbrook?
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1806.92,1810.326,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1972.173,1980.399,"Mr. Easterbrook, does the United States have a view as to whether or not the blanket licensing here has any impact on the price level?"
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1980.399,1989.501,The United States Your Honor did not participate in the trial of this case and has not fully examined the record of this case.
1978.77-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2043.134,2052.985,"Also Mr. Easterbrook, ASCAP has to operate under the provisions of that consent decree which gives judicial supervision or at least --"
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2052.985,2070.931,"It does Your Honor, it does provide there is both the compulsion that ASCAP permit direct licensing, not interfere with direct licensing in anyway, and a rule that the Consent Decree Court can set a price for anyone who applies and can not reach an agreement with ASCAP."
1978.77-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2089.052,2090.331,And slower it too.
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2090.331,2092.32,"And slower it, and that is hard."
1978.77-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2092.32,2095.632,I am not sure you have answered my question.
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2106.932,2109.932,I am sorry Your Honor if my answer is sounded like evasion.
1978.77-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2109.932,2113.118,"If anything, it sounded like you are saying it tended to lower the price."
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2113.118,2121.414,That is the tendency of my answer and it is – I must say that I can not give a definite answer precisely because --
1978.77-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2121.414,2124.607,"If you do not have a view, you can simply say, no you do not have a view."
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2126.431,2132.157,I do not have a view but there are considerations that indicate that the price appears to be lowering.
1978.77-1578,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2132.157,2146.909,"Well, Mr. Easterbrook, you are here I take it as a lawyer and not as a qualified expert testifying before nisi prius court as to the licensing of music and what its competitive effects are?"
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2146.909,2159.399,"Certainly not Your Honor, I was just attempting to draw inferences from the record bearing on the question Mr. Justice Stevens asked, I am not qualified as an economic expert by any stretch of the imagination."
1978.77-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2159.399,2166.198,I would have understood your analysis of proceed to have some relationship to your judgment about the economics of the situation.
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2166.198,2171.223,It does but that is also drawn from the record and from this Court's cases.
1978.77-1578,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2315.582,2324.739,"Mr. Easterbrook, you have repeatedly referred to ASCAP, you might understand that you mean generically to also include BMI?"
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2324.739,2332.851,I do mean generically to include BMI and I am generally referring to the practice of offering blanket licenses.
1978.77-1578,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2451.814,2458.392,"Why do suppose the, Mr. Easterbrook, the individuals have not lined-up up at the door anyway?"
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2458.392,2463.423,"Mr. Justice White, so long as CBS maintains its blanket license."
1978.77-1578,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2463.423,2466.826,"Well, has it got one now?"
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2466.826,2474.469,It is operating under an interim license allowing it to use all of ASCAP's and BMI's repertory.
1978.77-1578,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.469,2478.056,I know but it is terminable will or whatever.
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2478.056,2479.958,It is terminable will.
1978.77-1578,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2479.958,2489.206,So is there anything in the record indicate that any individual has ever come around to CBS willing to license individual?
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2489.206,2502.506,"The only indication in the record in that is the Warner Brothers episode which was discussed by Miss Kearse, in which someone came to CBS or not necessarily CBS but to users to radio networks, and were turned down."
1978.77-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.814,2545.073,"So you think it is just that the copyright, individual copyright holders just know when they would be doing a useless thing?"
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2545.073,2548.939,It would be completely useless for them if we go to CBS now.
1978.77-1578,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2548.939,2560.874,"Is there anything under these arrangements that prevents the -- I should say first, assuming there was no ASCAP arrangement at all."
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2571.958,2585.807,"As a matter of convenience, it may be that if you keep a record and pay a royalty, no one will prosecute you, but in fact the bond requires that you have the license before you make the broadcast; that provides for a free economic bargaining."
1978.77-1578,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2596.3,2603.046,"(Voice overlap) make a copy of recording in the amount, under that $2 arrangement?"
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2603.046,2617.469,There is a provision in the law with respect to mechanical recordings providing that anyone can use or copyright a copyright for a little more than $0.02 per copyright.
1978.77-1578,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2634.833,2638.019,But is not it a criminal offense or you get the license?
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2638.019,2639.953,It is criminal offense.
1978.77-1578,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2639.953,2663.879,"Mr. Easterbrook, part of your answer to the Chief Justice reminded me of, CBS's argument with respect to music that is already in the can as it is called recorded and the fact that with respect to that, they would not and could not be free negotiation for the same reason that you indicated in part of your answer to the Chief Justice."
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2663.879,2671.308,"Mr. Justice Stewart, it is I think a little difficult to determine how those negotiations would come out."
1978.77-1578,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2693.405,2694.985,And that's that ladder that suggests --
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2694.985,2703.626,"It is a two party hold-up and what the District Court found was that in the circumstances of the two party hold-up, a fair price would be reached."
1978.77-1578,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2749.884,2752.217,And that kind of license would cover music in the can?
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2752.217,2762.167,"Yes it would and it would alleviate the problem prospectively but the suit began almost a decade ago, CBS has had the option of seeking such licenses and has never sought them."
1978.77-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2762.167,2765.669,"It would have to pay for such license, would it not?"
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2765.669,2768.703,"It is not true Mr. Justice Stevens, what the nature of the payment might be."
1978.77-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2768.703,2769.808,They have to pay something.
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2775.84,2787.417,"It is in the nature of an option Mr. Justice Stevens and options are generally available although not necessarily at a high price, but the promise to pay, the major promise to pay would be if we ever use it outside a blanket license, we will promise to pay."
1978.77-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2787.417,2790.936,"I gahter, but would not you agree there must a price pay given for the option?"
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2790.936,2793.315,"Yes, I would certainly agree that you have to pay a price for the option."
1978.77-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2793.315,2797.136,Which will be money down the drain if they never cancel the blanket license?
1978.77-1578,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2797.136,2803.749,But their argument of course is they want to cancel a blanket license and they want to setup a circumstance under which they can do it.
1978.77-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2815.127,2820.684,If they are going to pay for it.
1978.77-1578,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2820.684,2821.572,Mr. Hruska?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,2821.572,2824.453,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1578,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2987.396,3008.474,"Mr. Hruska, what is your answer to the petitioner's contention that if you have two individual general contractors that go into partnership, they sees competing too and bid as a unit rather than formally is they then supplying two separate prices."
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3011.204,3013.365,"Well, yes it was."
1978.77-1578,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3019.817,3023.727,And did the District Court and Court of Appeals  rule on your monopolization?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3023.727,3024.724,"Yes indeed, they did."
1978.77-1578,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3050.598,3052.149,What did the Court of Appeals do with it?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3052.149,3057.059,"The Court of Appeals appalled that finding, excuse me, appalled that ruling of law."
1978.77-1578,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3057.059,3059.109,So that you are challenging the two courts?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3059.109,3061.632,We are indeed.
1978.77-1578,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3061.632,3070.702,But to the question about the two general contractors who form a partnership and from then on did singly rather than separately.
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3070.702,3074.051,Well I think under existing law that is price fixing.
1978.77-1578,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3097.143,3101.113,Do you mean Judge Taft was wrong in his expression of views in the Addyston case?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3101.113,3118.305,"Well, I think that we can be far more confidant that the benefits for which we permit mergers to occur will actually be achieved when the firms decide to merge."
1978.77-1578,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3128.992,3144.695,"Well, I have the same difficulty with your answer that my brother Stevens did with one of Mr. Easterbrook's answers, is that an answer to my question, do you agree or do you not agree with Judge Taft's observation in the Addyston case?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3144.695,3148.508,"I am not sure I understand completely Mr. Justice Rehnquist, which observation you are referring to?"
1978.77-1578,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3148.508,3166.183,"Well, the observation that if you applied the logic of your, I won't say your principle, but this principle towards extended to – it would extend to two individual businessmen who form a partnership."
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3166.183,3179.384,"Yes the logic would extend to not to form a partnership, no, but to enter into a price fixing arrangement on the bidding for a particular job, then perhaps, yes."
1978.77-1578,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3179.384,3180.248,"Well, how about the (Inaudible)?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3180.248,3185.635,"Although the logic -- but I have got to complete my answer to that, I really have to make this additional point."
1978.77-1578,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3274.049,3284.137,"What if two relatively minor steel companies merge and from then on, they had a common sales agent who quoted a single price?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3284.137,3310.158,"Well, if they merged obviously under existing law that is basic distinction we make, we test that under section 2 or section 7 and we do that because we perceive certain benefits commonly achieved in monopolization cases and we perceive the antitrust tools section 2 and 7 adequately to judge whether those benefits outweigh the added competitive effects."
1978.77-1578,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3310.158,3310.411,Well.
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3310.411,3311.017,Yeah.
1978.77-1578,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3311.017,3315.621,"Mr. Hruska, I understand that you would like to stay on both sides of this question because --"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3315.621,3319.031,"No, no, not at all."
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3319.031,3322.339,"Well, you do though, do not you?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3326.152,3330.845,"I am defending the result I got in the Second Circuit on pricing fixing, yes."
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3330.845,3334.233,"But you do not want to destroy the common sales issue, do you?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3334.233,3337.019,I certainly would like to enjoin and ask --
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3337.019,3339.546,You just like to get a better deal out of them.
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3339.546,3344.997,"No, I prefer to enjoin blanket licensing, so does my client."
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3344.997,3347.661,"Yeah, but is that the Court of Appeals' ruling?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3347.661,3351.797,The Court of Appeals suggested the adoption of per-use system.
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3351.797,3352.031,"Yes, so --"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3352.031,3354.427,"We accept that we do not prefer, we accept it."
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3354.427,3356.324,"Well, so are you defending it or not?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3356.324,3357.562,"Yes, I am quite prepared to --"
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3357.562,3360.784,"But even though under your theory, it is illegal?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3360.784,3366.074,"Under my theory, if the defendants did it themselves, it would be illegal."
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3367.05,3376.007,"So are you defending a result, a remedy the Court of Appeals gave, which according to your theory is price fixing?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3376.007,3383.165,"In the unique circumstances of this case, that happens to be sensible and to bring relief, like the relief granted in National Lead and Heseltine and all the other cases --"
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3383.165,3387.637,"So, you would now suggest that you are on both sides of this question?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3387.637,3415.525,"Well, if that is both sides, then I am, but I should say that compulsory licensing on reasonable royalty turns has been granted in patent cases, in the National Lead case, in the Heseltine case and a flock of others, it could be directed to the individual music publishing corporations rather than ASCAP and BMI and form, I do not think that makes much difference."
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3432.359,3435.162,"Alright, if you are allowed to."
1978.77-1578,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3435.162,3465.095,"Mr. Hruska, I hate to discontinue the interruption, but sometimes the theory has trouble filtering through a very, very long brief and I would like to know whether your price fixing theory is that it is per se unlawful to have two competitors to use a common sales agent, for example, automobile companies sometimes use the same too, or say foreign car company and a Mexican will use the same dealer."
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3478.481,3487.473,"Well, it certainly our position that when a substantial portion of the market uses a common sales agent, it is per se unlawful."
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3533.465,3536.914,"Well, I will say that they just both want to use a effective sales agency and want to go to the sales --"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3536.914,3553.208,"If they do not have to fix the price, the Harry Fox Agency for example, which handles on behalf of music publishing corporations, which handles the licensing of mechanical rights and right through motion performance rights and sync rights for motion picture producers, does not fix the price."
1978.77-1578,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3567.94,3569.944,"Well, he is more a broker, is not he?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3569.944,3570.807,"Well, not necessarily."
1978.77-1578,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3589.912,3599.931,"Just so I understood your theory, then your theory does not depend on the percentage of the market that the principles of the common sales agent?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3599.931,3603.629,"True, it does not depend on the percentage of the market."
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3603.629,3607.779,As long as he can set the price.
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3607.779,3614.191,"That is right, as long as he is fixing the price for his members in essence or his clients or his customers."
1978.77-1578,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3755.213,3768.079,Is it entirely fair Mr. Hruska to analogies this case or you dealing with copyrights which have to be policed in order to be enforced with barrels of oil?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3768.079,3770.7,I do not see why not.
1978.77-1578,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3782.315,3794.641,"Well, but some organization, each individual music publishing house would have great difficulty policing doctor's offices and Muzak places and that sort of thing."
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3794.641,3826.051,"I think under the Aiken decision, the new copyright statute, doctors' offices are not infringing on copyrights, but you do not know, today's world anybody who wants to buy a phonograph and a phonograph record, whether he is running a barbershop or a hotel or doctors' office, can set that record player up and start playing music, as I said, I do not think it is an infringement, but the policing aspect of this is really a separate thing."
1978.77-1578,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3853.021,3864.27,It was my understanding that the reason that they had the blanket license with that even though they all are banded together for the purpose of policing.
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3869.956,3873.186,"No, no, I want to deal with the questions."
1978.77-1578,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3873.186,3881.622,"ASCAP or BMI were incapable of policing individual users, then therefore the blanket license."
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3881.622,3906.622,"Well, that may well have been and no doubt that was one of the inspiring reasons for the creation of an organization like ASCAP, but as a matter of logic and as a matter of plain economic fact in which no one really disagrees about, to in order for publishers to police together or monitor users' uses together, they do not have to fix prices."
1978.77-1578,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3938.474,3944.743,"Mr. Hruska, what about the man that has copyrights to three songs?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3945.983,3949.582,His music publishing corporation protects him now.
1978.77-1578,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3950.145,3952.103,I thought ASCAP protected them.
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3952.103,3956.596,"Well, if in the dealings that his music --"
1978.77-1578,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3956.596,3968.428,"Well, I mean how could he negotiate with CBS, a man who has got three songs, and (Inaudible)?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3968.428,3975.062,"Well, if he has not got a music publishing corporation now, because as I say, it is a matter of commercial practice --"
1978.77-1578,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3975.062,3976.802,"But he has there somebody, would not he?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3976.802,3980.673,"Well, he is got to have somebody, he can have himself, he can have a publisher."
1978.77-1578,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3980.673,3982.34,How himself can happen?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3982.34,3983.74,"Excuse me, sir."
1978.77-1578,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3983.74,3989.888,A person who has got three songs can compete with CBS?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3989.888,3991.077,It is not a question of competing --
1978.77-1578,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3991.077,3995.525,"Well, you said he can protect himself, I want to know how in the world he could."
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,3995.525,4006.758,"Well, the people who supply music now, who write music originally for television network use, deal of course with the program packages."
1978.77-1578,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4029.016,4040.593,"(Inaudible) and he go to sell it to CBS, get CBS to use it, how can he do that?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4058.266,4059.756,"Well, there are really two different questions."
1978.77-1578,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4064.78,4071.534,But is not the real problem is this is all set up long before the broadcasting industry?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4071.534,4072.024,"Yes, it was set up."
1978.77-1578,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4072.024,4075.532,And now you are trying to bring them both together now?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4075.532,4079.934,"No, I am trying to take them apart."
1978.77-1578,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4079.934,4080.879,Yeah.
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4080.879,4082.696,Yeah.
1978.77-1578,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4082.696,4083.773,I stand corrected.
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4083.773,4088.033,Yeah.
1978.77-1578,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4128.546,4154.738,"Again and Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked you if the analogy really is fair, the 50 oil companies do not sell anything that no one company could sell, but in this case, the government particularly stresses the point that ASCAP sells a product that no one composer could sell, namely the blanket license and that the blanket license has independent economic utility. How do you respond to that?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4154.738,4170.416,"Absent conspiracy, Twentieth Century Fox cannot market the films made by MGM and United Artists and Columbia Pictures and all the other motion picture companies, but that is not excuse for price fixing, that is a definition of price fixing."
1978.77-1578,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4204.894,4206.215,Here is a benefit to it?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4206.215,4213.53,"Well, but it is totally unnecessary if we have got to choose between getting a competitive price and getting a fixed price in this particular fancy model."
1978.77-1578,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4213.53,4219.634,"Well, maybe you would rather have something else, but I do not think you can deny that there are some benefits to the blanket license."
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4219.634,4224.566,"They are not appreciable, they are not significant and they are not justifications of price fixing."
1978.77-1578,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4224.566,4230.815,"As soon as you admit that there is some benefits, it seems to me, it destroys your analogy to the oil companies and all the rest."
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4230.815,4234.725,"I do not believe so Your Honor, because oil companies can create benefits too."
1978.77-1578,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4261.09,4281.725,"I get lost when anyone deals with comparison of 50 oil companies selling oil presumably in about the same kind of containers and the kind of situation we are dealing with here, what is being sold here under the license is not frangible, is it?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4281.725,4283.039,No.
1978.77-1578,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4283.039,4283.459,Each one is --
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4283.459,4289.345,"But they make it frangible by selling your blanket license, but it is not naturally or inherently a frangible product."
1978.77-1578,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4289.345,4298.631,"The licensee does not just call up and say send me music and except Jazz music, when he is running a station which emphasis classical music."
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4298.631,4308.808,"On the contrary, a great deal of investment is engaged in by the independent packager of each of these programs and simply the selection of the music for his program."
1978.77-1578,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4558.546,4576.046,"Mr. Hruska, what do you understand the theory the Court of Appeals was in indicating that the only thing that is wrong with this arrangement is that licensing is not on a per use basis?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4576.046,4576.435,"Yes, right."
1978.77-1578,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4576.435,4584.475,"Under the Court Of Appeals' decision then ASCAP would be wholly acceptable as long as it license on a per use basis, is that it?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4584.475,4615.346,"Well, they did not say that exactly Your Honor, No, they said ASCAP -- they said that the price fixing, the antitrust violation was going on might be relieved by the per-use system, on the other hand I recognize that the per use system might have a continuing effect on direct licensing prices, they were not persuaded that, that was so, but they thought it might be so and they suggested the District Court that this be tried out, but the whole suggestion there, I suggest --"
1978.77-1578,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4615.346,4620.051,Now what was the theory of the suggestion that perhaps per-use licensing might survive?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4620.051,4637.814,"Well, because the Court of Appeals perceived that the present system creates a substantial disinclination, otherwise there are cartel created values here to be preserved and the Court Of Appeals recognized those values as this Court did in the Mason case."
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4637.814,4642.321,"Well, as I perceive your argument, you are not accepting that theory?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4642.321,4646.732,"Oh no, on the contrary, I am wholly endorsing that theory, in fact I argued that to the Court of Appeals."
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4646.732,4648.144,You are?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4648.144,4650.08,Yes.
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4650.08,4656.258,So ASCAP may proceed as long as it gives you a better brake?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4656.258,4674.989,"Oh, no if that is the theory you mean that I am wholly endorsing, the answer is I accepted I do endorse it, even though I must note on behalf of my client that we would prefer to enjoin the system entirely, to enjoin blanket licensing for television networks."
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4676.307,4677.867,Are you submitting --
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4684.107,4687.892,"To give us a more effective remedy, I think ultimately, although they argument otherwise."
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4687.892,4692.966,"They would certainly expand your relief under the judgment, if we purported to agree with you?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4692.966,4695.782,I do not know that I really regarded as an expansion.
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4702.746,4704.474,How you can have both ways in that?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4714.973,4719.046,"No Mr. Justice White, I have not made myself clear, let me try to do so now."
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4823.49,4829.991,"The district court found Mr. Hruska that gave them a year's notice or year and a half, something like that, there would be plenty of time to setup all that."
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,4829.991,4849.038,"Yes, the District Court found that with all period advance preparation, which you read at particularize the page 107 of the record and I make a note of that page because that is a very important page to resolve a dispute that seems to have come about through the reply briefs."
1978.77-1578,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5124.811,5133.955,Do you agree that the record does not indicate at all why was that the broadcasters did not want to deal with Warners in the episode?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,5133.955,5138.78,"Well, the Warner Brothers incident occurred in the 30's, it was radio broadcasters."
1978.77-1578,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5175.135,5177.585,Lyric writers or music writers?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,5177.585,5185.537,"Music writers, yes, they, you know, song writers who assigned their rights to Warner Brothers and then saw Warner Brothers leave the family, leave the --"
1978.77-1578,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5185.537,5186.522,The composers you mean?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,5186.522,5188.512,"The composers, yeah."
1978.77-1578,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5343.22,5345.813,You are in sort of digression on -- let me just ask you this.
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,5353.272,5354.331,Yes.
1978.77-1578,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5354.331,5359.193,Are there also blanket license offered in those markets?
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,5359.193,5362.66,"I do not believe so Mr. Justice Stevens, no."
1978.77-1578,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5549.448,5562.156,"You are not suggesting that a court has discretion to decide in a suit for damages, a legitimate suit for damages, whether the damages in an antitrust case should be triple or double or single?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,5562.156,5568.793,"I am suggesting that the court has discretion not to award damages under the law, even though there is liability, any damages."
1978.77-1578,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5568.793,5569.136,Yeah.
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,5569.136,5570.925,"Exactly, yes Your Honor, I am suggesting."
1978.77-1578,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5570.925,5582.124,"But it has no discretion, if it awards damages to say well, in this case, it will be single damages or double damages or one-and-half times or one-and-three times or just actually damages, does it?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,5586.95,5590.784,"Well, I think it is nice question and --"
1978.77-1578,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5590.784,5591.458,"Yeah, if there is a pretty --"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,5591.458,5594.716,"Well, you can argue it both ways and I --"
1978.77-1578,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5594.716,5596.61,It was.
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,5596.61,5605.347,"It just never been decided and if I had to run a brief on that, I would say, if you are going to award damages, there are going to trouble under the statute."
1978.77-1578,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5605.347,5607.63,"Congress gave some thought to that, did not they?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,5607.63,5610.103,"Well, it apparently did."
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5610.103,5617.298,"In fact Mr. Hruska, if you find an injury to the business or property of the plaintiff, then you ask for damages, where does the judge get discretion to say no?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,5617.298,5623.135,From the sense in all case in which this Court stated exactly that Your Honor.
1978.77-1578,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5623.135,5628.971,"But that had to do with the retroactivity of new rule, did not it?"
1978.77-1578,3,16173,alan_j_hruska,,5628.971,5634.251,Yes.
1978.77-1578,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5634.251,5635.823,Mr. Topkis?
1978.77-1578,4,33250,jay_h_topkis,,5635.823,5642.762,"Mr. Chief Justice of the Court please I attempted to reserve a couple of minutes, I will use no more than that of course."
1978.77-1578,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5708.164,5709.927,Saying with BMI?
1978.77-1578,4,33250,jay_h_topkis,,5709.927,5718.136,"So far, I would not attempt to speak for BMI Your Honor, I am not sure of the fact there."
1978.77-1578,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5785.342,5786.575,Mr. Topkis.
1978.77-1578,4,33250,jay_h_topkis,,5786.575,5787.077,Mr. Justice.
1978.77-1578,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5787.077,5794.006,"Your opponent about the motion picture market and the sync right market, and he said there were no blanket licenses in those markets."
1978.77-1578,4,33250,jay_h_topkis,,5801.905,5809.379,"Well, Your Honor I take it means a film company asking for a blanket license from ASCAP."
1978.77-1578,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5809.379,5813.615,And the sync right market also applies to television network.
1978.77-1578,4,33250,jay_h_topkis,,5813.615,5814.781,The sync rights apply to television.
1978.77-1578,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5814.781,5816.068,The television sync rights then.
1978.77-1578,4,33250,jay_h_topkis,,5816.068,5816.523,Right.
1978.77-1578,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5846.817,5848.492,Because they are so infrequent?
1978.77-1578,4,33250,jay_h_topkis,,5848.492,5853.282,"Yeah, there is one lady in New York who handles the whole thing and --"
1978.77-1578,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5853.282,5854.768,"But it is correct, there are no blanket licensees in that market, or in the motion picture market?"
1978.77-1578,4,33250,jay_h_topkis,,5854.768,5857.213,There are no blanket licenses.
1978.77-1578,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5858.214,5863.276,"Thus would you give the same answers to the reason for no blanket license in the motion picture market that they are so rare, do you think they are used rarely for the movies?"
1978.77-1578,4,33250,jay_h_topkis,,5863.276,5876.513,"Well in the motion picture field Your Honor, we are enjoying under the amended final judgment from granting licenses for many -- in anyway dealing in licenses for performance rights."
1978.77-1578,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5880.363,5882.246,Is BMI also enjoined?
1978.77-1578,4,33250,jay_h_topkis,,5882.246,5887.667,"I do not know again, I leave to Mr. Kearse to acquaint Your Honor with the facts there."
1978.77-1578,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5889.768,5891.206,Thank you counsel.
