1968.644,0,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,117.943,122.232,This is a federal -- this is Supreme Court decision that I was referring to here.
1968.644,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,124.508,126.871,Does this case have it heard from the federal court?
1968.644,0,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,126.871,131.612,"Yes, it's on appeal it started in state court of Alabama."
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1032.459,1036.15,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."

1968.644,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1104.946,1106.643,I beg your pardon.
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1106.643,1108.507,It's the point that I'm going to bring out.
1968.644,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1130.981,1135.461,Did the man who was supposed to have said that testified?
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1135.461,1138.296,"Yes sir, because --"
1968.644,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1138.296,1138.893,Did he denied.
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1138.893,1144.47,Billy Boulden said that there was an officer Good in another -- another patrolman there.
1968.644,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1151.675,1155.875,"But how about the one who was suppose to have said it, did he testified?"
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1155.875,1156.572,"Yes, sir."
1968.644,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1156.572,1158.027,"And he denied it, did he?"
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1158.027,1158.506,"Yes, sir."
1968.644,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1158.506,1159.943,"Well, that's all I want to hear."
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1159.943,1165.009,"And of course, Judge Johnson, the district judge had to identify that both of their testimonies."
1968.644,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1195.268,1200.456,Would you mind telling us what the reason for the removal as to the other county?
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1200.456,1202.38,"Yes, sir."
1968.644,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1212.354,1213.49,It was a matter of security.
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1213.49,1213.937,"Yes, sir."
1968.644,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1216.43,1219.175,"Yes, alright."
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1219.175,1229.933,"Now, there was this something said about he wasn't warned of his rights at that time before this first confession was taken."
1968.644,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1260.996,1267.42,Was that the law of Alabama at that time that he was entitled to a lawyer at the time he's being interrogated by the police?
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1267.42,1274.194,"Incidentally, this trial, I would point out to the Court that the murder occurred on the first of May."
1968.644,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1274.194,1274.753,Yes.
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1274.753,1279.462,And the trial was May the 27th through the 29th.
1968.644,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1279.462,1280.608,Of 1965?
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1280.608,1281.684,Of '64 sir.
1968.644,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1281.684,1282.49,'64.
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1282.49,1284.267,Prior to Escobedo or --
1968.644,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1284.267,1285.732,Prior to either one.
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1285.732,1288.107,I should like to point out to the Court that --
1968.644,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1288.107,1297.967,This Captain Williams said that he was told the petitioner that he was entitled to a lawyer by the time of his being -- the time he's being interrogated?
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1297.967,1298.434,Yes sir.
1968.644,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1298.434,1300.887,Was that the law of Alabama?
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1300.887,1314.379,"It was not an absolute requirement throughout Alabama but in that circuit, Judge Bloodworth was really an advanced judge in thinking at that time."
1968.644,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1319.808,1322.042,"Because it wasn't the law generally, it wasn't any constitutional requirement."
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1322.042,1324.485,"Well, it wasn't at that time judge."
1968.644,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1324.485,1324.874,I beg your pardon?
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1324.874,1328.527,It was not an absolute requirement at that time.
1968.644,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1356.386,1358.887,What time was this?
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1358.887,1359.841,What time?
1968.644,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1359.841,1360.49,Was it night?
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1360.49,1365.209,I believe it was around 10:30 - 11 o'clock somewhere in that.
1968.644,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1365.209,1365.906,At night?
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1365.906,1368.14,"At night, sir."
1968.644,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1378.377,1385.642,"As a matter of fact, he said, ""I wish to make the following voluntary statement to E. B. Watts."""
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1404.035,1408.185,"It is my understanding, Mr. Watts asking those questions and then wrote it down."
1968.644,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1408.185,1410.179,"But he says ""I, Billy Watts"
1968.644,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1410.179,1410.898,Yes sir.
1968.644,2,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,2287.803,2290.586,May it please the Honorable Court.
1968.644,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2334.902,2338.355,"Well, he was murdered and she was not an eyewitness to it."
1968.644,2,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,2338.355,2340.032,That's correct sir.
1968.644,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2431.337,2432.054,How old was he?
1968.644,2,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,2432.054,2435.136,"19, never been in trouble before."
1968.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2435.992,2437.18,"He had a pistol, didn't he?"
1968.644,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2437.18,2438.066,No.
1968.644,2,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,2438.066,2438.875,Did he have a pistol?
1968.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2438.875,2439.701,Yes.
1968.644,2,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,2439.701,2441.318,"Yes, sir, I think he did."
1968.644,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2442.226,2443.863,"Well, he said he did."
1968.644,2,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,2443.863,2447.536,"In some of his confessions, he did and they never show it up in the trial."
1968.644,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2447.536,2448.794,And the girl said he did.
1968.644,2,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,2448.794,2452.674,That's correct.
1968.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2452.674,2456.626,Is there any indication that anybody else could have done this?
1968.644,2,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,2457.566,2459.63,"He has said so, Your Honor."
1968.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2459.63,2460.007,What?
1968.644,2,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,2460.007,2463.141,He has said so later when he got before the governor.
1968.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2479.574,2488.895,"How long was it after the girl ran to the street or the road, highway, when the officers came back down where he was killed?"
1968.644,2,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,2488.895,2490.18,Very short.
1968.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2490.18,2490.56,What?
1968.644,2,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,2490.56,2491.257,Very shortly.
1968.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2491.257,2494.948,How far was it?
1968.644,2,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,2494.948,2499.387,Less than about a half mile to a mile.
1968.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2499.387,2500.924,And they came right back?
1968.644,2,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,2500.924,2502.931,"Very shortly, Your Honor."
1968.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2503.418,2507.131,"That's the information, the only information they have and what she gave them?"
1968.644,2,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,2507.131,2507.957,This is correct.
1968.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2507.957,2509.632,That this boy had killed him.
1968.644,2,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,2509.632,2510.508,That's right.
1968.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2510.688,2512.303,Where was he then?
1968.644,2,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,2512.303,2516.022,He was back down in the woods.
1968.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2521.96,2523.066,I understand.
1968.644,2,44113,william_bmoore_jr,,2523.066,2530.798,"This is what he told when he got in the Governor's office, what he told when we started in the District Court, this is when I got in the case in the District Court."
