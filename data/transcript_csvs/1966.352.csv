1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,22.808,27.875,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the court."
1966.352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,54.983,58.113,Do you know how many shareholders there are?
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,58.113,60.727,I don’t Mr. Justice White.
1966.352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,150.37,156.285,Do you mean by that if the company were liquidated you’d have distributed rights of that much --
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,156.285,159.345,"Yes, precisely."
1966.352,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,234.838,241.695,"These were securities issued under a Section 77, reorganization plan?"
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,241.695,242.808,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1966.352,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,242.808,244.486,And approved by the commission?
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,244.486,248.104,"And by the, and confirmed by the reorganization court."
1966.352,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,248.104,248.478,Yeah.
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,248.478,251.17,That is correct.
1966.352,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,381.222,382.985,Did the ICC rule on this?
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,382.985,389.48,"Yes, Mr. Justice Douglas, the ICC required that this protective clause be included."
1966.352,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,389.48,392.265,I know but in this new consolidation did they --?
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,392.265,394.433,"No, no, no, Mr. Justice Douglas."
1966.352,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,394.433,396.689,Is that still before the ICC?
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,396.689,402.432,"It’s pending there, awaiting the outcome of this litigation."
1966.352,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,506.305,513.196,"In other words in the new company, in the proposed new consolidated company --"
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,518.482,518.855,Right.
1966.352,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,518.855,519.538,Is that right?
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,519.538,520.243,Exactly.
1966.352,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,520.243,531.759,"And then, and each is going to, for each share whether it would be an A share or B share they’re going to get the same number of shares, but is it four --"
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,531.759,533.51,"It’s four to one, yes, Mr. Justice."
1966.352,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,533.51,538.02,"For each one with the – of a one class stock, is that it?"
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,538.02,543.057,"That is correct, exactly, $25 for common stock."
1966.352,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,543.057,546.794,And that’s going to be the only equity security in the new formulated corporation--
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,546.794,549.488,Correct.
1966.352,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,756.202,757.088,Be what?
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,757.088,787.461,"The assent of the shareholders and if that vote of the shareholders in favor of the merger or consolidation is not forthcoming, there will be no such consolidation and it really doesn’t matter whether we are talking about Penn Central or whether we are talking about this rather limited operation of MoPac."
1966.352,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1023.925,1030.742,"Would you agree with that interpretation of the statute, if that was governed by federal law?"
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1030.742,1033.03,No I think that they --
1966.352,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1033.03,1037.43,"Board is governed by Federal Law, would you agree with them that they construed it correctly."
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1037.43,1056.426,"No, we would not Mr. Justice Black, because they did not give effect to the recognition of what is called applicable state law at all."
1966.352,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1071.77,1090.184,"You said they gave no, if I understood you, gave no effect of the court applicable to state law, I rather read that opinion as differing with the District Judge as to what applicable, as to what the Missouri Law, am I wrong?"
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1090.184,1095.076,We thought not Mr. Justice Brennan.
1966.352,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1095.076,1118.588,"Well, certainly the Court of Appeals seemed to have I thought the opinion reflects some difficulty in determining precisely what the state law was that I rather than indicating that whatever it was -- certainly it was what the District Court had said with Missouri Law, am I wrong in that?"
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1118.588,1178.401,"Well, in our view the -- yes Mr. Justice Brennan, we rated it differently, but I should like to call the attention of the Court to the point where they seem to be resolving the various points, the Court of Appeals speaks at length of this consideration and that consideration and so on and I would think that on the record of page 157 Mr. Justice Brennan the end of that long paragraph, the Court there says that they are compelled to resolve that doubt that they seem to be expressing on the side of those provisions of the statute which --"
1966.352,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1178.401,1180.214,Meaning this was 511.
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1180.214,1201.025,"511, yes Mr. Justice Brennan, of the statute which speak the rule and that is the majority vote now I have not mentioned Section 511 provides for a majority vote unless applicable state law provides."
1966.352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1201.025,1238.29,"Well, on this question, what significance do you attach to the sentences just above this Mr. McAllister, while there are significant contrary arguments, we are not persuaded either A that MoPac’s articles ” requires full consolidation” or B and if they do Section 35127 by its reference to the article demands the class vote or that even if it does class voting is required for state law, particularly B is that, does that indicate some disagreement of the District Court?"
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1238.29,1241.571,"Well, maybe."
1966.352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1249.167,1254.182,"Maybe the Court of Appeals, just was deciding what the state law was."
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1254.182,1274.204,"But the District Court did Mr. Justice White and we don’t find here that the Court of Appeals has overturned the decision of the District Court on the state law because the Court of Appeals went off, we think on the points of Federal Law which we believe were erroneous."
1966.352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1274.204,1286.028,I don’t suppose the Court of Appeals would have decided the way it did that the state law had said in case of the consolidation there shall be a separate code of each class of stock?
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1286.028,1296.992,"Well, that would have been obvious, in the easy case, but we think of course that -- to turn to the state law point --"
1966.352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.992,1306.778,"Well, if it would have decided that way and that it would have recognized the state law, that it had to be said consolidation, why wouldn’t it do so here."
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1329.233,1335.231,"Well, we just don’t read it that way because and I’d like to refer --"
1966.352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1335.231,1339.049,"And what about just the result, result of the case."
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1339.049,1363.9,"Yes, Mr. Justice White, but if you look at the very last paragraph of the opinion of the Court of Appeals, which appears on page 158 of the record, the very last paragraph number two, the Court of Appeals says that this -- the question here is a matter which primarily concerns the interpretation of 511 a Federal Statute."
1966.352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1380.338,1386.167,"Well, they could have differed with them on that and they could also differed with them on state laws."
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1386.167,1386.762,"Well, I think --"
1966.352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1386.762,1394.341,Let’s assume the Court of Appeals is absolutely wrong on 511 and it’s impact on this state law question.
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1394.341,1404.077,"Well, I think this Mr. Justice White, the District Court didn’t really consider the federal points at all, it applied itself to the state law point."
1966.352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1404.077,1406.777,"Well, that might force the provision of 511."
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1406.777,1409.012,"Yes, as the, as indeed --"
1966.352,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1409.012,1429.719,"Well, what Mr. Justice White said, Mr. McAllister, suppose we do propose that in what you referred to in the concluding paragraph 158, the Court of Appeals was just dead wrong and then it becomes question what is the Missouri Law."
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1429.719,1430.138,Now this is --
1966.352,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1430.138,1432.222,What are we to do in that circumstance?
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1432.222,1436.502,This is precisely what I want to come to Mr. Justice Brennan.
1966.352,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1436.502,1468.08,"Well, have you thought about a (Inaudible) that this case might be governed in part by the state law and in part by the federal law, and it is basic positive fact that half of it should not be taken away from one group and given to another, but that the value should be saved as it were, that Federal Law would control all that points."
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1470.028,1477.168,"No, I have not Mr. Justice Black because I think Section 5(11) really precludes that, I think --"
1966.352,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1477.168,1494.79,"You think that the basic principle in Federal Law said no merger or consolidation could be done in such ways, to take away the validators of one group  of stockholders and give it (Inaudible) to the other."
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1501.712,1505.158,"Oh, I think that would if the statute was like that, there is --"
1966.352,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1505.158,1526.505,"Suppose, the statute was construed, that meaning and a division of the stock in the new company on the basis by one person’s property value that wouldn’t be bodily lifted away from him for that reason and given to the other group, why would that not be the controlling norm."
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1526.505,1536.032,"I would answer that this way Mr. Justice Black, that is not our case because we asking here for a right to vote."
1966.352,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1536.032,1543.012,"If you’ll pardon me, that seems to me like it’s a little early to renounce that not being your case."
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1586.033,1588.391,And that is precisely why we’re in court.
1966.352,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1588.391,1610.718,"What I thought and that precisely is one of the problems we have to decide whether a Federal Law permits taking of one group of stockholders value, giving them to another simply because they were represented by different numbers, that is not too difficult."
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1610.718,1615.06,I would indeed agree with that Mr. Justice Black.
1966.352,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1632.937,1634.01,Stockholder what?
1966.352,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1634.01,1646.469,"The assent, the consent or the vote of the stockholders and this vote is to be whatever applicable state law maybe and this is all we are asking, we are asking --"
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2396.399,2399.172,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1966.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2422.104,2427.528,Did that Class A stock go to some creditors and former --
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2427.528,2433.556,"No the Class A stock went to the old preferred stockholder, several years after that --"
1966.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2433.556,2445.27,"They had a fixed, they had –- class A went to class of stockholders that had fixed right in the company that was that –- I mean, a fixed distribution rights and fixed dividend rights?"
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2445.27,2452.084,"Yes, standard preferred stock and the class A is likewise the standard preferred --"
1966.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2452.084,2453.685,Where the creditors paid off 100%?
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2453.685,2468.049,"Creditable were paid off in full and the old preferred stockholders were paid off in full, they got a lot of new -– they got two-and-a-half times as many shares of new preferred stock of class A for their old preferred stock."
1966.352,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2520.852,2537.66,"(Inaudible) as these stockholders voted in favor of this plan, do you have any constitutional violation?"
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2537.66,2541.986,If they have voted in favor of it by virtue of their class vote --
1966.352,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2541.986,2543.58,By virtue of their class vote.
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2543.58,2545.409,"No, it would not be unconstitutional."
1966.352,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2545.409,2547.455,I wouldn’t explain that –
1966.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2547.455,2552.533,What about the -- he didn’t say 100% in majority.
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2552.533,2572.908,"I quite agree it would be unconstitutional as to the defenders, it could not be done that goes too far if the vote, the hypothetical vote in favor of the plan is designed to deprive a minority of what they are entitled to, then the Wood case makes perfectly clear, it’s unconstitutional."
1966.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2652.649,2656.381,"Well now, who had the burden, you have the burden of case didn’t you?"
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2656.381,2666.563,"No sir we are plaintiffs, the respondents moved to dismiss the complaints on the ground that we have no class vote."
1966.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2676.519,2679.271,But you say the articles called for a class vote.
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2679.271,2680.241,Yes sir.
1966.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2680.241,2691.091,"And the Court of Appeals ruled dead against you, he said the MoPac articles, we are not persuading that the MoPac articles called for a class vote on consolidation."
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2698.857,2727.121,"Your Honor if the Court of Appeals had held that the charter does not require a class vote which I don’t they held, they would be, I submit dead wrong in interpreting that charter because as you can see on the face of the charter it says any change of class rights requires a class vote and that’s the charter that the commission and the bankruptcy court imposed in this plan of reorganization."
1966.352,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2774.421,2788.88,Now how do you explain the language on the top of page 157 of the record as to the -- that seems to me is the -- seems to me and I guess me alone as the key to Court of Appeals reason --
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2788.88,2809.242,"Mr. Justice Stewart if the -- I think the Court is saying two things, it is saying we are not sure what the charter and the state law provide and because we are not sure instead of following the District Court’s conclusions on that we will simply disregard it entirely."
1966.352,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2809.242,2819.003,"This much is clear isn’t it that no statute of Missouri, no statute of Missouri requires this kind of a class vote and this kind of a consolidation."
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2819.003,2822.106,No sir that is not clear and that is not correct.
1966.352,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2829.626,2847.165,"Well, but please just so we can see it, so I can try to see what this case is about, is there any general statute of Missouri requiring with respect to railroad corporations or corporations generally that there be a class vote in this kind of a consolidation."
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2847.165,2849.124,Yes sir there is.
1966.352,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2879.785,2882.208,Now that would be true under the ordinary law of contract.
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2882.208,2885.376,"Of course, and it’s true in practically every state union."
1966.352,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2885.376,2885.86,"Well, of course."
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2885.86,2892.544,That is to say the statutory pattern in the state law is your charter may upgrade or augment --
1966.352,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2892.544,2894.183,We are going to uphold your corporate charter.
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2894.183,2894.902,Of course.
1966.352,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2894.902,2897.126,That’s not what I asked you.
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2897.126,2900.433,"Oh, I beg your pardon."
1966.352,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2900.433,2900.856,"No, I don’t."
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2903.537,2908.205,If the question then whether that is a required vote or a permitted vote?
1966.352,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2908.205,2920.528,"Whether any statute of Missouri without reference to what a corporate charter might have, whether any statute of Missouri says that in case of the consolidation of this kind, you have to have this kind of a class vote."
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2920.528,2924.629,Only if your charter so requires it not if the charter is silent.
1966.352,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2924.629,2927.337,The Missouri statutes say we are going to uphold we are going to permit --
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2927.337,2927.79,Yes.
1966.352,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2927.79,2929.663,The corporate charter to say what it wants about --
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2929.663,2930.135,Absolutely.
1966.352,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2930.135,2932.371,This and then we are going to enforce the charter.
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2932.371,2933.13,Absolutely.
1966.352,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2933.13,2934.182,That’s what the Missouri Law is.
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2934.182,2936.588,That’s what the Missouri Law is.
1966.352,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2944.101,2944.917,Right.
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,2944.917,2949.143,And that’s what the charter here did pursuant to the commission in the bankruptcy court.
1966.352,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3103.039,3110.958,"Mr. Lowenthal, in Missouri law what would have happened if a recapitalization has been proposed in this company to this same effect?"
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,3110.958,3113.027,The same thing Mr. Justice Black.
1966.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3123.165,3129.416,Would the same provision have been governing here in your view on a recapitalization?
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,3129.416,3134.22,Absolutely because the charter requires the class vote for any change of class rights.
1966.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3134.22,3146.677,"So if the -- on the Missouri law point if this can happen in railroad reorganization, it could happen under Missouri law in just an ordinary recapitalization."
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,3146.677,3147.781,Absolutely.
1966.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.781,3153.684,If the Court of Appeals did say what Missouri law is and they’re right.
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,3158.623,3159.052,Yes.
1966.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3159.052,3162.725,Even if the merger is turned was down by the Commerce Commission?
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,3162.725,3164.59,It could not happen constitutionally.
1966.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3164.59,3168.817,"Well, I know but under Missouri Law this could happen on just a recap."
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,3168.817,3175.605,"If the Court of Appeals construed Missouri Law to deny the class vote it could happen, yes."
1966.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.444,3178.646,I understand.
1966.352,1,31524,john_lowenthal,,3178.646,3179.547,Court of Appeals decision.
1966.352,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3186.071,3189.323,You may.
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3193.742,3196.581,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court."
1966.352,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3281.057,3284.538,"Actually in your brief, you take issue with at least two of those."
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3284.538,3295.832,"We take issue of all three of those proposition Your Honor and we say that the -- of course, the petitioners have to prove all three of those; they have to prove the two federal law propositions."
1966.352,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3412.559,3415.628,"Are you suggesting that, that would be an outrageous or absurd result?"
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3418.729,3431.906,"Well, we suggest that when the proposition is seen in that extent, the inconsistency of Section 5(11) with that proposition becomes more manifest."
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3451.575,3454.446,But it would certainly stop it in its track?
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3454.446,3457.138,"Yes, if you require a class vote --"
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3457.138,3472.722,"With the particular commission or but the statute 5(11) does say that the commission has defined a majority of approved merger, so stockholders can kill any merger."
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3472.722,3483.332,They can and the question is what vote did Congress provides for the stockholders as a ticket of admission to the Interstate Commerce Commission.
1966.352,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3825.416,3850.734,"Would a carry your hypothetical little farther to say that if in Virginia you made a contract to the man to paint your fence and he did paint your fence for a consideration, would you say that the law did not require him to require you to pay for it?"
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3850.734,3857.597,I say the contract required and that the law will enforce that contract.
1966.352,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3859.325,3861.698,"Well, isn’t that a distinction without a difference?"
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3861.698,3870.851,Well it’s a distinction we submit that Congress made in the statute and they very easily could have left the old language of the statute in.
1966.352,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3882.256,3891.539,You mean that we should infer that they wipe out a property right by sub silentio.
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3891.539,3908.298,"Your Honor, the property rights of the stockholders here will be amply protected by the I.C.C. and we assume by the District Court when it reviews the I.C.C.’s order and by this Court should an appeal be taken from the District Court’s order."
1966.352,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3908.298,3912.473,"Well, if they have a property right, don’t they have a right to enforce it in courts?"
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3912.473,3946.61,"We submit that the federal statute here overrides the contract rights, assuming that they have a contract right, just as in the Schwabacher case under state law therein, actually this was a requirement of state law, there were dissenter’s appraisal rights, the stockholders who didn’t like the merger there or if state law were governing, were entitled to be paid off in cash and this Court said that maybe the case under state law, but Section 511 --"
1966.352,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3946.61,3963.891,"No, but the difficult with that I suggest is that Section 511 did not differ at all the state law in the area in which the Schwabacher case dealt, but Section 511 does differ to state law in connection with voting."
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3963.891,3972.313,"Your Honor, it certainly does differ as to the requirements of state law and it uses that word required twice -- required under a state law."
1966.352,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3972.313,3978.344,How is that going to be different?
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3978.344,3985.43,"From required by there maybe, Your Honor there maybe some slight difference, the Court of Appeals do not think it material."
1966.352,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3986.092,3990.217,But I’m just wondering if Court of Appeals has d said that about that.
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3990.217,4004.64,It would have been easy enough for Congress to have made the distinction between that which was required by state law that -- and on that which was required by corporate charters.
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4038.527,4043.09,"Well your case doesn’t depend on this, does it?"
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4043.09,4046.414,Actually my case doesn’t depend -- the petitioner’s case depends on --
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4046.414,4052.228,If you lose on this issue of the required and then still --
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4052.228,4059.271,"Because we have the three state law points, actually there’s a second federal law point that I’ll come to shortly."
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4059.271,4068.325,But the basic federal law question seems to be as if just unreasonable for a fair plan.
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4068.325,4072.518,"Yes Your Honor that is the basic federal law point, and that is the point."
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4072.518,4073.216,Maybe I have missed --
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4073.216,4074.474,Which we haven’t come to yet.
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4074.474,4076.11,"Yes, maybe I’ve misread this."
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4093.13,4093.44,Your Honor --
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4093.44,4099.629,How can you -- how could we possibly conceive of that as a fair and just and reasonable?
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4102.304,4107.372,"Well, that’s what the complaint says certainly, Your Honor, we’re here on a motion to dismiss."
1966.352,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4122.573,4137.211,"Excuse me, that -- those question suggested by Mr. Justice Douglas’ questions and the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Black, those issues, those issues would be present in this case would they not?"
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4149.073,4155.429,"Well that is correct Your Honor, let’s assume that this was a monstrous fraud as the complaints say."
1966.352,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4238.77,4244.432,Why haven’t the ICC already approved that method of counting the vote.
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4244.432,4248.268,"Your Honor, the I.C.C. has taken no view on this."
1966.352,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4257.646,4264.775,How about back in 1954 when the commission approved these charter provisions?
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4264.775,4291.177,"Your Honor, if we get back to the position then that the charter provisions don’t talk about consolidation at all, and it would be rather odd to say that the commission -- one of the aids to interpretation that they don’t apply the consolidations is that there’d be no purpose for the commission to protect the parties against the commission, since the commissions review of the terms of the consolidation as plenary."
1966.352,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4304.633,4314.722,"The (Inaudible) that the I.C.C. has already has approved the submission of vote, on this vote."
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4314.722,4319.352,The I.C.C. has taken no action whatsoever in this case Your Honor.
1966.352,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4319.352,4320.273,Issue no order?
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4320.273,4322.668,It’s issued no order at all.
1966.352,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4324.362,4327.127,What action has been taken?
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4327.127,4336.42,The I.C.C. Is -- the only action that has been taken I believe by the I.C.C’s file room is let us file the application and there have been no proceedings on the application.
1966.352,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4337.091,4339.335,And yet file a bill for injunction.
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4339.335,4347.962,"Yes, the private parties here brought a bill for injunction in the District Court before a single district judge involving the diversities of jurisdiction."
1966.352,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4355.302,4364.219,"Well, I’m not talking about -- I’m talking about this method of voting, giving each owner of each share stock."
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4364.219,4383.806,"Well the I.C.C. in terms of the vote that would generally apply for election of directors say, the I.C.C. insisted that the election of directors and the general corporate matters, the general voting power be the way that it is."
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4412.306,4429.556,"May I ask you Mr. Lyons would the I.C.C. under 5(2) application have to decide first, at the outset of a proceeding whether this provision 5(11) had been satisfied?"
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4429.556,4434.084,"I suppose they would Your Honor, that’s a condition pursuant to the exercise of their jurisdiction."
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4434.084,4438.927,Well if that -- no one has raised the question of primary jurisdiction in this case?
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4438.927,4442.634,"No one ever has, we have not."
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4443.755,4447.902,The Court of Appeals referred to it.
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4447.902,4460.04,I don’t believe -- sorry Your Honor I maybe mistaken but no party has seriously pressed this and actually what we have here is a naked question I believe of statutory interpretation.
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4460.04,4467.463,"But Mr. Lyons, what if the motion -- what if the injunction suit by these plaintiffs had attacked the plan as not being just unreasonable?"
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4467.463,4470.068,"Oh it did also, but those issues were separate Your Honor."
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4470.068,4483.915,"Well I know, but what if they had and some court, some state court reported to decide that it was just unreasonable over some objection, that this was a matter of primary jurisdiction for the commission under 511."
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4483.915,4487.702,"Well, I think that’s perfectly a clear case of primary jurisdiction."
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4487.702,4489.809,But along with the finding of just unreasonable --
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4489.809,4491.407,That would have to be reversed.
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4491.407,4499.674,But the commission also has defined along with the just unreasonable finding that a plan has been approved by the requisite number of shareholders.
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4499.674,4511.249,"I’m not sure that the statute provides that as one of their findings, the statute provides that that’s one of things that has to take place, that there has to be the approval of the commission and the assents of the stockholders."
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4511.249,4522.503,"Well, that’s the authority conferred shall be exclusive and plenary and then it goes on to say full power with the assent and so forth."
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4528.046,4549.957,"Well, Your Honor, I wouldn’t attempt to suggest what you might do, but I believe that this does not partake of the sort of the questions of the Court has generally held to be within the primary jurisdiction rationale, it’s a pure question of -- for the three points, the interpretation of state law and what the I.C.C. would know about that as problematical."
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4549.957,4551.34,No more than we do.
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4551.34,4553.175,And the -- quite right.
1966.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4553.842,4559.534,"No but this is the question, the first thing you’ve argued is a matter of federal law, what was required here."
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4559.534,4566.21,It’s only when you pass through the state law questions that you come to the federal law questions.
1966.352,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4591.792,4605.133,Is there anything in the legislative history of 511 Mr. Lyons that would shed any lights on your interpretation of that Act as far as this is concerned?
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4605.133,4610.699,"I believe there is Your Honor, we set it forth an extensive in our briefs."
1966.352,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4610.93,4613.809,Did you set forth here in brief?
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4613.809,4615.25,"Yes, I will Your Honor."
1966.352,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4837.707,4840.993,Now that’s the extent that the legislative history --
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4840.993,4869.592,"That’s the high spots of it Your Honor, we have of course in more detail in our brief, one of the important things I think further is that there were very few provisions of the sort that the petitioners are now relying on in 1940, when Congress thought about required under state law, it was thinking about the affirmative requirements of state law to the effect that you have to have two-thirds or three-fifths vote on a merger."
1966.352,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4987.979,4995.115,Then those were the years when everybody sort of abandoned this because of the economic condition.
1966.352,2,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4995.115,5008.557,"Well, there were some, there were fewer bills in the late 30s, but Eastman’s bill did come out in ‘36 and is forth report as coordinator of transportation."
1966.352,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5072.547,5073.924,Mr. McRoberts.
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5073.924,5078.675,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.352,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5151.254,5164.695,Is there is any importance at all to the vote of the stockholder on the approval or disapproval of a Court mention?
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5164.695,5165.994,Not so far.
1966.352,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5165.994,5168.113,Do you think that has a bearing in it?
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5168.113,5172.51,It has no bearing upon whether a plan is just and reasonable.
1966.352,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5172.51,5177.378,Do you think that is important or unimportant in the process of merger?
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5177.378,5180.388,"The kind of vote, yes Your Honor, no question about it."
1966.352,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5180.388,5202.013,"Do you see anything fair and good in a vote which allows neither to be submitted, the vote by those that are very, very, very, small parts that people can override the vote of others who have a greater valuation."
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5202.013,5206.887,"Mr. Justice, I think that is true in any plain majority vote or in two-thirds vote."
1966.352,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5206.887,5215.12,"But then, if you defend the method of voting here, how can you do it, if it is having any possibility of fairness?"
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5215.12,5229.843,"I’ll tell you there is just as fair, where there is just as much possibility of unfairness in any provision whether it be for a majority of vote or a two-thirds vote or a three-fourth vote, or a 90% vote --"
1966.352,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5229.843,5245.241,"If you had 100 stockholders, in that 98 of them, that two of them value a certain amount of security, that those two decide on whether or not a plan would be submitted."
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5245.241,5251.067,"And that is exactly what the petitioners are contending, their 2% decides not on the fairness or unfairness."
1966.352,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5251.067,5262.908,"What is the value, value, value, one value, one vote you might say, but certainly does not sound better."
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5262.908,5263.196,Perhaps --
1966.352,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5263.196,5283.11,"You have a substantial step of great importance, connection with the merger and you’ve submitted to us, which would permit and the (Inaudible) would require that they be squeezed to death by the vote of the other groups."
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5283.11,5293.864,Mr. Justice they can no more be squeezed by this vote than they can if there is no class vote and the statute requires as of the third statute requires a two-thirds vote.
1966.352,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5305.205,5320.315,"Why is that a plan is submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission, being sent to him by a vote that would not be so offensive to the ordinary ideas or facts of any man who believes in preserving the rights of that."
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5320.315,5328.471,I think the only thing that I suspect -- the only thing that is troubling Your Honor is the allegation here that this is an unfair plan.
1966.352,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5328.471,5338.436,"But as it is our understanding, it is (Inaudible) it could be no more uncertain, unless you just said that they can take it all away from you."
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5338.436,5344.537,Then Mr. Justice the same principles would apply if there were no class vote.
1966.352,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5346.146,5347.315,Maybe it was.
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5347.315,5362.543,"If 99% of the stockholder vote in favor of this plan and 1% vote against it and it goes to the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission must protect that 1% against this vote of the 99%."
1966.352,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5369.075,5374.885,"It is just the device used for the competency purpose or just desire to be accomplished, I agree to that."
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5374.885,5384.73,"It is the class vote, which the petitioners are seeking to use to prevent this plan being submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission --"
1966.352,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5384.73,5390.688,On the ground that it had anything – anything fair come out of it--
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5390.688,5399.505,"Your Honor, please they do not want the Interstate Commerce Commission to have an opportunity to pass upon the fairness of the plan."
1966.352,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5400.573,5405.03,I am saying this could be so unfair that one might not even be willing to trust.
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5405.03,5405.99,"But, I might say that --"
1966.352,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5405.99,5408.064,The Interstate Commerce Commission should decide here.
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5408.064,5427.269,"May I suggest here Your Honor that very issue was raised in the petitions in this case was not decided by the District Court, but was reserved and that the Court of Appeals said that is not within our jurisdiction to decide that is for the Interstate Commerce Commission."
1966.352,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5427.269,5434.6,"And what you are defending here, the idea that that the way of submitting that plan is not unfair."
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5434.6,5438.617,"The way of submitting a plan is not unfair, no it’s not unfair in any sense Your Honor."
1966.352,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5438.617,5441.481,"You say it’s not unfair, so that’s got really --"
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5441.481,5453.658,"I am saying not only the way of submitting it is not unfair, but the plan itself is alleged to be unfair, we do not concede that and if it is unfair the commission will throw it up, instead."
1966.352,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5528.217,5531.141,"Pardon me, that’s hardly a matter of Missouri law, that’s just a matter of reading --"
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5531.141,5532.731,"Well, it’s a matter of simply just --"
1966.352,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5532.731,5533.648,Of reading the language --
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5533.648,5537.12,"Of contract law, shall we call it, State or Federal or whatever it maybe."
1966.352,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5537.12,5538.26,Fine.
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5538.26,5553.412,"The next question that must be decided in favor of the petitioners is that Chapter 388 of our Missouri statute which deal with Railroad Corporation does not apply, because if it does it calls only for a simple majority vote."
1966.352,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5560.028,5562.577,"I mean just by assuming, they ruled definitely."
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5562.577,5567.743,No they ruled definitely that Chapter 351 and not 358 applies.
1966.352,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5567.743,5570.674,I thought they just said they just got to be assuming.
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5570.674,5571.535,The word maybe assume.
1966.352,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5571.535,5572.576,It’s okay.
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5572.576,5579.524,And any of that the effect of it was to say we think Chapter 351 applies.
1966.352,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5819.677,5821.709,Court of Appeals deal with that question.
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5821.709,5833.167,"They did not deal with that specific question because Mr. Justice, because and I must confess it, it was pointed out at that time and we did not do our home work."
1966.352,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5833.167,5837.714,"What about that statement of 157, what does that mean?"
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5837.714,5839.918,In 157.
1966.352,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5839.918,5856.624,"It says I gather were not persuaded to pay, if MoPac Articles Court for class vote were consolidated or B, that if they do – that is if the Articles requires class vote on consolidation 351,270 --"
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5856.624,5859.142,It is yes that part of 351.
1966.352,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5859.142,5863.367,"By its reference to the articles, demands class vote, what does that mean?"
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,5863.367,5884.675,"That means this, if Your Honor please, it is not enough that they come within Chapter 351 per se, because Chapter 351 per se in 425 prescribes a simple, a straight two-thirds vote of all the stockholders for merger and consolidation, that’s all."
1966.352,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6056.063,6079.402,"Well, may I just ask a (Inaudible) structure of this sentence -- it is susceptible to construction that even though Articles calls for a class vote, 370 by its reference doesn’t demand it, maybe that means even if it permits it?"
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,6079.402,6087.042,I think what the court was saying and to really construe that you have to go back earlier in this opinion and time will not permit me to do it here.
1966.352,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6087.042,6088.153,Don’t bother I just --
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,6088.153,6093.37,To go to the questions which the court propounded for itself.
1966.352,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6220.834,6238.697,"The deal goes as far as Mr. Lyons in making a distinction between what is required under state law by state law and what is applicable, required under applicable state law, remember he had a little --"
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,6238.697,6239.382,He makes a distinction.
1966.352,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6239.382,6265.72,"He had a little hypothetical which I chose to amend a bit, if a man hiring someone to pay defense in court and the man didn’t pay the defense or compensation, is he entitled to compensation under state law or does that work."
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,6268.468,6275.188,"Well, I think and I think if – May, I answer your question this way, Mr. Chief Justice."
1966.352,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6277.636,6282.957,"No that is kind -- that is what Congress was doing, I’m asking, we’re talking about state law."
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,6282.957,6286.204,I think this is an answer I may to the question.
1966.352,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6317.256,6321.639,Then where do you get that out of the legislated history?
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,6321.639,6327.515,I’m not as familiar with that legislative history as Mr. Lyons is and I cannot point to a specific sector.
1966.352,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6327.515,6340.63,If you’re going to give a different wording to these words under state law; it seems to me you ought to have some legislative history or something to indicate that we should change the normal effect of those words.
1966.352,3,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,6340.63,6357.045,"Well, I cannot cite, I cannot cite legislative history in Congress, but I can say that in doing my brief a decision of our Supreme Court that says that in another situation where they’re talking about state law, their main state statutory law."
1966.352,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6381.665,6385.512,Mr. Lowenthal you are going to --
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6385.512,6405.451,"Mr. Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Stewart, I would draw your attention to what the Court of Appeals said about this problem that’s required on page 8 of my reply brief, that buff colored job, number 352 on page 8."
1966.352,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6420.457,6423.529,And then why did they later say they had done --
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6423.529,6424.394,"I don’t know, Your Honor."
1966.352,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6424.394,6425.844,In fact they ruled on.
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6425.844,6429.702,"Your honor I don’t know, the best that I can make out of it is that, they --"
1966.352,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6429.702,6431.63,You are on Page 8 of our --
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6431.63,6436.385,"Page 8 of my replied brief, your honor the buff job in number 352."
1966.352,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6436.385,6438.217,Also in the record 156.
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6438.217,6441.706,"156 in the record thanks, Justice Douglas."
1966.352,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6477.179,6492.514,"Yes, but right ahead of that in our view the Class B shareholders must surmount each and all of these work hurdles in order to prevail, we are not convinced they’ve surmounted any of them."
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6492.514,6503.163,"Yes, Your Honor but if that had been what they held, they would then have held that the required vote in Missouri is a two-thirds vote for mergers, but they did not so hold."
1966.352,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6525.995,6533.045,"But they said they were also to make, they were driven the word required and didn’t they rule on what they thought requires man under 5(11)?"
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6533.045,6536.163,"I don’t see that they ruled on it, Your Honor."
1966.352,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6536.769,6540.806,"They ruled on it, and ruled on it because it is a matter of federal law and not the state law."
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6540.806,6541.79,"Yes, Your Honor it is."
1966.352,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6541.79,6546.039,If it’s required means something mandatory not something permitted by agreements.
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6546.039,6557.574,"Yes, but right before that they said what I have just quoted about they see no difference, if the charter requires it pursuant to statutory authority which makes the charter provision controlling so I am not sure --"
1966.352,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6557.574,6576.897,"Well, while you put the two together that means that at most this does it, that certainly under Missouri Law it’s permissive to do it this way, but the federal statute uses the word required and that required implies something mandatory, not something permissive --"
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6576.897,6577.177,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.352,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6577.177,6578.411,Wasn’t that out of it.
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6578.411,6579.518,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.352,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6635.224,6636.137,In which state?
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6636.137,6664.22,"Indiana, with state law absolutely indistinguishable from Missouri state law and the charter of Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad just like MoPac’s charter came out of a bankruptcy organization, it provides a class vote on mergers for a small class of the preferred stock and MoPac bought just enough of that preferred stock to block other roads from merging with CNI and --"
1966.352,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6664.22,6669.653,Is there any argument about the -- about the right to a class vote in that case?
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6669.653,6679.518,"Your honor, MoPac and Mississippi River Fuel both respondents here were parties before the commission in that preceding that you affirmed last week."
1966.352,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6748.319,6753.033,Why didn’t you wait for the commission to decide this instead of coming into Court with a separate suit?
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6753.033,6764.711,"Your honor, this is, this voting question is not within the primary jurisdiction under the commission, and I have noted by the way in my principle brief."
1966.352,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6764.711,6766.38,It’s just within its jurisdiction.
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6766.38,6768.215,"It’s within its jurisdiction, but not primary."
1966.352,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6793.942,6795.809,You have some cases on that?
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6795.809,6797.459,"Yes, sir."
1966.352,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6797.459,6798.99,"Well that’s all right, it’s in your brief?"
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6798.99,6824.216,"It’s in my brief, so all agreed since this is not within the primary jurisdiction, let’s get it over with and not first go through years of commission proceedings and we are not for this, this entire case on the respondents’ position would make a dead letter of the bankruptcy act because this charter provision just like CNI’s charter provision came in under the Bankruptcy Act and a plan --"
1966.352,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6824.216,6835.756,"Mr. Lowenthal, at the time that charter provision came in upon the bankruptcy act, the law of Missouri was to the effect that a majority of vote only is required."
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6835.756,6836.737,"No, sir it was not --"
1966.352,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6836.737,6841.332,I understand from the other side that this provision was in the Missouri law of 1961.
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6841.332,6861.933,"No, sir may I please refer you to pages 12 to 14 of my reply brief and number 352 for the Missouri statutes which makes it absolutely clear that it has always been the practice in Missouri that charter provisions incorporate charters for class voting will always be observed and required."
1966.352,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6861.933,6863.491,Even in railroad reorganizations?
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6863.491,6871.845,Even in railroad reorganizations and Missouri Pacific itself had such a class voting provision in it’s old charter of 1917.
1966.352,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6881.235,6886.433,"Up until 1961, the applicable statutes for the railroad consolidation – is that where?"
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6886.433,6892.661,"Mostly they were not -- both lower Courts held that they were chapter 351, the general business statutes."
1966.352,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6892.661,6893.931,That’s even before 61.
1966.352,4,31524,john_lowenthal,,6893.931,6897.524,Even before 61 has nothing to do with the date of 61.
