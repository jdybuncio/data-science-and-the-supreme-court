2015.14-1504,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.81,"We'll hear argument first today in Case No. 14-1504, Wittman v. Personhuballah. Mr. Carvin."
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,8.81,20.505,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The sum total of the alleged Shaw violation here is that the legislature treated black-majority District 3 the same way as it treated the 10 majority-white districts."
2015.14-1504,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,26.69,34.535,"Is that -- is that undisputed? How did they preserve the core when they shifted something like 180,000 people around?"
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,34.535,35.615,Right.
2015.14-1504,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,66.87,69.65,Was there any holding that that preserved the core?
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,69.65,70.29,Yes.
2015.14-1504,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,94.99,107.245,"And how can we take politics when the drafter of the plan -- rightly or wrongly, the drafter of the plan represented to the court, I haven't looked at partisan performance."
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,118.855,121.54,He said he didn't look at partisan performance statistics.
2015.14-1504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,132.2,135.02,Politics motivates the change in district.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,142.14,142.885,Right.
2015.14-1504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,142.885,159.635,"May we then use race to move people from one district to another, simply because that's the easiest way to do it? We know that this is a -- a race that votes strongly for a particular party, so we can use race for this ultimate neutral purpose?"
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,159.635,164.42,"You can't use race as a proxy, Justice Kennedy, and it's very important to note that they didn't find --"
2015.14-1504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,164.42,168.3,"The -- the district -- I understood your argument to be that, so --"
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,168.3,168.71,No.
2015.14-1504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,168.71,169.95,So perhaps you can correct me.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,169.95,173.21,It's the difference between Cromartie II and using race as a proxy.
2015.14-1504,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,211.415,211.94,How did you --
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,211.94,224.265,"That is why Cromartie II insisted that plaintiffs show, meet the demanded burden of showing, that's -- race -- traditional districting principles were subordinated to race rather than politics."
2015.14-1504,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,224.265,240.23,"How do you show what the motive of the legislature was? Let's say you have 10 percent of the legislators say this is because of race -- that's their motive -- 10 percent say it's because of partisanship, and 80 percent say nothing at all."
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,242.96,243.38,Right.
2015.14-1504,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,314.63,318.95,But it -- but it made District 3 more compact.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,318.95,322.97,The only way to make it more compact is to split the district in half.
2015.14-1504,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,324.2,326.98,"Well, this district was never compact to start with."
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,326.98,327.47,Well --
2015.14-1504,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,327.47,331.35,"I mean, it's -- it's contiguous only by water, not by land."
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,331.35,331.82,Well --
2015.14-1504,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,331.82,336.35,And it runs a very unusual route.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,336.35,346.5,"It's certainly reasonably compact within the meaning of the Supreme Court -- Virginia Supreme Court's definition of compactness, where you have to look at whether or not they're preserving the core of the existing district to assess --"
2015.14-1504,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,346.5,347.21,The new plan --
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,347.21,347.69,-- capacity.
2015.14-1504,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,347.69,349.635,-- splits less districts.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,362.355,364.925,"That is only half-accurate, Justice Sotomayor."
2015.14-1504,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,400.87,430.7,"Would you spend a few minutes on whether this case is moot or not? As I understand it, the vast majority of the districts of the representatives who are parties to this action have not been changed in any meaningful way. Forbes is the only one who had a -- who had, perhaps, a live claim, but he's decided to run in another district. So how do we have a live claim or controversy?"
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,430.7,436.59,"Oh, because what they did to -- to Representative Forbes was to severely hamper and be -- make impossible --"
2015.14-1504,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,436.59,438.16,But he has decided not to run.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,438.16,445.11,"Right, and that means the injury is so severe that it forced him out of the districts. Let's assume you had paired two Republican incumbents, and what --"
2015.14-1504,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,445.11,448.39,Is he going to go back and run in the old district?
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,448.39,452.01,"But for the remedial order, he would obviously be running in District 4."
2015.14-1504,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,469.57,479.12,"Are you representing that if the map goes back to the enacted form, not the new one, that he will run in his old district?"
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,479.12,479.9,Absolutely.
2015.14-1504,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,489.485,489.985,And as --
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,489.985,491.45,I'm sure this was undisputed.
2015.14-1504,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,491.45,500.815,"As to the old district -- I mean, we do have a rule that -- District A is allegedly gerrymandered."
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,521.0,523.48,Because they're asserting the constitutional right.
2015.14-1504,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,608.65,612.015,What about Brat? What about Brat?
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,612.015,620.42,"I could argue, Your Honor, if I wanted to that Brat and Wittman, who had seven and one, also had their districts changed in a way."
2015.14-1504,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,637.195,644.445,"Normally, the defendant is the State in a voting rights case."
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,705.86,706.965,I -- I will give you two.
2015.14-1504,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,706.965,707.28,Okay.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,707.62,726.81,"ASARCO -- ASARCO articulates the burden in a nonelection context which is, do you suffer a threat to your current injuries because of the lower court opinion? And the best case is actually Meese v. Keene in applying that injury to hurting your chances for re-election."
2015.14-1504,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,726.81,727.38,Meese --
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,727.38,750.525,"Meese v. Keene, where the Court found that because they had attached the propaganda label to this California Democratic legislator's acid rain documentary, that hurt his chances for re-election. Solicitor General says, let's use the word ""reputation."" That's true, but reputation was only relevant because it hurt his chances for re-election."
2015.14-1504,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,756.93,757.28,I'm --
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,757.28,758.71,And after all -- I'm sorry.
2015.14-1504,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,758.71,770.09,"And the distinction between, let's say, the best one is the split district, you know, the one you were just talking about, Representative --"
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,770.09,770.68,Forbes.
2015.14-1504,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,770.68,775.185,"-- Forbes, right. If he has standing, who doesn't?"
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,775.185,783.295,"Well, the standard is Meese v. Keene, and this was the argument that this California Democratic legislature running an acid rain documentary said."
2015.14-1504,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,790.62,813.61,"But, I mean, in the voting context, the standard for saying that a person in another district is hurt enough to be able to maintain a standing here, and these people aren't, which ones are and which ones aren't?"
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,813.61,814.38,Meese used the formulation harm his chances for re-election. You can attack --
2015.14-1504,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,814.38,816.3,Harmed his chances for re-election.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,816.3,818.675,"But -- but, Justice Breyer, this is the simplest process."
2015.14-1504,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,830.73,832.26,So we announce a rule -- so we announce a rule --
2015.14-1504,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,832.26,832.6,All right.
2015.14-1504,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,834.13,846.16,We announce a rule that every change that affects an incumbent gives the incumbent the right to challenge the line of change.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,846.16,850.435,I think any -- any time somebody is injured-in-fact --
2015.14-1504,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,850.435,852.65,Just answer the question yes.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,857.605,858.0,No.
2015.14-1504,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,858.0,867.975,"Every time your district is changed and you believe it hurts you, you have a right to go to court and say what?"
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,867.975,870.435,"I want to quibble a bit with the premise, Justice."
2015.14-1504,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,875.87,877.385,But -- but I -- but that's the rule.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,892.02,898.58,"That the remedial order has hurt dramatically, indeed, irretrievably, his chances for re-election."
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,898.58,899.64,"So, Mr. Carvin --"
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,899.64,899.75,If.
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,899.75,917.82,"-- let's assume that that's true and that that is -- counts as an injury-in-fact. We also have this other requirement in the law, which we talk about a lot less, but it seems to be quite well established, which is that there needs to a kind of legally recognized interest."
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,933.25,934.55,That he wants to be elected.
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,934.55,938.3,"No, that's -- that's -- that's, you know, he wants to be elected."
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,953.21,956.96,"Well, two points: You surely don't need to show any cognizable right."
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,970.055,983.75,"Are you saying that that part of our standing doctrine which does look as to whether there is a legally cognizable right is only good for plaintiffs, and that once the inquiry shifts to the defendant, it just completely drops out of the picture?"
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,983.75,1009.665,"It just recognizes the reality the difference between a plaintiff filing a complaint challenging a State law and the defendant who is defending the State law, who is obviously not going to argue that his legal rights have been violated, he has the same interest as the people who are supposed to be defending the State law, which is he was well benefited under the status quo ante, and he has suffered direct injury-in-fact because of the alteration caused by the remedial order."
2015.14-1504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1010.53,1015.04,"Justice Kagan can ask her own question, but he suffered injury-in-fact to what?"
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1015.04,1023.06,"To his ability to be reelected. The same injury-in-fact that was recognized in Meese v. Keene, Davis v. FTC, and a host of cases like --"
2015.14-1504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1023.06,1036.39,"So they are right to assert that you have a legally recognized interest in being re-elected without, I don't know, improper interference or something like that?"
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1036.39,1054.44,"Not having a State entity, in this case a Federal entity, affirmatively intervene, override the sovereign prerogatives of the State, and create an electoral system which substantially diminishes, indeed eliminates, his chances for election. Why is that not injury-in-fact? There was injury-in-fact every time this Court says --"
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1054.44,1058.0,I wasn't -- I wasn't -- I wasn't contesting the injury-in-fact requirement.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1084.84,1087.96,May I clarify? They need to show a legally cognizable interest.
2015.14-1504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1093.8,1095.415,But would they have a legally --
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1095.415,1100.465,So the legally cognizable interest is -- just finish the sentence for me.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1100.465,1105.26,That he has been injured-in-fact and has a direct stake in the outcome because he wants to be re-elected.
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1105.26,1110.75,That just -- that just makes the legally cognizable interest the same as the injury-in-fact requirement.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1110.75,1112.74,Fair enough --
2015.14-1504,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1112.74,1113.09,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1114.04,1114.425,Okay.
2015.14-1504,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1147.84,1168.735,"There are two questions. There's the question injury-in-fact, which you've been talking about. Now, on the issue of legally cognizable interest, does a member of Congress who wants to be re-elected have a legally cognizable interest in running in a district that was lawfully enacted by the State legislature?"
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1168.735,1195.62,"Yes, he certainly does, because obviously the interference -- and you have to accept as true for standing purposes -- the improper interference in the Federal judiciary into that political thicket, which harms him and rearranges the entire district, is obviously injury-in-fact, and is just the kind of interest that this Court would want to find cognizable, because, after all, it's most concerned about the Federal judiciary hijacking the political process much more than in any other --"
2015.14-1504,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1195.62,1197.88,Here -- here is the basic problem.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1272.94,1275.14,I -- I've given you ASARCO; I've given you Meese v. Keene.
2015.14-1504,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1275.14,1275.29,Yeah.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1275.36,1278.04,Now let's talk -- let's talk about incumbency protection generally.
2015.14-1504,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1278.04,1278.13,Okay.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1278.13,1286.725,"If they had paired two incumbents. This Court found in Karcher v. Daggett, Justice Brennan said, that kind of political gerrymandering imposes such a severe injury --"
2015.14-1504,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1286.725,1286.91,Yeah.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1286.91,1295.8,"-- you can adjust equal population. In Larios, this -- where this Court summarily affirmed, they said that kind of injury is a classic tool of political gerrymandering."
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1355.62,1360.18,"Mr. Carvin, can I -- can I take you back to the merits? Let me give you a hypothetical."
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1362.035,1362.4,Okay.
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1362.4,1370.02,"Let's say that there are some racist mapdrawers, and -- and they say, here's what we're going to do."
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1393.9,1394.74,Uh-huh.
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1394.74,1401.21,Now what should be the right answer to that question? Is there strict scrutiny in such a case?
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1401.21,1414.59,I give precisely the answer this Court gave in Alabama where they had an absolute BVAP floor which you could argue was trying to segregate the races. This Court didn't say that ipso facto invalidated all 35 majority-minority districts in Alabama.
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1422.56,1432.13,"You're making -- you're making my hypothetical more complicated than it is. We're just -- this it one district, we're just going to segregate all the African-American voters in this district."
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1446.46,1446.8,Right.
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1446.8,1459.42,"Is -- and -- and so the question is, is that unconstitutional, because you know, if I look at that, I say, okay, that's -- the race was your primary motivation."
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1476.855,1486.28,"If it coincides, and if it is a motivating factor like it was here, then obviously you need to show that race was the but-for cause of any alteration of district lines."
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1493.73,1493.95,Okay.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1503.94,1504.175,Right.
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1504.175,1507.78,So you're saying the -- the critical question is not conflict.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1524.63,1525.08,No.
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1541.04,1550.045,"This is -- this is -- it's very clear, just as it is in this case I have to say, they have a list of criteria, and number one on the list is race."
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1557.26,1557.58,Right.
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1557.58,1572.405,"And the question is, does the fact that it also has political benefits, does that insulate these line drawers from what you would think is the obvious conclusion, which is this is unconstitutional conduct?"
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1572.405,1582.045,"In every context, Mount Healthy, Gross, even outside of the Shaw cases where plaintiffs have a special burden to show, it's race rather than politics."
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1587.97,1590.09,"Well, he says, this is our first priority."
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1590.09,1590.55,Yes.
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1599.67,1600.67,But in my hypothetical --
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1600.67,1601.22,But -- but -- but --
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1601.22,1604.61,-- it's his first priority because he is a racist line drawer.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1604.61,1605.05,Great.
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1630.945,1635.49,That -- that sounds to me as though it's a harmless error rule for racial discrimination.
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1645.9,1649.33,"What you found in Cromartie, it's not harmless error."
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1672.53,1672.83,"Yes, but --"
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1672.83,1673.22,And we --
2015.14-1504,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1673.22,1687.51,"Could I ask a question, which is really highlighted by Justice Kagan's hypothetical? Because normally, were -- were it not for the Voting Rights Act, there would be a very simple answer to all of these questions, and that is that you cannot take race into account at all."
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1703.38,1703.64,Right.
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1759.24,1763.14,"Well, the first seven words of that quote are ""in a case such as this one."""
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1763.14,1763.61,Yes.
2015.14-1504,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1763.61,1792.6,"And the question is what did they mean by that? And one understanding of what they meant when they said ""in a case such as this one"" is in a case in which there was no direct evidence of racial motivation but only circumstantial evidence, and -- and the -- and the absence or the presence of a map was indeed relevant to the question of whether that circumstantial evidence added up to the conclusion that race was the motivator."
2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1792.6,1797.815,I -- I must respectfully disagree that that's a remotely implausible interpretation of this language.

2015.14-1504,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1819.475,1826.22,"It's -- why didn't we -- the Court said, remand to find out which districts were affected by the BVAP floor."

2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,1930.37,1930.79,That's --
2015.14-1504,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1930.79,1931.62,"I mean, there's nothing wrong with that."
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,1932.18,1934.08,That's exactly -- that's exactly right.

2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2022.195,2023.62,"Well, Mr. Morgan --"
2015.14-1504,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2023.62,2024.87,That's at 649.
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2025.325,2026.24,John McDonald --
2015.14-1504,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2026.24,2027.32,"McDonald, right."
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2027.32,2042.135,"-- who was the plaintiffs' expert, he was asked, can't -- can't a lot of these swaps be explained based on -- based on politics? And he said they could be, with the exception, I would say, of Plaintiffs' Exhibit 57, which showed that there were five -- that's on page 439 of the Joint Appendix."
2015.14-1504,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2054.0,2065.065,Would there -- would there be a violation here if the district that were drawn could be explained on the basis of partisanship rather than race?
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2065.065,2075.745,"If -- if the only evidence were statistical, just like in Easley v. Cromartie, and it could equally be explained based on partisanship, you're right, I think we would have won the case and we'd be defending that position here."
2015.14-1504,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2089.75,2093.06,It's a -- a question I asked Mr. Carvin.
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2104.68,2104.97,Right.
2015.14-1504,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2120.38,2123.19,"But if you're a legislature and you say, okay, I understand now what you said."
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2133.335,2133.825,Yeah.
2015.14-1504,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2210.77,2225.1,"Wouldn't there be a basis for the legislator who said, the Department of Justice won't accept it if we go below 55 percent? Is it -- was there -- was it something she made up, or did she have some basis for that?"
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2225.1,2240.64,"The record in this case has no showing as to where that 55 percent number came from. In fact, the record shows that this exact district was precleared previously at 53 percent and at 50 percent. The Senate -- Virginia Senate districts were precleared at 50 percent --"
2015.14-1504,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2240.64,2249.755,"Are there districts in other States or in other cases where the BVAP is at 55 percent or 60 percent, or is that unusually high?"
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2249.755,2252.09,I -- I don't know the answer to that question.
2015.14-1504,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2342.08,2347.36,"Meese was the case, wasn't it, about -- was that the case involving the --"
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2347.36,2348.11,California --
2015.14-1504,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2348.11,2349.97,-- supporting a lobbyist?
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2349.97,2354.63,That was the California Senator who wanted to show a Canadian film that was dubbed political propaganda.
2015.14-1504,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2354.63,2354.75,"Yeah, yeah."
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2381.09,2381.52,"Yeah, I --"
2015.14-1504,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2381.52,2390.61,"You have, in a State like Virginia, several million people who could attack any redistricting plan and any variation on any redistricting plan."
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2392.67,2394.69,"Justice Breyer, I don't think it means that."
2015.14-1504,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2401.94,2404.985,Special because it's more severe in degree?
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2404.985,2405.43,Yes.
2015.14-1504,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2409.25,2416.71,There is no case that -- the closest you can come is the case of a lobbyist who is complaining about his reputation.
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2416.71,2417.6,He wasn't a lobbyist.
2015.14-1504,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2418.49,2419.61,He was a State Senator. That's fine.
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2419.61,2421.89,"-- running for re-election, and I think that case is controlling."
2015.14-1504,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2422.27,2423.515,Is there anything better?
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2423.515,2427.85,I think that's the best case. Take a look at Footnote 8 of the brief that the government filed in that case.
2015.14-1504,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2427.85,2427.97,I did.
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2428.08,2436.98,The government argued in Meese v. Keene the damage to reputation isn't -- a damage to candidacy isn't enough because it depends on the actions of voters and third parties.
2015.14-1504,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2471.01,2475.04,Do -- do you think it's fair to characterize Forbes as an officious intermeddler?
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2475.04,2476.89,"Well, I don't mean to disparage him in any way."
2015.14-1504,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2477.49,2480.69,The future of his political career that he's had for 16 years.
2015.14-1504,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2480.69,2485.055,"That's exactly right, and that's why I think he has standing and why the Court should affirm on the merits."
2015.14-1504,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2485.055,2497.16,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Elias."
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,2497.16,2504.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State of Virginia has twice decided not to appeal the decision below."
2015.14-1504,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2571.45,2606.085,"Well, I don't want to impute -- impugn in any respect the motives of the Commonwealth of Virginia, but if it were the case that a State decided not to defend the Constitution, not to defend the legality of a districting plan that was adopted by the legislature, and that decision was made purely for partisan reasons, you would say that a number of -- that -- that an elected official or a candidate who was severely adversely affected by that should not be able to challenge it."
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,2606.085,2607.65,"That is -- that is correct, Your Honor."
2015.14-1504,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2624.16,2630.4,"What if the -- the decision -- and, again, this is not a -- I'm not saying this is about Virginia in this case."
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,2634.485,2635.34,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1504,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2635.88,2652.32,What if it were made for a racist reason? What if the reason for not defending the legality of this -- of the districting plan was a racist reason on the part of the State executive? You would say that an adversely affected member of Congress or candidate may not have standing?
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,2652.32,2658.41,"That is correct, Your Honor, because members of Congress simply don't have a legal interest in choosing their voters."
2015.14-1504,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2716.385,2730.29,"If the State had a plan designed to protect incumbency and it did not do that, could a -- a voter object to the fact that the incumbency rationale was not followed?"
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,2730.29,2730.89,So --
2015.14-1504,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2730.89,2736.91,Can voters assert an interest in preserving incumbency?
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,2736.91,2740.09,"So two -- two answers, Your Honor."
2015.14-1504,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2747.04,2759.38,"So then -- so then you have an -- an acknowledged interest on the part of this legislature, but -- that the -- the fact that the plan fails to accomplish that, no one -- nobody can object?"
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,2759.38,2781.09,"Well, it is interesting that in this case neither the Virginia State House nor the Virginia State Senate, both of whom are controlled by the same party as the members of Congress affected, neither body nor the legislature as a whole has chosen to intervene in this case, which is quite different than, for example, in the Arizona case that this Court handled -- resolved where it found --"
2015.14-1504,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2781.09,2783.615,"Under your view, could the legislature as a whole intervene?"
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,2783.615,2793.505,I think that the legislature could have intervened and would -- and would have a better claim to standing again under the -- the Arizona redistricting case that this Court decided.
2015.14-1504,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2793.505,2799.705,So a legislature who passes the law has greater standing than the individual who is affected by the law?
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,2799.705,2801.96,"Well, we are all affected by the law."
2015.14-1504,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2817.88,2823.58,"It sounds to me like it's incumbency, which is the very thing you say that this one individual cannot protect."
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,2828.84,2848.285,"So, Your Honor, one thing I want to clarify just from the record, it is not the case that we have conceded nor is it the case that the Court found, nor are the underlying facts of the case that the Virginia legislature endeavored to protect incumbents. What Mr. Janis said was quite specific."
2015.14-1504,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2870.31,2872.685,Race -- you say race is a proxy.
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,2888.925,2902.59,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I think that that is true in the circumstances in a case such as -- as Cromartie where the evidence, the direct evidence that race predominated was quite weak."
2015.14-1504,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2932.655,2933.0,No.
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,2964.215,2971.87,"So in this case, Your Honor, just as a factual matter, it was the person who sponsored the bill, the person who drew the map."
2015.14-1504,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2971.87,2972.79,Is that Janis?
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,2972.79,2973.31,Janis.
2015.14-1504,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2973.31,2976.375,"He wasn't in the legislature when this took -- was approved, was he?"
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,2976.375,2981.13,I believe he -- I believe he was at the -- at the time that the -- that the map was approved.
2015.14-1504,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2983.2,2991.43,"Well, I thought the -- the person who drafted the plan -- maybe I've got that mixed up."
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,2995.095,3020.38,"Well, Janis says that he -- that he -- in fact, I believe said that he in fact drafted the -- we may be talking against each other about the house -- the State house plan versus the -- the congressional plan. But in any event, the -- the fact is that if you look at Exhibit 57, which Mr. Raphael pointed to, what you see is that Professor McDonald did a very important calculation."
2015.14-1504,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3061.16,3074.41,"So you could have -- you think you could have drawn a map under Cromartie that would show if you wanted to protect incumbency or -- and Republican or Democratic advantage, you would have done this, and instead you did this?"
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,3074.41,3078.61,I don't think that that -- that the -- the question is whether we could have drawn a map.
2015.14-1504,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3084.84,3096.075,"Well, why isn't it the question where you could have drawn the map another way? Are -- are you saying that you can draw a map only by using race, then you can't draw the map? Is that your position? I can see where you could take that position, but is that what you're saying?"
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,3096.075,3096.365,Yeah.
2015.14-1504,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3138.405,3145.095,"Let's not forget that there was -- counsel, I'm over here -- you're skipping over it."
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,3149.78,3150.41,"Yes, it was --"
2015.14-1504,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3150.41,3151.765,-- if you had not used race.
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,3151.765,3152.01,Yeah.
2015.14-1504,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3152.01,3154.495,"That's the whole purpose of the exercise, correct?"
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,3154.495,3155.115,Correct.
2015.14-1504,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3155.115,3164.59,"If you're race neutral, you move people not on the basis of their skin color, but on some -- some neutral principle."
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,3173.79,3174.745,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-1504,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3174.745,3180.21,"Well, but if you moved those districts, then you'd have to move other districts to make up for -- for it."
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,3194.42,3197.885,I think that our burden was to show that race predominated.
2015.14-1504,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3209.97,3215.675,"If -- if race and partisanship are co-extensive, which one predominates?"
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,3215.675,3218.43,"Well, in a case where the legislature tells you?"
2015.14-1504,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3218.43,3219.165,"No, no."
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,3231.12,3242.875,"If -- if you had a circumstance where there was no other evidence other than these two factors, race and -- and partisanship, then essentially it's a tie, then neither predominates over the other."
2015.14-1504,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3242.875,3244.2,And who loses if it's a tie?
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,3244.2,3250.215,"We would lose -- we would lose if it's a tie, but in this case there is no tie. There's nothing even approaching a tie."
2015.14-1504,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3255.325,3262.97,Suppose the legislature had set the same number as what was referred to as the Benchmark Plan.
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,3273.66,3283.29,"Justice Ginsburg, if it was done as a mechanical threshold, then it would be subject to heightened scrutiny."
2015.14-1504,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3301.96,3322.05,"Is that what you're making it right on? Do you agree with the Solicitor General that a simple statement from the line drawers that they were trying the best they can to comply with the Voting Rights Act, that that is not sufficient to -- to have strict scrutiny apply?"
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,3322.05,3333.48,So I think that this Court in Alabama made clear that the fact that the State of Virginia may have been under the mistaken belief -- a good faith mistaken belief -- that it had to -- that it had to go to 55 percent --
2015.14-1504,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3333.48,3333.66,Yes.
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,3354.27,3354.75,"No, of course not."
2015.14-1504,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3362.79,3367.935,So what you think triggers strict scrutiny is essentially the use of a mechanical target here?
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,3367.935,3368.45,Correct.
2015.14-1504,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3368.74,3371.035,It's not related to the ability to elect?
2015.14-1504,2,62677,mark_e_elias,,3371.035,3371.79,Correct.
2015.14-1504,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3413.965,3425.225,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gershengorn."
2015.14-1504,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3425.225,3436.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to make two points on the merits, but I'd like to start where this Court is going to start, with standing. We believe that Appellants lack standing to appeal."
2015.14-1504,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3451.015,3458.77,Is that -- is that true when the legislature specifically has adopted incumbency protection as a matter of State law or a matter of State policy?
2015.14-1504,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3458.77,3468.56,"So Your Honor, I think if they had adopted, as a matter of State law, incumbency protection, that might be different, because then the legislature would have established that, actually, as a legally-cognizable right."
2015.14-1504,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3516.12,3529.56,"That's the area District 5, District 5 in the State which is heavily African-American and so imagined racist legislatures changed the whole district so they couldn't possibly elect an African-American."
2015.14-1504,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3534.265,3537.17,So a voter would have standing to contest it.
2015.14-1504,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3543.28,3544.8,"And as a congressman, not."
2015.14-1504,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3544.8,3547.53,"As a congressman, I think not, at least this Court has not said."
2015.14-1504,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3551.98,3560.865,"No, I know it's different, but what I'm looking for throughout is the -- I understand that there has been no case which discusses this -- that I've been able to find."
2015.14-1504,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3611.24,3611.85,Your Honor --
2015.14-1504,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3611.85,3612.81,That's what's worrying me.
2015.14-1504,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3612.81,3614.72,"And I think you're right to be worried about it, and I --"
2015.14-1504,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3614.72,3617.32,"Well, I knew you thought I would be, given your comments. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-1504,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3617.32,3621.87,Now I'm going to tell you why. See -- but I -- and I do think there are a couple of responses to that.
2015.14-1504,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3672.26,3673.97,"But if you -- yeah, I -- I'm sorry."
2015.14-1504,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3674.02,3680.205,"I was just going to say that we think Meese is very different, because Meese is not about choosing the voters in the district."
2015.14-1504,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3692.34,3703.135,"I guess I find this a little bit harder than you just suggested, because this is not Representative Forbes saying, I want to choose exactly the set of voters that's going to increase my own electoral chances."
2015.14-1504,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3720.865,3726.84,"Your Honor, I think it's for the same reason that this Court rejected that idea in the -- in Hays itself."
2015.14-1504,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3839.13,3857.13,"But, I mean, people have objected to some extent that Cromartie cut back on Shaw and Miller as well, and again, I just -- I, at least, would feel on much more solid ground if the plaintiffs had been put to the test of saying, show us. They say this isn't about partisanship; this is about race."
2015.14-1504,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3867.49,3885.35,"So, Your Honor, we think Cromartie is a very important case, but it actually is quite the -- the exact opposite of the situation here. We think Cromartie is the situation in which the legislator -- there was direct and substantial evidence that the legislature acted on the basis of politics, and statistics were put forward that said it's equally explained by race."
2015.14-1504,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3902.72,3905.55,"Well, okay, if there is evidence that race is at issue."
2015.14-1504,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3912.26,3914.73,But you're looking to see whether race was the motive.
2015.14-1504,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3924.105,3935.94,"So, Your Honor, I think -- it's obviously a difficult question, but I would say two things on that. First is, this Court's cases have been fairly unanimous in looking to the -- to the intent of the drafter."
2015.14-1504,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3978.77,3996.555,"What if the drafter or other members of the legislature say, race was our first consideration, and by that, what we mean is that we have to take race into account under the Voting Rights Act, and that's what we've done? Would that -- what would be the -- what would be the result there?"
2015.14-1504,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3996.555,4005.72,"So, Your Honor, I don't think that that necessarily results in strict scrutiny. What this Court has said over and over is that the -- that race must predominate."
2015.14-1504,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4031.345,4034.995,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Carvin, you have four minutes remaining."
2015.14-1504,4,35611,michael_a_carvin,,4034.995,4047.175,"I'd like to begin with Justice Kagan's questions. We've heard a constant theme that if it was done because of race, a post hoc political explanation doesn't justify it -- I fully agree with that -- with a mixed motive case here."
2015.14-1504,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4086.05,4107.37,"Well, I take the point, Mr. Carvin, but isn't that really exactly what we confronted in Alabama, which is -- you know, the number one priority was the VRA, but then it turned out that they had misunderstood the VIA, so it turned out that the number one priority was a racial quota, which had nothing to do with the way the VRA is really supposed to operate?"
2015.14-1504,4,35611,michael_a_carvin,,4107.37,4131.195,"That's fine, and that goes to narrow tailoring, but what we are trying to figure out here is whether or not there is a prima facie case. Now, assume with me that in 30 of the districts in Alabama, race was completely coextensive. They didn't assert politics, but with county lines. Would you ever say that race predominated over something or subordinated something when they are entirely coextensive? Let's take it out of the racial context. Compactness is number two; county lines are number three."
2015.14-1504,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4278.845,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
