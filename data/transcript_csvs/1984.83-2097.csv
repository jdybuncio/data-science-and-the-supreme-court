1984.83-2097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.66,We will hear arguments next in Burger King against Rudzewicz.
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,62.323,62.69,Thank you.
1984.83-2097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,370.924,381.299,That would be true of just a sale of a particular piece of equipment that is payable in Florida.
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,386.267,402.228,"I don't, although as we have indicated, the clear majority of Circuit Court decisions appear to indicate that it might be sufficient in a pure arm's length purchase and sale agreement which calls for the application of the substantive law of the forum."
1984.83-2097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,424.142,440.167,I don't think you would really argue that just a requirement that Florida law be applied to resolve any disputes would in itself be enough to confer jurisdiction in Florida.
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,440.167,440.869,--I think I agree.
1984.83-2097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,450.959,456.529,Your other two contracts really are the headquarters and an arbitration provision.
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,457.063,460.248,"--Well, there was the requirement of all the payments that he made to--"
1984.83-2097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,460.248,460.548,Right.
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,474.824,478.376,"--If the cause of action grew out of the contact, I would suggest that they could."
1984.83-2097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,479.978,480.678,Why is it tougher?
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,482.446,485.215,Because... it is not exactly the same thing.
1984.83-2097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,499.808,502.76,But that is control exercised in Michigan.
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,502.76,505.194,"No, I would respectfully disagree."
1984.83-2097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,534.461,539.765,"You have international franchisees, as I understand the record, London and some other places."
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,543.819,548.271,"--I don't know that we have ever attempted to do so, but I think the same arguments would apply."
1984.83-2097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,548.271,548.454,"Your theory would apply, wouldn't it?"
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,548.454,549.806,I think it would.
1984.83-2097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,564.832,567.265,"But that would be no different from your Michigan branch office, would it?"
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,567.265,572.383,--It would be if it were a policymaking body with independent decisionmaking authority.
1984.83-2097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,572.383,572.85,"Oh, I see."
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,572.85,574.469,"In this case, we do not have that."
1984.83-2097,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,609.858,614.912,"Mr. Perwin, just as a matter of curiosity, where was the defendant served?"
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,615.862,620.983,He was served under Florida's long arm statute by direct personal service in Michigan.
1984.83-2097,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,620.983,621.533,In Michigan?
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,621.533,623.1,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2097,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,623.1,641.746,"Mr. Perwin, it isn't clear to me, at least, whether Florida itself would apply the standards for personal jurisdiction that you apparently stipulated would be sufficient."
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,649.3,651.719,"Yes, there is some disagreement, Your Honor."
1984.83-2097,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,676.217,683.74,"Well, I guess the Court of Appeals itself recognized that it isn't clear in Florida law."
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,683.74,685.675,I would argue exactly the opposite.
1984.83-2097,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,689.81,697.15,The Court of Appeals accepted the parties' stipulation in lieu of a determination of what Florida law provides.
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,697.95,698.6,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2097,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,698.6,702.518,Do you think you can just stipulate to jurisdiction?
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,702.518,703.904,"No, Your Honor, I do not think--"
1984.83-2097,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,703.904,705.337,For our purposes?
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,705.337,710.474,--There certainly can be no stipulation to the jurisdiction of this Court.
1984.83-2097,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,729.502,738.81,It could make our decision just advisory if we are deciding it on the basis of your stipulation as to what Florida law is.
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,738.81,753.902,I would respectfully submit that the decision would not be on the basis of the parties' stipulation but on the basis of the Circuit Court's holding that given that stipulation the statute was unconstitutional as applied.
1984.83-2097,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,773.9,783.422,"Well, the Court of Appeals I thought did not hold that as a matter of state law the Florida statute would allow state courts to exercise jurisdiction."
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,783.422,784.339,That's correct.
1984.83-2097,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,797.781,800.031,"Mr. Perwin, why don't we call it the Court of Appeals?"
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,803.419,804.485,"I apologize, Your Honor."
1984.83-2097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.622,853.166,"Just to make sure I understand what you and Justice O'Connor have been talking about, the Court of Appeals majority opinion says that Rudzewicz concedes that his activities fall within the reach of the Florida long arm statute."
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,857.554,885.304,"Yes, Your Honor, that is what I am referring to, and what I find significant in that is that the Court of Appeals appeared to have accepted that concession rather than undertaking any scrutiny of the Florida decisions in this area, and thus far we have undertaken such scrutiny in our briefs and we have suggested that the clear majority of Florida decisions comport with the parties' agreement below."
1984.83-2097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1307.096,1317.738,Don't some states have some laws about franchises that Burger King would have to abide by if it was going to franchise?
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,1317.738,1318.187,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1318.187,1322.105,"Well, in that respect there wouldn't be any national uniformity."
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,1322.105,1329.442,"The only laws of which I am aware are comparable to that in Michigan, in which the--"
1984.83-2097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1329.442,1330.609,"Comparable, but not the same."
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,1330.609,1331.711,"--Not the same, no."
1984.83-2097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1332.077,1333.611,And there are some states that don't have them at all.
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,1333.611,1335.663,"--Yes, Your Honor, some states don't have them at all."
1984.83-2097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1352.207,1356.426,And whatever its contract said.
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,1356.426,1359.194,"Well, I suppose that's a choice of--"
1984.83-2097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1359.194,1365.615,"Well, I mean, absent that law, the validity of the contract would be governed by Florida law."
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,1365.615,1366.615,--Perhaps in the--
1984.83-2097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1366.615,1367.331,Is that right?
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,1367.331,1368.148,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1368.148,1374.804,"And under Michigan's law, under the franchise law in Michigan, it would be settled under Michigan law."
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,1375.904,1376.521,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1376.521,1377.154,All right.
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,1377.154,1382.041,But in this case my position is that there is no conflict between Florida law and Michigan law.
1984.83-2097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1423.218,1427.855,That in any event is a choice of law question rather than a jurisdictional question.
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,1427.855,1452.971,"Yes, it is, Your Honor, and what is relevant for the purposes of jurisdiction is not so much the question of what substantive law might apply as a product of that process, but rather that the parties put in their contract that they agree to comply with the law of the state of Florida, and therefore had reason to know that they were both invoking the benefits of Florida law and might be called to answer for breach of contract in a Florida court."
1984.83-2097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1463.945,1472.3,"My I just ask this question, just again limited to your point about your client's interest in a consistent interpretation of the law."
1984.83-2097,0,32427,joel_s_perwin,,1495.5,1512.859,"No, of course, it is not conceivable, but that does not undermine the objective of trying to create some centrality of decisions on the contract issues that exist between the parties, on the question of breach, on the measure of damages, on the expectations of the parties in a contractual relationship."
1984.83-2097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1577.635,1581.106,Very well.
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,1582.689,1596.198,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, an interesting aspect of this case, of course, is that the question of whether this is a direct appeal or not was suggested when the Court noted its probable jurisdiction."
1984.83-2097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1622.329,1623.579,"What do you mean, direct appeal?"
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,1623.579,1624.662,--An appeal.
1984.83-2097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.079,1626.331,Just an appeal?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,1626.331,1629.333,"Yes, an appeal as opposed to a petition for cert. Thank you, Justice White."
1984.83-2097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1631.185,1633.801,Did we not postpone jurisdiction?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,1633.801,1634.37,--Yes.
1984.83-2097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1643.993,1645.726,At least not take it for granted.
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,1645.726,1646.545,That's right.
1984.83-2097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1668.124,1670.81,Didn't they at least hold it unconstitutional as applied?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,1670.81,1672.076,"--Yes, they did, Justice White."
1984.83-2097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.076,1674.595,Isn't that the basis for an appeal?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,1674.595,1675.428,I think not.
1984.83-2097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1687.153,1696.358,Can you point to a single case that suggests that a holding that a statute is unconstitutional as applied is not a basis for an appeal?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,1696.358,1705.464,"No, I can't, because we had some struggle as we looked for the term or the phrase ""as applied"", to try to learn and be educated what the Court has meant by that in the past."
1984.83-2097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1705.464,1706.483,What about Donkey Walker?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,1708.449,1711.451,We think that if you apply it only to one--
1984.83-2097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1711.451,1712.637,How about Donkey Walker?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,1712.637,1714.203,"--I can't respond to that case, Justice Brennan."
1984.83-2097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1714.203,1722.326,"Well, I am afraid you are wasting your time, counsel, because that case seems to settle it."
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,1722.326,1726.211,"If that certainly is the sentiment of the Court, then it would settle it."
1984.83-2097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1726.211,1727.397,You do what you want to.
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,1727.397,1729.08,Thank you.
1984.83-2097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1779.328,1780.645,What about the contract clause?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,1782.53,1792.486,"--The contract had a choice of law provision, and it had a choice of forum provision for arbitration, but not for litigation."
1984.83-2097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.211,1841.233,"What if we disagree with you on that, and that there is a clause for the application of Florida law which is perfectly valid."
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,1844.752,1845.287,--I don't think we have.
1984.83-2097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1926.756,1929.208,Except to sign the contract.
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,1929.208,1942.699,"Except to sign the contract, Justice Marshall, the contract which did say that it was entered into and made in Florida, when the reality of the situation was, physically it was signed in Michigan, and Burger King then mailed it down to its headquarters people for signing."
1984.83-2097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1971.368,1974.42,"But, of course... I think the argument is a little bit different."
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,1986.728,1996.417,"We have to believe that this... Justice Rehnquist, that this is not a substantial enough contact to elevate itself to the level of a constitutionally imagined minimum contact."
1984.83-2097,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2020.199,2040.929,"Well, isn't it relevant in that regard that the contract envisioned a 20-year relationship with the Florida corporation, and the length and the detail of the involvement with that corporation seemed to make it foreseeable that your client might be hauled before the Florida court?"
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2040.929,2043.231,"I think not for this reason, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-2097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2094.349,2099.135,Can you assume that your client had legal advice before he signed this contract?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2099.135,2103.889,"In fact, our client did not have legal advice, but that is not in the record, Justice Marshall."
1984.83-2097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2125.218,2131.022,"He was in this to the extent of $180,000 and didn't have a lawyer?"
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2131.022,2131.489,--That's right.
1984.83-2097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2181.536,2189.709,Maybe it was the pendency of those cases that led them to draft a form of contract that required application of Florida law.
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2189.709,2194.446,"--I think in part it was, Justice Rehnquist, but I think what Burger King has had in mind--"
1984.83-2097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2194.446,2199.747,"Also, it may have been that they were being sued."
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2199.747,2203.218,"--As a matter of fact, in all of those cases they were defendants, Justice White."
1984.83-2097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2203.218,2205.018,That doesn't prove anything.
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2205.018,2220.93,"To we as lawyers it doesn't, and as the Court, but to a Certified Public Accountant who doesn't understand the difference between defendant and plaintiff, for him to read the fact that there are six out of seven cases in other states, I think, doesn't put him on notice that he could only expect to be used in Florida."
1984.83-2097,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.93,2225.465,Are you serious in saying a Certified Public Accountant doesn't know the difference between a plaintiff and a defendant?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2225.465,2230.536,I am not serious in only stopping at that point.
1984.83-2097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2274.778,2281.182,"It may well be that had your client chosen to initiate litigation, he could have sued in Michigan."
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2284.367,2284.783,I agree.
1984.83-2097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2284.783,2288.121,But that doesn't mean that only Michigan could take jurisdiction.
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2288.121,2299.327,"You are right in your analysis that we could have sued in Michigan had we been quicker to the draw, but we don't think that Florida should take jurisdiction here because there is no continuous and systematic doing of business in the State of Florida."
1984.83-2097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2361.468,2364.336,Does that theme come through from any of the cases of this Court?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2364.336,2365.469,"No, they haven't."
1984.83-2097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2368.287,2371.823,"If they had gone to arbitration, where would the arbitration have been conducted?"
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2371.823,2380.327,"In Florida, as far as we can tell, Mr. Chief Justice, because of the choice of forum provision, because parties can contract, of course, to go to a different state."
1984.83-2097,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2401.843,2406.061,Are you contending this is a contract of adhesion?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2407.246,2410.881,"We have made that allegation throughout our litigation at every level, Justice Blackmun."
1984.83-2097,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2410.881,2411.898,Are you arguing that here?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2411.898,2414.566,"Yes, we have argued that in our brief."
1984.83-2097,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2436.497,2443.67,"You have an experienced businessman with a substantial amount of money invested, and a Certified Public Accountant on top of that."
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2443.67,2444.37,That is right.
1984.83-2097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2488.915,2492.4,You say that... you contend this is a contract of adhesion.
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2498.487,2499.939,"Only this, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.83-2097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2517.301,2521.77,You say you should ignore it.
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2523.788,2547.403,"First of all, we have argued that we think it is unlawful to force the parties to go to Florida just because... because Michigan law... because there are no contacts there, but to the extent you wish to give some weight to the fact that the parties openly and voluntarily negotiated and agreed on a choice of law forum... choice of law provision, we don't think there was any... there was no bargaining, and so I think you can ignore giving any weight to that aspect of the contract."
1984.83-2097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2547.403,2560.913,"So you say then perhaps there should be a trial, I suppose... perhaps your opponent would dispute what you say... on the issue of whether there was some sort of economic duress in signing a... before you decide whether a state could take jurisdiction or not?"
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2560.913,2562.713,"No, we don't say that."
1984.83-2097,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2592.616,2599.472,"Yes, but going back to your contract of adhesion argument, the District Court in this case found that there was no economic duress."
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2599.472,2599.972,That's right.
1984.83-2097,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2599.972,2601.555,Doesn't that blow that out of the water?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2603.49,2606.526,"No, and we are really not asking you to take that up as an issue."
1984.83-2097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2644.151,2659.493,"Well, you feel it would be different then if instead of a franchise agreement this were... all the facts, but it were a merger agreement between Wendy's, which was doing business only in Michigan but had a huge net worth, and Burger King?"
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2659.493,2661.362,"I am sorry, I don't follow you, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.83-2097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2661.362,2682.359,"Let's assume that your client, instead of being a CPA who didn't know the difference between a plaintiff and a defendant, was actually a very, very substantial Michigan businessman who had a net worth of millions in all sorts of business enterprise all through Michigan, but the facts of this case were exactly the same."
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2682.359,2682.809,Yes.
1984.83-2097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2682.809,2684.894,You say the result should be different.
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2684.894,2696.701,"Yes, I think the result should be different in this sense, that just because someone has a great net worth and happens to be a CPA doesn't necessarily put him on notice about the fine points of jurisdiction or venue."
1984.83-2097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2696.701,2706.391,"But I thought your argument a moment ago was that because Burger King was able to have such a big operation, it could pay attorneys' fees much more easily than your client."
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2708.759,2718.949,"Yes, it is, and build into their cost of running the franchise enough money to pay for their going to Michigan, because they are already in Michigan and they have local attorneys in Michigan anyway."
1984.83-2097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2740.326,2745.23,"Now, is there any one of our cases on minimum contact that supports that view?"
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2745.23,2746.33,"No, there is not, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.83-2097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2757.119,2764.208,"Do I understand your theory that when a fat cat is sued by a small cat, the fat cat has to pay?"
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2764.208,2775.163,"--No, we are just saying that when the fat cat sues the small cat, the fat cat is in a better position to build into the cost of taxing the franchisee enough money to pay for the litigation."
1984.83-2097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2775.163,2776.615,And therefore he has to pay.
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2776.615,2778.515,"No, not that he has to pay."
1984.83-2097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2782.003,2782.686,So What?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2784.103,2787.555,--This is... I guess this gets us down to the... who pays?
1984.83-2097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2794.811,2797.679,Is it any different from any other contract?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2800.548,2801.115,"Right, sir."
1984.83-2097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2801.115,2805.535,"And if you fail to put in your protection, you are unprotected."
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2805.535,2806.352,That's right.
1984.83-2097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2808.736,2815.224,"If you fail to put in there that you should be tried in Michigan only, you have lost it."
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,2815.224,2818.926,Only if one can agree that people can contract jurisdiction away.
1984.83-2097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3037.467,3040.919,"That may sound good, but what about arbitration?"
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,3046.29,3048.175,I agree that we would have to go to Florida to arbitrate.
1984.83-2097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3048.175,3049.941,"The 1,200 miles."
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,3051.377,3051.81,That is right.
1984.83-2097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3062.666,3063.835,I don't know what you would say.
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,3067.737,3068.27,Yes.
1984.83-2097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3068.27,3073.556,And you didn't live up to the arbitrator's award.
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,3075.742,3076.658,"I think so, Justice White."
1984.83-2097,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3133.781,3137.149,Wasn't he sued for failing to make payments?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,3137.149,3138.016,"--Yes, he was."
1984.83-2097,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3138.016,3140.351,And the payments were to be made in Florida?
1984.83-2097,1,43161,thomas_h_oehmke,,3140.351,3145.903,"Yes, he was, Justice O'Connor, and he was brought into Florida on the sole basis that he had failed to send his check."
1984.83-2097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3215.565,3215.949,Very well.
1984.83-2097,2,32427,joel_s_perwin,,3217.184,3219.184,"A few points, Your Honor, if I may."
1984.83-2097,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3257.89,3266.83,"May I just ask on this sort of fat cat-small cat argument, would it be a different case if he just owned a mom and pop grocery store?"
1984.83-2097,2,32427,joel_s_perwin,,3266.83,3268.615,--Yes.
1984.83-2097,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3268.615,3271.966,"You think you would not have jurisdiction, even if you had all your other factors?"
1984.83-2097,2,32427,joel_s_perwin,,3271.966,3274.335,"Well, a mom and pop grocery store is not a franchise."
1984.83-2097,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3274.335,3289.778,"But they had a contract to be able to use the name, whatever, some franchise product, as a lot of them do, saying, and any dispute of it will be governed by Florida law, and we will arbitrate in Florida if we have to, and wouldn't it be the same case?"
1984.83-2097,2,32427,joel_s_perwin,,3289.778,3298.201,"Yes, it would, if the plaintiff had the same measure of control over the activities of the enterprise."
1984.83-2097,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3298.201,3299.917,"Correct, with respect to the product in dispute."
1984.83-2097,2,32427,joel_s_perwin,,3299.917,3305.871,"With respect to the product, and it weren't simply an arm's length purchase and sale agreement which included a license."
1984.83-2097,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3337.308,3340.694,"Just to boil it down, you really don't rely on the fact that he had $1 million."
1984.83-2097,2,32427,joel_s_perwin,,3340.694,3342.146,"No, it is just rebuttal."
1984.83-2097,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3342.146,3344.329,"If he were bankrupt, it would be the same case."
1984.83-2097,2,32427,joel_s_perwin,,3344.329,3345.348,If he were--
1984.83-2097,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3345.348,3347.331,Or just on the fringe.
1984.83-2097,2,32427,joel_s_perwin,,3347.331,3350.751,"--If the facts were otherwise the same, yes."
1984.83-2097,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3351.784,3354.286,If the contractual relationship was otherwise the same.
1984.83-2097,2,32427,joel_s_perwin,,3354.286,3354.769,--Yes.
1984.83-2097,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3367.094,3379.502,"It is quite important, because the question whether a wealthy man has a right to move for want of jurisdiction on a different standard than one who doesn't have much money is really a fairly important question of whether we administer the law with an even hand."
1984.83-2097,2,32427,joel_s_perwin,,3379.502,3383.223,"I agree, and a fairly disturbing implication."
1984.83-2097,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3392.662,3406.402,"I take your argument on that point to mean that a CPA making $170,000 a year with a net worth of $1 million is sufficiently sophisticated to have arm's length dealing with anybody."
1984.83-2097,2,32427,joel_s_perwin,,3406.402,3429.185,"I would agree, Your Honor, and I believe so, and in this case that arm's length dealing produced a contract which called for an intimate 20-year relationship controlled by a company whose finest details were controlled by a company based in Florida and entitled to the protection of a Florida law which sought to preserve its business, its legitimate business expectations."
1984.83-2097,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3457.002,3458.219,"Thank you, gentlemen."
