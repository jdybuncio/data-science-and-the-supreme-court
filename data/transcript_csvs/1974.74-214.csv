1974.74-214,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,39.393,"We'll hear arguments next in 74-214, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare against Salfi."
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,40.916,43.782,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-214,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,105.094,111.159,"Mrs. Shapiro do you know that the reason for the nine months, why is it nine rather than 10 or 12?"
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,111.159,125.081,"Well, the indication is that Congress felt that nine months was long enough to deter marriages designed to obtain benefits."
1974.74-214,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,147.505,150.03,Is it related to the period of gestation?
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,150.03,153.642,Not so far as I know.
1974.74-214,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,153.642,157.205,I know.
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,157.205,175.767,The court below found that the nine-month eligibility requirement was unconstitutional because it thought that it established a conclusive presumption that shorter marriages are undertaken to secure benefits.
1974.74-214,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,214.074,219.301,Does that depend to some extent on a state by state analysis?
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,219.301,219.731,No.
1974.74-214,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,219.731,224.003,Are there some states in which the stepfather has no obligation at all?
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,224.003,226.112,The Social Security Act requires --
1974.74-214,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,226.112,227.07,State law although --
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,227.07,236.475,"Yes, but the social security doesn't make the eligibility turn on the state law requirements."
1974.74-214,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,236.667,244.504,"Mrs. Shapiro, if what you just said is so, why is there the exception in the statute for death by accident?"
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,244.504,277.118,"Well, this reflects one of the important factors in the Social Security Act that the -- each specific provision reflects the interrelation and the resultant effect of many different policies that the general policy may -- having this exception because of other policies which are impinge."
1974.74-214,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,338.05,347.243,Is that in your view then a distinction between a death by accident and one by surprising heart attack is a policy decision?
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,347.243,349.262,Yes.
1974.74-214,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,349.262,352.443,Even though the wage earner might be 33?
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,352.443,379.003,"That's -- well, the other basic -- the Congress in these duration of marriage requirements was looking at the problems of the question of motivations for entering into valid marriages."
1974.74-214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,509.452,515.331,(Inaudible) is the United States satisfied there was jurisdiction in the District Court rule?
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,515.331,530.911,We are not satisfied that there was jurisdiction for -- to the extent that it imposed a -- identified a class and required retroactive payments to all members of the class.
1974.74-214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,530.911,534.719,What about the jurisdictional amount?
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,534.719,535.132,Well --
1974.74-214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,535.132,538.74,"The United States made a motion, I gather to dismiss?"
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,538.74,539.368,Yes.
1974.74-214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,539.368,541.004,Based on the --
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,541.004,543.071,"Well, the -- its --"
1974.74-214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,543.071,547.629,"Well, does the -- is it possible that the plaintiff, each plaintiff could recover more than $10,000.00?"
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,547.629,548.662,It's possible.
1974.74-214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,568.477,572.71,What's (Inaudible)?
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,572.71,590.394,The payment of benefits to the survivors of accident victims without -- immediately doesn't undercut the deterrent purpose of the statute.
1974.74-214,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,611.221,615.634,I suppose you can have a problem as to whether it is by accident?
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,615.634,616.658,Well --
1974.74-214,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,616.658,618.527,What does the department do?
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,618.527,633.968,"Ordinarily I think that the fact that it was by accident would appear on the death certificate, that in the vast majority of these cases, the fact of an accidental death is pretty much self-evident."
1974.74-214,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,633.968,638.148,Is suicide excluded?
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,644.237,647.981,I am not sure whether suicide is excluded.
1974.74-214,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,647.981,653.124,"Or whether after an automobile collision, the victim has a heart attack and dies, is that by accident?"
1974.74-214,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,653.124,662.065,"Well, the death definition of accident in the Act says it has to be solely by external causes."
1974.74-214,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,662.66,670.691,Always the same definition and always the same litigation?
1974.74-214,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,670.691,677.182,But unexpected death from natural causes is far more difficult to identify.
1974.74-214,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,706.465,708.489,Mrs. Shapiro let me interrupt you once again.
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,725.592,727.394,Well --
1974.74-214,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,727.394,730.416,(Voice Overlap) changed?
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,730.416,756.086,The function of this provision in this Act is to deter the entering into marriages in order to obtain benefits and I believe it's the deterrent purpose of the statute that distinguishes it.
1974.74-214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,885.245,889.328,"I gather, there is no stipulation here as there was in Wiesenfeld this morning?"
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,889.328,889.559,That's right.
1974.74-214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,889.559,891.928,And that -- it would be futile to exhaust remedies?
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,891.928,892.172,No.
1974.74-214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,894.452,897.283,"But that would make a difference, isn't it?"
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,897.283,899.82,"Well, it would make a difference as to the --"
1974.74-214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,899.82,904.005,"Well, you didn't argue -- you didn't argue sovereign immunity in Wiesenfeld?"
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,904.005,904.26,"No, we did not."
1974.74-214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,904.26,908.243,"I wondered why, because of the stipulation?"
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,908.243,911.614,Apparently because Wiesenfeld wasn't a class action.
1974.74-214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,912.719,921.126,"Wiesenfeld was a -- there was a provision of the order we affirmed this morning, requiring back payment of those benefits?"
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,921.126,925.053,Well -- that's the problem that we're addressing here.
1974.74-214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,925.053,928.756,"Well, I'm just wondering why you didn't raise it, you didn't --"
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,928.756,928.973,No.
1974.74-214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,929.351,935.994,"And I wondered if the stipulation of that, it would've been futile in the case at the issue then to exhaust it."
1974.74-214,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,937.179,938.349,No.
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1099.967,1102.485,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-214,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1138.681,1144.139,(Inaudible)
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1144.139,1163.752,I would also like to respond just briefly to the allegations here that a justification maybe offered for the ninth-month rule in terms either of deterrents or of proving dependency of the stepchild and the widow upon the husband.
1974.74-214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1254.316,1258.673,Has there been much doubt in the past whether they could get the money back?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1258.673,1259.405,I beg your pardon Your Honor?
1974.74-214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1259.405,1265.695,Has there been much doubt in the past that they could get the money back in your hypothetical or your illustration?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1265.695,1273.781,"There certainly has been some doubt, although I understand that the law applies equally Your Honor whether they get the money back or not."
1974.74-214,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1280.253,1305.645,"In your case of the terminal illness person and you say that nobody loses anything, but if the purpose of the thing is to deter that kind of marriages for the benefit, I would presume that the putative spouse who is going to marriage -- marry the terminally ill person would be a little less likely to do it if she knew that he had to last nine months?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1305.645,1315.163,"She might be a little less likely to do it Your Honor, but if the marriage is a sham which is what this rule is directed at, I don't see why she really would."
1974.74-214,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1322.019,1329.674,"Well, but some consequences certainly attach to marriage other than getting Social Security benefits?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1329.674,1338.711,"Yes, Your Honor, but I don't see that any of the deleterious consequences would apply such as they may be speaking as a bachelor."
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1489.1,1496.274,"Well, how about a -- suppose Congress made a judgment that it was a -- and that was a chance that they should take some precautions against it?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1496.274,1497.819,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1514.605,1523.645,"Well let's assume there was evidence that a -- of a substantial incidence of fraudulent claims, would that make a difference to you?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1523.645,1527.273,It would not make a difference to our conclusive presumption argument Your Honor but it would make a difference --
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1527.273,1528.731,"Well, (Voice Overlap) arguing it?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1528.731,1530.989,Pardon?
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1530.989,1532.249,Why are you arguing that?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1532.249,1547.823,"We also rest this case on an equal protection argument Your Honor and we feel that a classification is per se unreasonable where it is so over broad -- well, to give an example, a classification would --"
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1547.823,1564.883,Are you -- you're suggesting Congress in a law may not classify -- may not treat a group was a class unless every single member of the group shares the same characteristics?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1564.883,1575.476,"Absolutely not Your Honor, but we think that a classification is fatally over broad if it tosses out 99 innocent people to catch one malefactor."
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.476,1577.294,"Well, what if it were the other way around?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1577.294,1581.172,If it were the other way around we think that it might well be acceptable.
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1581.172,1584.267,"Well, what, on both equal protection and (Voice Overlap) --"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1584.267,1585.392,No Your Honor.
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1587.221,1589.457,"Well, what about the conclusive presumption in that case?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1589.457,1596.401,A conclusively presumption Your Honor is unconstitutional unless (Voice Overlap) --
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1596.401,1604.0,Then you are saying Congress cannot classify in this way unless every single member of the class shares the trade?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1604.0,1610.648,"For the purposes of the conclusive presumption doctrine, Your Honor, a conclusive presumption must be universally true."
1974.74-214,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1610.648,1612.883,Why on Stanley against Illinois on this -- that argument?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1612.883,1618.263,I certainly do Your Honor as well as upon Vlandis and upon LaFleur.
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.263,1634.589,"Stanley against Illinois and those cases had some, not Vlandis but Stanley against Illinois specifically said that there was a kind of a special relationship that it -- that required some kind of special scrutiny?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1634.589,1636.494,"Well, Your Honor I --"
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1636.494,1638.232,And what is it here?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1638.232,1639.687,I do not --
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1639.687,1641.561,The marriage.[Attempt to Laughter]
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1641.561,1644.087,"Well, Your Honor there is as your colleague --"
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.087,1652.536,"And what -- I'd like to know what -- I'd like to know what your answer is to Justice Stewart's question besides, Mr. Justice Stewart's answer?[Laughter]"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1652.536,1657.151,I always attempt to rely upon Mr. Justice Stewart whenever I can Your Honor.[Attempt to Laughter]
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1657.151,1659.545,"Well, and on any other justice whenever you can?[Laughter]"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1659.545,1664.208,Absolutely Your Honor.
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1664.208,1665.099,So what is your answer?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1665.099,1670.193,"We do not believe that other than marriage, there is a special relationship."
1974.74-214,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1689.908,1696.617,"I take it in your answer to Justice White, you're really reaching for unattainable perfection, aren't you?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1696.617,1697.58,No Your Honor.
1974.74-214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1853.44,1866.245,Would it be fatally over broad if Congress eliminated the benefits entirely on the theory that they didn't want to get into deciding how many people of the total number were malefactors as you put?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1866.245,1873.503,"I -- you mean if -- if you're asking Your Honor whether Congress could eliminate benefits to widows entirely, it certainly could, yes."
1974.74-214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1873.503,1875.034,In these circumstances?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1875.034,1875.923,In these circumstances?
1974.74-214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1875.923,1878.089,Yeah.
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1878.089,1880.721,I -- I'm -- you mean --
1974.74-214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1880.721,1882.708,Just simply say no benefits at all.
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1886.584,1889.145,"I'm a little uncertain, you mean, whenever a person died of --"
1974.74-214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1889.145,1890.305,"No, no."
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1895.673,1898.969,"Well, Congress definitely could eliminate all widows' benefits, Your Honor."
1974.74-214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1898.969,1902.82,"Very definitely over breadth, isn't it?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1902.82,1910.986,"Well, at that point Your Honor I think that Congress would've made a substantive decision that it didn't want to have widows' benefits."
1974.74-214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1910.986,1921.381,"What you say is that they can't make one, they can't try to slice it as thin as they sliced it here when the knife cuts some innocent people?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1921.381,1922.285,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1930.171,1948.296,"And what the -- the next Congress could've made a judgment that a person or widow, a wife who's been married for nine months or a year or two years is more entitled to benefits than one who's only been married for a day or a week."
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1948.296,1948.51,Congress --
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1948.51,1950.29,And might need them more?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1950.29,1953.962,"Congress might have made that judgment Your Honor, but Congress didn't make that judgment --"
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1953.962,1961.827,"Well, what if they didn't but they could've?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1961.827,1964.205,That doesn't have anything to do with our case Your Honor.
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1964.205,1967.475,Well it does in the class of equal protection terms.
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1974.018,1974.651,"Well, Your Honor --"
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1974.651,1976.563,And you save the law with it?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,1976.563,1985.159,"I can only say with regard to that that would -- as to the children's benefits, make this statute a redundancy."
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2002.105,2016.514,"Well, I would suppose that arguably Congress could've decided that the wife has only been married a short time, are more confident to take care of themselves, their husband died than if they have been married longer?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2016.514,2022.345,"Well, Your Honor, if it had that with itself have been a conclusive presumption that would've raised certain problems."
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2033.206,2034.038,That's legally?
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2034.038,2034.753,Yeah.
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2034.753,2037.41,"Well not just legally Your Honor, factually."
1974.74-214,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2055.634,2067.261,"But if she quits her job at the time she is married and tries to go back to that or a similar job a month afterward, she's going to have an easier time than she's been out -- if she has been off the market for a year, isn't she?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2067.261,2069.491,"Marginally Your Honor, yes."
1974.74-214,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2069.502,2079.565,"Well, isn't Congress entitled to take into consideration this kind of things that you -- you say are marginal when its drafting anything as this, much of a tapestry as a Social Security Act?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2079.565,2087.899,"Well, Your Honor I would concede that Congress would be entitled to take this things into consideration."
1974.74-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.244,2202.563,So far?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2202.563,2204.349,"So far, yes Your Honor."
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2291.14,2294.288,Is this an argument of that itself as a waiver of sovereign immunity?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2294.288,2295.62,No Your Honor.
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2297.471,2298.637,(Inaudible)
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2298.637,2323.372,Whether it is a waiver or not we believe that the court was entitled to an order -- to order and its order is entitled to be affirmed insofar as it simply requires the Social Security Administration to treat the members of the Salfi class the way it would treat anyone else who came in and showed that they had erroneously been denied benefits.
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2323.372,2334.827,Because you -- I gather you say here if the -- that SSA had admitted that it did made a mistake in this case then the operation of that regulation would've paid these benefits back to the date of Mr. Salfi's death?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2334.827,2335.482,Yes Your Honor.
1974.74-214,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2347.95,2361.018,"Are there any members of this class who'd -- have not -- would not have been in compliance with Section 402 (j) (1), the one that limits it to a one year before the application?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2361.018,2388.769,"I would imagine that their -- according the estimate of SSA which we accept because we have no facts on the matter, although I don't know how they came about theirs, there were 20,000 members of the class, approximately over a six year period, presumably a substantial number of those class members are before that six-year period."
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2505.542,2512.223,Is that – would there be a reduction of benefits if Mrs. Salfi were working and earning?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2512.223,2513.491,I believe there would be Your Honor.
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2513.491,2518.486,"As -- that same that we had in Wiesenfeld, a dollar for every dollars there?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2518.486,2519.079,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2519.366,2519.783,(Inaudible)
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2519.783,2524.182,"-- if she were able to work, if she went completely disabled, she wouldn't be on disability and shouldn't be eligible at all."
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2524.182,2529.148,"Well, (Voice Overlap) in this class and maybe many will have to go to work, they haven't been getting any benefit (Voice Overlap) --"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2529.148,2541.378,Yes Your Honor [Attempt to Laughter] that's probably true and their lack of benefits might even have some relationship to my comment that some of them may no longer be around.
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2662.169,2677.539,"Well, if -- going to -- that's the whole story Mr. Kates, after all there was a stipulation and I tried to get, I couldn't from Mrs. Shapiro when relied on that as the reason they never raised this sovereign immunity question in Wiesenfeld?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2677.539,2678.641,"Well, Your Honor the --"
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2678.641,2682.512,"But the fact is they did and you don't have a similar stipulation here, do you?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2682.512,2686.809,They stipulated that they had no jurisdiction to decide constitutional issues.
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2687.105,2688.246,"(Voice Overlap) to their agency, has it?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2688.246,2688.675,Right.
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2690.549,2691.814,(Voice Overlap) stipulation in Wiesenfeld.
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2699.743,2702.171,"Well, they stipulated that it would be futile, yes Your Honor."
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2708.402,2717.108,"Well, may I ask this, do you read 405 (g) as waiving sovereign immunity, whatever its fact may weigh, conditionally upon the exhaustion of remedies?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2717.108,2719.605,"No Your Honor, we do not, not at all."
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2755.595,2761.443,"(Voice Overlap) for back payments, do you regard the suit you brought as a suit under 405 (g)?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2761.443,2762.096,Yes Your Honor.
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2765.925,2781.29,"Because 408 says that -- because they got it misstated when they talk about -- what is it, Section 7142, but that there's no other avenue for this kind of recovery except the 405 (g) recovery, hasn't it?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2781.29,2781.846,No.
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2797.861,2801.494,I'm limiting to the question I asked because it was limited to this back benefits?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2801.494,2803.672,"These back benefits, we believe that --"
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2803.672,2805.515,That's still 1331?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2805.515,2811.566,The waiver of sovereign immunity in our position Your Honor is that it is either of two things.
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2826.866,2854.863,"Well, what bothers me on your first argument is, in this -- and to the extent you're going before back benefits, is the provision of 405 (h) which says, “that no proceeding shall be brought under -- I forgotten the exact language -- Section 71 of 28 or 42 U.S.C., I forgot which one, 28 I think, was apparently from history, 71 is all of the --"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2854.863,2857.945,"Well, that would include 1331 Your Honor."
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2857.945,2858.464,That's right.
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2858.464,2861.01,And that's what Wiesenfeld was brought under.
1974.74-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2867.397,2874.974,"Well, the Court (Voice Overlap) because the Government didn't raise it, we didn't have to wrestle with it in Wiesenfeld, but I suppose we could in this case?"
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2874.974,2877.977,Very well Your Honor.
1974.74-214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2904.13,2906.216,Have you covered this in your brief?
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2906.216,2908.222,"No, we have not covered this point in our brief."
1974.74-214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2908.222,2910.082,We'll give you a minute to do it very briefly.
1974.74-214,1,21099,don_b_kates_jr,,2912.324,2916.295,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1974.74-214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2980.75,2982.655,Thank you Mr. Kates.
1974.74-214,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2988.769,2994.575,The stipulation in the District Court was to the facts.
1974.74-214,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3068.827,3070.156,"Well, average is --"
1974.74-214,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3070.156,3070.757,Average --
1974.74-214,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3070.757,3072.182,"(Voice Overlap) jurisdiction, do they?"
1974.74-214,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3072.182,3072.943,"No, they don't."
1974.74-214,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3084.61,3089.927,"Well, didn't (Inaudible) last year hold that each member of the class had to meet the $10,000.00 requirement?"
1974.74-214,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3089.927,3091.375,"That's right, it did."
1974.74-214,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3132.68,3135.006,Thank you Mrs. Shapiro.
