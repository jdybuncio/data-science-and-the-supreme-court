1966.53,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,7.924,National Labor Relations Board petitioner versus C & C Plywood Corporation.
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,9.043,12.229,Mr. Chief Justice and may have pleased the Court.
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,271.306,281.365,Has the company ever claimed that this action would not have been an unfair labor practice even if there had been no premium pay provision on the contract?
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,281.365,295.573,"I don't believe so Mr. Justice that the whole controversy from the company's point of view has turned on their claim that under this provision of the contract, it was -- they were justified in what they did."
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,334.099,352.238,So what would be the Government's position if these two parties in fact really agreed to permit the Government or permit the employer to raise wages whenever he wanted to?
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,352.238,373.228,"Well this would -- this Mr. Justice would present a difficult problem which I will come to the implication to this in a minute because our basic position in this case is that an employer cannot, without bargaining with the Union under Section 8 (a)(5) unilaterally change terms and conditions of employment."
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,373.228,376.233,It can't be that the Union agreed in advance to let them do it?
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,376.233,388.969,"Well, the Union has the right to waive rights under the contract and the question in that case would be, whether what was done was sufficient in all the circumstances to constitute a waiver."
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,405.071,421.494,"Well in this particular case, if a court or this Court found that this factual provision justified the plan that the employer -- covered the plan, that the employer actually put in, would the Government -- is that in the case as far as you are concerned?"
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,421.494,423.987,We don't think that is in the case Mr. Justice.
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,423.987,425.789,I thought that that's in the case?
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,425.789,427.997,Is that end -- well the Board wouldn't think so.
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,430.731,433.287,That's the only issue that's here though.
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,433.287,434.227,"No, Mr. Justice."
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,438.709,454.209,I understand -- I understand that but let's assume that they do have the authority and they did it wrong and that the contract doesn't mean what the Board said it means and that the contract really permits this plan.
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,454.209,455.435,"Well, if --"
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,455.435,458.579,And then -- then that's the end of the case as far as the Board's concerned.
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,458.579,467.858,"If -- if this Court would hold that this provision of the contract does not -- does permit this plan, I would seem that that would be the end of the case but what I'm suggesting Mr. Justice is --"
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,467.858,474.553,"Well, I know that's -- that's my question."
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,474.553,478.308,And then I'm coming back a moment to what the Board held in this case.
1966.53,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,734.809,739.633,"Now, the employer here as I understand it says, “We did bargain."
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,755.87,775.254,"Well that Mr. Justice, the Union -- it isn't that the Union is asking the Employer to bargain -- our position is that during the term of the collective bargaining agreement, if the employer attempts unilaterally without bargaining with the Union to make any substantial modifications in that thing, he cannot do it."
1966.53,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,775.254,785.027,"Well of course, the employer's position is, I'm not making any modifications in the contract, I'm simply doing what I was permitted to do as a result of our previous collective bargaining."
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,785.027,788.777,"That's right, but that I would suggest Mr. Justice is a defense basically."
1966.53,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,789.479,793.99,"Well, what I wonder what the point of collective bargaining is, if you can never reach a bargain that sticks."
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,793.99,797.043,"Well, you can Mr. Justice if they had reached the bargain."
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,939.207,960.7,"Well, speaking of the Employer (Inaudible)."
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,960.7,967.51,"Well, let me -- I'm going to have to answer your -- answer you Mr. Justice in two stages."
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,987.312,993.066,Employer said (Inaudible)
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,993.066,993.755,Well then it's --
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.755,994.989,They can't do it.
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,994.989,1001.102,Then it seems to me Mr. Justice -- then the employer has satisfied his duty under this order to bargain.
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1001.577,1002.369,(Inaudible)
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1002.369,1002.694,Pardon?
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1002.694,1003.561,(Inaudible)
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1003.561,1009.466,"In this case, what happened was, the employer without consulting with the Union inaugurated this plan."
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1027.205,1036.066,But what happened after the (Inaudible)?
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1036.066,1037.731,That is correct under this case.
1966.53,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1167.475,1177.373,"This goes to, this goes to -- this argument goes to the merit so to speak, i.e. to whether or not this collective bargaining agreement permitted the employer to do what he did."
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1177.373,1177.751,This goes
1966.53,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1177.751,1179.611,And those covered by the provision in the --
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1179.611,1185.826,This goes to the merit but also I was also tending to show that the change that was made here was a very significant change.
1966.53,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1193.707,1204.872,"Well, it doesn't it still go to the question of whether or not the employer on this collective bargaining agreement in that provision that permits him to pay premium pay, whether or not that provision covered what he did here."
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1204.872,1206.131,"Yes, that's correct."
1966.53,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1301.005,1304.143,"Mr. Friedman, have we had occasion to interpret 10 (a)?"
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1304.143,1306.321,10 (a)?
1966.53,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1306.321,1307.429,Here.
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1314.047,1331.555,I don't remember any case on that Mr. Justice.
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1347.182,1349.913,"We talked about it in Smith, didn't we?"
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1349.913,1354.576,I think so Mr. Justice and also I think in Carey-Westinghouse.
1966.53,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1390.634,1411.415,"Did I understand you to say earlier Mr. Friedman in response to Justice White's question that if the Court interpreted this provision as the company interprets it, that this nevertheless was not preclude the Board from proceeding?"
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1411.415,1412.316,That's correct.
1966.53,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1416.073,1421.114,"Do you remember that, it's not the Court, the same agency -- remember the Texas Gas Transmission case?"
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1421.114,1422.224,"No, I'm afraid I don't."
1966.53,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1422.224,1439.908,"Now, that was involved with Federal Power Commission in 363, where we held with the -- an interpretation of an agreement by the Federal Power Commission was not to be regarded as something within its expertise so called."
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1468.108,1477.971,"Well, I would -- we'll allow to deference Mr. Justice, I would suggest that when we're dealing with this kind of a problem, the Board's expertise should be given great weight."
1966.53,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1480.581,1482.555,Now this is independently of the 10(a) argument --
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1482.555,1484.357,This is independently of the 10 (a) argument.
1966.53,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1489.78,1492.629,"Well, I don't I recall that there was any comparable --"
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1492.629,1494.305,I don't believe.
1966.53,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1636.951,1653.372,"Mr. Friedman, how would you state the principle for which your contending here that is to say you've told us that you don't contend that the Board has general power to interpret collective bargaining agreements."
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1653.372,1654.847,That's correct.
1966.53,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1654.847,1660.528,"On the other hand, the Board does have the power with respect to unfair labor practices."
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1667.97,1682.269,"Well, I would say Mr. Justice that where it is necessary to interpret a collective bargaining agreement, in order to ascertain whether there has been an unfair labor practice."
1966.53,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1690.65,1703.403,And I suppose you can add to that assuming always that the mere violation of the collective bargaining agreement is not an unfair labor practice.
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1703.403,1704.172,That's right.
1966.53,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1720.909,1740.864,"So they find now whether the Board has power in the particular circumstances to interpret a collective bargaining agreement, you've got to find out -- you've got to go to the end of the process and say, “How did it interpret it for a work purpose and with work consequences?”"
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1740.864,1744.286,That is -- I think that is correct Mr. Justice.
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.888,1794.538,"Well, Mr. Friedman, to the extent that you feel that the contract interpretation issue where unfair labor practice really invokes the expertise of the Board."
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1826.506,1826.755,Well I think --
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1826.755,1834.439,Why wouldn't there be a primary jurisdiction then in 301 suits where the contract division overlaps an unfair labor practice --
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1834.439,1846.808,I think there Mr. Justice we would say that the Congress in an act in 301 intended to open up broadly the federal courts and this Court's decisions I think in the preemption case have indicated that this --
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1846.808,1851.733,Well then Congress doesn't -- must not feel a labor expertise is so critical.
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1851.733,1852.416,Well the Congress --
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1852.416,1853.251,Contracts?
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1853.251,1865.584,-- Congress in those situations Mr. Justice I suggest was not addressing itself to the problem of the Board's authority to remedy unfair labor practice as it was addressing itself to the question of what remedy is the best --
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1865.584,1867.235,That's a different question.
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1876.533,1883.799,"Well, I would think in this situation the Board's interpretation should be given very substantial deference by the Court of Appeals."
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1883.799,1892.314,"Well, I'm just saying that if you do, if that's the Government's position, you really should say that Smith against Evening News Association should be overruled."
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1892.314,1894.474,"No, we support in fact the Government urge --"
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1894.474,1899.419,"Well I know, and I know -- I just don't understand how your position here is consistent with the position you took there."
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1899.419,1905.746,"Well I think -- I think Mr. Justice, it's consistent because there are different problems it seems to me."
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1908.877,1911.739,"I remember, we're not talking about the questions of power."
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1942.288,1953.633,"Well I would -- perhaps Mr. Justice, what I was trying to suggest was that in the 301 suit the issue is framed in the Court ordinarily in a much narrower context than before the Board."
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1970.191,1972.412,Was this the breach of contract?
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1972.412,1973.964,I would think it may have been.
1966.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1975.433,1986.827,"Well, the Union sort of -- you think the Union -- let's just assume the Union hadn't gone to the Board but it's on the Court sued under 301, for breach of contract to enforce a contract."
1966.53,0,23500,friedman,,1998.324,2019.315,"Well, but Mr. Justice if I may come back in such a suit by the Union, the only question would be whether or not the contract authorizes, who wouldn't get to the -- any questions as to whether the question of suggestion go way with the statutory rights, you wouldn't have to get-in in the 301 suit to the problem of whether there was a refusal to bargain."
1966.53,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2037.137,2038.976,Mr. Tichy.
1966.53,1,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,2038.976,2043.576,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please this Honorable Court."
