1959.283,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.818,"-- the Hertz Corporation, Petitioner, versus United States."
1959.283,0,21969,edgar_bernhard,,14.09,18.829,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1959.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,137.702,140.028,"Mr. Bernhard, what were you reading from this time?"
1959.283,0,21969,edgar_bernhard,,140.028,145.146,I was reading from the Third Circuit brief by the -- filed by the Government below in this case.
1959.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,145.146,147.308,"All right, thank you."
1959.283,0,21969,edgar_bernhard,,147.308,153.473,"Third, the Government admits the same point in its brief in this Court."
1959.283,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,632.839,633.799,What -- what case is that?
1959.283,0,21969,edgar_bernhard,,635.31,636.738,"Pilot Freight Carriers, Your Honor."
1959.283,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,640.419,640.902,I'll find it.
1959.283,0,21969,edgar_bernhard,,645.639,648.118,It's at pages 29 and 62 in our brief.
1959.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,648.118,661.784,"Mr. Bernhard, I'm -- I'm right in thinking am I not, that it is a practical matter in the -- in the ordinary case, it would be to the Government's physical interest to have as long a useful life as possible?"
1959.283,0,21969,edgar_bernhard,,661.784,662.523,"That's right, Your Honor."
1959.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,662.729,663.251,The --
1959.283,0,21969,edgar_bernhard,,663.251,666.187,-- without the new 1954 accelerated depreciation --
1959.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,666.187,672.659,"It would -- generally speaking, (Inaudible) the Government's interest to have each year's depreciation deduction as small as possible."
1959.283,0,21969,edgar_bernhard,,672.659,673.377,Exactly.
1959.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,673.377,688.457,"And that the reason these cases are kind of offbeat, is because of this very high salvage value and the problem is further accentuated by the new deduction method allowed by the 1954 Code, is that it?"
1959.283,0,21969,edgar_bernhard,,688.457,702.697,"Well, the -- the reason for the salvage value, if Your Honor please, only appears after the 1954 Code allowing accelerated depreciations, so more depreciation could be taken."
1959.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,719.795,719.818,That I --
1959.283,0,21969,edgar_bernhard,,719.818,721.282,That also -- I'm sorry.
1959.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,721.282,725.135,Well that I understand that there's a controversy as to what a salvage value means.
1959.283,0,21969,edgar_bernhard,,736.688,737.12,That causes the (Voice Overlap) --
1959.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,737.12,739.19,"-- creates -- creates this issue, isn't that (Voice Overlap) --"
1959.283,0,21969,edgar_bernhard,,739.19,740.139,"Well, no, Your Honor."
1959.283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,794.038,796.789,That's the new problem in this case that was not present in the Evans case.
1959.283,0,21969,edgar_bernhard,,796.789,797.939,"That's right, Your Honor."
1959.283,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1612.131,1615.311,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1959.283,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1660.648,1668.941,"But for auditing that we do know for other reasons, for simplicity reasons, Congress might do what it did in (Inaudible) Oil."
1959.283,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1690.581,1692.185,"Well, Congress might have --"
1959.283,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1692.185,1693.534,(Voice Overlap) is abstracting.
1959.283,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1703.427,1706.602,"Well, I intend to get to the regulations and the practice."
1959.283,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1723.577,1727.745,But you've just stated an absolute -- you yourself -- and thus stated an abstraction.
1959.283,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1730.991,1731.346,"No, no --"
1959.283,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1731.346,1734.836,-- the depreciation has been -- by which the depreciation has been governed.
1959.283,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1734.836,1748.068,"We would conceive that if Congress said give depreciation without recourse to cost, without any relevance to cost as it is done in the field of percentage depletion, that then, of course, cost would be an irrelevant factor, but Congress hasn't done that."
1959.283,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1748.068,1748.93,So --
1959.283,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1748.93,1749.302,But what is the --
1959.283,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1749.302,1758.985,"-- and how did you say it's unrelated and said, you take the course and later spread it on the four years although as a matter of business practice you only hold it for two years."
1959.283,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1758.985,1759.607,Well I -- I was going --
1959.283,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1759.607,1762.193,You are not in crossed out the adjustments.
1959.283,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1768.534,1769.417,Well --
1959.283,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1769.417,1770.55,--is a four-year period.
1959.283,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1770.55,1788.534,"I think that's right, but we're talking -- if we're talking simply in terms of a rate and we're talking about a rate which when applied aggregates cost, what point is it to base that rate upon factors which are wholly unrelated to the period the taxpayer will use the asset or what he receives when he finishes with the asset."
1959.283,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1837.726,1838.332,But that --
1959.283,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1838.332,1847.314,-- because then the aggregate 10% only equals 50% and we're looking for a rate which when aggregated equals a 100% of the taxpayer's cost.
1959.283,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1847.314,1859.74,"Is there any reference in the regulation to that fact, Mr. Bernhard stated from the regulation, variations as to the kind of -- the kind of vehicles, three years, four years, five years?"
1959.283,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1873.49,1885.973,"The regulation states in terms that the proper allowance for depreciation is an amount which when aggregated over the useful life of the property in the business, equals cost."
1959.283,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1885.973,1895.034,"Well then, that it brings on what useful life means, whether useful life as a thing or useful life as an asset for the particular holder?"
1959.283,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1895.034,1918.975,"Now, we say useful life there means just what the regulation says, useful life of the property in the business, because if it meant anything else, you would not be recovering cost and the purpose of the deduction is to enable the taxpayer to recover cost, if the rate is based on factors which have no bearing and no relationship to the taxpayer's business, there is no guaranty, there is no probability."
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3644.086,3680.602,"Your Honor, the record show in the evidence in Hertz cases, that Evans filed its returns on the basis of the physical life, a four-year basis for automobiles, irrespective of holding periods since 1936 and that Hertz has been filing its returns since 1918 on the basis of four-year life, physical life, irrespective of holding periods."
1959.283,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3696.91,3698.575,"Since 1936, up to --"
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3698.575,3698.747,I beg your pardon?
1959.283,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3698.747,3700.89,Did you say since 1936 in Evans?
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3700.89,3701.704,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.283,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3703.666,3704.409,Since 1918?
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3704.409,3707.842,Since 1918 in Hertz.
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3768.683,3771.464,"In the -- in the Evans, I think at record page --"
1959.283,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3771.464,3776.592,I thought you referred to that as the one that would show that they had been making these reports over a certain period of years.
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3778.305,3778.381,No.
1959.283,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3782.673,3782.898,114.
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3782.898,3797.756,"That indicates that the 1955 return was specifically reviewed and the -- a record page on Hertz's practice is 50, that it has filed these returns (Voice Overlap) --"
1959.283,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3797.756,3800.414,What page -- what page is that?
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3802.458,3811.953,Record page 50 in the Hertz.
1959.283,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3820.28,3820.462,What year?
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3820.462,3821.423,-- at record page 50.
1959.283,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3821.423,3829.109,But where is the evidence to which you referred they'd been making this same kind of return and has been accepted?
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3829.109,3835.839,"Your Honor, I'm pretty sure that Mr. Jacobs testified that they've transferred."
1959.283,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3835.839,3840.876,"In the finding of page 129 in Hertz, to that effect?"
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3840.876,3842.22,"I beg your pardon, Mr. Justice Clark?"
1959.283,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3842.22,3855.91,"Page 129 of Hertz, the Court's opinion, was that clear that the right dollar return amounts (Inaudible) long continued interpretation of his own regulations and he was on?"
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3855.91,3857.079,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.283,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3857.079,3860.193,Was that there?
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3860.193,3861.235,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1959.283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3876.835,3903.988,"Mr. Bernhard, at page 111 of the Hertz statute, as part of Judge Leighton's opinion, there's a table preceded by the statement of Judge Leighton on its income's tax returns for its tax years and so forth, Connor claimed the following amounts computed as indicated that he has a table and that he -- has this some reference to the way they return themselves who have filled out in that year?"
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3903.988,3904.98,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3904.98,3911.207,"In other words, on each return that there appear in that column, four-year life using rates of and so forth?"
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3911.207,3911.511,That's right.
1959.283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3913.81,3914.091,"No, no."
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3925.109,3926.243,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
1959.283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3933.92,3941.78,"Well, then, if -- if that is not so, do you know whether the returns themselves indicated that the computation was based --"
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3941.78,3942.468,On four-year life?
1959.283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3942.468,3943.844,-- so notified the --
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3943.844,3944.249,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1959.283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3944.249,3945.885,-- review on a four-year life basis?
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3945.885,3946.529,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1959.283,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3947.766,3949.58,Where is -- where is that?
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3949.58,3961.857,"Now, I -- I'd like to -- I'd like to find that record and perhaps I can have someone search for it because the consistent custom of the rent-a-car companies in these two cases --"
1959.283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3961.857,3967.45,"No, but -- if I may, and supplementing what Mr. Justice Black has asked you."
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3986.306,3995.475,"I'm -- I am very sure that's true, Your Honor, because I -- I am satisfied that both these companies followed this practice for many, many years."
1959.283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3995.475,3997.418,"Well, whether they followed it or not, what I'm --"
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3997.418,3998.174,On the returns?
1959.283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3998.174,3998.679,-- what I am interested in this --
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3998.679,3999.356,Yes.
1959.283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3999.356,3999.892,-- is whether it --
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,3999.892,4000.01,"On the returns, Your Honor."
1959.283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4000.01,4004.984,-- appeared affirmatively on the returns that the computation was based on four-year life.
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,4004.984,4011.061,"I am satisfied that's true, although I cannot give, Your Honor, the record page at this time and --"
1959.283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4011.061,4012.659,"Well, can you give it to us later?"
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,4012.659,4013.059,I would like --
1959.283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4013.059,4015.249,I'm just completely have to see in these cases.
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,4015.249,4019.971,"I would like very much to send the Court a memorandum, if I may, on -- on this (Voice Overlap) --"
1959.283,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4019.971,4022.492,"Can you give us later, if you can find it?"
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,4022.492,4023.153,I beg your pardon?
1959.283,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4023.153,4051.496,"Can you give us later if you can find it, references to the kind of interpretation which have been mentioned here, not using the word, “useful life”, but which showed that the Treasury has had the practice of allowing people whether what you call a useful life for four years, even more of that with wholly charge off something it left them who had paid probably of 50% value."
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,4058.46,4058.986,"Sure, Your Honor."
1959.283,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4059.432,4064.665,You may respond to it Mr. -- you may respond to it Mr. Heffron to (Voice Overlap) --
1959.283,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4064.665,4086.083,"And as I understand the Government's argument -- as I understand the Government's argument, it isn't of the holding of less than four years, but that the practice of the business was not to hold it for four years, namely that the sales were usually made within whatever the period is, two years is it, Mr. Bernhard?"
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,4086.083,4088.645,"It's -- it's something over two years, two years and three months --"
1959.283,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4088.645,4088.834,So that whatever --
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,4088.834,4091.081,-- so as what the average contended for by the Government.
1959.283,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4091.081,4099.274,"Must be -- must be accepted practice of the business is at the outset, not longer than four years?"
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,4099.274,4110.323,"Now, Your Honor, the testimony -- the clear testimony in Hertz and in Evans uncontroverted, is that there is no practice."
1959.283,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4172.171,4184.535,"Well then, why is there this -- why is there this uniformity to which I understood you to exceed a minute ago, if knowing the holdings are not for four years, but are for two years or a few months?"
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,4184.535,4194.272,"Well, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, what I said was that in the years in review here, the years in issue here, it is true and we would not contest that we did not hold the cars for four years."
1959.283,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4194.272,4194.528,Well --
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,4194.528,4200.678,"But actually, the -- the figures in the record show a wide variation because of these unpredictables."
1959.283,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4202.787,4216.315,"May I ask you one more -- one more question, during these years of practice that you have just told us about, so far as depreciation is concerned, did you also claim, as capital gains, the difference?"
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,4216.315,4217.572,Where we had a --
1959.283,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4217.572,4218.453,Where you had a sale?
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,4218.453,4219.898,Where we had a gain?

1959.283,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4221.754,4223.852,-- have that's why you practice also?
1959.283,2,21969,edgar_bernhard,,4223.852,4225.256,"Yes, sir."
