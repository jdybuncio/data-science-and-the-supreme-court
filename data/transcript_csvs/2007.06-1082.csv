2007.06-1082,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.077,"We'll hear argument first today in 06-1082, Virginia v. Moore."
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,7.187,23.54,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has again and again held that an arrest is constitutionally reasonable if the officers have probable cause to believe a suspect has committed a crime."
2007.06-1082,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,86.373,87.498,Mr. McCullough--
2007.06-1082,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,87.498,102.93,"If this officer had complied with the State law, that is he had issued a summons, then you agree that the exclusionary rule would apply if he went ahead and searched."
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,102.93,104.147,That's correct.
2007.06-1082,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,109.769,120.484,"So would you explain the logic to saying that when the police violate State law, then the evidence can come in; but when they comply with State law, it can't."
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,120.484,137.478,"Your Honor, the rationale of Knowles was that the officer did not engage in any extended contact with the suspect and that there was no need to gather evidence."
2007.06-1082,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,176.931,179.01,"Did you... excuse me, sorry, General."
2007.06-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,179.01,182.71,"Well, you say he made a custodial arrest."
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,184.804,185.74,No.
2007.06-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,187.849,189.193,And did he search him at the place of the arrest?
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,189.193,189.99,--No.
2007.06-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,189.99,192.238,"Well, how can this be incident to an arrest?"
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,192.238,199.796,"Your Honor, the fact of the arrest was uncontested, and the law doesn't require--"
2007.06-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,199.796,202.826,"But the search is unrelated to the arrest, as I understand the facts."
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,202.826,203.576,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,203.576,204.998,It took place later in a different place.
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,204.998,208.964,"Justice Stevens, the search was related to the arrest."
2007.06-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,230.035,235.017,"Well, why is it present if he's not... he searched when he wasn't arrested?"
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,236.564,239.109,"The arrest did not cease at that point, Your Honor."
2007.06-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,248.136,250.401,"It's an ongoing arrest, is it?"
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,250.401,252.01,"Well, it's an arrest--"
2007.06-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,252.01,252.962,Incident to an ongoing arrest?
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,254.556,263.271,--It's an arrest until he is released or denied bail.
2007.06-1082,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,274.174,283.263,"Mr. McCullough, the proposition that you're arguing, does it apply at the Federal level as well?"
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,312.377,317.484,--If there is State action--
2007.06-1082,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.484,320.234,"I'm a State actor, I guess."
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,322.872,324.511,--If you have State actors--
2007.06-1082,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.511,326.636,"You know, a Supreme Court Justice should not be...--"
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,332.508,333.821,--That's not a smart neighbor.
2007.06-1082,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.644,347.174,Don't dance around.
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,356.155,360.029,--I don't think the fact of... no.
2007.06-1082,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.123,366.386,So any Federal employee can go crashing around conducting searches and seizures?
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,366.386,366.776,--So long--
2007.06-1082,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.776,368.384,So long as he has probable cause?
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,368.384,369.915,--That's correct.
2007.06-1082,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,369.915,370.681,That's fantastic.
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,372.883,380.473,"I think if there is State action, it doesn't matter that you're wearing a badge or that you've gone through the police academy."
2007.06-1082,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,380.473,385.44,"Or that you are an administrative law judge at the, you know, Bureau of Customs?"
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,386.128,387.799,I think that's right.
2007.06-1082,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,390.064,390.97,What about a janitor?
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,396.14,397.451,--Your Honor--
2007.06-1082,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,397.451,402.841,"His neighbor is growing marijuana, and he's just as offended as a Supreme Court Justice would be."
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,405.104,407.962,"--I think if he's doing it on behalf of the State, the answer is yes."
2007.06-1082,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.962,408.665,Wow.
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,408.665,446.228,"But in terms of the Federal-State distinction, Your Honor, I think what we're advocating for is the uniform standard that this Court has embraced before, that there should not be a difference between a Federal officer on a State facility who is authorized under the Assimilated Crimes Act to arrest for Virginia laws and a Virginia officer who is a hundred feet away with making an unconstitutional arrest under the holding below when--"
2007.06-1082,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,446.228,452.163,"Would you agree that there was no probable cause to arrest, given the State statute?"
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,452.163,453.335,--Your Honor--
2007.06-1082,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,453.335,456.567,You're talking about probable cause to believe that he committed an offense.
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,456.567,456.989,--That's right.
2007.06-1082,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,456.989,460.175,But was there probable cause to arrest?
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,460.175,469.75,"Well, the State court found there was no... none of the exceptions in the statute applied."
2007.06-1082,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,490.117,497.989,Could he... could this officer have gotten a warrant to arrest Moore?
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,509.124,517.589,"Well, under the facts of this case he could have, but it would have caused a prolonged detention of the suspect."
2007.06-1082,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,517.589,524.197,How could he... how could he have gotten a warrant to arrest when it's a nonarrestable offense?
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,524.197,525.509,Well--
2007.06-1082,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,525.509,532.881,"He couldn't... would a judge have told this police officer... they have a call-in procedure, call the judge."
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,542.331,545.69,"--Your Honor, it is an arrestable offense under certain circumstances."
2007.06-1082,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,552.249,555.887,Did these officers think this... those circumstances exist?
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,555.887,560.917,The officers did not... their only testimony was it was their prerogative.
2007.06-1082,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,607.726,627.485,"Maybe we could say that in this, in these unique circumstances, where the officers could not let the fellow drive off without a license, it was not unreasonable to arrest him, but in some other situation where they had no arrest authority it would be."
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,627.485,628.251,--Your--
2007.06-1082,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,628.251,642.682,"I mean, you know, let's assume that the stop was not based on some, some deficiency in his license or some deficiency in the car... I don't know what else it could be... like, he had been going too fast, okay?"
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,664.234,670.56,"--Well, what we're asking the Court to do is to let the States regulate this arrest authority."
2007.06-1082,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,670.56,676.433,"If that's the argument you're making, then don't bring forward the argument that they couldn't let him go because he'd be in violation of the law."
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,681.447,692.27,"All we're asking the Court to do is to affirm the probable cause standard that has... without any further balancing, that the balancing has occurred when--"
2007.06-1082,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,692.27,693.817,"No, you're asking us to balance."
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,702.205,707.062,"--No, I'm simply explain... what I was trying to so was to explain that as a matter of state law these officers have to make these discretionary calls."
2007.06-1082,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.414,727.318,"You say this was not unlawful under Virginia law, then, because of the factor you brought forth?"
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,727.318,728.678,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1082,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,732.364,735.143,"Well, I don't know what you're talking about a discretionary call."
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,738.627,760.618,"Well... but the problem is, if the standard then becomes a two-step probable cause, where we have to figure out as a matter of constitutional law whether the officer guessed right in terms of one of these exceptions, then every discretionary judgment in the field becomes the occasion for constitutional--"
2007.06-1082,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,760.618,762.851,--But suppose it works the other way.
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,782.249,785.654,"--It... I mean, it certainly would flow from that."
2007.06-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,791.245,798.852,Let me ask this question: You would argue it doesn't matter whether it violated State or Federal law; it's a question of Federal law on probable cause.
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,812.424,818.89,"--The search incident to arrest is a bright-line rule, Your Honor, that this Court has promulgated in Robinson."
2007.06-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,818.89,819.983,"The answer is yes, they could search?"
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,819.983,820.374,I'm sorry.
2007.06-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,830.089,833.181,Even though the rationale for the search incident to arrest doesn't apply?
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,833.181,853.594,"--What the... yes, because what the Court said in Robinson was: We're not interested in delving into case-by-case litigation as to how dangerous this person was and how... and whether there was a likelihood of evidence being found--"
2007.06-1082,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,853.594,855.828,Why would the rationale not apply in that situation?
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,869.526,871.103,--I agree with that.
2007.06-1082,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,880.178,893.393,"No, but you're also arguing, as I understand it, that the... that the search, even in the case of the tax arrest, does fall within the rationale of search incident to an arrest because one of those two rationales is officer safety."
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,893.83,894.252,--Yes.
2007.06-1082,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,894.252,894.609,Okay.
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,908.167,909.807,That's correct.
2007.06-1082,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,909.807,910.369,Okay.
2007.06-1082,0,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,910.369,933.033,This Court has crafted a bright-line rule... it has not distinguished between types of offenses; it doesn't have to be a violent offense; it could be a white-collar offense... that across the board there is virtue to having this bright-line rule that permits the officer to search incident to a lawful arrest.
2007.06-1082,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,950.197,951.212,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.06-1082,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,957.975,974.326,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The States and the Federal Government may for a variety of reasons enact restrictions on officer authority that exceed the requirements of the Fourth Amendment as this Court has articulated them."
2007.06-1082,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,988.056,994.21,Does the person making the arrest at least have to have some arrest authority?
2007.06-1082,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,994.21,995.194,This Court has never--
2007.06-1082,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.194,996.913,Or will a janitor do the job?
2007.06-1082,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1005.347,1011.704,"--Well, certainly, Justice Scalia, such an individual wouldn't have positive law authority to engage in an arrest."
2007.06-1082,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1011.704,1015.716,Just as this person here didn't have positive law authority to engage in an arrest.
2007.06-1082,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1015.716,1020.497,The question would then be whether that means that it's automatically a constitutional violation.
2007.06-1082,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1031.179,1034.194,"Yes, but he was purporting to act in an official capacity."
2007.06-1082,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1039.457,1042.238,And if you assume that the Court would have two options.
2007.06-1082,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1179.559,1195.473,"If you're right, Mr. Dreeben, then the Court gave a false signal when it GVR'd in Lovelace, in the Lovelace case, the person who was drinking in public, it GVR'd in light of Knowles."
2007.06-1082,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1195.473,1205.282,"I don't know that it gave a false signal, Justice Ginsburg, but a GVR doesn't indicate this Court's disposition of the merits once all of the arguments are presented to it."
2007.06-1082,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1270.63,1277.549,"If we rule for Respondent in this case, would we have to reexamine the holding in California v. Greenwood?"
2007.06-1082,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1277.549,1278.674,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-1082,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1320.235,1330.652,There could not have been a warrant... a grant... a judge could not have given a warrant for arrest on these charges.
2007.06-1082,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1330.652,1335.542,"I'm venturing a little bit outside of my expertise under State law, but I think that that's correct."
2007.06-1082,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1360.984,1367.279,How often and under what circumstances is that Virginia... Virginia law rule?
2007.06-1082,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1378.492,1380.57,--I know that it has done it.
2007.06-1082,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1436.796,1452.587,"I should know this, but do we defer to State law in determining the lawfulness of the time before arraignment in the context of confessions, the McNabb-Mallory rule?"
2007.06-1082,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1452.587,1454.742,The McNabb-Mallory rule--
2007.06-1082,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1454.742,1455.195,Which is Federal.
2007.06-1082,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1455.195,1456.273,--is uniquely Federal.
2007.06-1082,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1470.08,1474.25,"Well, was there any indication in that case that if the State had a shorter period, they would--"
2007.06-1082,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1474.25,1476.655,"--No, and that's precisely, I think, the point."
2007.06-1082,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1575.537,1576.927,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1579.771,1603.808,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The notion that the proud men who framed the Constitution would believe it reasonable to go out and arrest someone for a non-arrestable offense and not only do that, but having committed that trespass at common law, to further search them, is I think an extreme proposition and one that they would not have accepted."
2007.06-1082,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1603.808,1607.181,But you think they would accept arresting somebody for not wearing a seat belt?
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1607.181,1608.947,"Your Honor, I do--"
2007.06-1082,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1608.947,1611.697,It seems to me we've crossed that bridge with Atwater.
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1611.697,1618.584,"--No, Your Honor, I disagree, for the reason that... and there are obviously... I'm not here to tell the Court what its own precedents mean."
2007.06-1082,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1639.81,1649.259,"The particular illegal arrest here, to bring this down to earth a little bit, is I take it they arrested him because he had a suspended... he was driving without a good license?"
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1649.259,1649.447,--Yes.
2007.06-1082,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1649.447,1649.775,Okay.
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1660.521,1661.365,Yes.
2007.06-1082,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1661.365,1662.191,Okay.
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1717.669,1718.873,For a few reasons.
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1745.565,1748.846,"Well, I thought it's questioned in your footnote 13 in your brief."
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1752.657,1753.375,That's right.
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1756.232,1763.981,So... so we should write an opinion saying we're not saying that it was correct to... we're not saying that it was correct to exclude the evidence in this case?
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1763.981,1765.697,That's... I think that that's right.
2007.06-1082,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1777.616,1779.084,What is the difference between this and Whren?
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1807.619,1809.867,Whren is different in several different ways.
2007.06-1082,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1877.138,1888.773,"Well, why do you draw a distinction between something that's prohibited by a statute, something that's prohibited by a local ordnance or let's say it's a directive of the police department?"
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1894.116,1896.583,The court hasn't ever confronted that question.
2007.06-1082,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1925.992,1934.395,"I thought it was your argument that if the arrest is unlawful under State law it's an unreasonable search, an unreasonable arrest under the Fourth Amendment?"
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1934.395,1934.645,--That's right.
2007.06-1082,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1943.657,1944.141,No.
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1961.65,1964.898,"If I have conveyed that impression, I am sorry."
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1977.784,1982.735,"No, it says the laws of the 50 States are pretty variable on this question as well."
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1982.735,1987.811,"As are the laws of whether it's a crime at all, as are under Indianapolis v. Edmund and lots of other cases where the court--"
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1987.811,1989.936,Do we have to look at both of those varieties?
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2000.182,2003.416,"--No, as Justice Ginsburg suggests, you have to have probable cases to arrest."
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2004.884,2006.571,--is probable cause to arrest.
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2012.631,2015.051,--I'm sorry.
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2023.672,2030.108,"I thought you were telling us it has to be sufficient cause to arrest, not sufficient cause to believe that a crime has been committed."
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2030.108,2033.888,"--That is necessary but not a sufficient condition, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2041.494,2047.351,"So it is, as your friends on the other side put it, you are advocating a two-step process."
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2050.975,2053.331,I view those as the same thing.
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2054.348,2055.018,"No, they're different here."
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2061.516,2063.703,"--In that sense, absolutely."
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2134.503,2140.531,"What if the State makes a trivial offense arrestable, as in Atwater?"
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2152.355,2152.746,--That's right.
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2172.755,2175.705,"Well, what if the legislature... this was the hypothetical Mr. Dreeben posed."
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2195.542,2195.807,--No.
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2197.118,2205.492,"So the State can define the circumstances under which you can have an arrest, but the State can't define and limit the consequences of the arrest?"
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2205.492,2205.865,--That's right.
2007.06-1082,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2217.392,2254.331,"But isn't... isn't the difficulty with that argument that we... we have rejected the, in effect, the trespass rationale; and what you're telling us now, it seems to me, based on in effect trespass concepts, is that so far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned an arrest may constitutionally be made, but the officer following that arrest may not take the step of determining whether the individual arrested has on his person anything that can be used to hurt the officer like a knife or a gun?"
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2279.632,2284.568,"This is I think the hardest question for us, and so if I could have the time to give you a couple of answers."
2007.06-1082,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2310.027,2310.481,Right.
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2312.729,2313.026,--I--
2007.06-1082,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2313.026,2314.76,We're starting with a constitutional premise.
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2314.76,2314.993,--Yes.
2007.06-1082,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2376.798,2393.088,"If that... if that logic is sound and that logic depends on Justice Powell's use of the word unlawfully, then it seems to me the... the only way to arrest an irrational system would to be conclude that, in fact, the arrest is not constitutionally lawful."
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2429.558,2431.01,Can I just correct one thing?
2007.06-1082,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2444.412,2450.908,"Don't you think we have to, if not overrule, at least back away from the holding in California versus Greenwood?"
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2450.908,2454.688,"--No, Justice Kennedy, and that's why I focused so much on searches incident to arrest."
2007.06-1082,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.673,2496.25,What about Cooper... Cooper v California?
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2496.25,2506.403,"I think Cooper v California is a very good case for us, because Cooper and all its progeny say that State law has to authorize and determine the validity of the inventory search."
2007.06-1082,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2511.323,2513.229,Can we go back for a second?
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2592.9,2602.693,"Well, I think it is a terribly difficult rule to administer when you try to decide, well if this is a law that sometimes allows arrest and sometimes does not."
2007.06-1082,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2611.659,2622.747,"I think it is much easier to administer, to have a uniform Federal standard, rather than whether or not an officer can arrest in one county for something and not in another county whether he has to have a badge or not."
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2626.106,2637.866,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, remember, we have one standard for an officer on the street, and that is, look... do, if you're allowed to arrest, you can arrest, and that's what will determine the constitutionality of the search incident to arrest."
2007.06-1082,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2674.789,2681.879,"But under that analysis, it seems to you we rely on the citizen's expectation of privacy as the justification."
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2697.686,2707.073,"--This is a very... just as a court note, there's no other State that has one of these statutes."
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2732.594,2733.844,"Counsel, can I get back to your discussion of Cooper?"
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2750.15,2751.946,"--Chief Justice Roberts, I do disagree."
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2768.11,2774.842,"No, but just... it gets to... I mean, if you don't follow the State rules, it doesn't comply with the rules for an inventory search."
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2786.369,2788.133,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I disagree."
2007.06-1082,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2798.004,2801.159,"Mr. Goldstein, can I bring you back to Cooper v. California?"
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2801.159,2801.675,Yes.
2007.06-1082,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2801.675,2803.564,Which you say is a good case for you.
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2840.659,2852.015,"Not... I don't think that language is relevant for the following reason: What the Court said in Cooper was that the seizure of the car, which is analogous to the arrest here, right?"
2007.06-1082,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2862.697,2865.884,Even though the State law did not authorize it.
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2865.884,2868.663,"--The State law did not speak to it either way, but... it didn't speak to it either way."
2007.06-1082,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2868.663,2874.849,"They were assume ing, in that passage, that the State law did not authorize it, or otherwise the passage makes no sense."
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2874.849,2875.787,"Justice Scalia, I disagree."
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2891.31,2913.021,"Counsel, if we assume, contrary to your footnote 13, that the exclusionary rule is implicated in this case, could you explain why, under the Federal Constitution, there should be imposed on the State an exclusionary rule for a violation of State law when State law does not impose an exclusionary rule for the violation of its law?"
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2913.021,2926.656,"--Assuming the Court decides that the question was not waived because it wasn't briefed, the reason is that this Court's exclusionary rule precedents look to something else, and that is: Did the evidence follow directly from the unconstitutional conduct?"
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2927.671,2936.964,"Well, I guess the question would be: Why doesn't our jurisprudence on whether there's an arrest also look to something else, rather than whether it's permitted or violated under State law?"
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2953.316,2961.095,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that illustrates the point I am willing to accept, and that is there are times that State law is relevant under this Court's doctrines; there are times it isn't."
2007.06-1082,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2974.339,2991.629,"What if Virginia has a statute that said it's unlawful to arrest for a traffic violation, but that it is lawful under Virginia law for an officer to conduct a search incident to any arrest, whether it's lawful under Virginia law or not?"
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2993.894,2998.158,I don't know.
2007.06-1082,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3009.388,3013.48,What is the difference between that law and in effect what Virginia has in place?
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3021.992,3036.564,"--The reason is I think the one... that the Court has never looked to the State law remedies in Di Re, Miller, Johnson, Ker, and DeFillippo, and that it looks to what the common law would look to, which is: Is the arrest legal or not?"
2007.06-1082,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3077.344,3084.139,"And both arrests are illegal, but you're saying that there's a difference."
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3086.31,3088.044,"--Justice Kennedy, I don't--"
2007.06-1082,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3088.044,3095.916,I mean I'm assuming that your answer to my question about the badge or the wrong county and so forth would not result in suppression.
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3098.398,3100.273,--We have proposed two alternative rules.
2007.06-1082,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3102.195,3102.632,What's right?
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3102.632,3103.445,--I'm sorry.
2007.06-1082,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3139.82,3149.924,"But then if you... do you accept the proposition then, in some of these minor cases, the arrest might be valid, then you're whole argument about the Framers and the trespass and so forth is wrong."
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3149.924,3152.345,--To... that's correct.
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3184.708,3193.719,I think your friend agreed that the cases didn't establish whether our references to probable cause meant to probable cause to arrest or probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed.
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3198.826,3202.576,--I do when it comes to the search-incident-to-arrest cases.
2007.06-1082,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3263.632,3266.663,"In Johnson, the search was illegal because they illegally entered the hotel room."
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3269.833,3271.956,--That is not what the Court said.
2007.06-1082,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3292.182,3296.291,The Court simply said we're going to use our Federal supervisory power and incorporate the State law of arrest.
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3303.101,3312.362,"--Well, then... I don't know how you pronounce it either, but I do know that Johnson, Ker, and DeFillippo are cases that are against the State."
2007.06-1082,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3314.846,3316.0,"Then you have three cases, not five."
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3316.0,3317.313,"Well, I disagree."
2007.06-1082,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3317.313,3322.857,Putting cases aside for the moment--
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3322.857,3323.67,Yes.
2007.06-1082,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3323.67,3327.386,"--I mean if we reach this question, you must have lost on the first question."
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3382.303,3383.551,May I?
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3394.704,3398.015,You can finish your answer.
2007.06-1082,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3398.015,3398.998,That's it.
2007.06-1082,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3398.998,3399.42,All right.
2007.06-1082,3,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,3404.543,3405.183,Thank you.
2007.06-1082,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3441.873,3443.295,Any crime at all?
2007.06-1082,3,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,3443.295,3444.358,I'm sorry?
2007.06-1082,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3444.358,3447.529,"Any crime at all; jaywalking, for example?"
2007.06-1082,3,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,3447.529,3449.168,That's... that's correct.
2007.06-1082,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3449.168,3456.524,"We would never know about it if the... if the misdemeanor, or jaywalking offense, was not committed in the officer's presence."
2007.06-1082,3,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,3456.524,3457.367,That's right.

2007.06-1082,3,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,3460.757,3461.335,--That's correct.
2007.06-1082,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3475.001,3489.199,"Mr. McCullough, what is here, for some reason the Commonwealth did not cite Cooper v. California, which I can't understand unless you agree with your friend that it has been overruled by later cases."
2007.06-1082,3,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,3489.199,3493.431,--No.
2007.06-1082,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3494.806,3495.367,I understand.
2007.06-1082,3,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,3496.508,3499.054,--I don't have an explanation for that.
2007.06-1082,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3584.94,3589.578,"Mr. McCullough, there is one thing that I was curious about."
2007.06-1082,3,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,3597.514,3597.639,Yes.
2007.06-1082,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3597.639,3599.889,When is that used?
2007.06-1082,3,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,3599.889,3606.464,"That is used with some frequency, and we certainly saw an increase in the wake of the Moore decision."
2007.06-1082,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3652.243,3660.426,What would be the basis of a... can a district court enter such an order just because it thinks it's a good idea?
2007.06-1082,3,41727,stephen_b_mccullough,,3661.77,3664.034,The statute... I see my time has expired.
