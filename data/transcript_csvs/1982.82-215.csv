1982.82-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.9,We will hear arguments next in United States against Whiting Pools.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,62.708,72.796,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this bankruptcy tax collection case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Second Circuit."
1982.82-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,175.147,181.831,"What was the value of the property seized when the adjustment, $20,000 adjustment was made?"
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,181.831,190.967,"Well, the value of the property was found by the Bankruptcy Court to have a liquidating value of $35,000."
1982.82-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,190.967,193.966,What was the amount of the government's claim?
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,193.966,197.966,"The amount of the government's claim is $92,000."
1982.82-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,340.339,355.129,"Do you think the District Court or the Bankruptcy Court based that view on the... analogizing the government's position here to that of any seizing secured creditor, or on the basis of peculiar to the government's position?"
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,355.129,384.856,"I think on the basis of peculiar to the government's position, that the government is not simply seizing secured credit, but operates, as the Court... as we point out in our brief, and the Court recognized in Phelps, the government... the government's position as tax collector is really quite different and distinct, and Congress has so made it different and distinct because of the involuntary nature of the government's creditor relationship."
1982.82-215,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,417.655,422.478,"Mr. Smith, would your position be any different if it were just the income tax liability?"
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,422.478,422.934,"No, no."
1982.82-215,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,422.934,423.605,It would be the same?
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,423.605,431.209,I think the aspect of employee withholding taxes gives this case peculiar force.
1982.82-215,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,443.063,444.72,"Well, it wasn't the Respondent's money."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,447.001,446.564,Exactly.
1982.82-215,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,447.703,449.513,"Which makes, I suppose--"
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,449.513,458.888,"And indeed, the Court of Appeals recognized that that was something of somewhat peculiar force because of that fact."
1982.82-215,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,458.888,461.73,--But you don't restrict your case to that.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,461.73,477.082,"Again, I think it would be the same with respect to income taxes, and the Code suggests that, you know, once taxes are delinquent and owing, the full panoply of statutory authority rests in the Commission to take these steps."
1982.82-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.082,498.058,"Mr. Smith, in all these bankruptcy situations, there obviously isn't enough money to go around or we wouldn't be having bankruptcy proceedings filed, and isn't... if the government were able to sell the property, it would only recover part of the taxes."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,518.566,523.954,"Justice O'Connor, that may well be the case in a particular case."
1982.82-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,562.657,592.02,"Well, the concern I have... the concern I have is that probably in almost every case of a bankruptcy reorganization there are taxes owed the government, and if the government is going to take the position on all these cases that it wants its levy and its money out, then probably the reorganization aspects will not be able to proceed in many cases, and so I was curious why--"
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,592.02,592.504,--Yes.
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,614.98,618.26,"--Yes, but that may be against the judgment of the Bankruptcy Court."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,631.472,647.374,"Indeed, but I suggest to the Court that the exercise of these statutory rights of levy are rights which Congress has vested in the Commissioner to take, notwithstanding--"
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,647.374,653.075,"You have only got Phelps to defend your position under the previous Chapter 10, haven't you?"
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,653.075,657.135,"--Well, I would not say only got Phelps."
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,657.135,658.445,"Well, that wasn't even a Chapter 10 case."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,663.632,668.491,There is no... there are no Chapter 10 cases.
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,668.491,672.783,The bankruptcy law... Chapter 10 had been on the books a long time.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,672.783,673.314,Um-hm.
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,673.314,687.527,And did you think the government regularly or even often got away with levying on property that... or saying that they didn't have to turn over property that had been levied on in that Chapter 10 proceeding?
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,687.527,693.962,"Let me... as we point out in our brief, Justice White, there have been... there are no decided cases--"
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,693.962,694.963,That isn't what I asked you.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,696.554,697.432,--The practice--
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,697.432,698.555,--that you were able to get away with it.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,698.555,708.206,"--The practice, as I understand it, is that the government exercised its rights of levy when it felt that they were necessary and appropriate."
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,708.206,709.162,"Well, all right, they exercised them."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,717.686,722.31,I'm aware... I'm aware of no decisions forbidding the government from doing that.
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.31,723.983,--Or approving it.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,723.983,724.966,Or approving it.
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.589,735.729,"Every other secured creditor could be required to turn it over, in the old Chapter 10."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,735.729,736.275,--Indeed.
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,738.806,749.315,You are saying now that one of your arguments is that the new bankruptcy law has permitted all creditors to seize property before the petition and keep it.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,751.253,760.639,"--Indeed it is, although I think that, you know, our primary and principal argument is that the government stands in a very distinct position."
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,760.639,761.98,"--Well, that is one of your arguments in your brief."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,763.092,772.072,"Well, it is the argument that we make, you know, and basically it is an argument based on this Court's recognition in Phelps, a unanimous recognition--"
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,772.072,773.476,It's a Chapter 11.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,778.756,779.583,--No.
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,781.131,785.284,"Well, that was a completely different operation with respect to secured creditors."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,785.284,790.751,"--But we think that Phelps is persuasive on this, and let me explain why."
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,827.426,828.955,"Yes, under Chapter 11."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,828.955,830.281,--Under Chapter 11.
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.088,851.556,Exactly.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,851.556,857.335,--and the Court held that the assignee was holding the property in constructive possession for the government.
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,863.364,868.671,Do you think the case would have come out any differently in Phelps if it had been a non-government creditor?
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,878.295,882.323,"--That may well be, but I think the important--"
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,882.323,888.04,"Well, then, Phelps couldn't have rested on the special position of the government."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,888.04,898.16,"--I beg to differ with the Court, only because the middle part of the opinion discusses at great length the effect of a levy."
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,902.987,903.47,Right.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,903.47,910.251,"""Historically, service of notice has been sufficient to seize a debt, and notice of levy and demand are equivalent to seizure. """
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,910.251,918.433,"What if a mortgagee, what if a mortgagee in a case just like that had taken possession of the property before the Chapter 11 petition had been filed?"
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,918.433,919.232,Well--
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,919.232,920.807,"Do you think they could have turned, been--"
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,920.807,928.836,--There is authority that is cited by the Court of Appeals below that suggests that that would have been subject to a turnover.
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,928.836,930.428,--In a Chapter 11?
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,931.102,933.82,"No, under a Chapter 10."
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.82,937.474,"--Well, that is a different thing, old Chapter 10."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,937.474,967.399,"Well, the point... I think the essential point of Phelps is, no matter what kind of proceeding existed under the old bankruptcy law, Phelps turns on the recognition as to what the effect of a levy is, and I think the important thing about the effect of a levy is that for all intents and purposes, it means that the government has virtually all rights to the property except a few narrow rights."
1982.82-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,967.399,979.316,All Phelps had to decide for purposes of deciding whether a plenary hearing was required or summary jurisdiction under the old Bankruptcy Act was that the government had reduced this property possession prior to the filing of bankruptcy.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,981.426,1001.823,"That is all the case could have... could have said, but the Court went on and discussed what the effect of a levy was, and it said basically that the levy therefore gave the United States full legal right to the $38,000 levied upon as against the claim for the petitioner receiver."
1982.82-215,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1082.462,1084.072,May I interrupt you right there?
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1094.987,1095.938,That's right.
1982.82-215,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1095.938,1100.08,"Whereas in this case, the physical assets would be property that could be used?"
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1100.08,1103.437,"Yes, but the point... the point--"
1982.82-215,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1103.437,1104.357,Isn't that true?
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1107.294,1109.216,"--Well, let me go on."
1982.82-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1145.92,1147.433,"--Let me back you up a little bit, Mr. Smith."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1161.91,1164.394,"--Precisely, and it would have been paid over."
1982.82-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1164.394,1167.066,"Well, at least it would have been set aside if it hadn't been paid over."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1167.066,1167.612,Right.
1982.82-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1167.612,1178.578,"Well, then, in this rehabilitation concept of Chapter 11, could that $92,000 have been used for any of the purposes of restoring this business?"
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1178.578,1179.139,No.
1982.82-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1180.138,1180.574,Of course not.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1180.574,1181.323,Of course not.
1982.82-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1181.323,1182.606,"Well, then, it is in a separate category--"
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1182.606,1183.198,"Well, indeed--"
1982.82-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1183.198,1191.774,--and are you asserting that what was left of the... what was available is subject to a constructive trust?
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1191.774,1204.47,"--Well, that requires, you know, questions of tracing that the record is opaque on, and I am not suggesting that this property was in a constructive trust."
1982.82-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1213.513,1217.092,But that is no different than a mortgagee seizing the day before.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1227.165,1236.038,"Well, we don't... we are not putting ourselves, Justice Rehnquist, in the same category as all secured creditors generally."
1982.82-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1236.038,1237.102,"Yes, but you are--"
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1237.102,1241.191,We are resting... we are resting on the exercise of our rights to levy.
1982.82-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1241.191,1252.5,"--But what you are saying, Mr. Smith, is that property of the estate refers to the debtor's interest in property and not to property in which the debtor has an interest."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1252.5,1253.139,That's right.
1982.82-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1253.139,1261.153,"And if that is your theory, it makes reorganization impossible in any case, because every creditor would be the same."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1262.682,1283.033,"It makes... let me suggest that it makes reorganization... it makes reorganization impossible in a case in which the debtor, like in this case, waits, you know, and does not pay tax obligations, and then finally the Internal Revenue Service exercises its statutory rights to levy, and then it goes into Bankruptcy Court."
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1293.059,1296.124,But your theory that you have just been talking about would apply to all creditors.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1303.791,1317.693,"--The point is that the Court of Appeals here began its analysis by saying that there was this turnover authority under the old bankruptcy law, and that somehow it was carried forward."
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1354.301,1361.754,"Well, it is not very well settled if you can't give me any cases under Chapter 10, on the old law, if you can't even give me a case one way or the other."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1361.754,1362.378,--I think the point--
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1362.378,1364.031,How settled is that?
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1364.031,1368.545,--I think it is settled because no one ever challenged the authority.
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1370.09,1374.216,"As far as I know, the Internal Revenue Service never attempted it before."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1374.216,1375.745,"--Well, I can--"
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1375.745,1377.651,And you can't tell me that it did.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1377.651,1394.053,"--I can tell you that in investigating the history of this case, the Internal Revenue Service assured me that its right to do this had never been challenged, and that it had done it on a... it had done it on innumerable cases."
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.053,1395.332,That hardly answers my question.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1395.332,1402.55,"Well, I would simply suggest that the absence of authority suggests that the... that the right was well settled."
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1409.14,1413.324,"Well, you wouldn't think that it had been settled with respect to other secured creditors under Chapter 10, would you?"
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1413.324,1415.043,"--Well, apparently, there is--"
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1415.043,1415.636,Would you?
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1415.636,1416.276,--No.
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1416.276,1417.761,The rule is quite the contrary.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1417.761,1423.182,"Well, there was some decisional law to the contrary, but that really--"
1982.82-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1423.182,1423.947,Then that is not well settled.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1427.881,1436.706,"--Well, indeed, but our point is that the government occupies quite a different position than an ordinary secured creditor."
1982.82-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1442.11,1453.044,"Mr. Smith, all of your tracing through these statutory sections that you very helpfully took us through a few minutes ago, there is nothing peculiar to the government about any of that argument."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1457.681,1458.652,"Well, let me say this."
1982.82-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1510.956,1515.207,"Well, that is not much different than the chattel mortgagee."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1518.627,1520.093,"Well, under--"
1982.82-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1520.093,1522.764,"Or chattel mortgagor, I should say."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1522.764,1523.579,"--Well, now, I--"
1982.82-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1523.579,1524.546,Right to receive notice of sale.
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1526.215,1543.24,"--Well, ultimately that is true, but I would suggest to the Court that the government is different in the sense that Congress has armed the government with statutory authority to conduct administrative sales without any... without any further ado."
1982.82-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.644,1557.33,"Well, take a conditional vendor then, who can... the sale--"
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1557.33,1602.513,"--Well, let me simply say this, that the end result with respect to a secured creditor and the government may be the same at the bottom line in the sense that the debtor will be entitled to surplus, but the point is that Congress has made a determination that the Internal Revenue Service and its prerogatives are to be treated differently, and I think the Court has recognized that in Phelps, because what the Court said there was that the service of a notice of seizure takes the property... takes the legal interest of the property and puts it in the hands of the government."
1982.82-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1620.489,1625.27,"--Well, neither a chattel mortgagee nor a conditional vendor in most places has to start suits to foreclose."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1625.27,1649.93,"That's... that may be the case, but I am simply suggesting to the Court that in enacting the Bankruptcy Code, there is just... there is no statutory language that supports the notion that in a situation like this when the IRS has engaged in a free petition levy, that such property is subject to turnover."
1982.82-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1661.411,1683.95,"I suppose one argument that the government might make that says that the tax claim is different from other secured creditors is that... at least you submit that the government's interest under a levy is determined by the code, whereas other secured creditors' interests very likely would be determined under state law."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1683.95,1685.463,--Under state law.
1982.82-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1686.154,1693.008,Did the corporation here ever acquire any title to these tax moneys?
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1693.008,1695.087,These tax moneys?
1982.82-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1695.087,1703.143,"Yes, the money that was put into these accounts, that he did not put into the accounts but should have put into the accounts."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1703.143,1712.108,"Well, the corporation had title, and ultimately, you know, there is no money now in the account, where there are... are inventory."
1982.82-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1712.108,1712.487,"Well, let me go back to my other question."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1719.857,1720.481,Indeed.
1982.82-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1720.481,1722.154,"And the $92,000 would be there."
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1725.231,1725.683,No.
1982.82-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1726.494,1728.9,You are arguing that equity presumes that should be done?
1982.82-215,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1728.9,1748.924,"Absolutely not, but our argument, as I suggested to Mr. Justice Blackmun, you know, is with respect to all taxes, because Section 6331 empowers the Internal Revenue Service to levy on assets of the delinquent taxpayer any time there is unpaid assets, and here is a situation where these... unpaid tax liabilities."
1982.82-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1781.379,1788.827,Mr. Relin.
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,1788.827,1808.789,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it is the view of the Respondent that the decision reached by the Court of Appeals below was not only based on sound statutory analysis, but that of equal importance, it was grounded in common sense."
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1817.02,1821.048,"Let me put to you the question I put to your friend, Mr. Relin."
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,1835.855,1836.686,"--Yes, indeed."
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1836.686,1840.917,"Now, could it use any part of that money for its corporate affairs?"
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,1840.917,1842.621,It would not be property of the estate.
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1842.621,1845.054,"It would be an embezzlement if they did so, would it not?"
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,1845.054,1846.883,"Well, perhaps--"
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1846.883,1847.757,Perhaps?
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,1847.757,1850.366,"--but it certainly would be a violation of trust, and--"
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1850.366,1852.116,"Well, that is sometimes called embezzlement--"
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,1852.116,1852.646,--Yes.
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1853.504,1858.862,"--when trustees take the money and use it for their own affairs and then lose it, especially if they lose it."
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,1885.711,1893.645,"Your question, Mr. Chief Justice, presumes that there was in fact such a fund in existence at some point in time."
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1896.176,1903.219,"Sometimes the law, especially on the equity side, assumes what that was done what should have been done."
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,1903.219,1904.829,--That's true.
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1904.829,1907.719,"Now, that would be true if the $92,000 were there, wouldn't it?"
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,1907.719,1909.466,No question about it.
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1917.85,1927.787,"Why should the general creditors profit by the embezzlement or at least the default, to use a kinder word, of the debtor?"
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,1927.787,1945.045,"Well, I think the way the statutory construction is of the Bankruptcy Code is that if in fact a fund exists and can be traced, and the sponsors of the legislation indicate that tracing should be allowed a fairly liberal course--"
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1945.045,1952.416,"The predicate for that statutory provision is that the money belonged to the debtor, is it not?"
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,1952.416,1968.63,"--No, that the money does not belong to the debtor if it can be traced, and the sponsors make it clear that the government is to be given leeway by the Court to attempt to do such a tracing, if at all possible, but that was not attempted to be done here."
1982.82-215,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2016.655,2023.823,"Mr. Relin, did the government's levy count the filing of the petition for reorganization?"
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2023.823,2029.664,"Well, it did, Justice Blackmun, at least on the day that it was filed."
1982.82-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2058.825,2061.012,May I ask just one question before you get into your argument?
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2061.012,2061.512,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
1982.82-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2061.512,2064.495,"The assets in dispute, as I understand it, are primarily physical assets."
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2064.495,2065.228,That's correct.
1982.82-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2065.228,2071.117,"And you have a statement in your brief they had a going concern value of $162,000 or something of that--"
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2071.117,2071.931,The court did so find.
1982.82-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2071.931,2073.616,--That is what I wanted to know.
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2075.086,2075.507,"Oh, yes."
1982.82-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2078.474,2081.177,"Which is, of course, in excess of the government's claim."
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2081.177,2083.751,"Only by $70,000."
1982.82-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2083.751,2084.036,Yes.
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2084.036,2084.629,Yes.
1982.82-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.035,2126.22,Then it would apply to all creditors.
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2126.22,2127.312,Absolutely.
1982.82-215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2254.043,2270.022,"Mr. Relin, do you understand the Second Circuit to have taken the position that you have just now been describing of this generally expanded availability of the turnover order even for property in possession of an adverse creditor?"
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2270.022,2274.394,I understand them to have taken that position with respect to a reorganization.
1982.82-215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2275.849,2277.908,That they reserved as to ordinary?
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2277.908,2296.73,"--Yes, and I don't think it's necessary to reach that because, of course, we are dealing with a reorganization case here, but I think because the section itself, 542(a), is one of the sections of general application, then, Justice Rehnquist, I believe that such an interpretation would be possible."
1982.82-215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2296.73,2301.272,"That is really a fairly important and rather broad question under the new Bankruptcy Act, isn't it?"
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2301.272,2309.256,"It absolutely is, and I don't really purport to give an overall response to that, although it may be--"
1982.82-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.256,2318.829,"What do you think the law was under Chapter 10, the old Chapter 10, with just an ordinary secured creditor who has taken possession immediately prior to the filing of the petition?"
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2320.939,2322.826,--Yes.
1982.82-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2326.858,2332.45,"And if it wasn't subject to summary turnover, it might have been subject to turnover in a plenary suit?"
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2332.45,2334.59,It certainly might have been.
1982.82-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.386,2341.773,I thought the trustee in the old Chapter 10 could collect those kinds of assets.
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2341.773,2346.394,"--Absolutely could, and there is no question that the developed law that--"
1982.82-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.394,2358.549,And do you know of any cases dealing specifically with property held... prior to a Chapter 10 reorganization held by the government under a levy?
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2358.549,2359.829,--Absolutely not.
1982.82-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2359.829,2360.874,There just weren't any?
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2360.874,2368.341,"No, there never were, and I would like to correct you, Justice White, in one minor respect, if I might."
1982.82-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2368.341,2369.48,"Yes, you certainly may."
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2369.48,2370.669,Phelps was a liquidation case.
1982.82-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2380.819,2384.333,"Well, it was a case... was it started out a Chapter 10 case?"
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2384.333,2386.224,Phelps?
1982.82-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2386.224,2386.723,Yes.
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2386.723,2387.441,No.
1982.82-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2387.441,2389.035,It started out a straight bankruptcy case.
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2389.035,2392.798,"It was not only straight, but it was an involuntary bankruptcy."
1982.82-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.798,2395.61,"Well, that is even... that is a fortiori then from a Chapter 11."
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2402.906,2404.747,Yes.
1982.82-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2407.262,2408.404,Which it was.
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2408.404,2409.169,--or in Chapter 11.
1982.82-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2410.011,2410.807,Which Phelps was.
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2410.807,2415.041,"Absolutely was, and that certainly is our position with regard to Phelps."
1982.82-215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2474.688,2478.217,"Where is 543 set out in the briefs, if you know right off?"
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2478.217,2484.043,"Well, it would be, I am fairly certain, in the government's appendix."
1982.82-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2484.043,2487.026,It is in Judge Friendly's opinion in the footnote on Page 6-A.
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2490.633,2518.64,"Now, the essence of 543 seems to be that there must be turnover by any party holding property which was once the debtor's or proceeds of that property if the party holding the party or the proceeds holds it for the benefit of some other party, and it doesn't matter whether that other party is just one creditor or all creditors of the debtor."
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2560.029,2560.622,Excuse me.
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2561.842,2562.357,--Yes.
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2562.357,2575.756,"--542(a) after the... other than custodian in possession language, is followed by what appears to be limitation of property that the trustee may use."
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2575.756,2580.536,"Yes, may use, sell, or lease under Section 363."
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2580.536,2598.669,"Now, if, as I had suggested in my earlier question, this company had done what they should have done legally, put it in a separate account identified as withholding tax, then would that have been property that the trustee may use?"
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2598.669,2603.715,"Not that property, but the property that was seized here by the government, absolutely."
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2616.022,2616.755,What about bank accounts?
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2618.475,2628.125,"Well, there is an indication in the legislative history that perhaps the courts should assume that the last money in bank accounts is in fact trust funds."
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2628.125,2629.97,--Is impressed with a constructive trust.
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2629.97,2639.824,"Yes, that is really a constructive trust argument, or resulting trust, perhaps, in a traditional sense, but not in the case of tangible property."
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2660.707,2677.871,"If the trustee... if the government could show that some of this $92,000 was used to purchase the physical, tangible assets that were seized, would the constructive or resulting trust follow?"
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2677.871,2679.962,Absolutely.
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2687.32,2688.771,But that hasn't been undertaken.
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2688.771,2690.319,--Not in this case.
1982.82-215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2794.323,2806.629,"Mr. Relin, to your knowledge, was Judge Magruder's opinion in Reconstruction Finance the only Court of Appeals opinion treating the particular issue that it did under the old bankruptcy law?"
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,2806.629,2827.076,"Well, that particular issue was dealt with in various other cases in other categories, although I think, as far as I know, Reconstruction Finance was the only case that actually dealt with inventory, which was the seized assets in that particular case."
1982.82-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3330.213,3338.289,Certainly that would have been the case if the non-tax secured creditor had seized physical assets and were holding them pursuant to a lien.
1982.82-215,1,35041,lloyd_h_relin,,3338.289,3338.819,Yes.
1982.82-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3540.879,3544.44,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Smith?"
1982.82-215,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3544.44,3547.922,"Yes, I do."
1982.82-215,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3700.794,3702.151,"Thank you, gentlemen."
