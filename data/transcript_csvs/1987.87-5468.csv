1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.558,"Mr. Abrams, you may proceed whenever you wish to."
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,12.558,15.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,57.353,63.49,"What was the basis of the reversal of the conviction, Mr. Abrams, by the New York Court of Appeals?"
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,63.49,74.214,The New York Court of Appeals reversed the conviction specifically on the ground that there had been no right to appeal provided to Sam Johnson in New York.
1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,74.214,76.916,No right to appeal?
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,76.916,79.283,"Well, it was a few things which came together."
1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,139.537,141.87,The just didn't give him a late appeal then.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,141.87,146.691,"No, what they said in effect is that there is not enough left to talk about here."
1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,191.303,195.522,Isn't the burden normally on an appellant in New York to show error?
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,195.522,201.777,"Not in a situation, Your Honor, where he was denied a Jackson hearing."
1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,235.832,239.284,"Do they ordinarily... but they would pass on those claims, I would think."
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,239.284,264.665,"Ordinarily what the New York Court of Appeals has done in the past in the Rivera case, the Montgomery case where a lot of time has passed and it has passed because of the action of the state, only if it has passed because of state misconduct so to speak as opposed to defendant misconduct, what they have routinely done in New York in those cases is to dismiss and to reverse the state conviction."
1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,264.665,270.969,Even though they do not make any judgment on the merits as to whether the conviction was infected with error.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,270.969,276.89,"In the earlier Rivera case, they made no decision on the merits as to the correctness of the conviction."
1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,289.967,292.169,That was as far as they went on the merits?
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,292.169,292.769,Yes.
1987.87-5468,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,308.178,310.463,But the conviction is another thing.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,310.463,312.546,The conviction is a nullity under New York law.
1987.87-5468,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,312.546,313.129,In New York.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,313.129,313.629,"Yes, sir."
1987.87-5468,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,313.629,321.533,"Mr. Abrams, that means that another state cannot take it into account for any purpose?"
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,321.533,323.418,"I believe so, Justice Scalia."
1987.87-5468,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,323.418,325.437,By reason of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,325.437,325.987,"Yes, sir."
1987.87-5468,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,325.987,328.305,What if the governor had pardoned--
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,328.305,334.208,There I think it's a somewhat harder issue because what the pardon means--
1987.87-5468,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,334.208,336.125,--Not if you are relying on Full Faith and Credit.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,336.125,339.077,"--No, I think it depends on what a pardon means in the state."
1987.87-5468,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.6,346.283,Let's assume it does.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,362.376,370.216,"--Again, I would distinguish between a pardon issued by the executive of the state and a judicial determination."
1987.87-5468,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,384.358,384.974,It wouldn't have to be the same.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,392.528,395.38,--So long as you ask me to assume I'm in a state--
1987.87-5468,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.38,395.997,That's right.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,395.997,398.182,--in which a pardon wipes it out completely.
1987.87-5468,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.182,398.666,Right.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,398.666,408.489,"If a pardon wipes it out completely, then I would be urging upon you that a pardon under Full Faith and Credit ought to be given the same effect as if it was a judicial decree."
1987.87-5468,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.387,443.98,It seems to me there is one thing... there is a difference between giving a decision of another state full faith and credit in the sense that it has an operative legal effect.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,474.832,478.117,--This was given legal effect in Mississippi.
1987.87-5468,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,504.749,505.367,It doesn't say record.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,507.267,508.034,"--Yes, it does."
1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,550.395,564.755,It's your position that the Full Faith and Credit Clause has a negative operation; that a second state cannot give a judgment any more faith and credit than it has given in the state that it originated.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,564.755,565.672,That's correct.
1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,565.672,567.422,And what case from this Court--
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,567.422,570.124,"This Court has not held that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,570.124,572.659,--Then what's the basis of your argument then?
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,572.659,574.778,The basis of the argument is this.
1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,587.169,600.809,"I think we have cases in our jurisprudence that say even though the state was not required by the Full Faith and Credit Clause to give effect to a particular judgment, it could do so unless there is a due process context relation."
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,600.809,609.682,"It is not my argument, Mr. Chief Justice, that Mississippi is obliged to give full faith and credit to criminal convictions from out of state."
1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,630.079,633.631,What case in this Court comes closest to supporting your proposition?
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,633.631,643.672,"Well, this Court has talked in terms of states not being able to pick and choose between giving full faith and credit sometimes and sometimes not giving full faith and credit."
1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,643.672,646.807,Do you have a case in mind that supports you?
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,646.807,650.576,"I will give you that name right after lunch, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,758.161,762.279,"In dealing with the federal Court of Appeals, we're dealing with federal convictions?"
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,762.279,763.479,"--Yes, sir, yes."
1987.87-5468,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,803.854,804.67,Mr. Abrams.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,804.67,805.272,Yes.
1987.87-5468,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,805.272,810.441,Was that full faith and credit argument made to the Mississippi court below?
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,810.441,811.126,"Yes, it was."
1987.87-5468,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,811.126,823.934,"May I ask, Mr. Abrams, are you asking that we give more than the required full faith and credit to the earlier conviction?"
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,851.601,853.267,"Yes, yes, the reversal."
1987.87-5468,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,873.097,882.553,"But if it's relevant, then they would have to take the reversal whether or not they have considered the earlier conviction, I would think is your argument."
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,882.553,882.769,Yes.
1987.87-5468,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,984.182,985.468,And that was done here.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,985.468,987.068,"That was done here, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1987.87-5468,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1162.88,1169.652,"For the Mississippi court, you had your other spirited division of opinion, didn't you?"
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1169.652,1170.502,"Indeed, indeed."
1987.87-5468,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1189.297,1204.223,"Mr. Abrams, you said that the New York State's Attorney vigorously contested the relitigation of this and refused to accept anything but the resentencing."
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1211.646,1217.216,The New York Attorney General's office opposed setting aside of the sentence.
1987.87-5468,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1217.216,1223.786,So this was a genuinely litigated matter in New York from beginning to end.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1223.786,1225.436,"Yes, it was genuinely litigated."
1987.87-5468,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1227.522,1228.238,Adversely litigated.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1228.238,1252.806,"--so as not to mislead the Court, that the New York Attorney General's office, in my view, in the highest tradition of the bar, advised every court that it appeared before in New York that they had investigated and that Sam Johnson had not in fact been advised of his right to appeal, and that therefore resentencing was appropriate under the circumstances, and then that an appeal should follow."
1987.87-5468,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1290.413,1298.001,"Mr. Abrams, there was no holding in New York that failure to give him an appeal denied him a constitutional right."
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1298.001,1303.572,"The New York State court cited New York cases, yes."
1987.87-5468,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1312.511,1322.117,"Do you think in effect it was a holding that his conviction was unconstitutional, or that the constitution required the setting aside of his conviction?"
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1322.117,1334.358,"In response to the first part of your question, Mr. Justice White, they did not say that this conviction was unconstitutional under federal law."
1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1376.537,1379.322,"We will resume there at 1:00, Mr. Abrams."
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1379.322,1379.872,--Thank you.
1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1379.872,1390.644,"We'll resume where we were before lunch, Mr. Abrams."
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1390.644,1392.946,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-5468,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1511.337,1521.812,"Well, is there some other constitutional reason based on... reason based on the federal constitution why this conviction could not be used in this sentencing proceeding?"
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1521.812,1536.654,"Yes, the other reason is a due process reason that this Court has in the Burgett case, in the Tucker case, in the Townsend case, come down hard on lower courts, state and federal, in which you have used--"
1987.87-5468,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1536.654,1540.623,Would you think you have a better chance of winning on Full Faith and Credit than the due process?
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1540.623,1542.289,"--I thought so coming in, but--"
1987.87-5468,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.289,1544.941,"Well, at least you've got some cases in this Court."
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1544.941,1546.593,--I do have cases in this Court on that.
1987.87-5468,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.537,1563.305,But you have no cases on Full Faith and Credit.
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1563.305,1566.506,"On Full Faith and Credit, in terms of reversed criminal convictions, no."
1987.87-5468,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1575.279,1578.564,But weren't they all involving enhancement statutes?
1987.87-5468,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1578.564,1593.408,"They were enhancement cases, yes, yes, and they were cases in which information which came before state and federal courts was later stricken because it turned out to be wrong just as hear."
1987.87-5468,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1632.366,1633.899,"Thank you, Mr. Abrams."
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1636.268,1642.322,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-5468,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1782.793,1794.501,"Has Mississippi in the past, when they find one of several aggravating circumstances invalid, normally remand it for a new trial?"
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1794.501,1795.435,"No, it has not."
1987.87-5468,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1795.435,1799.071,So the appellate court does the reweighing itself?
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1799.071,1799.604,"Yes, it does."
1987.87-5468,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1799.604,1808.277,"And if it finds that the valid aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, they affirm?"
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1808.277,1809.76,"They affirm, right."
1987.87-5468,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1836.012,1838.297,"But they say,"
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1846.401,1847.736,"That's what I am relying on, yes, sir."
1987.87-5468,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1847.736,1850.521,You don't think they took that back a couple of pages later?
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1852.621,1877.005,"Well, they talk a lot about what the effect of the New York vacation in that particular instance were, but I think that we get to that point, and they say it would not affect that, and we are relying on that that they were correct in that the sentence of death would not be disturbed because of the vacation of that New York sentence."
1987.87-5468,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1877.005,1883.576,"All this means that if you should lose now, he still may receive the death penalty."
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1883.576,1884.542,"Yes, sir."
1987.87-5468,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1908.124,1915.963,"Mr. White, what's the language you rely upon to say that the Mississippi court actually did a reweighing?"
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1926.403,1927.521,Right.
1987.87-5468,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1927.521,1932.906,Nor is the other statement you rely on actually a redoing of the weighing by the Supreme Court.
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1948.517,1951.084,"Well, those are the thing we rely on."
1987.87-5468,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1988.143,1991.927,Wouldn't they say it would support an unchanged outcome?
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1997.331,1997.981,--That's right.
1987.87-5468,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1997.981,2005.604,"But that's a bit different from reweighing it themselves and saying, well, you know, the jury goofed up through no fault of their own because there was inadmissible evidence."
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2010.925,2018.412,"Well, in Wainwright v. Goode, the way I read it, the court there did not go into an extensive reweighing."
1987.87-5468,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.733,2046.848,"--before this one where it's clear that the Mississippi Supreme Court does reweigh, where they have expressly said, we do not... when one of several aggravating circumstances is invalidated, we do not necessarily send it back for a new sentencing hearing, we will reweigh?"
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2046.848,2047.998,Yes.
1987.87-5468,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.435,2054.935,"Stringer v. State, and Irving."
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2054.935,2060.089,"They are cited in my brief, I think Stringer and Irving both."
1987.87-5468,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.089,2060.439,All right.
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2060.439,2063.791,And in the Nixon opinion that is--
1987.87-5468,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.791,2067.343,"So it is Stringer, and the other one was what, Irving?"
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2067.343,2067.693,--Irving.
1987.87-5468,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.361,2069.811,"Yes, I've got it."
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2069.811,2072.813,"--And Irving, 498."
1987.87-5468,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2085.704,2096.428,"And doesn't necessarily vitiate it, but will... but do they say, we will not send back for a new sentencing hearing?"
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2096.428,2097.964,--They say--
1987.87-5468,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2097.964,2099.747,"We will reweigh, and we find the--"
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2099.747,2103.082,"--Well, they have never said they will not."
1987.87-5468,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.425,2115.725,--Yes?
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2115.725,2124.281,"It is something we will consider at that point to think, in our opinion whether a new sentencing hearing is required."
1987.87-5468,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2124.281,2125.147,"Well, what did Irving hold?"
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2125.147,2127.064,Irving held the same thing.
1987.87-5468,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2148.897,2151.682,"Well, that's very good, but I mean that's just what we are arguing about here."
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2151.682,2152.232,--Right.
1987.87-5468,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.232,2164.489,The issue is it's clear that it doesn't invalidate it if the court is reweighing in light of that invalidation itself.
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2189.39,2203.031,"I think from the reading of Zant and Barclay and Goode, the court places great emphasis on the proportionality review separate from."
1987.87-5468,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.941,2244.291,--Is that really fair to the defendant though?
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2286.185,2291.839,I think maybe it is in some circumstances here.
1987.87-5468,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.762,2333.582,"General White, isn't there involved in this case still another problem though?"
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2347.057,2347.474,I agree.
1987.87-5468,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2347.474,2348.426,It would be improper.
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2348.426,2348.759,I agree.
1987.87-5468,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2348.759,2356.781,"So here if you say that we didn't know at the time, the jury did consider evidence that we now know it should not have considered."
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2356.781,2359.899,"Well, they did, yes."
1987.87-5468,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2359.899,2374.493,"So these other cases where you invalidate an aggravating circumstance usually the evidence supporting the circumstance is properly before the jury, and the question really is whether it was entitled to have the label aggravating circumstance attached to it."
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2374.493,2374.959,Yes.
1987.87-5468,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2375.409,2376.126,"But this is a little different, I think."
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2376.126,2385.099,"--Well, it's like the situation in Smith v. Picunia, or Smith v. Murray, and your dissent in that case where there was a Fifth Amendment violation."
1987.87-5468,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2385.099,2386.384,"Of course, that was a procedural bar case rather than--"
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2386.384,2401.06,"A procedural bar case, but your dissent, of course, said the procedural bar should not be applied, and that the Fifth Amendment violation relating to one of the aggravating circumstances should vitiated the whole... the death penalty and a new sentencing hearing was conducted."
1987.87-5468,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2444.57,2452.576,"--Well, Mr. White, what does Mississippi rely on in these aggravating circumstances?"
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2461.349,2469.121,"Well, under the facts of the case, you introduce the certified copies from the State of New York."
1987.87-5468,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2469.121,2470.021,"And that's it, just the conviction."
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2470.021,2470.588,Right.
1987.87-5468,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2471.321,2473.673,And that has now been set aside.
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2473.673,2474.29,--That has been.
1987.87-5468,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2482.678,2501.592,What do you assert that the Petitioner should have done in this case to raise his constitutional challenge in light of your Phillips case and Nixon case in Mississippi?
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2501.592,2516.435,"Well, in the Phillips case, of course, dealt with a habitual offender statute type situation where we had... and as the court distinguished it here, our Supreme Court distinguished the use of Phillips in this type case and--"
1987.87-5468,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2516.435,2525.291,"Well, my question to you is, what do you say this Petitioner should have done here to put his claim before the courts?"
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2525.291,2538.099,"--Well, relying on the bar that the Mississippi Supreme Court applied in this case, that one found in Evans v. State, he should have raised it as the soonest possible moment he could have after the conviction or beforehand."
1987.87-5468,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2543.836,2548.055,"Well, I don't think I understand."
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2552.775,2553.742,He could have.
1987.87-5468,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2554.492,2564.014,I'm asking what he should have done in order to enable the Mississippi courts to address the problem that has arisen.
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2564.014,2570.668,"--In Phillips, and as it is now interpreted in Nixon, he did what the Supreme Court now has said he should have done."
1987.87-5468,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2572.204,2575.07,"Well, then how could he be procedurally barred?"
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2575.07,2581.642,For the failure to do it speedily after that time.
1987.87-5468,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2699.552,2716.829,"But Lowenfield did not involve a situation in which the defendant's claim is the jury... he could not possibly have said the jury wouldn't have reached the result it did, and that's the situation here."
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2722.816,2723.233,Certainly.
1987.87-5468,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2723.233,2724.983,Now that situation didn't exist in Lowenfield.
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2724.983,2725.483,That's right.
1987.87-5468,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2725.483,2731.403,"All the stuff that went before the jury was directly before them, and they made the decision on the basis of all of that."
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2738.992,2747.014,"Well, it says, though, that it's not required."
1987.87-5468,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2764.06,2768.262,Are you saying they are not constitutionally required by the federal constitution?
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2768.262,2768.678,That's right.
1987.87-5468,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2768.678,2771.394,"Well, let's take the normal criminal trial."
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2797.511,2798.28,"I agree, I agree with that."
1987.87-5468,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2798.28,2802.065,"Here the state didn't have to require the jury to find all this, but it did."
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2802.065,2802.582,It did.
1987.87-5468,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2802.582,2808.903,"And we don't know that the jury actually found it, or properly found it."
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2808.903,2843.142,"But we would basically rely, though, on the proportionality review there in the readings of Zant and Barclay and Goode in that when this proportionality review is made, even in light of an invalidated aggravated circumstances or invalid circumstance, that this review that the invalidation of this aggravating circumstance here does not make the penalty arbitrary, or freakish, or capricious, nor is it excessive or disproportionate in this case."
1987.87-5468,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2864.99,2867.025,Would you clear up one thing for me?
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2882.184,2884.386,--It could be.
1987.87-5468,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2895.694,2896.011,Right.
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2896.011,2902.948,"You have to prove two, or sometimes the prosecutor will go and prove three, and this is before the judge only."
1987.87-5468,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2939.704,2946.294,"But if it were set aside in the same time sequence that we had here, normally the trial judge would take a second look at the sentence then."
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2946.294,2948.16,"Well, it wouldn't go back to the trial judge."
1987.87-5468,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2948.16,2950.326,Or would it automatically be reduced--
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2950.326,2961.218,"The procedure in Mississippi, of course, is that once something is appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court, it goes back to that court for an application to proceed in a lower court."
1987.87-5468,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2978.695,2994.439,"--I'm still not clear on... had this not been a capital case and been an enhance sentencing case, and you had the same sequence of events, say one of the two prior convictions was set side as this one was after the sentencing, would there be a new sentencing either by the Mississippi Supreme Court or by the trial court?"
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2994.439,2996.907,In that case he would be... the sentence would be reduced.
1987.87-5468,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2996.907,2997.691,It would be reduced.
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2997.691,2998.343,It would be reduced.
1987.87-5468,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3012.316,3017.654,There would be no Mississippi procedural bar to a reduction of the sentence in this same time sequence.
1987.87-5468,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,3018.537,3019.589,--I don't know that.
1987.87-5468,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3115.968,3118.003,"Thank you, Mr. White."
1987.87-5468,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3120.17,3132.31,It is not our position in this case that there should be an automatic reversal when an aggravating circumstance is held invalid.
1987.87-5468,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3164.262,3175.404,--competent constitutionally to reweigh the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating and affirm?
1987.87-5468,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3175.404,3181.641,"I would say, first of all, that is not what the court did in this case as a constitutional matter."
1987.87-5468,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3181.641,3183.676,"Well, that's your reading of this opinion."
1987.87-5468,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3183.676,3188.145,"Yes, sir, it is my reading of this opinion on two separate basis."
1987.87-5468,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3188.58,3189.547,"Well, how about my question now?"
1987.87-5468,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3189.547,3190.08,--Right.
1987.87-5468,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3225.837,3229.389,What constitutional provision would be violated?
1987.87-5468,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3229.389,3232.072,I believe the Eighth Amendment would be violated.
1987.87-5468,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3302.918,3304.62,I'm not taking about proportionality.
1987.87-5468,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3304.62,3305.453,"Yes, sir."
1987.87-5468,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3349.715,3351.298,"Thank you, Mr. Abrams."
