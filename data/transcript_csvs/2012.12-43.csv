2012.12-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.939,"We'll hear argument next in Case 12-43, PPL Corporation and Subsidiaries v. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,9.856,12.658,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,74.395,80.482,"See, I have a problem with this argument because it assumes a way of looking at this, but it's an assumption."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,125.792,129.546,"--Well, it has to be my way because of the way the specific tax was designed."
2012.12-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,130.646,145.222,"No, you can only do it your way if you do what the amici says, which is to take out from your simplified equation the fact that the time -- the D element of your equation -- is constant."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,156.196,160.081,"--Well, Your Honor, we're not artificially freezing the number."
2012.12-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,171.373,179.227,"But there was at least two or three companies that had a very different period and they paid a huge amount, much further than their gross profits."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,181.745,183.697,I can talk about the outlying companies.
2012.12-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,203.608,211.964,"But you change the other part of the equation, or the tax regulation, which says it has to be true for all taxpayers."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,211.964,212.63,No.
2012.12-43,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,270.314,288.96,"Suppose everyone in the case conceded that the purpose of this statute was to compensate the government for having valued the shares at too low a price, and this was stated right in the enactment."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,290.978,299.001,"It wouldn't, Justice Kennedy, because at the end of the day, it's the substance of the tax, not its purpose behind it that matters."
2012.12-43,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,317.545,325.651,"Well, suppose we think this is both a tax on profits and a tax on low value, then what do we do?"
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,325.651,336.191,"--Well, in this particular case, you would say it's creditable, because the only measure of value here is by looking at retrospective earnings over a 4-year period."
2012.12-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,390.009,390.661,Mr. Clement--
2012.12-43,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,390.661,400.433,"Suppose it's a one -- if I could just -- suppose -- we say, well this is a one-time tax in order to recalculate, reassess the value."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,404.984,405.836,--Yes.
2012.12-43,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,434.97,440.538,"Mr. Clement, is there another example -- Justice Kennedy mentioned that this was what they call one-off."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,462.537,470.141,"--Justice Ginsburg, I can't put all the pieces of that together and say there's one case that had all of these various features, and then it was still creditable."
2012.12-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,492.757,514.672,"My fear is, as warned by the government and the tax professors, that the rule you want us to announce to help you win is to say anytime a tax uses estimates of profits, no matter how it does it, it is credible -- creditable."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,515.955,516.872,"No, it is not."
2012.12-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,564.883,574.073,"So why isn't that to say I want to find the original floatation value, and instead of estimating what the profits are, I'm simply going to use the ones that happen?"
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,574.073,575.075,Exactly.
2012.12-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,575.075,576.308,So why is that different?
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,576.308,579.727,Because you never would do that in any normal valuation.
2012.12-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,602.723,613.012,"Well, there is an argument about that because it has two components that you keep ignoring: The floatation value and the time that the company--"
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,613.012,615.797,--I would love to talk about those other variables.
2012.12-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,629.723,631.823,"--Well, Mr. -- I'm sorry, please."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,631.823,633.941,Go ahead.
2012.12-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,635.957,636.307,I'd really like to hear what you have to say.
2012.12-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,636.307,636.641,Okay.
2012.12-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,637.309,639.043,"Wait, Justice Kagan."
2012.12-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,642.211,650.317,"Do you agree -- I mean, you said we should look to the way this is designed, so let's look to the way that the actual formula is designed."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,668.012,671.297,"Yes, and that's true of every excess profits tax, Your Honor."
2012.12-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,672.897,673.713,"Well, that's the question."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,715.659,716.626,--No.
2012.12-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,720.178,720.644,One year or four years?
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,720.644,722.863,--They have the same -- they'd have the same rate.
2012.12-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,729.533,737.789,"In other words, a company that has made four times as much profits under this formula could pay the same tax; isn't that right?"
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,737.789,739.406,--I -- I don't think--
2012.12-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,739.406,741.508,Because it was operating four times as long.
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,741.508,742.358,--Right.
2012.12-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,742.358,744.793,And because there is that D variable.
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,744.793,746.495,Right; that's right.
2012.12-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,750.797,753.398,Assuming the floatation value is the same for both companies.
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,753.398,758.036,"--Then -- then maybe it could, Justice Kagan, but let me say two things about that."
2012.12-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,758.036,758.852,It definitely could.
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,772.294,772.962,No.
2012.12-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,792.123,800.613,But -- but the reason why this formula was devised in the way that this formula was devised was specifically to get at the outlier.
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,829.216,831.483,"No, that's not right, Your Honor."
2012.12-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.495,901.078,Excuse me.
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,907.999,909.082,--They were.
2012.12-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,958.779,969.318,"No, but even companies with the exact same profits and the exact same floatation value can be subject to different taxes, and that's a result of the amount of time."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,972.72,973.553,"--With respect, that's only true of--"
2012.12-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,973.553,973.82,--Excuse me.
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,985.961,987.73,"--With respect, I disagree."
2012.12-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1028.286,1034.69,"If you were right, it would just be a 52 percent tax on annual profits above 1/9th of the floatation value."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1059.84,1063.227,Because they had three free years in the out-years.
2012.12-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1072.166,1076.385,"--The problem with their argument, Mr. Clement, is that you are undermining your own argument."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1085.923,1086.925,"No, that's not right."
2012.12-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1086.925,1091.644,So they don't need to be taxed any more moving forward because they got it right.
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1091.644,1093.596,"No, that's -- with all due respect, that's not right."
2012.12-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1115.109,1122.696,I wanted -- I just wanted to hear what you were going to say in answer to the second part of Justice Sotomayor's earlier question.
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1133.921,1134.421,Right.
2012.12-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1134.421,1159.471,"But I did notice, that if you take.23 times fair value, not quite by coincidence, it happens to be what the companies would have made over a period of 2 years in profit, had it been the truth that the value of such companies was, as valued by the market, 9 times their earnings."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1258.234,1268.522,"Well, I -- I think so, but I think I get there in a slightly different way, because I guess I don't see the natural relationship between the 23 percent and the floatation value; but I think I get to a similar place."
2012.12-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1313.553,1316.086,It will do that for firms that are in business for 4 years.
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1316.086,1316.588,--Yes.
2012.12-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1316.588,1317.205,Absolutely.
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1321.873,1323.075,It -- it will give you a different number.
2012.12-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1323.075,1324.225,--A very different number.
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1324.225,1324.391,Yes.
2012.12-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1324.391,1330.711,"Indeed, a number that could exceed the money -- all the money they really make in the next 2 years."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1330.711,1331.261,That's not true.
2012.12-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1334.044,1334.213,"Yes, that's correct."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1350.156,1351.589,Railtrack.
2012.12-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1355.209,1356.559,--I know -- I know they didn't.
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1358.078,1370.819,"--And -- and -- and that is a very important fact because when you are trying to figure out -- what -- and again, their regulation says, you look to the application of the statute in the normal circumstances in which it applies."
2012.12-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1395.852,1397.452,Let's go back to my initial question.
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1405.808,1406.391,--No.
2012.12-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1407.424,1427.821,"I don't know how you get around it, because you seem to be saying to us that no matter how -- what formula you create, so long as we can simplify it in math to affect which -- take any variables in it and fix them in any way, that's a creditable tax."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1430.356,1432.106,"--No, it's not, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.12-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1438.695,1447.135,"No, I'm saying to you that any tax that relies upon actual profits in any way, you say is wrong."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1447.135,1448.685,It's not right or wrong.
2012.12-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1474.968,1478.086,"No, the floatation value is not fixed; it was different for each company."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1478.086,1478.769,--Right.
2012.12-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1479.252,1484.84,"They only fixed the percentage that they're going to use, but the actual amount paid was different for every company."
2012.12-43,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1484.84,1487.358,"--But again, that is classic excess profits tax."
2012.12-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1546.83,1547.663,"Thank you, Counsel."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1552.9,1555.419,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-43,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1576.0,1581.318,That -- that's a way of estimating future value.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1600.798,1609.987,"Well, Justice Scalia, the -- what parliament was trying to do here was to impute a value on the company for which should have been sold in 1990."
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1616.975,1619.36,"If they know what it really was, I guess they're all billionaires."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1633.034,1640.038,"Well, the point is that parliament was trying to come up with a value that it should have charged for these companies in 1990, and, you know--"
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1640.038,1652.429,"So, since there is no real value, I -- I mean, maybe there is, because they did it in the form of an IPO, and the share then went the next day into the market, and when the it went the next day into the market, did the market pay a lot more?"
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1652.429,1652.862,"--Yes, it did."
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1652.862,1653.762,Really?
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1653.762,1654.695,There -- there is--
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1654.695,1655.845,"All right, then you could use that."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1656.714,1657.58,"--Well, but if you use--"
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1657.58,1659.147,How does that relate to the number 9?
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1659.147,1665.467,"--If you use just the profits on the next day, that wouldn't capture all of the efficiencies that were realized over the--"
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1665.467,1665.834,"Yes, yes."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1687.897,1689.766,"--Well, that is true."
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1691.784,1696.603,The reason that that is relevant here of course is this number 9 is a made-up number.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1705.026,1706.042,--It is -- it is--
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1706.042,1706.592,Isn't that true?
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1706.592,1709.475,--The number 9 was not an arbitrary number.
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1709.475,1717.329,"No, it was a number picked by whatever company had, what is it, the -- the lowest price earnings ratio or something like that."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1717.329,1717.529,Right.
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1718.414,1718.697,Okay.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1848.562,1863.991,"Justice Breyer, I think the problem with, when we start to reformulate what this tax is or is not taxing or what the amount of the actual tax is, just shows the danger of trying to reformulate what parliament actually did in trying to determine if it's an income tax."
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1877.749,1878.917,"But I said, so what?"
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1898.412,1899.763,In that characterization--
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1899.763,1905.065,As long as you're not -- they actually have the gross income from which this comes.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1905.065,1917.539,"--In that characterization, Justice Breyer, the 207 percent of average annual profits over one-ninth of floatation value, then, no, it's not an income tax and the rate does matter because it's completely confiscatory--"
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1917.539,1917.923,"No, it will."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1933.832,1935.017,--Right.
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1935.017,1936.633,Is that right?
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1936.633,1937.283,It's true.
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1937.283,1947.508,"So here, by good luck for them or bad luck for you or whatever it is, they have not taxed more than the gross income of the companies."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1948.625,1952.593,"They have not taxed more than the total profits over a four-year period, which is--"
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1952.593,1952.993,--Four-year period.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1970.554,1978.31,"--Well, the U.S. income tax -- what the regulation looks for is taxes that have the essential features of the U.S. income tax."
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1984.048,2001.341,"So you say whatever -- if they impose it on more than a year, any country that calculates the income tax over a period for more than a year is outside the tax treaty because it's essential to the nature of the American income tax system that it be calculated year by year."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2003.957,2004.459,"--Yes, I am."
2012.12-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2045.131,2048.585,Could you -- I'm sorry.
2012.12-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2048.585,2061.992,"We had a lot of -- your friend had a lot of questions on the different periods, the initial periods and changing the D value and what that did to the -- that is not an argument that you've made, is it?"
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2061.992,2062.792,That's right.
2012.12-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2082.49,2083.925,"Well, but that is -- again, that's not an argument you've made."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2083.925,2086.058,"--No, but our the amicus did make it."
2012.12-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2086.794,2091.096,"Well, the amicus did, but I don't think we should do a better job of getting money from people than the IRS does."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2091.096,2104.922,"--Well, the point is that -- the fact that there is a D variable there shows that what parliament was trying to do was to place an annual earnings figure on each company to create a value for it."
2012.12-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2118.596,2121.448,"No, that's a good articulation of the argument you haven't made."
2012.12-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2121.448,2127.518,So you are accepting the position the government made in v. Exxon.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2131.32,2132.089,Right.
2012.12-43,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2135.257,2138.226,You're not saying that the amicus brief is wrong.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2147.515,2148.449,--It's not wrong.
2012.12-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2173.499,2182.438,"I thought you were saying that that argument was wrong, because you looked to the predominant character of the tax and that it's either a tax -- it's either an income tax or it's not."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2195.93,2197.015,That's right.
2012.12-43,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2202.084,2207.388,"Because they're saying this is not an income for anybody because, in fact, this doesn't tax anybody's income."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2218.194,2224.598,"--That particular aspect of the amicus brief that says if it's bad for one, it's bad for all, yes, that is not our position."
2012.12-43,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2241.992,2248.113,"Well, now I'm totally confused, because this outlier is an outlier not because the tax hasn't worked."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2279.767,2290.125,"Well, I mean, you could also get to that by saying that the predominant character of this tax is -- is not an income tax because of the way that it applies to everybody else."
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2401.197,2415.039,"--On that -- on the question of how to treat, I -- there isn't authority but, I mean, if I'm quite honest about how I think about it, I think the people in the tax court actually usually know more about it than the judges who are not on the tax court."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2435.368,2443.988,"--Well, Justice Breyer, with due respect to the tax court, the tax court didn't even analyze any of the three regulatory tests that are set forth in the regulation."
2012.12-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2444.224,2449.792,"I thought you would -- when you would answer that that the Commissioner gets some credit, too."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2460.348,2461.231,--Yes.
2012.12-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2473.84,2477.975,But there is no difference between what the Commissioner says the regulation means and what it says.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2477.975,2479.075,--That's true.
2012.12-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2479.541,2481.224,It doesn't seem to move the ball much one way or the other.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2481.224,2503.906,"--That's true unless you accept Petitioner's argument that what the regulation means when it says you evaluate the tax based on its predominant character is that that means you can rewrite the tax before you start testing it against the three regulatory requirements, and in which case, this would be a 51.75 percent tax on four years of profits that you are testing against the three regulatory requirements."
2012.12-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2544.483,2546.283,What if you -- go ahead.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2571.231,2580.253,"I think that would not be an income tax, because they are using a valuation formula that is imputing a value on the company and then taxing that value."
2012.12-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2580.253,2583.122,Based solely on the amount of income?
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2583.122,2595.262,"Well, if that -- if that were the only characteristic, then I think a property tax that is calculated that way could become an income tax, and that's not what the income tax credit -- the foreign tax credit is designed to do."
2012.12-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2595.262,2598.398,How could -- a property tax calculated that way?
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2600.598,2602.183,Times the price-to-earnings ratio.
2012.12-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2621.461,2626.046,"But if they said, We are going to multiply it by a price/earnings ratio."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2626.046,2627.065,--Yes.
2012.12-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2627.065,2628.648,Based on how much you earned.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2628.648,2629.417,Yes.
2012.12-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2629.417,2631.167,Which sounds like income.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2631.167,2633.802,"No, that sounds like value."
2012.12-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2635.668,2638.02,The “ how much you earned ” part sounds like income.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2638.02,2644.424,"--Yes, but -- but any valuation formula will use some known data from the company to determine a company's value."
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2662.886,2665.486,If the reformulation -- think of -- think that first term.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2769.835,2772.354,"--No, if you're--"
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2772.354,2772.904,Okay.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2772.904,2779.608,"--First of all, if the first part of the equation is -- is profits multiplied by 2, then -- then no."
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2780.624,2781.208,"No, no."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2834.24,2834.706,--If you--
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2834.706,2839.894,So what we are doing is taking the average annual profit over a four-year period.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2873.198,2882.987,"--Well, and I think what you are -- the one point of this that is missing is: If you are going to multiply the other part by 2, you also have to multiply the tax rate by 2."
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2883.839,2885.206,That's why I said 50 percent.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2885.206,2889.174,"--No, no, it would be -- it would be 100-and-some percent."
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2890.707,2896.428,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, that rate could be a problem for somebody at some time in some place."
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2896.428,2896.844,--It would be--
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2896.844,2907.067,It wasn't a problem here because all of these companies but one did have and did fit within the four-year category.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2919.374,2928.061,"--Well, Justice Breyer, in your -- in your reconstructed formula, the tax rate is going to be twice the 51.75 percent."
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2928.813,2929.313,It is?
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2929.313,2930.046,--Yes.
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2931.931,2935.483,"Of the one year, you haven't calculated on one year, but it's 50 percent of two years, isn't it?"
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2937.849,2939.199,--It's 50 percent for all four years.
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2942.151,2942.667,--All right.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2942.667,2944.867,It's 51.75 percent for all years.
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2944.867,2945.217,All right.
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2954.056,2962.728,"Justice Breyer, I just -- I want to address for a minute the -- the issue that it wasn't confiscatory of any particular taxpayer's net gain."
2012.12-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3008.621,3022.197,Ms. O'Connell -- if the Court should go the way the Fifth Circuit went -- or the Tax Court went -- could the regulation be changed so it wouldn't happen again?
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,3022.197,3026.166,"If so, then I -- I think it should be changed."
2012.12-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3046.913,3049.265,Why -- why should it be changed?
2012.12-43,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,3059.222,3062.524,"Well, Justice Breyer, they're not."
2012.12-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3168.107,3169.323,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-43,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3171.475,3172.325,Thank you.
2012.12-43,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3241.27,3264.168,"Mr. Clement, what do you think would -- is the answer -- suppose that the Labour government had come in, not after 4 years but after 2 years, that they looked at those 2 years of profits, they said that's enough for us to know that these companies were grossly undervalued, and they had done this exact same formula, and the result is that they would have ended up with a tax rate of over 100 percent."
2012.12-43,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3266.353,3269.139,"--I would be here with a more difficult case, Justice Kagan."
2012.12-43,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3288.284,3296.723,"I guess what the hypothetical suggests is that in some respects, the fact that you now -- that you have a tax rate here of between zero and 1 is a bit of a fluke."
2012.12-43,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3310.463,3318.819,"Can I just say, though, it wouldn't have been a fluke, because one of the things that the people that constructed this tax wanted out of this tax is they wanted it paid."
2012.12-43,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3402.454,3403.621,"Thank you, counsel."
