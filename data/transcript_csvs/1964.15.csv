1964.15,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,36.881,"Number 15, National Labor Relations Board versus Burnup & Sims."
1964.15,0,16666,arnold_ordman,,36.881,38.091,May it please the Court.
1964.15,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,38.091,41.122,Mr. Ordman.
1964.15,0,16666,arnold_ordman,,41.122,42.02,May it please the Court.
1964.15,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,419.593,429.771,"For having said that Mr. Ordman, do I understand that this case is submitted to us on the premise that nevertheless the employer had good faith -- believed that that was (Voice Overlap)"
1964.15,0,16666,arnold_ordman,,429.771,431.018,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1964.15,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,445.301,449.221,But what did the Board find -- what did the Board find?
1964.15,0,16666,arnold_ordman,,449.221,451.851,The Board made its final attempt --
1964.15,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,451.851,455.374,I thought it rested its holding on the lack of bad faith -- (Voice Overlap) faith.
1964.15,0,16666,arnold_ordman,,455.374,459.813,The Board made -- the Board made two findings in this case.
1964.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,487.618,489.757,"Well, I'm a little confused Mr. Ordman."
1964.15,0,16666,arnold_ordman,,498.853,500.361,We are -- we are not.
1964.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,508.786,509.937,"Well, I understand but --"
1964.15,0,16666,arnold_ordman,,509.937,510.085,And I --
1964.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,510.085,511.184,Am I wrong about this?
1964.15,0,16666,arnold_ordman,,527.538,557.789,"We think it does but we concluded in framing our petition for certiorari and respondent correcting points about it, maybe this was the kind of fact issue on which we did not want a petition for certiorari and the question representing the petition for certiorari is the second ground upon which the Board decided this case namely, assuming and we do assume in this case a good faith belief on the part of the employer that these people had engaged in misconduct."
1964.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,574.542,588.011,You may want in maybe a matter of interest to the Board and generally to the profession will someday decide that question but are you in position to abandon that? I -- I thought -- I thought it has --
1964.15,0,16666,arnold_ordman,,588.011,588.92,I think --
1964.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,588.92,607.268,-- revision put limitations on what the Court of Appeals might do in setting aside the Board's factual conclusion and that our responsibility here was to see that the Courts of Appeals adhered to the congressional standing.
1964.15,0,16666,arnold_ordman,,607.268,613.307,"I think the court described -- I think that Mr. Justice Brennan, if I'm correct on that and I think the Court would be free to do so."
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1497.058,1510.986,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I think there is a real good reason, Mr. Justice Brennan why the Board in this case didn't seek review of anything except the good faith fact."
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.997,1671.249,"Well, the Trial Examiner found there was a good faith."
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1671.249,1672.721,He didn't have to reach that Mr. Justice White.
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1718.453,1726.57,"The Board itself found both things if there was -- a) there was not good faith, a good faith belief and even if -- even if there was -- there is still a violation."
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1726.57,1727.199,Yes sir.
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1727.199,1728.492,Both things they have to do.
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1728.492,1728.927,Yes sir.
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1728.927,1730.952,And the Court of Appeals rejected both?
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1730.952,1752.625,"Well I think, initially, the Board found that the threats have not been made and that therefore the Rubin Brothers, Board case were not applicable and therefore it found a violation one as to the layoff of three man and then two, as to the subsequent discharge while on layoff of the two men."
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1752.625,1761.967,"Yes, but they also held that even if there was, did they also hold that even if there was a good faith belief --"
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1761.967,1773.978,They held that if there was a good faith belief that it would not avail the employer because it affirmatively was proven by General Counsel that the good faith belief was mistaken.
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1773.978,1778.089,But they all -- but they did find it on the facts that there was not a good faith.
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1778.089,1781.429,"Yes sir, yes sir, contrary to the (Voice Overlap)."
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1781.429,1786.256,The Court of Appeals -- do you think that the Court of Appeals rejected both of their claims?
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1786.256,1786.839,No sir.
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1820.211,1828.753,"Yes, but the Board did also found -- the Board did found that there was not a good faith belief on the part of the employer, that this was a pretext."
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1828.753,1831.167,"The court disagreed with this, the lower court."
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1831.167,1832.469,And the Court of Appeals disagreed with that point too.
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1832.469,1833.343,Yes.
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1834.954,1837.477,It had to -- I guess it gets the other one.
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1837.477,1842.939,"Well, I think the answer is that there was no evidence whatsoever of the lack of good faith belief."
1964.15,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1914.02,1915.059,I want to ask you a question.
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1916.784,1918.162,Right.
1964.15,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1918.162,1920.465,(Inaudible)
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1920.465,1923.462,"I won't belabor it, Mr. Justice Goldberg."
1964.15,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1930.67,1932.801,But that is to argue quite candidly.
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1932.801,1933.049,Right.
1964.15,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1933.049,1941.427,"That they're arresting and in fact assuming your good faith, the Board still had the right under the statute to --"
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1941.427,1942.108,Well --
1964.15,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1942.108,1949.731,I'd be interested to know why Pate was there but was not called to substantiate the good faith.
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1949.731,1971.483,"Well, the lawyer that tried the case, Mr. Chief Justice tried it on the theory of Rubins Brothers -- Rubin Brothers which is that a good faith belief is a defense and I think he felt it was unnecessary to call Pate -- to make out our defense and while the General Counsel didn't call him in, I don't know."
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1971.483,1989.689,"What you're saying Mr. Phillips is Rubin Brothers as you applied it or as -- and as you think the examiner applied it holds that even if Pate was not telling the truth about the threat, if you were -- honestly believe he did, that's a sufficient offense."
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1989.689,1995.365,"Well, Mr. Justice Brennan, this -- the court really -- when I speak of Rubin Brothers here, I'm speaking of the Fifth Circuit decision."
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1995.365,1996.11,Yes.
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,1996.11,2000.075,"Now, the Board called Rubin Brothers as the same which the Circuit would not enforce --"
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2000.075,2001.042,"Well, whosever decision is, --"
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,2001.042,2001.41,Right.
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2001.41,2002.289,-- is that the approach?
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,2002.289,2003.651,"Yes sir, that's the Circuit."
1964.15,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2709.154,2711.721,We're going to assume that this is a threat.
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,2711.721,2718.255,"Well again, Mr. Justice Goldberg, it doesn't make any difference."
1964.15,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2827.874,2837.024,"Mr. Phillips, what's the facts that effect of that -- what the Board has done here to order them not to repeat a violation."
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,2838.21,2839.304,Yes sir.
1964.15,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2839.304,2841.416,The other is to make them hold?
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,2841.416,2843.074,Yes sir.
1964.15,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2843.074,2854.086,"And as I understand it, it boils down to this controversy that the company had a right that this could be upset."
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,2884.619,2890.053,I don't think it would have if there had been contract for a year Mr. Justice Black but there was not a contract for a year.
1964.15,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2890.053,2890.788,There was what?
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,2890.788,2893.023,There was not a contract for a year.
1964.15,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2893.023,2906.037,"No, there was not but they were discharged without -- on the grounds according to this, according to your statement that was wrong if they hadn't done anything and they've lost their jobs."
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,2906.037,2908.897,This is what -- this is what this piece gets down to of course.
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2929.261,2937.14,Except that you also have the finding that indeed he was -- they were discharged for union activities.
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,2937.14,2937.738,Well --
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2937.738,2953.422,"-- and the -- and -- and as I gather, the issue really is whether you may escape the ordinary consequence of a discharge for union activity namely, reinstatement, why the fact that you had a good faith belief said indeed they've certainly violated --"
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,2953.422,2967.372,"Mr. Justice Brennan, there's nothing in the opinion of the court below which indicates that we -- we violated Section 8 (a) (3) and indeed this is -- this is the part of the problem."
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2970.113,2970.992,"Well, I'm getting back --"
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,2970.992,2971.643,Right.
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2971.643,2974.387,-- the Board's view is that there was a finding of an unfair labor practice --
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,2974.387,2975.128,Yes sir.
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2975.128,2988.736,"-- ordinarily to be redressed by an order of reinstatement unless in this case, the fact that you had a good faith belief that they threatened to dynamite the plant absolved you from the ordinary order of that issue, got it?"
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,2988.736,2996.528,"Yes, but I think -- I recognize that this Court can do most anything that it wishes with a case such as this, but with --"
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2996.528,2999.516,"No, I -- I had to disagree with that."
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,2999.516,2999.899,No I'm talking first --
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2999.899,3006.595,I think our powers of review as I tried to suggest to Mr. Ordman are quite limited on this kind of situation.
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,3006.595,3010.656,"Well, I think the Board could have petitioned this Court to review the whole case below."
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3010.656,3011.093,Yes.
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,3011.093,3026.843,"But it did not and under your established practice, as I understand it, your review is going to be limited to the question raised by the petition for certiorari and the Board specifically on page 6 of the petition for that certiorari, I think had no -- I mean Footnote 6, we waived, we're not questioning the right."
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3026.843,3028.725,This is to an 8 (a) (1) file?
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,3028.725,3038.19,"No sir, this reduces it to the question again of, is a good faith but mistaken belief sufficient to justify the discharge?"
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3040.194,3042.809,Let's assume there isn't -- it isn't.
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,3045.35,3046.103,Alright sir.
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3046.103,3053.274,"-- enough to insulate the employer from what, an 8 (a) (1) violation or an 8 (a) (3)?"
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,3053.274,3057.933,Well I -- I think -- I think this is -- this is probably a question that the Court must decide.
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3057.933,3066.989,"Doesn't the -- doesn't the -- doesn't the Board -- isn't the Board really saying that since we've given up the good faith argument, that the only thing that can be left is an 8 (a) (1)?"
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,3066.989,3067.998,"Oh, no sir."
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3076.117,3082.487,"But no, I realize the court below because there they were arguing their good -- their bad faith thing too."
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,3093.147,3094.16,Right.
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3094.16,3098.536,"Now, does that mean that they are abandoning the argument about that -- that that it was an 8 (a) (3)?"
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,3098.536,3104.683,"As I understand the argument from the brief and from what General Counsel stated, they still argue on both grounds."
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3112.15,3126.58,Because a critical fact in -- in finding the violation even though there's good faith is that the active place when the employee was engaged in protected activity.
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,3126.58,3135.8,I'm not sure that I followed you but the problem from -- the problem with the Board's case on an 8 (a) (3) is that they've got to prove motivation which they haven't proven.
1964.15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3150.292,3156.118,"Well, does the Board usually grant the reinstatement of back pays for an 8 (a) (1) when there's no 8 (a) (3)?"
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,3156.118,3157.788,Yes sir.
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3219.95,3228.708,"You're not suggesting, are you, that the Board's position is that without a finding of an 8 (a) (1) or an 8 (a) (3), it has to be one of them?"
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,3228.708,3229.929,Yes sir.
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3229.929,3241.787,Are you suggesting the Board's position is that they may nevertheless order reinstatement merely because they find that the -- there was a mistaken although good faith beliefs that these fellows have threatened to dynamite?
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,3241.787,3242.885,That's my understanding of the Board's position.
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3242.885,3243.42,Really?
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,3243.42,3244.105,Yes sir.
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3244.105,3246.728,"Well, I didn't get that from Mr. Ordman but we're going to hear from him again."
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,3264.953,3269.077,"Well, as I understand the Board's position, it's reinstatement either way with back pay."
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3269.077,3272.078,But predicated upon an 8 (a) (1) or 8 (a) (3) findings?
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,3272.078,3272.462,Yes sir.
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3272.912,3273.56,It has to be one or the other.
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,3273.56,3274.087,"Well, yes sir."
1964.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3274.087,3274.705,"Oh, yes."
1964.15,1,22985,erle_phillips,,3274.705,3277.046,There must be finding.
1964.15,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3303.99,3306.3,Very well.
1964.15,2,16666,arnold_ordman,,3306.3,3307.899,I will just take one moment.
1964.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3307.899,3309.31,Mr. Ordman.
1964.15,2,16666,arnold_ordman,,3309.31,3313.98,"I'll just take one moment, if the Court please to clarify exactly what the Board's position here is."
1964.15,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3354.335,3355.617,And you have to find that before --
1964.15,2,16666,arnold_ordman,,3355.617,3384.426,"And we found -- the Board found that to be a violation, I beg your pardon, of 8 (a) (1) and also of 8 (a) (3) and for the lack of specific proof of anti-union motivation, we submit that that defect, if it is a defect, it's the same sort of defect which the Board didn't, or which the Court, the Supreme Court found no handicap either on Radio Officers or in Erie Resistor or in Republic."
1964.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3386.074,3391.647,We'll recess now.
