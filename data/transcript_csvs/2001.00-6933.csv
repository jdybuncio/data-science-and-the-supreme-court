2001.00-6933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,20.05,"We'll hear argument next in No. 00-6933, Remon Lee v. Mike Kemna."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,34.899,56.363,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Remon Lee is serving a life sentence without possibility of parole for first degree murder without ever having had a chance to present testimony from witnesses who could have established his innocence."
2001.00-6933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,102.945,105.259,"You're... you're just summarizing now, I take it."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,106.742,107.374,--Yes.
2001.00-6933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,107.374,108.305,--the rules are arbitrary.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,108.305,108.416,Correct.
2001.00-6933,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,116.913,127.094,"Well, at least as far as 24.10's elements are concerned, presumably those could have been addressed by counsel."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,142.283,143.176,That's--
2001.00-6933,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,143.176,144.198,--in making the decision.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,144.198,151.272,"--That's correct, and every piece of information required by those rules were before the trial court."
2001.00-6933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,152.034,157.976,"When you say before the trial court, you mean in the presentation made at that time orally by counsel?"
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,160.321,162.074,--No.
2001.00-6933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,163.126,165.25,Where... where else are you saying it came from?
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,165.25,168.869,--The opening statement by defense counsel.
2001.00-6933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,168.869,177.595,"So, the trial judge is supposed to remember the opening statement by... by defense counsel when he passes on a motion for a continuance that's made at the end of the trial?"
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,177.595,179.388,Let me clarify a few things.
2001.00-6933,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,187.515,191.684,How about... I didn't find anything about that at all.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,209.13,225.372,--The discussion with the trial court was... bear in mind the discussion with the trial court occurred in an emergency situation where witnesses are suddenly gone and the... and counsel is now before the trial court explaining what had happened.
2001.00-6933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,232.676,236.274,You... you say that the trial judge knew it too?
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,236.274,241.595,"--Yes, and the trial court... even in the colloquy, you can see that the trial court knew who the witnesses were."
2001.00-6933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,242.415,243.739,And what their purpose was?
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,247.295,258.357,"--At one point during the discussion... the only question that the trial court had for counsel was were these witnesses under subpoena, and counsel answered that question yes, twice."
2001.00-6933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,258.357,260.552,The counsel has to make a showing of his own.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,262.546,278.499,"When the... when counsel pulled out the subpoenas and starting reading from the subpoena and he read, Gladys Edwards is supposed to come on the last day of trial at 9 o'clock, the trial court responded, is she the mother, showing that the trial court understood who the witnesses were."
2001.00-6933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,280.041,282.276,But what... what the purpose was.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,282.276,291.906,--There was only one issue in the case and that was whether the defendant was correctly identified by the eye witnesses or was he somewhere else.
2001.00-6933,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,299.741,301.505,Was that explained in the opening statement?
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,304.611,305.553,--Yes.
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,353.871,356.135,This... this goes to the importance of those witnesses.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,378.009,379.091,July through October.
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,380.675,382.378,Nobody else saw him there that he could have brought in?
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,384.662,386.435,--I... I can't answer that.
2001.00-6933,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,387.768,391.427,"Well, let me tell you... let me tell you, counsel, what... what concerns me about your case."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,456.758,458.01,Correct.
2001.00-6933,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,458.01,462.178,"Well, there was nothing new shown by counsel at that point."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,480.557,481.248,Okay.
2001.00-6933,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,509.775,521.287,"Well, but you're... you're saying that Missouri, as a matter of due process, did not afford adequate opportunity for this attorney to explain the disappearance of his witnesses."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,531.598,531.78,I have--
2001.00-6933,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,531.78,536.047,"--2 weeks later he had... he had all the opportunity in the world to explain this, I think."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,545.558,547.24,--I... I disagree.
2001.00-6933,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,559.254,569.605,"But Missouri gave to the attorney the opportunity to revisit the entire matter at the post-conviction motion for a new trial, and nothing further was adduced."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,569.605,591.059,"--The motion for a new trial restated his grounds for granting a new trial, the fact that the witnesses had come in... and it did... it did explain that they... these were the alibi witnesses from California... so that was clear in the motion for a new trial... and the fact that the trial court had denied that motion without giving him a short recess or without enforcing the subpoenas."
2001.00-6933,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,615.208,617.252,"These were sequestered witnesses, as I remember it."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,625.718,627.892,That was not stated in the motion for a new trial.
2001.00-6933,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.892,628.723,It wasn't until later.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,628.723,633.643,It was in the rule 29.15 State post-conviction motion that that issue first came up.
2001.00-6933,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,658.715,664.266,"Well, there's where I disagree with you because 2 weeks later, he didn't show anything more other than they were alibi witnesses."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,670.257,682.251,"--The reason why they left doesn't change the fact that the moment that the trial court ruled on the motion for a continuance, he didn't know where they were, counsel didn't know where they were, the prosecutor didn't know where they were."
2001.00-6933,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,688.014,694.677,"Well, but what I'm saying is we don't need to have at that time because we have the benefit of hindsight 2 weeks later, and you had nothing new."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,694.677,701.331,"--There's nothing new in the motion for a new trial, but no new facts need to be adduced in the motion for a new trial."
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,753.315,761.932,"Do... do we know that if he had been given the couple of hours' continuance, which is what he asked for, you would have located the witnesses?"
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,773.014,778.235,"Well, the affidavits of the witnesses don't state where they went when they left."
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.913,803.717,Where did they go?
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,821.904,823.155,The--
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,823.155,827.454,"Why do you say that, you know, if he had only gotten these couple of hours, everything would have been okay?"
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,827.454,834.879,--The record doesn't establish for sure where it is that they went at the time they left or for a fact that they could have been brought in.
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,850.631,852.164,I think... I think that's your burden.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,865.571,876.903,"There is nothing in the record that contradicts the representations made by counsel and the defendant to the State trial court that they were staying at a relative's house and that they were still in town, and the State has never offered--"
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,876.903,879.63,There's nothing in those facts that suggests you could find them in 2 hours.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,879.63,884.971,"--Well, counsel's actual request for a continuance was... was until the following morning."
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,891.042,892.425,I'm quoting... I'm quoting from your brief.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,898.137,900.121,"--Correct, and then it's... and then--"
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.121,903.106,"Lee told the court that he knew the witnesses were still in town, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,903.106,906.583,--But then... but ultimately counsel asked for an overnight continuance.
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.19,924.308,"So, you... counsel did ask for a continuance until the following morning."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,924.308,924.839,Correct.
2001.00-6933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,944.61,956.342,"But it's... it's odd in a way, and perhaps this doesn't... that, you know, you would have to get a capias and arrest your... your father-in-law and your mother and your sister."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,956.342,962.655,"--You know, I think that is a backup suggestion by counsel to cover all bases."
2001.00-6933,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1013.829,1019.449,"Counsel, please... please don't ask us to write an opinion where we tell judges it's wrong to tell counsel to hurry along."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1019.449,1020.08,--No.
2001.00-6933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1074.191,1080.604,"Well, the rules for reviewing that sort of thing in this Court have changed a good deal from the time of Osborne against Ohio I think."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1080.604,1087.077,"--Well, the basic principles regarding when a State law ground is adequate haven't changed much."
2001.00-6933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1130.704,1136.886,But the Missouri Court of Appeals upheld the denial on the basis that it hadn't conformed to rules what?
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1137.819,1138.92,Correct.
2001.00-6933,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1155.775,1159.883,"Well, I... I think it's fair to say... or maybe it isn't."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1179.371,1191.296,The only thing that could possibly be missing in the showing that was made during the exchange on the continuance was a failure to repeat the full opening statement regarding what the witnesses would have testified to.
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.296,1191.727,No.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1212.338,1214.483,What rule 24--
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1214.483,1215.285,One of the reasons.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1215.285,1218.12,--rule 24.10(b) requires the name and address--
2001.00-6933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1218.12,1219.474,Where are you reading from?
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1219.474,1224.243,--I'm reading from page 3a of the... the appendix to the opening brief.
2001.00-6933,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1258.622,1259.352,And they had come voluntarily.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1259.352,1260.055,And--
2001.00-6933,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1260.055,1262.358,They had not come by subpoena.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1265.686,1266.348,--That's correct.
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1269.814,1275.305,They also skipped voluntarily just before they were supposed to be put on the stand under oath.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1275.305,1275.756,But we don't--
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1275.756,1283.753,Doesn't one factor that into account as to whether these witnesses who suddenly vanish into thin air are likely to be found?
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1283.753,1294.324,"--No, because there was no factual basis at that moment before the State trial court judge to have any idea whether it was a medical emergency, a misunderstanding, they had gone to lunch and hadn't come back on time."
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1301.508,1302.83,They were there under subpoena.
2001.00-6933,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1322.63,1327.992,But you also have to factor in the fact they were sequestered witnesses not in contact with any of these people you're discussing.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1327.992,1328.322,Correct.
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1340.447,1355.567,"Did their sequestering prevent their leaving a message with the... with the clerk of the court or a marshal or someone saying, tell my son we're going because we had a medical emergency or, you know... or because, as the... as the later story comes out, some marshal told us to leave?"
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1355.567,1357.761,"Well, if you credit the later story--"
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1357.761,1365.838,"I find that so implausible that they should just walk out, not leave any word for... for their son for whom they were about to testify."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1375.517,1379.185,--You have witnesses who apparently are unsophisticated.
2001.00-6933,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1386.159,1390.918,"Wasn't there a thing too that he's a minister, the father, and he was scheduled to give a sermon that night?"
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1390.918,1391.8,--Correct.
2001.00-6933,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1404.215,1406.5,"The defendant was in custody, was he not, during--"
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1406.5,1407.131,Correct?
2001.00-6933,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1407.131,1409.205,"--So, they didn't have actual contact with him."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1411.639,1413.513,"Correct, correct."
2001.00-6933,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1413.513,1414.015,There is a--
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1414.015,1416.38,"--But they could have told somebody to tell him, couldn't they?"
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1433.924,1450.808,"It actually makes the trial court's decision that much more arbitrary because at the moment that the trial court is faced with this question, you have witnesses who traveled voluntary from California, who are under subpoena, who actually appeared in the courthouse, were sitting in a witness room, and had suddenly disappeared, and no one knew why."
2001.00-6933,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1450.808,1462.713,--Why did it take 17 months to bring out the... the information that a court official told these people their testimony wouldn't be needed?
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1466.691,1474.616,"Well, with respect to your question regarding the delay, I think that's just a function of how the Missouri post-conviction process unfolded."
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1485.117,1497.813,"Did he get in touch with these people before... before 2 weeks... I mean, before the motion for reconsideration of... of the denial of... of continuance came up?"
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1497.813,1501.209,I don't know whether he got in touch with them or not.
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1501.209,1502.432,"Well, that's extraordinary."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1512.922,1512.964,The record--
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1512.964,1514.416,But he doesn't mention that--
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1514.416,1514.947,--The record--
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1514.947,1515.468,--2 weeks later.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1515.468,1516.67,--The record is silent on that.
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1518.074,1518.414,I know it is.
2001.00-6933,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1518.414,1523.354,Was the motion for a new trial filed by the same lawyer who represented him during the trial?
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1523.354,1528.003,"Yes, it was and in fact, he was relieved during the sentencing hearing that took place."
2001.00-6933,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1528.003,1528.185,I know.
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1533.605,1534.065,Correct.
2001.00-6933,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1534.065,1538.094,"And once he had gotten fee for what had been done, he sort of lost interest in the case."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1538.094,1540.218,That is an impression that the record gives.
2001.00-6933,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1540.218,1546.401,"So, you... you can't say that he... he got in touch with these witnesses who would have been so easy to find within a day."
2001.00-6933,0,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,1550.839,1551.4,I don't know.
2001.00-6933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1655.56,1657.684,"Very well, Ms. Vergeer."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,1660.73,1691.883,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Kennedy... Kennedy, you are quite right to be disturbed by counsel's failure to provide the court any more information or better showing under... under rule 24.10 in the motion for a new trial that was filed 2 weeks after the events that the Court has been discussing than he did."
2001.00-6933,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1711.101,1713.225,Why... why do you think that might have been?
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,1728.114,1737.975,"First of all, for... for counsel to have represented the facts that 24.10 requires, counsel would have had to believe that they were true."
2001.00-6933,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1740.861,1743.315,"He didn't say all that in the opening statement, did he?"
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,1743.315,1743.988,--Excuse me?
2001.00-6933,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1744.648,1747.784,"I mean, I wonder why is there no ineffective counsel claim."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,1762.525,1767.454,--The habeas court addressed the question of whether there was such--
2001.00-6933,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1767.454,1768.497,Why didn't they say what I just said?
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,1768.497,1770.801,--And because they... they said that claim was never raised to--
2001.00-6933,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1770.801,1772.956,"Now... now, that's exactly right."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,1782.596,1792.094,"--First, how trial counsel conducts trial motions and post-trial motions is an area in which he... there is a broad discretion for the trial counsel."
2001.00-6933,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1792.094,1813.296,"Of course, and what I'm really driving at is, isn't the reason that they didn't raise rule 9 and rule 10 as showing ineffective assistance at that post-trial business is because nobody dreamt that the courts in that State of Missouri would apply rule 9 and rule 10?"
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,1828.357,1830.732,"Justice Breyer, that's correct."
2001.00-6933,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1830.732,1831.765,That's not--
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,1831.765,1833.066,That is not correct.
2001.00-6933,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1853.779,1854.25,"--Well, at least--"
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,1854.25,1854.349,And second--
2001.00-6933,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1854.349,1865.473,"--we know that the... the trial judge did not deny the continuance on the basis of a failure to comply with those rules, did he?"
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,1865.473,1867.977,--He didn't say because I find that--
2001.00-6933,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1867.977,1873.849,"There's nothing in the record to indicate that the trial judge said, well, I can't grant that."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,1879.1,1880.854,"--No, Your Honor."
2001.00-6933,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1881.424,1890.933,The trial judge denied it because he wanted to go to the hospital with his daughter on one day and he had another trial in another case starting the day after.
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,1890.933,1891.935,I don't believe that's correct.
2001.00-6933,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1891.935,1892.516,Isn't that right?
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,1892.516,1894.932,"I don't believe that's correct, Justice O'Connor."
2001.00-6933,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1900.302,1901.313,What... what does it indicate?
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,1906.083,1918.328,"I... I think the record clearly shows that the reason he denied the continuance is because, as Justice Scalia suggested, he determined, on the circumstances that had been presented to him, that these witnesses abandoned the defense."
2001.00-6933,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1918.328,1922.567,--Then why did he get into his daughter's hospitalization and his Monday schedule?
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,1922.567,1935.633,"The... the continuance that was requested was till the following morning, and it was in that context... and... and it is a single sentence utterance there, that... that he noted that he was not going to be in the courthouse--"
2001.00-6933,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1935.633,1946.184,"Well, why if he... if he was denying the motion on the ground that there had not been the specifications that rule 10 required, why get into his daughter's medical condition?"
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,1946.184,1957.096,"--The trial judge could have been responding to the idea that even though you've not made a sufficient showing, I'm not going to cut a break for this because--"
2001.00-6933,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1957.096,1961.445,"Yes, I assume... I assume there are a number of factors that go into the judge's decision."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,1980.172,1984.2,"--He found that an insufficient showing had been made, and there are other factors that he would have been considering."
2001.00-6933,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1993.75,1996.956,"The witnesses were there, we're told."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2016.546,2026.276,"--Except that the circumstances that were presented to the trial court, Justice O'Connor, I believe supported his conclusion that they had left--"
2001.00-6933,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2026.276,2027.348,May I just interrupt?
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2036.736,2043.861,--There was a court employee in contact with them and also trial counsel was in contact with them and the defendant.
2001.00-6933,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2043.861,2044.101,No.
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2045.465,2049.924,But trial counsel went and checked on them at 10 o'clock when the State rested its case.
2001.00-6933,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2072.197,2074.683,"Well, they might have gone down to get an apple out of the vending machine."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2088.13,2101.678,"But if these are the witnesses that stand between this young man and life in prison without parole, it is absolutely to be presumed that trial counsel did what trial counsel would do in that circumstance and say, you are under subpoena."
2001.00-6933,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2110.415,2125.065,"Why would he have any reason to think that witnesses who had come on their... by their own expense all the way from California and who were in the courtroom that very morning... they were there at 8: 30, as I understand, and at 10 o'clock they're still there."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2129.464,2145.756,"--Justice Ginsburg, he may not have believed that they would leave or... or suspected they might leave, but these are the sorts of instructions that trial counsel give their witnesses whether or not they think that that might happen because the circumstances can be very dire if they do leave."
2001.00-6933,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2145.756,2156.838,"Well, if... if we're... if we're going to make an argument based on what trial counsel could be expected to do, why isn't it equally fair to make an argument about what trial judges could be expected to do?"
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2197.951,2208.082,"First, the judge did ask, following the discussion about what had happened, whether counsel intended to file a motion for a continuance."
2001.00-6933,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.363,2242.581,Even... even where it wasn't... the denial wasn't based on that basis.
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2256.019,2273.864,I don't know any of the dozens of Missouri cases that are cited in the briefs that applied the rule that a failure to comply with those rules will foreclose appellate review where they cited that the trial judge had made a specific finding 24.09 has been or 24.10 has been violated.
2001.00-6933,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2279.866,2280.418,The question was--
2001.00-6933,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2280.418,2283.383,"--on that... I... I mean, they have a lot of cases."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2293.502,2294.203,--Justice Breyer--
2001.00-6933,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2294.203,2297.932,"So... so, if that... maybe you can suggest one, but I'll go back and read it."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2357.982,2368.644,"--The standard that you gave me, Justice Breyer, I don't believe differs materially from the standard in Ford v. Georgia which is firmly established and regularly applied."
2001.00-6933,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2403.634,2417.613,"The reason the... the three aspects of it that suggest maybe this lawyer did not have fair notice that the rule would apply in the circumstances are, first, the lawyer was surprised by his loss of witnesses."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2470.3,2474.266,"Surprise, Justice Breyer, was not present."
2001.00-6933,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2509.338,2516.301,"Could you just tell me on that, what could he have told the judge that he knew that he didn't tell the judge?"
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2516.301,2527.403,--He did not tell the judge that these witnesses could be located in a reasonable amount of time and that they would give the testimony that it has been suggested they would give.
2001.00-6933,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2527.403,2530.329,"Well, he... the judge knew what testimony they were going to give."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2532.113,2533.506,"I... I do question that, Justice Stevens."
2001.00-6933,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2533.506,2536.331,--Didn't... didn't the lawyer announce it in his opening statement to the jury?
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2539.9,2549.036,The... the... a lawyer's statements and opening statement are not evidence and they're not evidentiary.
2001.00-6933,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2549.036,2550.691,But the judge heard the statement.
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2550.691,2552.855,"He did hear the statement, but what's--"
2001.00-6933,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2552.855,2556.0,"He knew what the witnesses were intended to testify to, didn't he?"
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2556.0,2558.276,"--But 24.10 requires more than that, Justice Stevens."
2001.00-6933,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2558.276,2560.261,"Well, he did know that much, don't you agree?"
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2560.261,2567.664,"I do, but... but it requires someone to attach their credibility to the proposition that they will actually give that testimony."
2001.00-6933,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2567.664,2579.428,"And, of course, I suppose the lawyer knew what the family would testify to before they heard the strengths of the prosecution's case, which was that there were four witnesses that put him in... in the city."
2001.00-6933,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2579.428,2590.861,I don't suppose a lot of judges concentrate intently on opening statements the way they do perhaps motions that they have to decide or something like that.
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2601.563,2611.954,"Your Honor, that might be true as a general proposition, but we don't need to rely on a general proposition in this case because this judge told these lawyers in this lawsuit the following."
2001.00-6933,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2617.285,2620.973,Are you going to tell me right now... we both read this record.
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2631.062,2642.836,"--The judge knew that he did not have anybody in that courtroom who was willing to stand up and say on my credibility, that's what these witnesses--"
2001.00-6933,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2642.836,2646.504,He did not know that he had the lawyer's assurance of that.
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2646.504,2647.385,--Or any other--
2001.00-6933,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2647.385,2650.812,Because in fact he did not have the lawyer's assurance.
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2650.812,2651.433,--That's correct.
2001.00-6933,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2651.433,2651.994,But he did--
2001.00-6933,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2651.994,2654.148,--Actually I asked the question that I'd like an answer to.
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2674.66,2681.574,I believe that the... that the judge knew what had been said... what had been attributed to them in the opening statement.
2001.00-6933,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2685.983,2702.487,"That's a different... well, if you're... you're willing to say, which I think is fair and I think correct, that on the basis of this record, the judge knew that the point of these witnesses was to testify that the defendant was in California at the time."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2702.487,2702.867,--At the most--
2001.00-6933,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2702.867,2704.741,The answer to my question is yes.
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2705.182,2705.442,--Yes.
2001.00-6933,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2710.152,2712.096,"Well, he knew something more than that, didn't he?"
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2726.474,2728.027,"--No, I don't believe that that's correct."
2001.00-6933,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2748.82,2757.186,"What... I presume what he stated was not if things go as well for me as possible, these people will say as follows."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2774.22,2775.513,--That is what he told the jury.
2001.00-6933,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2775.513,2778.448,--because we have the transcript that shows exactly that.
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2787.456,2788.329,Yes.
2001.00-6933,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2788.329,2790.543,"He didn't say, the best thing that you might infer from what they testify."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2790.543,2798.589,But counsel's statements to the jury in opening statement are not held to the level of a representation of an officer of the court to the judge--
2001.00-6933,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2798.589,2807.869,But the judge was fully apprised that the defendant was expecting to put on witnesses and that hey were alibi witnesses.
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2809.752,2813.669,--The judge knew facts... knew those facts from the opening statement only.
2001.00-6933,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2824.732,2831.385,Is it your experience that witnesses ever have second thoughts about giving their story after they've heard the strength of the prosecution's case?
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2831.385,2835.654,"That... Your Honor, I believe that that does happen."
2001.00-6933,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2846.606,2850.915,But were these witnesses in the courtroom to hear that testimony?
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2852.778,2854.282,--They had been sequestered.
2001.00-6933,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2854.692,2856.005,So how would they know?
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2861.165,2867.518,"I don't know that they did know, but I know that they visited frequently with the defendant and with defendant's counsel."
2001.00-6933,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2871.326,2876.106,"They did later file affidavits substantiating what the... was said in the opening statement, didn't they?"
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2876.106,2877.167,--Excuse me?
2001.00-6933,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2877.167,2883.16,They did later file affidavits consistent with what the counsel had said in his opening statement.
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2883.16,2886.345,"Yes, 4 years later they did, 4 years--"
2001.00-6933,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2886.345,2898.51,What about the third part which is... I... I take it as well that you would agree that the judge heard that this... the missing witness is a minister who's there for a religious event that's taking place that evening.
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2937.359,2954.874,"--Missouri v. Cuckovich and other cases cited in the... in the dissent in the Eighth Circuit where he quite candidly categorizes and admits that Missouri rules of 24.09 and 24.10 applied prior to trial, at the outset of trial, and during trial."
2001.00-6933,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2957.178,2961.357,"Well, you don't want us to decide this case on the fact that he didn't make an affidavit, do you?"
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2967.4,2968.682,"--Your Honor, I am not--"
2001.00-6933,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2968.682,2971.787,--24.10 I would... I would think.
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,2971.787,2981.237,"--I'm not going to stand on the formality, and we didn't stand in the court of appeals on a formality of a writing or even the formality of an affidavit."
2001.00-6933,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3005.566,3024.745,"So, if I read through the transcript and I came to the conclusion that everyone in that courtroom in that very short trial, in the circumstances given what was said, would have very clear that this lawyer does mean to tell the judge, one, these are my own witnesses that make a difference."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,3061.298,3074.114,"In effect, what the lawyer was telling the judge by reference, implied or otherwise, to the entire body of trial is not what 24.09 or 24.10 require."
2001.00-6933,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3094.015,3101.389,"Mr. Wilson, at the time of the new trial motion, the transcript was available to the judge of the proceedings?"
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,3101.389,3103.653,"I don't know, Justice Ginsburg."
2001.00-6933,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3109.616,3122.471,My concern with your position is you suggest twice in your brief that counsel ought to have scribbled out this 24.09 notice.
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,3154.526,3169.335,"Justice Ginsburg, that argument in the brief is... is not made to show what a reasonable lawyer would do or what every lawyer could do, but rather to show that it was neither impossible nor impractical... impracticable to comply with the rule."
2001.00-6933,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3169.335,3171.351,"Well, I... I... 29.09."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,3198.606,3204.698,"It may be surprising that... that the court of appeals and the Missouri Supreme Court have done that, but they have done it."
2001.00-6933,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3211.821,3230.119,"We don't know... we don't know that... that the idea of you have to scribble something in the court has been around for some time because, as you said, there's no case that presents precisely that situation where the motion is in the... in the heat trial something unexpected happens."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,3238.787,3240.93,"--Well, the... no."
2001.00-6933,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3313.276,3346.964,"Mr. Wilson, I thought you weren't going to rely very much on the... on the not written part, but let's talk about the other part, that all of these... even if all of these factors of substance that had to be in the motion were somewhere in the trial transcript and even if you could say that this trial judge knew it, you couldn't say, could you, that the court of appeals knew it, that the court of appeals could look back to this motion without searching the entire transcript and asking itself, I wonder what, under this transcript, the trial judge knew?"
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,3356.453,3357.324,"Yes, that is clear."
2001.00-6933,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3357.324,3366.062,"The court of appeals would have been constrained to review the entire trial record, which it is one of the purposes of... of.10 to avoid."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,3366.062,3366.705,"Yes, it is."
2001.00-6933,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3368.538,3376.964,"It is not purposeless, even if you assume that the trial judge knew that... that in fact the lawyer was... was making the affidavit that he... that he had to make."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,3376.964,3377.746,--Yes.
2001.00-6933,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3386.584,3396.034,"But, of course, I suppose the court of appeals is entitled to rely upon the trial judge's reasons when it reviews the adequacy of those reasons for granting the motion."
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,3409.11,3416.374,"No, I don't believe so because the... the very purpose of the appellate rule is that they will not do exactly that."
2001.00-6933,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3420.451,3420.822,No.
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,3432.365,3433.678,"No, I don't believe so."
2001.00-6933,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3438.327,3453.558,"Mr. Wilson, in... in answer to Justice Scalia's question about hunting through the whole record, wouldn't counsel, notified about the 24.10 requirement, say, judges, you don't have to read through the whole record?"
2001.00-6933,1,38447,paul_c_wilson,,3473.108,3488.689,"Except that compliance with 24.10 doesn't... doesn't require you to be able to trace it through the record, but rather that you presented it all at once to the trial judge and that you did so with some credible reason to believe that what was being asserted was so."
2001.00-6933,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3535.663,3536.826,"Thank you, Mr. Wilson. Ms. Vergeer, you have 3 minutes remaining."
2001.00-6933,2,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,3536.826,3537.418,Just a few quick points.
2001.00-6933,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3618.933,3626.047,"Ms. Robin-Vergeer, was any due process argument ever raised at the motion for a new trial level?"
2001.00-6933,2,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,3626.047,3637.935,"At the motion for a new trial, the defendant argued the denial of the brief continuance and the denial of the arrest warrant to enforce the subpoenas... argued that that denied the defendant a fair trial."
2001.00-6933,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3645.978,3655.082,"Well, in the post-conviction proceeding, as I recall, what was raised was ineffective assistance of counsel primarily."
2001.00-6933,2,18123,bonnie_i_robin_vergeer,,3655.082,3657.578,"Actually, it... it was both."
2001.00-6933,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3698.539,3700.523,"Thank you, Ms. Vergeer."
