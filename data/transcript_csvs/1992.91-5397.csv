1992.91-5397,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.3,"We'll hear argument now in Number 91-5397, Emery L. Negonsott v. Harold Samuels, Warden."
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,12.308,15.651,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-5397,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,167.582,174.665,What crime covered by the Federal Major Crimes Act most closely parallels the State crime?
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,174.665,183.781,"It would be those crimes found in 18 U.S. Code section 113 (c) and (f), which is basically assault with a dangerous weapon."
1992.91-5397,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,183.781,185.253,(c) and (f).
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,185.253,187.603,(c) and (f).
1992.91-5397,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,187.603,188.194,Thank you.
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,188.194,199.411,"Mr. Negonsott challenged his conviction by filing a writ of habeas corpus in the Federal district court, attacking, of course, the subject matter jurisdiction of the State courts."
1992.91-5397,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,227.848,233.375,Are you saying that it's inconsistent with the language of section 3243?
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,233.375,237.356,"Yes, Your Honor, I'm... Justice Rehnquist."
1992.91-5397,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.356,238.247,I don't see why that is.
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,252.056,264.154,"If you take the language of the proviso, where it says, shall not deprive the courts of the United States, it's our contention that shall not deprive is not language granting concurrent jurisdiction."
1992.91-5397,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,264.154,265.783,Why not?
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,265.783,270.758,Because it's mandatory... shall not deprive the courts of the United States.
1992.91-5397,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,270.758,279.104,"Well, but concurrent jurisdiction, if a court has concurrent jurisdiction, it surely has not been deprived of jurisdiction."
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,279.104,294.915,"It has been deprived of exclusive jurisdiction, and as this Court has held for the... at least the last 100 years, jurisdiction under the Major Crimes Act is exclusive with the Federal district courts."
1992.91-5397,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.915,301.728,"The proviso doesn't say, shall not deprive the courts of the United States of exclusive jurisdiction, it just says of jurisdiction."
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,301.728,314.897,"That's correct, Justice Rehnquist, but again, our contention is that you have to analyze this Kansas statute in conjunction with the Major Crimes Act."
1992.91-5397,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,314.897,322.532,"Anyway, why does the United States not continue to have exclusive jurisdiction?"
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,322.532,325.043,Because the--
1992.91-5397,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,325.043,328.595,"It does continue to have exclusive jurisdiction over Federal crimes, doesn't it?"
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,328.595,329.817,--No.
1992.91-5397,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,334.159,342.176,Is it the Government's position that the State of Kansas can try Federal offenses in Kansas courts?
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,342.176,343.024,No.
1992.91-5397,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.966,344.657,That's right--
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,344.657,345.545,The contention is that--
1992.91-5397,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.545,350.099,--And therefore the United States courts continue to have exclusive jurisdiction over Federal crimes.
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,350.099,364.29,"--But that's not how it's been... our contention is that the Major Crimes Act is... defines Federal offenses, and that therefore that fits right in with the proviso of the Kansas statute."
1992.91-5397,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,378.37,400.282,"Well, I think there's a little confusion that arises from your use in your brief... and maybe there's no other term, but usually when you say concurrent jurisdiction you mean that two courts have jurisdiction over the same cause of action, or over the same criminal offense."
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,437.948,438.739,That's true.
1992.91-5397,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,438.739,440.42,--And that's really what you're talking about.
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,440.42,441.011,Yes.
1992.91-5397,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,613.303,624.57,"Well, is it true, as the other side argues, that if it had done that, the act would in fact have constituted a misstatement about concurrent jurisdiction with respect to minor crimes?"
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,624.57,638.39,"At the time that the act was passed, it was unclear whether or not the Assimilative Crimes Act, the General Crimes Act, applied in Indian country, and that issue was not decided until the decision in Williams v. United States in 1946--"
1992.91-5397,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,638.39,639.689,But it could have been a good reason--
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,639.689,640.3,--By this Court.
1992.91-5397,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,640.3,640.881,--I'm sorry.
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,654.359,663.466,"It could have been a good reason, but on the other hand, Justice Souter, Congress has plenary power to deal with Indian affairs."
1992.91-5397,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,676.285,680.058,"Well, it could, but it clearly did not want to do so with respect to minor crimes."
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,680.058,681.579,That's clear from the history.
1992.91-5397,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,746.631,760.822,"Well, under your view of the meaning of the statute, Ms. Thompson, what jurisdiction is conferred on the Kansas courts by virtue of the first part of 2343--"
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,760.822,761.751,Our contention--
1992.91-5397,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,761.751,762.432,--3243.
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,762.432,763.063,--I'm sorry.
1992.91-5397,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,777.886,791.202,"Then you really read out of that first language the words, to the same extent as its court have jurisdiction over offenses committed elsewhere within the State in accordance with the laws of the State."
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,791.202,810.935,"That's correct, and as we... as I talked about before, the question as to whether the General Crimes Act and the Assimilative Crimes Act apply to Indian country has been... this Court has held that, since Williams v. The United States, that they do in fact apply to Indian country."
1992.91-5397,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,846.978,852.953,Are there Indian tribes in the State of Kansas which have their own tribal courts?
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,852.953,853.864,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-5397,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,853.864,858.739,"And the tribal courts punish minor offenses, I take it."
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,858.739,861.791,The... let me give you one example.
1992.91-5397,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,869.956,875.388,"And that jurisdiction, I take it, would be shared by the State of Kansas under your interpretation."
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,875.388,876.099,Yes.
1992.91-5397,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,876.099,876.861,All right.
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,882.754,884.625,"No, I do not believe that it is."
1992.91-5397,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1026.81,1039.426,"Well, on the other hand, you could look upon it as granting Indian tribes the great benefit of being protected by two criminal laws, Federal law and State law."
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,1063.232,1069.097,"Justice Scalia, we're... I am not looking at this from the point of the Indian criminal."
1992.91-5397,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.753,1077.893,They don't have sovereignty anyway.
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,1086.58,1106.803,"--No, it's going to be the State, but again, we're looking at this from the... because the criminal... the Indian criminal defendant, he's going to be punished one way or the other, whether it's State court or Federal court, but we're looking at this as an intrusion basically on the rights of the tribes to make their own laws and govern themselves."
1992.91-5397,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1106.803,1118.331,"Well, I thought the Indians supported the Major Crimes Act on the assumption the States would have the power."
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,1118.331,1121.122,Do you mean supported this Kansas act?
1992.91-5397,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.122,1122.612,"Yes, the Kansas act."
1992.91-5397,0,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,1122.612,1123.283,The Kansas act.
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,1678.553,1683.439,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1992.91-5397,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1746.487,1750.091,"General Stephan, whereabouts in Kansas is the Kickapoo Reservation?"
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,1750.091,1763.201,"The Kickapoo... all of the reservations are in the northeast part of the State of Kansas, and they're Brown County, Jackson County, in that area of the State."
1992.91-5397,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1763.201,1767.372,"General Stephan, can I ask you one question?"
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,1767.372,1767.953,Yes.
1992.91-5397,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1767.953,1776.4,Both the legislative history and your statement just now indicated the four tribes all supported this legislation.
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,1776.4,1777.479,Yes.
1992.91-5397,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1777.479,1781.943,How does that square with the amicus briefs and the correspondence in the amicus briefs?
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,1787.556,1834.287,"Well, the letter referred to, the Potawatomi Business Council, in those letters the author of the letters also referred to another Potawatomi Business Council, but he didn't agree with that council, so there was obviously a split of some kind in the tribe, but... and they also indicated in the letter that they realized that this would maintain full jurisdiction to the State of Kansas, and seemed to be more concerned about an attempt by Brown and Jackson Counties in Kansas to collect taxes, and they thought this was a guise to collect taxes that evidently they'd received a judgment for in a Federal court, and that Brown and Jackson County were trying to evade those taxes."
1992.91-5397,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1855.181,1862.296,"Even though the records themselves say we, the business community, and so forth and so on, take the other... voted by a majority the other way."
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,1862.296,1868.518,"Well, the business council, but we don't know exactly who this business council is."
1992.91-5397,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1869.81,1873.974,"If we don't know today, how do we know the Secretary knew back when the act was passed?"
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,1875.975,1887.823,"--Well, it's all second-hand, but I guess we've got one tribe and he's talking about all four, so at least it's three to one, and I would give great credence... he was the trustee for the Indian tribes."
1992.91-5397,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1887.823,1890.644,Maybe this is a pretty good argument for not looking at legislative history.
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,1890.644,1894.747,"Well, it could be that, and I will do my best to stay away from it."
1992.91-5397,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2081.799,2089.224,Is the State acting as the agent of the Federal Government when it prosecutes under its own laws?
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,2089.224,2092.695,"--No, the State is not acting as the agent of the Federal Government."
1992.91-5397,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2102.441,2107.897,So I take it there would be no objection under the double jeopardy clause to multiple prosecutions.
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,2107.897,2125.038,That issue has never been met by... I am convinced at this point that certainly the better line of thought is that there would be nothing to prevent a prosecution by both the Federal and the State Government.
1992.91-5397,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2125.038,2133.944,"In order for that result to obtain, is it necessary to say that what the Federal Government has done is to acquiesce in the exercise of State authority?"
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,2134.905,2146.121,"I don't know that there's acquiescence, because the State is not required to maintain the prosecution."
1992.91-5397,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2146.121,2148.555,"Well, there's either acguiescence or delegation."
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,2158.881,2183.177,"Well, double jeopardy has certainly been an issue that has been raised in other circumstances, and there are prosecutions today under both State and Federal law that arise from the same set of facts, and double jeopardy is not a problem in those instances, and the same is true in regard to Indian reservations."
1992.91-5397,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2183.177,2197.206,"That's like in Barkus v. Illinois, but there the State has its own sovereignty that it's exercising, and I'm just asking you if we can't interpret this act as allowing the State to exercise its own sovereignty."
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,2197.206,2204.982,"Well, the State does exercise its sovereignty in accordance with these acts--"
1992.91-5397,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2204.982,2206.452,But that seems somewhat inconsistent with your... excuse me.
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,2206.452,2207.654,--I'm sorry.
1992.91-5397,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2207.654,2214.988,That seems somewhat inconsistent with your saying that the United States has delegated its power to the States.
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,2214.988,2224.303,"If I said that, then I misspoke, because no Federal power was delegated to the State."
1992.91-5397,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2232.391,2235.834,General Stephan--
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,2235.834,2236.542,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-5397,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.542,2260.718,"--I would agree with you that the Major Crimes Act does not imply exclusive Federal jurisdiction but simply describes the jurisdiction whose laws are applied, namely those laws that exist where the United States has exclusive jurisdiction."
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,2300.044,2316.405,"Well, if I understand your question correctly, this Major Crimes Act applies to an Indian perpetrator, whether or not the victim is an Indian or a non-Indian."
1992.91-5397,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2316.405,2328.983,"That's right, but does it not imply that that Indian perpetrator is a perpetrator acting within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, because it uses the word other?"
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,2337.209,2363.435,"The term, exclusive jurisdiction, is an extension of the laws on Federal enclaves, and is not... the exclusive jurisdiction is not maintained from the language of the act itself, but from the fact that in the Major Crimes Act no authority is delegated to the States."
1992.91-5397,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2363.435,2374.204,"Well, you say that, but I find within the act itself the word, other, that certainly suggests to me that the act at least implies exclusivity."
1992.91-5397,1,40408,robert_t_stephan,,2391.835,2414.389,"Well, the Major Crimes Act was originally enacted as a result of the Crow Dog case that said they did not have... that the Federal Government did not have jurisdiction on the reservation in regard to a particular murder case where one Indian murdered another Indian because it was not a Federal enclave."
1992.91-5397,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2631.639,2634.583,"Thank you, General Stephan."
1992.91-5397,2,45217,william_k_kelley,,2636.053,2650.535,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-5397,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2833.624,2846.011,"You say under her view, then, or under the petitioner's view, the Kansas courts would have gotten no additional jurisdiction under the first sentence."
1992.91-5397,2,45217,william_k_kelley,,2846.011,2868.728,"Well, the Kansas courts would have gotten jurisdiction, Mr. Chief Justice, over minor crimes between two Indians, because Federal jurisdiction did not exist over those crimes then, and it does not today, and there's some question whether Kansas would have had jurisdiction over assimilative crimes that are defined by reference to State law rather than general Federal crimes defined by reference to Federal law."
1992.91-5397,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3033.17,3034.751,"Thank you, Mr. Kelley."
1992.91-5397,3,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,3037.081,3047.149,The first point I'd like to make is regarding the argument of double jeopardy.
1992.91-5397,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3146.063,3154.178,"Of course, in your view, it would have been very simple... if I may just interrupt you on the textual point, it would have been very simple in the second sentence simply to add one more word."
1992.91-5397,3,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,3166.547,3187.02,"--No, they did not do that, and again, when they... Congress in 1953 was in the process of passing Public Law 280, they were very specific in granting the States given criminal jurisdiction that the Major Crimes Act and the General Crimes Act and the Assimilative Crimes Act would be modified accordingly."
1992.91-5397,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3187.02,3190.732,"Ms. Thompson, can I make one comment that you might want to comment on."
1992.91-5397,3,38397,pamela_s_thompson,,3197.338,3203.803,Because I believe from that letter it is clear that he is interpreting the legislation.
