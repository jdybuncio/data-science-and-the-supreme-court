2008.08-453,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.57,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-453, Cuomo v. The Clearing House Association."
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,8.57,30.185,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under the OCC regulation at issue here, State antidiscrimination and consumer protection laws can be enforced against national banks by the Federal OCC and by private parties, but not by State attorneys general."
2008.08-453,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,87.788,103.198,"But to some extent, would you concede that interpretation; that is, not only the attorney general under New York's law, but the superintendent of banks as well, has authority over mortgage lending?"
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,113.005,120.759,"Well, first of all, the bank superintendent in New York doesn't have authority over national banks."
2008.08-453,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,140.073,152.297,"But there is -- the provision that you are talking about, 296(a), concerns the authority of the bank superintendent as well as the authority of the attorney general; isn't that so?"
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,152.297,161.07,--I believe that the banking superintendent does not assert authority to enforce in a regulatory fashion against national banks.
2008.08-453,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,174.228,183.749,Just with respect to the same issue on mortgage lending where there's a concern about racial discrimination?
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,183.749,190.755,"--Well, the -- the bank -- the banking superintendent of New York does not enforce against national banks."
2008.08-453,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,190.755,193.072,Anything?
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,195.474,196.493,"Yes, that is right."
2008.08-453,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,196.493,197.843,Even if the New York statute--
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,197.843,201.461,Read differently or interpreted or applied differently.
2008.08-453,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,220.859,221.941,How is it supposed to work?
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,305.362,310.666,"--Well, an -- there is a single standard of discrimination."
2008.08-453,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,325.942,329.746,"If I may say so, that response overlooks the question."
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,348.374,348.891,--Well--
2008.08-453,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,348.891,354.278,"These are hard and, therefore, they will reach a lot of different results under the same standard."
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,354.278,361.115,--There has been no such multiplicity of -- of enforcement.
2008.08-453,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,369.721,370.188,Okay.
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,383.381,390.384,"--It is already the case that under the Fair Housing Act, HUD is required to refer--"
2008.08-453,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,390.384,405.394,"Is your answer yes or no to what I just said, that you deny that the statement of the problem is realistic and therefore there is no problem in your view about having 51 different people enforce the same standard."
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,405.394,406.61,--There is no record of any such problem.
2008.08-453,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,407.927,409.846,"And should such a problem arise, what?"
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,409.846,430.259,"Should such a problem arise, that would be an occasion for considering a kind of burden pre-emption that would be similar -- on evidence of such a problem, that might be a basis for OCC to make a record and enact a regulation to deal with that--"
2008.08-453,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,430.259,440.9,"But if OCC thought there might be such a problem, couldn't it act in advance to avoid the risk that Justice Breyer's question explains?"
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,440.9,442.95,"--Well, its regulation doesn't say that."
2008.08-453,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,453.207,457.092,--May we clarify one thing about the 50 jurisdictions?
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,480.525,480.958,That's correct.
2008.08-453,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,481.808,484.044,"Well, that's correct with respect to a particular loan."
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,498.069,498.486,--It is.
2008.08-453,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,519.833,520.852,I want to--
2008.08-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.852,522.035,Excuse me.
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,531.975,533.477,The Federal Government--
2008.08-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,533.477,535.111,--and Hawaii can have a different law.
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,542.015,544.3,--That appears to be the case.
2008.08-453,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,577.771,580.823,--You are just at the point of getting to what I -- the blank in my mind.
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,595.95,599.035,"Well, there are many things that they might do."
2008.08-453,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,599.035,600.471,"For example, just give me two, a couple."
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,600.471,619.682,"For example, make some provision for -- in fact, I believe there are some regulations that call for conferencing and collaboration and consultation among the State enforcers and between the State and Federal regulators to avoid duplicative regulation."
2008.08-453,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,668.965,685.308,"But the -- in the -- in the general -- in the field of criminal enforcement generally there isn't any provision comparable to what is now 36(f)(1)(B), at least to my knowledge, and it's set out on pages 46 and 47, the text is in the government's brief:"
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,705.721,706.054,Well--
2008.08-453,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,706.054,707.256,You can't tell for sure.
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,743.279,745.448,--There are two reasons for that provision.
2008.08-453,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,764.26,773.016,"But that -- that's, in effect, saving clause kind of function could have been performed simply by a statute that says OCC may."
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,776.651,786.458,"There is another reason in the legislative history, which makes it clear that it was a directive to OCC to mount an enforcement program which Congress thought it had not been doing."
2008.08-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.272,815.026,"You don't deny, do you, that the Federal Government can, if it wishes, enforce the State laws?"
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,815.026,815.293,Absolutely.
2008.08-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,815.293,817.728,So this provision isn't really contrary to what you are saying.
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,819.346,820.496,That's correct.
2008.08-453,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,869.846,872.298,But we come to the New York Attorney General.
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,921.462,926.349,"Well, because you can look at books and records under various authorities."
2008.08-453,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1020.227,1034.487,There is an historic reason for thinking that Congress would be more concerned about States exercising visitorial powers than they would be about private attorneys general or private lawyers.
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1048.478,1061.554,"Well, the suggestion is made that 484, and there is some historical basis for it, was -- was meant to protect national banks against -- against, hostile States, which I guess is what you are suggesting, rather than hostile private people."
2008.08-453,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1162.086,1166.388,Do you want to talk a little bit about Chevron?
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1166.388,1167.324,--Yes.
2008.08-453,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1167.324,1178.012,"Whatever the arguments may be on the merits, it's not clear to me that visitorial powers has an unambiguous meaning that would pre-empt the authority of the OCC to explain it to us."
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1178.012,1180.731,"Well, I'd say two thing about that."
2008.08-453,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1208.582,1215.987,"What do you say about the quotations in the -- the brief that Mr. Waxman filed, as I recall; it may have been the government's brief--"
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1215.987,1216.504,--Yes.
2008.08-453,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1216.504,1224.676,--which -- which do have references to visitorial powers as including general conformance to the law.
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1230.814,1237.568,"Well, the strongest quotations that his brief mentioned several times come from Blackstone."
2008.08-453,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1260.766,1277.211,"No, but there was -- there was a point in -- in distinguishing the visitorial powers that Blackstone, in the cases Blackstone was referring to, and those for example that would apply solely to -- to religious or originally religious foundations like Oxford and Cambridge colleges and so on."
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1281.33,1303.112,"--Well, I think that the point about Blackstone's comment to distinguish -- the point about the distinction between the charitable corporations and the public non-charitable corporations is that it may well be that the sovereign was enforcing not just the charter, but the laws of the sovereign with respect to that State."
2008.08-453,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1303.545,1306.314,But he didn't need visitorial powers to do that.
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1309.849,1319.472,"--Yes, but the sovereign might do it in many different -- a supervisor might do it in many different ways, just as OCC here claims to enforce law not by going into court--"
2008.08-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1319.472,1329.763,"I thought that was your position, that the -- that the visitation authority includes the power to enforce general laws."
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1329.763,1332.715,"--The general laws of the visitor, of the sovereign."
2008.08-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1332.715,1333.681,Of the sovereign.
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1345.389,1346.572,That is correct.
2008.08-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1347.105,1351.176,"So there would be no inconsistency, if you believe that."
2008.08-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1351.176,1351.559,One thing--
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1351.559,1352.409,--That's--
2008.08-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1352.409,1353.461,--One thing puzzled me about this.
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1356.913,1359.365,--They're pre-empting -- that's correct.
2008.08-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.567,1371.34,Did we ever -- do we have any precedents dealing with the question whether preemption of the right to enforce a valid law is appropriate?
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1371.34,1413.084,"Well, this Court in, for example, St. Louis said that when the Federal and the State prohibition were the same, that is, a bank couldn't branch at that time or couldn't interstate branch, the -- and the -- and State tried to enforce both provisions -- they were the same, but the State tried to enforce both the Federal charter limitation and the State law, this Court said the State could not enforce the Federal charter, because that was the prerogative of the chartering visitor, but that it could enforce the State prohibition."
2008.08-453,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1478.275,1484.179,"Is it -- could they -- could the Federal authorities pre-empt the State law, in your opinion?"
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1484.179,1486.662,"Well, no, because Congress has said to the contrary."
2008.08-453,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1505.975,1509.877,"Well, but -- I'm sorry, but it certainly is pre-empted with respect to visitorial powers."
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1509.877,1510.127,--Yes.
2008.08-453,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1510.579,1512.996,This kind of gets us back to where we started.
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1512.996,1514.715,It does.
2008.08-453,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1519.952,1520.619,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-453,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1520.619,1521.102,Thank you.
2008.08-453,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1521.102,1524.987,Mr. Stewart.
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1524.987,1543.384,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To explain the threat that the OCC believes the State's enforcement regime poses to the national banking system and OCC's administration of that system, I would like to begin by going back to a colloquy between Ms. Underwood and Justice Breyer near the beginning of the argument."
2008.08-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1573.569,1574.303,"Well, wait a minute."
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1593.15,1593.9,--We would--
2008.08-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1593.9,1596.5,The Federal Government doesn't -- doesn't have the right to alter State law.
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1596.5,1598.952,--The Federal Government wouldn't have the right to alter State law.
2008.08-453,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1606.291,1617.146,But I thought it is a given in this case -- and tell me if I am wrong on this -- that the State substantive law is not pre-empted.
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1647.285,1650.653,"I give two examples from the national banking system, itself."
2008.08-453,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1663.71,1677.137,"But do you -- do you agree that -- that it is possible to read the OCC, but not necessarily as an exclusive ground?"
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1677.137,1680.439,"I don't think so with the ""shall"" in combination with the passive voice."
2008.08-453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1697.883,1710.208,"Yes, but if you have a situation in which the OCC, say, has very limited personnel -- they only have ten people in their enforcement division, for example -- and Congress thought they have to get more, wouldn't it be appropriate in that background to say, you shall start enforcing?"
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1713.993,1723.516,"--I agree that if the statute simply -- if the statute used the active voice and said the OCC shall enforce these laws, there would be a better argument that the OCC's authority was not exclusive."
2008.08-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1733.224,1737.676,I don't see any difference whatever in that regard between using the active and passive.
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1737.676,1742.329,"--Well, let me give you another example from the national banking system, and that is 12 U.S.C. 85."
2008.08-453,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1742.329,1743.462,I want you to come back.
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1751.699,1753.318,Let me just give you a second example very quickly.
2008.08-453,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1785.372,1787.572,But that's because -- because it's picking a rate.
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1840.757,1846.344,"--Well, another example would be the Similar Crimes Act, which provides for the incorporation of State law with respect to--"
2008.08-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.344,1852.683,"Well, that's not State law applying of its own force, just as your second example was not State law applying of its own force."
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1858.385,1859.287,--Those provisions--
2008.08-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.287,1860.487,That's a different situation.
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1860.487,1864.372,--Those provisions do accomplish incorporation of State law as Federal law.
2008.08-453,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1873.93,1882.017,"Is your concern that -- not with the substantive State law, but that leaving enforcement to the States would cause particular problems?"
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1895.593,1900.764,"--That is certainly true, that the -- the State's exercise of remedial discretion may be different from the Federal Government's."
2008.08-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1968.308,1970.574,You are arguing for conflict pre-emption.
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1982.132,1983.068,--Well--
2008.08-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.068,1988.722,It -- it has so much spare time after enforcing Federal law that it's -- it's going to be worrying about State law?
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1988.722,2003.898,"--Well, the point that has been made at various times in the argument that the State law basically tracks Federal law, I think, is an answer to that question; that is, whatever incentive the Federal Government might have to enforce idiosyncratic features of State law that didn't have a Federal analogue."
2008.08-453,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2020.241,2034.001,--Is there any -- is there any legislative history whatever to the effect that at the time 36(f)(1)(B) was adopted -- to the effect that its effect was to pre-empt State enforcement for--
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2034.001,2042.738,"They -- they don't say it in -- with quite that degree of clarity, but there is a colloquy quoted in the -- the brief for the Clearing House between -- I believe it's Senator D'Amato and--"
2008.08-453,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2042.738,2044.49,--Senator D'Amato and--
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2044.49,2054.479,--And it is -- it is to the effect that Senator D'Amato expresses the concern that this may subject the -- the national banks in their branch activities to State supervision.
2008.08-453,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2065.286,2077.744,"--Yes, but the -- the problem I have with that is, as a -- as a kind of clear statement of -- of something which is -- is -- would be extraordinary -- is that it talks in terms of supervision."
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2110.632,2124.309,"Well, section 36(f)(1)(A) refers to a very limited category of State laws that include State fair lending laws and said these laws will not be pre-empted unless they would be pre-empted with respect to national banks generally."
2008.08-453,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2176.277,2190.167,"Does that mean -- when they say ""review records"", does that mean that the State auditors in effect can walk into the bank, as distinguished from what we have here, in which the bank is being requested to produce excerpts from records?"
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2190.167,2200.956,"--I think that would be the implication of the provision, but the significant point for our purposes is that it refers solely to ensure compliance with applicable State unclaimed property or escheat laws."
2008.08-453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2200.956,2201.756,May I ask you this question?
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2230.308,2234.696,"Yes, we would because that would be going to the banks' federally authorized banking--"
2008.08-453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2234.696,2236.329,All you would have to just look at the records.
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2242.983,2248.803,"--I mean, it might be that in that instance the discrimination would be unlikely to persist, but the basic--"
2008.08-453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2248.803,2249.687,It would be unlikely to persist.
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2257.075,2267.098,"--Yes, the way the regulation is written, it speaks to State efforts to enforce laws that are directed at the bank's federally authorized banking activities."
2008.08-453,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2267.098,2271.918,So do you think the same answer whether -- Justice Stevens mentioned employment discrimination.
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2294.416,2301.002,"No, the regulation does sweep more categorically with respect to inspection of bank records."
2008.08-453,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2306.073,2315.762,Does any of this bring us back to the colloquy you began -- began with -- between Justice Breyer and Ms. Underwood with reference to many States?
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2315.762,2317.381,"Yes, a certain--"
2008.08-453,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2317.381,2320.083,"You -- you began on that, and I never did hear--"
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2320.083,2348.233,"--The part of the point I was trying to make was, even if the substantive State law on its face is not pre-empted because it is identical to the Federal law, once we get to the enforcement stage where the relevant enforcement agency is saying your statistical disparity constitutes a violation because it is not justified by sound banking practices, inevitably that judgment is going to put the State regulator in the business of doing what OCC does."
2008.08-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2361.776,2364.595,"That's conflict pre-emption, and that goes to the -- to the law."
2008.08-453,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2377.07,2386.508,"--Well, the other point I would make about this is that it is accurate to say that under the Federal regime the State is entirely disabled from enforcing its own fair lending law."
2008.08-453,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2432.339,2433.456,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2447.514,2459.404,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 484 plainly has pre-emptive effect, and what it pre-empts, quoting this Court's decision in Watters, is, quote,"
2008.08-453,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2464.958,2476.949,"Mr. Waxman, your mention of Watters, which has been mentioned in the briefs, I think is an inaccurate description of what that opinion held."
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2532.25,2540.089,"Oh, I -- I quite agree, and I did not mean to suggest that this Court's decision in Watters, you know, the holding in Watters concludes the outcome of this case."
2008.08-453,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2582.516,2596.276,"And that was in the context of a State law that says, mortgage lending institution, you may not lend unless you register and do all the rest."
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2614.237,2623.843,--The question in the case is whether or not what the Attorney General here sought to do is the exercise of a visitorial power.
2008.08-453,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2623.843,2631.68,"Can I -- can I take what Justice Ginsburg just said, and give you a thought that I am interested in your response to?"
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2636.5,2639.352,There -- the letters are in the record in the Joint Appendix.
2008.08-453,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2639.352,2639.835,Okay.
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2680.845,2681.979,"Yes, that--"
2008.08-453,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2681.979,2694.605,"But it might be quite a different case, if they had gone into court and found individuals who were really getting different interest rates and who really seemed very, very similar, but for race."
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2703.811,2704.245,--Yes.
2008.08-453,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2704.245,2704.978,Do you see what I'm doing?
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2704.978,2705.495,Right.
2008.08-453,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2705.495,2708.347,"I'm dividing the matter vertically, instead of, say, horizontally--"
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2708.347,2709.032,I'd like to--
2008.08-453,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2709.032,2710.282,--and I want to know if that's possible.
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2710.282,2714.501,--I'd like to address both the vertical and horizontal axes of what I perceive to be your question.
2008.08-453,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2752.042,2752.709,"Sure, there is."
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2752.709,2753.561,It deals with the sovereign.
2008.08-453,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2753.561,2768.07,"Would -- would you acknowledge, counsel, that there is a difference between enforcing State laws through visitation and enforcing State laws apart from visitation?"
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2781.211,2784.68,"Justice Breyer, I'll get to the horizontal axis in a moment."
2008.08-453,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2785.615,2787.015,"I'm sorry, did I skip over an axis here."
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2789.651,2822.455,"--Let me go -- let me go to your axis first, which is to say that anything that is a visitorial power can also be interpreted as a police or enforcement power, and what Congress had in mind -- this is legislation that was born in the crucible of the Civil War, and what Congress sought to pre-empt was State executive action, State examination and enforcement action with respect to these newly created, very important Federal instrumentalities."
2008.08-453,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2907.311,2912.863,"Mr. Waxman, assume -- assume for a minute, this -- what if before writing the letter, the Attorney General of New York said,"
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2933.092,2934.128,"Yes, they would."
2008.08-453,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2935.128,2938.496,Even though they didn't have to look at any bank record to make their prima facie case?
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2938.496,2952.006,"--Well, their -- the OCC in the preamble to its regulations does draw a distinction between State enforcement actions and a pure State declaratory judgment, quote,"
2008.08-453,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2956.725,2958.494,I am asking about a hypothetical.
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2966.85,2997.035,"--Well, this is -- this case is certainly in the core, but a -- a State authority, whether it's the State banking commission or the State human rights commission or the State attorney general, or for that matter another Federal Government authority, that seeks to call a national bank to account for the manner in which it is conducting an expressly designated, allocated banking power is an exercise of visitorial power."
2008.08-453,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2997.035,2997.835,"Well, it isn't -- it isn't if--"
2008.08-453,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2997.835,3004.808,He doesn't even want to look at your books; he just wants to prove it by people who have been borrowing money and compare them with -- among them they can orally.
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3004.808,3005.425,I don't--
2008.08-453,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3005.425,3008.009,I don't understand why that would be visitorial power.
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3008.009,3018.882,--The -- the State's enforcement of any law that is directed at a national bank's authorized banking powers is a visitorial power.
2008.08-453,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3061.977,3067.965,"So one could say, yes, the Federal authorities have visitorial powers, and they can go to court."
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3088.729,3090.33,--That's correct.
2008.08-453,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3107.773,3108.292,"--Well, is it--"
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3108.292,3110.225,That was the reason for the courts of justice exception.
2008.08-453,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3110.225,3118.731,"--Is it the exercise of visitorial powers, or is it an action which covers the same subject that an exercise of visitorial powers would do?"
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3175.55,3205.456,"I don't think -- I think that if I understood your question, and I may not have -- if a suit by a private individual or a group of private individuals seeking to vindicate the deprivation of a private traditional right is not visitorial; but if the State, either directly in the enforcement of its general laws or seeking to protect the people of its State, goes into court or asks for records or anything else, it is exercising a traditional visitorial power."
2008.08-453,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3234.689,3235.975,That is the one with Senator D'Amato?
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3235.975,3236.441,--Yes.
2008.08-453,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3280.42,3280.97,Uh-huh.
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3280.97,3321.83,"So it enacted a dual regime that demonstrates exactly what Congress had in mind, which is that there would be one regulator making the kind of judgments about, okay, there is a disparity, but let's look at credit history, let's look at the loan to equity value, let's look at income versus debt incurred, and all these factors that the OCC and the Fed have explained have to go into making a judgment about whether or not a particular condition of a particular loan violates Federal law, whether it the Fair Housing Act or the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the Fed's regulation B."
2008.08-453,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3321.83,3326.132,"Mr. Waxman, you are talking about lending."
2008.08-453,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3349.831,3351.433,May I answer?
2008.08-453,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3367.026,3368.126,"--Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-453,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3370.894,3378.0,A couple of -- four points or so.
2008.08-453,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3443.192,3446.144,"Ms. Underwood, I -- I forgot the response you made in your brief."
2008.08-453,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3453.448,3454.365,In the exceptions?
2008.08-453,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3454.365,3455.084,Yes.
2008.08-453,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3461.671,3469.844,Virtually every exception was enacted to resolve a controversy over whether something was visitorial or not.
2008.08-453,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3491.007,3502.981,"Counsel, why isn't it a complete answer to what I agree is a somewhat unusual situation of pre-empting enforcement but not the substance of law that its enforcement that raises the concerns?"
2008.08-453,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3522.561,3531.934,"--Well, even without enforcement of State law, OCC would not have exclusive control of enforcement of discrimination laws against national banks."
2008.08-453,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3540.44,3542.573,"So, why -- why is it a mistake?"
2008.08-453,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3556.633,3558.318,I didn't mean it's a mistake of policy.
2008.08-453,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3583.1,3591.806,"So your answer is because they have different entities that can enforce it, they are sort of in for a penny, in for a pound?"
2008.08-453,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3595.158,3596.527,"No, I don't say that--"
2008.08-453,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3596.527,3600.644,Including the entities that have historically have targeted national banks?
2008.08-453,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3600.644,3603.28,--I don't make that argument.
2008.08-453,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3610.35,3632.533,"I suppose if -- if enforcement pre-emption is the lesser step, we probably ought to revise our jurisprudence so as not to tread any more heavily than we have to upon the States so that where there is conflict pre-emption, all we should say is the State law is not invalidated, it is simply not enforceable?"
2008.08-453,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3632.533,3633.45,Well--
2008.08-453,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3633.45,3634.166,I mean that would--
2008.08-453,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3634.166,3640.287,"No, I suppose the question would not be what we think is a good idea but what Congress has done."
2008.08-453,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3649.661,3650.227,--Well--
2008.08-453,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3650.227,3653.713,I would suppose you would thank them for that rather than criticize them for it.
2008.08-453,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3653.713,3664.937,--I think that in many ways leaving the law intact and denying the States the ability to enforce it is more intrusive then simply finding pre-emption.
2008.08-453,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3673.025,3673.725,"Thank you, Ms. Underwood."
