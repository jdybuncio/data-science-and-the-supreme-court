2003.02-682,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.569,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-682, Verizon Communications v. the Law Offices of Curtis v. Trinko, LLP."
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,60.929,64.522,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,92.403,97.71,"We have an Illinois Brick problem before we even get to the substantive question, don't we?"
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,101.015,107.535,"I don't think that Illinois Brick...  in fact, I think Illinois Brick is not a jurisdictional point."
2003.02-682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,113.192,121.82,"Well, I understand, but...  but those...  those standing rules that are not jurisdictional are still standing rules, and we normally apply them."
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,126.028,134.861,"Well, we...  we do think you should, but that it shouldn't preclude the Court from reaching the merits, which are of much broader importance."
2003.02-682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,151.746,153.315,"Well, it seems to me..."
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,153.315,153.853,The merits question is a much more...
2003.02-682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,153.853,155.999,It seems to me you're just trying to rush to the merits.
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,159.138,164.339,"Oh, we...  we think so as...  as well, and let me...  let me address that briefly."
2003.02-682,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,164.339,169.29,What you're...  what you're saying basically it's a claim for relief issue rather than a...  than a jurisdictional issue.
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,169.29,169.745,"Yes, yes."
2003.02-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,206.321,218.004,"Mr. Taranto, you made a...  an interesting classification, and I think I tend to agree with it, but I'm not sure that these Court's cases fit that mold."
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,256.642,267.045,The best that I can do with that is to describe what the Court has done in the cases that we rely on for saying there's no statutory standing.
2003.02-682,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,357.879,360.585,Is this a kind of refusal to deal case?
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,364.671,367.067,It is a kind of refusal to deal.
2003.02-682,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,488.183,493.012,And the reason Otter Tail...  Otter Tail seems like the strongest precedent against you.
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,502.793,506.387,Otter Tail was also a case of discrimination.
2003.02-682,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,588.12,590.161,"Well, now you're back into the merits, aren't you?"
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,590.161,591.425,"Yes, yes."
2003.02-682,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,591.425,592.29,Yes.
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,598.977,602.981,"Well, I...  we think not really for...  for a combination of reasons."
2003.02-682,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,628.372,632.17,But AT&T didn't bring an antitrust action.
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,632.17,649.549,"Well, the...  the final...  final reason I'll mention here is that recognizing the statutory cause of action here would also interfere with the voluntarily agreed upon nonjudicial dispute resolution mechanism that AT&T and Verizon entered into."
2003.02-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,649.549,671.923,"Mr. Taranto, Judge Katzmann in the Second Circuit, whose decision we're reviewing, seemed to think that AT&T was not, as you expressed it, the better complainant, but that the remedy for AT&T was the administrative context."
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,738.425,740.571,"Let me take those in...  in order, if I may."
2003.02-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,757.994,759.025,But it had no choice in that.
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,776.98,785.319,"Well, that...  that...  nondispute judicial...  dispute judicial...  nonjudicial dispute resolution was here part of an agreement."
2003.02-682,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,804.556,807.489,"Okay, and if...  if there hadn't been an agreement, AT&T would go where?"
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,809.097,819.666,"It...  it could go to the commission or it could bring a Sherman Act suit unless, of course, as we do contend, there is no legitimate section...  section 2 claim."
2003.02-682,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,824.746,825.422,"Mr. Taranto, would you clarify one thing for me?"
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,829.863,836.096,The New York Public Service Commission settlement settled the New York problem.
2003.02-682,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.526,856.241,"Well, I was under the impression AT&T retained the right to sue in other parts of the country."
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,864.991,871.929,I...  I'm...  I'm...  I don't know that AT&T has signed similar agreements for the rest of the country.
2003.02-682,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,909.945,915.684,"Of course, their position is that this isn't the best test case because this plaintiff didn't make all the right allegations, as I read their brief."
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,915.684,921.462,"Well, I...  I don't think there could have been any different allegations on the dispositive point."
2003.02-682,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.657,940.493,"Yes, but they...  they alleged that in other areas, that there had been...  that there's been sham litigation, fraudulent misrepresentations, and...  and affirmative misconduct, in addition to failing to comply with all the requirements of the '96 statute."
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,940.493,948.295,"And...  and those...  those claims, to the extent that they're not helping hand kinds of claims, would of course be outside the analysis."
2003.02-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,962.884,963.694,Would you get to the...
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,963.694,964.453,Yes.
2003.02-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,964.453,965.302,the last part?
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,979.502,979.957,Yes.
2003.02-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,991.391,993.786,Are damages available on that claim?
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,993.786,1005.674,The claim is...  is a claim under the damages provision of section 207 for an alleged violation of the substantive Communications Act provision in section 202.
2003.02-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1016.077,1031.393,"But you...  you say that under...  under 202 that there would be if...  if plaintiff prevails on that claim against Verizon, not AT&T, there would be a damage remedy for the loss that the plaintiff could prove?"
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1036.715,1040.431,The plaintiff certainly asks for the same damages.
2003.02-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1056.406,1069.0,Then why did Judge Katzmann say a couple of times the only opportunity for the plaintiff to get damages is if there is this second section 2 suit?
2003.02-682,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1069.0,1076.097,"I'm...  I'm afraid I can't answer that question, having...  the court having reinstated that...  that claim."
2003.02-682,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1083.777,1086.09,"Very well, Mr. Taranto."
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1087.986,1094.013,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-682,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1114.492,1119.238,"Mr. Solicitor General, before you get into your argument, do you have a position on the standing issue?"
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1119.238,1124.152,We did not brief and we did not take a position in our briefing on the standing question.
2003.02-682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1168.65,1169.865,Excuse me.
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1199.093,1224.728,"We...  we felt, Justice Scalia, not in the context of Article III standing, but in the context of prudential standing in the context of antitrust standing which relates specifically to something this Court has called antitrust injury, which ties into the particular violation, and in order to determine that here, we felt that the Court would have to first answer the question whether there is an antitrust injury itself."
2003.02-682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1231.248,1240.908,But you're asking us to do that in a case where a...  a plaintiff without a real interest may be the one that's...  that's demanding that...  that adjudication.
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1241.651,1277.771,"Well, we do think...  we do think...  and had we briefed the question, we would have...  we would have thought that there was...  that...  that Trinko had some points here, that it...  this is not an Illinois Brick case...  that Trinko was depending in part upon service provided by the Verizon loop and that it had a choice, as the plaintiffs...  the plaintiff...  that Trinko has alleged in this case, that it had a choice between deficient service from AT&T or...  or paying perhaps a higher price or something else from Verizon, that there are distinctions."
2003.02-682,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1309.35,1314.097,And do you...  do you take the position that that effort gives Trinko a cause of action under the statute?
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1314.097,1317.608,That we take...  I'm sorry.
2003.02-682,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1317.608,1321.239,Can Trinko sue...  does Trinko have a cause of action under the statute?
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1321.239,1323.385,"Under...  well, yes."
2003.02-682,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1327.017,1327.639,Yes.
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1327.639,1337.381,There is a...  there would be...  and the Second Circuit did decide that there was a right to action under the discrimination provisions of section 202.
2003.02-682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1340.763,1341.135,Is...
2003.02-682,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1341.135,1344.729,But I...  I thought Mr. Taranto said this...  there is no discrimination in this case.
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1350.506,1360.248,"Well, first of all, to the extent that there is and to the extent that there are allegations of that, the court addressed that and reinstated that very cause of action."
2003.02-682,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1363.016,1374.162,"Okay, but on the...  just on the facts pleaded, do you take...  does the United States take the position that...  that Trinko has pleaded a cause of action under 202 or any other section of the statute?"
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1374.162,1382.214,"We do not dispute, Justice Souter, the existence of the cause of action recognized by the Second Circuit on page 16a..."
2003.02-682,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1382.214,1385.186,Do you dispute that he has pleaded a cause of action?
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1385.186,1387.165,We do not.
2003.02-682,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1387.165,1388.091,Okay.
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1388.091,1391.063,With respect to that section of the Communications Act.
2003.02-682,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1391.063,1395.687,But is there any reason he can't go to the...  the PSC like anybody else can and say I have ducks on the line?
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1395.687,1396.264,That's...
2003.02-682,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1396.264,1396.886,I can't hear anything.
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1402.253,1412.368,That's also true and there's also an action against the...  the...  Trinko had a contract with AT&T to supply it with adequate telephone service.
2003.02-682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1426.419,1434.964,"To...  to get to...  to the merits part of the case, the sacrifice test that you want us to adopt assumes that certain acts are not pro-competitive."
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1443.387,1452.425,"Actually we submit, Justice Kennedy, that what the Communications Act does is something that the antitrust laws never did do."
2003.02-682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1595.339,1607.349,Why...  why do we have to accept or buy into your broader no-help theory of the antitrust laws if we...  we accept what you've just said?
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1619.404,1620.89,"I agree with that, Justice Scalia..."
2003.02-682,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1620.89,1621.445,You do.
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1621.445,1625.865,that the Court does not need to go into broader general principles.
2003.02-682,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1635.563,1641.302,How can you say the Communications Act has superseded the Sherman Act when the statute itself says it didn't?
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1641.302,1646.708,"It does...  no, we are not suggesting...  we're not saying that the...  that the act provides any immunity."
2003.02-682,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1656.822,1658.968,"Well, that's a different point than the one Justice Scalia made."
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1663.427,1668.34,"That's correct, but it's specifically true in the context of this regime that exists."
2003.02-682,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1696.371,1697.69,"Thank you, General Olson."
2003.02-682,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1697.69,1698.311,Thank you.
2003.02-682,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1698.311,1700.419,"Mr. Verrilli, we'll hear from you."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1700.419,1706.446,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-682,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1735.629,1745.948,"And at some point in...  in your standing discussion, could you address whether or not Trinko could just have sued AT&T, say you're giving us lousy service, we want our money back?"
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1745.948,1748.921,I think Trinko could have brought a suit like that.
2003.02-682,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1753.007,1759.119,"That's not usually a defense, the failure of the contracting party to deliver adequate services under the contract."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1759.119,1766.671,"Well, that...  that's correct, but in this situation, there...  there might well be filed rate doctrine problems with a suit like that."
2003.02-682,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1866.488,1867.519,Or even if he hasn't sued I thought.
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1867.519,1872.182,"That...  well, that's correct, but there were...  because he could sue and there will be problems of duplicative recovery."
2003.02-682,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1899.758,1907.188,"So as long as the consumer can bring an action for something that AT&T couldn't bring, no Illinois...  no Hanover, no Illinois Brick."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1907.188,1907.577,Correct.
2003.02-682,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1956.972,1959.079,"Yes, but isn't there a proximate cause problem in this case too?"
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1979.057,2003.783,"The means by which Verizon was trying to monopolize the market, as the complaint alleges...  and I think this is clear from paragraphs 1 and 2 and 54 of the amended complaint...  was that it was...  Verizon was using its control of the local loop that competitors needed to lease to get service going to degrade the service that its competitors, including AT&T, were able to provide to customers."
2003.02-682,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2008.507,2016.309,"Well, are you...  are you alleging that they not merely failed to perform their duties, but they actually interfered with AT&T's performance of its..."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2016.309,2016.864,Correct.
2003.02-682,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2016.864,2017.59,retail obligation?
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2017.59,2018.333,"I think...  you know, remember..."
2003.02-682,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2018.333,2021.51,Because that's a little different from the way the court of appeals described the complaint.
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2021.51,2040.086,"Well, I...  I understand it, Your Honor, but the...  but the complaint...  one of the difficulties of this case, of course, is that we're here on a complaint and the test under rule 8 is a notice pleading test, and it can...  and the complaint can only be dismissed if there is no conceivable set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations in the complaint that would support relief."
2003.02-682,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2040.708,2048.342,"Yes, but you have to have alleged in your complaint just how it was that...  that Verizon's misconduct hurt your clients."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2048.342,2068.943,"Yes, Your Honor, and I think the...  I think paragraph 2 of the amended complaint says that Bell Atlantic deterred and will continue to deter potential customers from switching to another company for local phone service or cause customers that switch back to Bell Atlantic in frustration for the poor services rendered by their local phone service provider."
2003.02-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2079.096,2101.553,"Under the...  what bothers me about the Illinois Brick problem is...  I completely agree with your characterization, but the law would seem odd that would say when Smith, a price-fixing ring, charges Jones $3 extra, we don't let Jones' customers sue for the actual overcharge he undoubtedly suffered."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2136.681,2141.018,"Well, I think it's the right answer to let them recover, and...  and it's not speculative."
2003.02-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2170.861,2196.125,"The other thing on...  on the...  that I had as a question on the merits of the complaint is I...  I...  if this complaint had said that Verizon went to the customers who were trying to use AT&T and said, Mr. Customer, we're going to wreck your service unless you buy from us, or indeed carried that out in...  through surreptitious ways, but that's what he was saying."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2204.176,2204.753,"Well, under..."
2003.02-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2204.753,2234.27,"Rather, what I see in the complaint...  and I want you to point out where it's the contrary...  is that every claim of bad service is connected through a because or some other word like that to the refusal of Verizon to hook up AT&T, i.e., to provide them with the Verizon service so they can provide service to the customer."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2244.301,2247.023,"First, paragraph 2, which is at page..."
2003.02-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2247.023,2247.849,2 is the overview.
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2247.849,2253.217,"Yes, but what it says, Justice Breyer, is that they degraded service."
2003.02-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2274.055,2285.827,"Well, I'm not with you completely for the reason that the overview seems to be an overview which is explicated by the specific complaints of exclusionary conduct which appear later in the complaint."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2285.827,2289.642,But I think those complaints are fairly construed to...  to include denial...
2003.02-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2289.642,2290.74,And I would like you to point out.
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2290.74,2294.743,I think it's true about paragraph 52.
2003.02-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2317.778,2318.149,All right.
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2318.149,2318.809,to this present day.
2003.02-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2318.809,2343.784,"Then with paragraph 54, which I thought was the heart of the complaint, what it seems to say at the end is when they did these bad things, the plain effect was that AT&T was prevented from offering local phone service of the quality, as was offered by Bell, and thereby to impede the ability of AT&T to compete."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2353.444,2354.847,"Well, what it...  what it says..."
2003.02-682,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2354.847,2355.84,Yes.
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2355.84,2356.333,I...  I don't...
2003.02-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2356.333,2359.843,"If you don't, in other words, have an obligation to bring them into the market..."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2359.843,2360.67,"Well, I think you do."
2003.02-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2360.67,2361.989,"under the antitrust laws, you lose."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2361.989,2366.258,"I think...  well, I think you do have an obligation under the antitrust laws, and I'll try to get to that as fast as I can."
2003.02-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2366.258,2366.796,If you don't...
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2366.796,2367.167,But...
2003.02-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2367.167,2368.366,"If you don't, do you lose?"
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2368.366,2369.852,"No, because this says..."
2003.02-682,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2369.852,2372.014,"Where...  where are you reading from, Mr. Verrilli?"
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2372.014,2373.111,"I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-682,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2481.595,2492.203,"Well, you...  you say then that the 1996 act gives you affirmative momentum that you wouldn't have with...  that you wouldn't have if it were just the antitrust laws?"
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2492.203,2497.011,"I wouldn't put it quite that way, Your Honor, but I...  and I will answer Your...  Your Honor's question directly."
2003.02-682,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2595.364,2597.426,"Well, you're modifying it either way, aren't you?"
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2604.03,2604.939,I don't think so.
2003.02-682,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2604.939,2605.888,It's modification either way.
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2605.888,2616.002,"I don't think so, Justice Souter, because the...  the statute says that nothing shall modify the...  modify, impair, or supersede the applicability of the antitrust laws."
2003.02-682,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2616.002,2623.327,"And the momentum theory, in effect, says the applicability is being modified because there's a declaration of certain anti-competitive conduct."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2623.327,2625.661,"Well, I don't...  I don't think so."
2003.02-682,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2641.265,2647.664,But I thought you were invoking the act for the characterization of those facts as anti-competitive.
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2647.664,2651.562,"Well, yes, in the following sense, Justice Souter."
2003.02-682,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2682.11,2690.533,Are...  are you saying that the Telecommunications Act imposes new duties and the violation of those duties now becomes an antitrust violation?
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2690.533,2692.224,No.
2003.02-682,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2692.967,2697.508,You want to talk about the...  about...  about the facts of...  of the...  of the market.
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2698.251,2699.283,They...  I...
2003.02-682,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2699.283,2713.584,"But it seemed to me the thrust of Justice Souter's question as well was that the Telecommunications Act imposes new duties, and violation of those new duties is...  is really the gravamen of your complaint."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2713.584,2718.397,"I don't think that...  I don't think that's quite right, Justice Kennedy, and let me try to explain why."
2003.02-682,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2820.581,2828.283,Or does it say we define pro-competitive in a...  in a way based on the Telecommunications Act?
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2830.391,2847.58,"Well, I think...  I think it does say that this is conduct that it...  that it...  I think you can no longer say that it is...  that it is consistent with competition on the merits for a monopolist to refuse to cooperate when a law designed to promote competition insists on the cooperation."
2003.02-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2852.986,2854.001,What is cooperation?
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2922.072,2926.53,"I...  I disagree with that, Your Honor, and the reason why is this."
2003.02-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2982.546,2998.976,"And many of those regulatory requirements consist of something called TELRIC blank slate, which happened to cover, you know, an unbelievable number of pages and I'm sure would come into the argument about whether the pricing condition is or is not a reasonable one."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2998.976,3000.379,"I don't...  I don't think that's right, Your Honor."
2003.02-682,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3013.3,3014.664,But does that go to the jury then?
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3022.854,3023.414,Yes.
2003.02-682,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3034.271,3041.33,"Well, but then you have the jury determining whether...  whether TELRIC pricing is...  has been properly applied or not."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3041.907,3048.017,"No, I don't think you do because the way this is going to...  what we're talking about here, Your Honor, is...  is something very different."
2003.02-682,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3083.767,3092.228,"You're saying only when the claim relates not to the refusal to interconnect, but to the failure to provide adequate service after interconnection pursuant to a contract."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3092.228,3094.374,"Well, I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2003.02-682,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3099.221,3100.607,"Well, let's suppose it's a refusal to interconnect."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3100.607,3101.144,But the...
2003.02-682,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3101.144,3103.002,The refusal to enter into a contract.
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3103.002,3106.922,"That's also governed by the same set of regulatory norms, and it takes away...  it..."
2003.02-682,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3106.922,3118.606,"But in that case at least you'd have to put to the jury the question of whether the refusal to enter into this contract was an unreasonable one, which would depend on these very subtle pricing determinations."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3118.606,3131.443,"I...  well, I think there might be some circumstances, Your Honor, in which it will be a harder case to make, and that might be a case where a judge could appropriately say, it's too complicated, it can't go to the jury, or might appropriately say, this is a matter for primary jurisdiction."
2003.02-682,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3150.39,3150.928,Mr. Verrilli?
2003.02-682,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3150.928,3169.875,"And so it is a concern when you address it in this context, isn't it?"
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3169.875,3183.084,"I think that it is a concern, but it is not a concern that defeats standing for the reasons I gave earlier, and it is a concern that can be overcome through the normal processes of discovery under the Federal rules."
2003.02-682,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3201.25,3246.242,"Mr. Verrilli, in attempting to determine whether these two pieces of legislation operate on separate tracks, Telecommunications Act, section 2, Judge Wood said one of the problems with reading the Telecommunications Act effectively into section 2 is that it then...  then section 2 of the Sherman Act might eclipse this elaborate regime that Congress set up because why would any player want to use that mechanism instead of coming into court with the possibility of getting treble damages."
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3246.242,3279.308,"Well, I...  I think the answer is, Your Honor, because in...  in the absence of an effort by a...  an entity, a competitor, to use the mechanisms that the act put in place, then that...  in that situation, the entity doesn't have an antitrust claim where they could show exclusionary conduct based on subversion on the regulatory requirements and lack of a legitimate business justification based on refusal to abide by the regulatory requirements because they haven't invoked the regulatory requirements."
2003.02-682,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3279.308,3286.45,But after because...  because certainly AT&T could go back to the regulator and say...
2003.02-682,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3286.45,3296.276,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's right, but that's a far...  but...  but I think that's a far different situation from the one that Judge Wood described."
2003.02-682,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3406.617,3410.704,Thank you...  excuse me...  Mr. Verrilli.
2003.02-682,3,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3412.849,3414.995,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2003.02-682,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3583.005,3585.151,"Thank you, Mr. Taranto."
2003.02-682,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3586.144,3590.435,The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at 10 o'clock.
