1998.97-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.939,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-1489, Your Home Visiting Nurse Services v. Donna E. Shalala."
1998.97-1489,0,20892,diana_l_gustin,,60.205,63.323,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,147.141,154.23,"Well, but you had one round of judicial... of administrative review here, didn't you, with the right to appeal to the district court?"
1998.97-1489,0,20892,diana_l_gustin,,154.23,189.487,"We had an opportunity, a chance to make a request for an appeal, but based upon the information that we had at that time, an appeal was not sought, but when we discovered new and material evidence which we believe shows that the intermediary violated its own regulations, upon discovery of the new and material evidence, we believe that gives us the right to request the reopening, and if that reopening is unlawfully withheld, we sought review, and so it's the review of the refusal, which is final agency action, which we are seeking."
1998.97-1489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,189.487,207.949,"Ms. Gustin, you know, there has to be an end to litigation at some point, and I thought the normal rule is, when there's a final judgment, you can come back and say, you know, there are new circumstances, but whether to open for that reason is discretionary."
1998.97-1489,0,20892,diana_l_gustin,,226.343,226.876,Well--
1998.97-1489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,226.876,229.278,"And if they decide not to, that's the end of the matter."
1998.97-1489,0,20892,diana_l_gustin,,229.278,248.424,"--Your Honor, in this Court's decision in ICC v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which was decided in 1977, this Court held that a refusal to reopen which was based upon new and material evidence should have some sort of review, because otherwise--"
1998.97-1489,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,248.424,252.228,"Ms. Gustin, the statute in that case provided for removal."
1998.97-1489,0,20892,diana_l_gustin,,254.43,254.53,--That is--
1998.97-1489,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,254.53,257.464,"Here, as I understand it, the statute says nothing."
1998.97-1489,0,20892,diana_l_gustin,,271.271,271.888,--Well--
1998.97-1489,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,271.888,279.044,"So how can you compare a case where Congress said, you have a right to reopen, to a case where Congress made no such provision."
1998.97-1489,0,20892,diana_l_gustin,,279.044,286.03,"--Well, first of all, I think that there is a statutory provision within the medicare statute which requires reopening."
1998.97-1489,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,286.03,287.649,And which one is that?
1998.97-1489,0,20892,diana_l_gustin,,287.649,292.034,"And that would be section 1395x(v)(1)(A), clause (ii)."
1998.97-1489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,292.034,306.194,"But that refers to reopening when the year's books have finally been closed so that you could tell what the actual charges were, and the Secretary gave you that opportunity, didn't she?"
1998.97-1489,0,20892,diana_l_gustin,,306.194,331.928,"Well, whether or not that refers to just a year-end book-balancing I think has not been decided by this Court, but in fact the Secretary uses that reopening process for more than simply a year-end book-balancing to compare estimated cost with actual cost, and so we would say first of all to Justice Ginsburg's question, there is statutory authority for a reopening within that."
1998.97-1489,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,332.611,341.701,"But if we read the statute to say what it does, it provides for the year-end adjustment, and that's all it provides for, then you don't have any such argument."
1998.97-1489,0,20892,diana_l_gustin,,341.701,358.311,"--If you read the statute that way, but I would impress upon the Court that in this case in particular the Secretary used the reopening process beyond that year-end book-balancing period, and the Secretary routinely uses the reopening process beyond that simple year-end--"
1998.97-1489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,358.311,359.279,The reopening process.
1998.97-1489,0,20892,diana_l_gustin,,375.755,401.923,"--Well, I don't think that there... that it's clearly stated that Congress wanted a... an unreviewable, completely insulated final agency action, and I think that the decision in Michigan Academy talks at great length about the fact that the presumption to judicial review is so important that we cannot just think that Congress meant something not to be reopened that it requires--"
1998.97-1489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,401.923,404.358,"But you can come back 10 years later, even after you've gotten this review."
1998.97-1489,0,20892,diana_l_gustin,,415.915,417.215,"--I believe that is correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-1489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,417.215,417.867,Well--
1998.97-1489,0,20892,diana_l_gustin,,417.867,419.217,As the Ninth Circuit held--
1998.97-1489,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1816.838,1818.89,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
