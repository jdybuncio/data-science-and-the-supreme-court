2009.08-861,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.122,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-861, Free Enterprise Fund and Beckstead and Watts v. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,11.022,30.785,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The board is unique among Federal regulatory agencies in that the President can neither appoint nor remove its members, nor does he have any ability to designate the chairman or review the work product, so he is stripped of the traditional means of control that he has over the traditional independent agencies."
2009.08-861,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,39.058,43.526,Why do you call it an independent regulatory agency?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,56.501,61.821,"Justice Ginsburg, by making it public, it made it free of the accounting profession."
2009.08-861,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,76.513,77.213,But the--
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,77.213,77.697,There was--
2009.08-861,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,77.697,82.067,--The SEC doesn't have another overseer.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,97.91,106.016,"--There is a buffer between the President and the board, and that's called the SEC, and the board can do many things without the approval of the SEC."
2009.08-861,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,110.753,115.205,It can't even issue a subpoena without the SEC's approval.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,115.205,122.228,"--It actually can collect information from anyone associated with the people they regulate, the auditing committees."
2009.08-861,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,127.096,129.898,So the SEC really could stop anything?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,129.898,134.119,"--It cannot, for example, stop what happened to the Petitioners here."
2009.08-861,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,142.289,144.622,What happened to the Petitioners here?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,165.135,176.943,"No, no, and I'm dealing with the inspections issue at large, not for -- for Petitioner or for anyone else, there is no mechanism -- no existing mechanism for the SEC, in any way, to say stop the investigation."
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,177.962,184.616,When you say SEC adopt a rule that would give the SEC authority to -- to stop it?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,184.616,191.953,"--No, it couldn't, and -- but I think the main point is, Your Honor, it hasn't, and since it hasn't, it doesn't have that authority now."
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.953,192.555,"Well, I'm--"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,192.555,194.022,But I can tell you--
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,194.022,195.005,--I'm not sure that's the main point.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,201.328,204.445,"--Yes, and right now it cannot, and that's because--"
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.445,205.945,"Never mind ""Right now, it cannot""."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,209.731,211.897,"--Yes, it cannot issue such a rule."
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,211.897,213.016,--It cannot issue such a rule?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,213.016,213.199,Absolutely not.
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,213.199,213.516,Why not?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,213.516,228.209,"Well, the provision they point to, 7217(d)(1), says it can relieve the board of responsibility, but there is nothing in the statute that gives the SEC to conduct the board's statutory duties."
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.196,244.385,"Well, why -- why isn't this simply relieving the board of responsibility, saying, you no longer have responsibility for -- for investigation and inspection in these areas?"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,244.385,245.052,But that--
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,245.052,245.568,"They could do that, couldn't they?"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,245.568,246.802,"--No, it can't."
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.604,251.639,"Well, let's talk about whether it can't or not."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,252.572,253.305,--All right.
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.359,313.428,"Don't -- don't you think that's what it means, though, realistically?"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,313.428,315.395,"--You know, Your Honor, I think that would be--"
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,315.395,320.699,"When you no longer have responsibility to perform a government -- governmental act, you no longer have authority to perform it."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,320.699,323.568,"--If you viewed it in isolation, that would be an arguable principle."
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,358.889,364.893,"Well, they don't have to -- they can't issue a subpoena without the board's approval, I take it -- the commission's approval."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,364.893,371.047,They have very serious information-gathering powers totally distinct from the board.
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,371.047,371.48,What?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,371.48,383.605,"Any -- any person who is a registered association or anyone who is associated with them has to provide documents, witness testimony, wholly apart from a subpoena, so anyone who is within the regulatory--"
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,383.605,384.188,Or what?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,384.188,388.307,--Or they will suffer the sanctions that are listed in the statute.
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,388.307,390.592,And the commission can't change the sanctions?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,390.592,394.811,"Well, not -- obviously the commission can review the sanctions."
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,395.413,398.698,"And it can't -- it can't pass a rule saying, we don't want you to do that?"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,398.698,401.65,"--Well, sanctions of course are done with order."
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,408.219,419.611,"So as far as -- if the company was ever certain it was right and that the Accounting Board was out of control, completely wrong, the company would just say: I'm not complying--"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,419.611,420.727,--Well -- but--
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,420.727,421.494,"--fine, do what you want."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,421.494,422.144,--But--
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,422.144,429.466,"And then at that moment, the group that would decide whether they were right or the board was right would be the commission; is that right?"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,429.466,437.053,"--Well, I don't think there ever would be a dispute about whether or not they would have access to their documents and their testimony, because it's written right in the statute--"
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,437.053,439.322,It says you don't -- you can get it even without a subpoena?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,439.322,440.69,"--Yes, absolutely."
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,440.69,441.057,Where does it say that?
2009.08-861,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,444.159,444.726,What happens--
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,444.726,446.678,"I don't want to delay you, so forget it."
2009.08-861,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,447.294,450.796,--What happens to the information that the board obtains?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,452.462,453.831,I think--
2009.08-861,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,453.831,454.598,--or is it all confidential?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,454.598,460.152,--I think there are certain confidentiality restrictions as part of their investigative and inspection thing.
2009.08-861,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,474.911,476.861,The -- the burden of time of compliance?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,476.861,478.363,I'm sorry.
2009.08-861,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,478.363,482.498,The burden is because it's difficult and expensive to comply?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,482.498,483.6,That would be one.
2009.08-861,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,503.928,509.816,No -- but I'm -- I'm talking about the harm to your client and to the -- those similarly situated.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,509.816,510.418,--Yes.
2009.08-861,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,510.418,511.918,There's the cost of compliance.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,523.325,524.927,"You're right, Your Honor."
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,543.905,545.655,But I've got one thing on my list.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,562.817,563.567,Yes.
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,563.567,564.217,"Now, what's two?"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,564.217,567.686,"Well, I think that that is the main point."
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,567.686,568.153,Okay.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,569.87,570.472,Well--
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,570.472,571.055,Okay.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,571.055,572.505,--But I do want to emphasize that--
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,572.505,573.59,I'm not saying it's good or bad.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,575.54,593.918,"--If I might elaborate slightly, Justice Breyer, I think it's important to understand that they have the ability to inspect foreign auditing firms, and the Cato Institute filed a brief that described the adverse reaction of the 27 countries where they are currently exercising this inspection power abroad."
2009.08-861,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,604.357,605.409,They can't pass rules?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,605.409,609.527,"--Again, they can pass rules, but the Attorney General--"
2009.08-861,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,609.527,625.537,"What -- what is the difference between what you are talking about and an employer who says: Look, I can't stick my nose in every bit of business that goes on in my office because that's impossible; otherwise I'd be doing all the work and I just humanly can't."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,634.377,636.995,"--There are three fundamental differences, Justice--"
2009.08-861,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,636.995,638.696,What's the difference between that and this scheme?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,638.696,644.1,"--In your hypothetical, the principal has exactly the same powers as the subordinate."
2009.08-861,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,651.904,654.723,"Well -- let's break down each part of your argument, please."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,667.316,668.65,"--No, obviously they do."
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,698.752,719.064,"And if you have a statute that says each Department -- Commerce, Justice -- the Attorney General of the United States or the secretary shall appoint an inspector general who will in fact inspect and find ethics violations and that office -- he cannot be removed from that office without cause."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,722.099,722.732,"No, no."
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,726.234,726.734,Yes.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,727.434,728.05,"--Well, two differences."
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,734.72,750.629,So you are saying that the -- the chairman of the SEC does not under the Constitution have the authority or the SEC does not have the authority to appoint individuals who cannot be removed without cause?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,750.629,752.165,"--Well, I think there is two points."
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,752.165,757.652,Or -- or you might be saying they do not have the authority to appoint inferior officers of the United States.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,762.121,768.508,"Well, because Freytag made it clear that there's a difference between an independent agency, like the Tax Court."
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,768.508,769.377,What's an independent agency?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,769.377,772.329,"Well, in that case was an independent agency in the Executive Branch--"
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,772.329,774.012,"Well, what is an independent agency?"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,774.012,778.047,--One that is not subject to the President's plenary control.
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,778.047,781.518,But why isn't -- so why aren't they subject to the President's plenary control?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,781.518,790.373,"Because of Humphrey's Executor and because of the removal provisions, which pose very serious removal restrictions on the President's ability to control the SEC."
2009.08-861,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,790.373,790.906,But you just--
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,790.906,791.34,The SEC.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,805.216,807.116,"It is silent, and -- but it still--"
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,807.116,807.752,It's silent.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,807.752,808.218,--Well--
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,808.218,809.052,"Then, in other words--"
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,809.052,818.608,I don't think the government will think it has achieved a great victory if it comes out of this with the proposition that the SEC is not an independent regulatory agency.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,821.31,822.678,--They have not taken that position.
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,822.678,823.495,--But that was not what I have asked.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,823.495,823.945,I know.
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,824.695,825.145,I know.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,828.581,828.916,--Yes.
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,828.916,831.132,And the answer to my -- my question was--
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,831.132,832.117,There is--
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,832.117,844.691,"--is there anything in the law, as far as you know, any statute, that says that the President cannot remove a commissioner or the chairman of the SEC but for cause?"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,844.691,845.191,--Yes.
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,845.191,846.96,The answer is there is something?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,846.96,847.377,Yes.
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,847.377,848.393,Where -- where is that?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,851.062,859.101,"It's -- they're given 5-year terms, so obviously if you have a term of 5 years, there is no removal provision."
2009.08-861,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,867.707,869.274,I thought that both sides--
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,869.274,869.607,The Court--
2009.08-861,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,869.607,874.544,"--I thought that both sides agreed that there is no statute, everybody agrees to that."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,888.602,892.07,"--Yes, with -- pursuant -- yes, for cause, but--"
2009.08-861,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,892.07,893.522,Even though there's no statute that says anything either way.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,893.522,895.707,--And the reason we--
2009.08-861,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,895.707,897.807,For cause would be short of the 5-year term.

2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,908.781,913.502,"""For cause"" doesn't mean for failure to obey the President's instructions, does it?"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,913.502,918.371,"--Not under Humphrey's Executor, which made it quite clear that the President had no--"
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,918.371,923.291,"That's why it's called an independent regulatory agency, because it's not subject to presidential control."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,923.291,923.808,--Right.
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,923.808,926.243,"I don't agree with that, but I mean, you do agree."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,937.034,938.167,And I will--
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,938.167,941.569,--what the President might expect he can do or not.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,944.771,947.306,"--It may not be hard law, but--"
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,947.306,951.544,"Well but if it's not hard law, then I wonder."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,951.544,952.227,--Well--
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,952.227,953.694,"I mean, that's why I asked the question."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,955.246,963.352,"--Well, if Your Honor wants to infer at-will removal of the SEC, that would be effectively overruling Humphrey's Executor."
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,964.168,964.668,Why?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,967.804,968.42,--Well--
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,968.42,974.374,"--There was a provision, which we know, that said the President cannot remove an FTC commissioner but for cause."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,976.41,981.563,"--No, you've been entirely right, but Humphrey's Executor didn't focus on the removal provision."
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1001.643,1002.21,I'd love to say that.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1003.16,1006.095,"--I'm not going to stand in your way, because that would obviously--"
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1012.032,1014.451,It would render the board unconstitutional?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1014.451,1014.934,"--Yes, because--"
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1014.934,1033.845,"If an executive appointee who is a superior officer of the United States appoints an inferior officer, which inferior officer can be removed only for cause -- I mean, my goodness -- I can -- there are lots of shapes and sizes."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1037.08,1052.759,"--Well, Your Honor, if the President called up the head of the SEC and said, I want you to seek sanctions against the chairman of Exxon, under the traditional understanding of Humphrey's Executor the SEC commissioner would not be beholden to follow the President's direction."
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1082.178,1083.978,This is not an argument you have made anyway.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1085.811,1086.93,Yes.
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1086.93,1087.43,Thank you.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1087.43,1101.94,"And in terms of that basic argument, he cannot control, for example, the appointment of the board members, which he could with respect to officers over whom he exercises."
2009.08-861,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1112.378,1117.882,--Is it unconstitutional for the President not to be able to appoint an inferior officer?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1117.882,1119.632,--Not an inferior officer.
2009.08-861,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1122.398,1126.119,Assuming we don't accept your characterization of them?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1126.119,1128.352,"--Then I have two other arguments, Your Honor."
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1146.08,1148.382,I hope your case doesn't rest on Freytag.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1150.151,1150.634,--So do I.
2009.08-861,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1162.125,1164.094,And the brief.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1170.164,1186.173,"The Appointments Clause is designed to achieve accountability, and even when you are not talking about presidential advice and consent positions, the way we achieve that accountability is by vesting it, in the words of the dissenting opinion, in ""the President's direct lieutenant""."
2009.08-861,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1220.264,1230.452,"Does that mean, Mr. Carvin, that the SEC cannot appoint heads of -- heads of its divisions?"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1237.975,1239.525,"--That would be true, and--"
2009.08-861,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1239.525,1242.11,So -- but if the SEC can't appoint--
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1242.11,1245.479,"--No, they can't appoint inferior officers."
2009.08-861,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1246.596,1250.616,"--Yes, so what are -- so what are the heads of the various divisions of the SEC?"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1250.616,1258.806,"--The board and the SEC say they are not inferior officers, because they do not under Freytag have any specific statutory authorization."
2009.08-861,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1263.608,1275.566,Aren't there -- aren't there people within the independent regulatory commissions that have jobs comparable to people who are in the departments--
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1275.566,1276.518,--Yes.
2009.08-861,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1276.518,1278.301,--that the head of the department can appoint?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1284.837,1286.306,There are two differences.
2009.08-861,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1307.37,1314.024,"But -- but the question is -- I assume it's the follow-up question that Justice Ginsburg is interested in -- under your view of the case, why is that lawful?"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1314.024,1318.778,"No, it would only be unlawful if they were inferior officers."
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1328.483,1329.2,I don't understand that.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1333.354,1333.67,"--No, no."
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1334.187,1334.854,Oh.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1335.972,1340.007,And the argument for them being employees that the board has advanced is that they're -- that they're--
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1340.007,1340.607,I wish you had said that.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1343.592,1346.328,"--If I am scaring you, I'm not doing my job--"
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1346.328,1349.363,"You're saying they are not inferior officers and also not principal officers, but merely employees?"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1349.363,1350.146,--Merely employees.
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.146,1354.498,And who appoints -- who appoints the inferior officers at the -- at the SEC?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1354.498,1355.35,"Well, that's my other point."
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1361.504,1363.354,All those appointments are presumably invalid.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1363.354,1365.972,"--all those appointments are unconstitutional, so under their theory--"
2009.08-861,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1365.972,1366.356,That would be a shame.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1366.356,1374.276,"--since the chairman didn't appoint any -- the general counsel, the heads of any of the departments, all of them are unconstitutional."
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1374.276,1376.045,Does the chairman serve as a chairman for a fixed term?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1376.045,1378.33,Not as chairman.
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1378.33,1378.746,No?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1378.913,1379.096,He just has--
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1379.096,1385.834,"So, therefore, what you had said before would not apply to the chairman, that is to say: The President can remove him at will--"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1385.834,1386.934,--Not--
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1386.934,1392.136,"--There is no statute to the contrary; he does not serve for a fixed term, and so you cannot imply that."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1394.438,1394.804,--But this statute doesn't--
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1394.804,1407.496,"--can remove him at will -- you do not have what you would call the gearing into play, this somewhat mechanical jurisprudence, of what's an independent agency."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1407.496,1411.465,"--No, he can remove the chairman at his pleasure, which -- but not a commissioner."
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1413.751,1417.803,"So you are saying that the chairman, not the commissioner, is the person who does the appointing?"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1417.803,1419.655,We argue that.
2009.08-861,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1421.537,1422.071,Okay.
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1422.071,1423.487,--the commissioner does the appointing.
2009.08-861,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1459.646,1466.883,"So this whole thing would be constitutional if, instead of giving the appointing power to the commission, they had given it to the chairman?"
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1466.883,1493.117,"--No, because we believe they are principal officers for three reasons under Edmond: They run their own shop; the commission has no control over the officers on the board, since it can only remove them in these extraordinarily narrow situations; and as we have discussed at length before, it can only review part of its work product, whereas the appeals court judges in Edmond, all of their work product was subject to review."
2009.08-861,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1506.441,1508.71,Isn't that a highly unlikely scenario?
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1512.995,1524.017,"--Well, it would work perfectly if the board was an independent, autonomous entity that was not subject to the plenary control of the SEC, and that's exactly how the Senate report described it."
2009.08-861,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1590.745,1591.845,"Thank you, Mr. Carvin."
2009.08-861,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1591.845,1592.828,Thank you.
2009.08-861,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1592.828,1605.338,General Kagan.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1605.338,1628.786,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Resolution of this case follows from a simple syllogism, and it is this: The President has constitutionally sufficient control over the SEC; the SEC has comprehensive control over the Accounting Board; therefore, the President has constitutionally sufficient control over the Accounting Board."
2009.08-861,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1631.655,1632.088,Excuse me.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1663.691,1666.809,"--Well, I -- I think not, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-861,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1687.187,1697.495,"The chairman, which is -- which is -- which is the -- what should I say -- the knife that the President has into the SEC, has no role in the control of this board."
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1697.495,1703.566,--The -- the chair has the same role that he has with respect to pretty much everything else that the SEC does.
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1704.832,1705.268,No.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1708.22,1711.755,--Subject to the control -- subject to the approval of the commission.
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1712.405,1718.659,So you think -- you think a -- a veto power is the same as an original -- original power?
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1718.659,1722.73,"--Well, in fact, the commission could do the exact same thing in this case."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1739.339,1739.805,"Well, let's say--"
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1739.805,1740.139,--of its staff.
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1740.139,1747.743,--Let's say that the -- let's say that the board issues -- demands documents from a particular company.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1751.562,1758.466,The SEC has full control over the investigative and inspection function of the board.
2009.08-861,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1786.034,1791.854,"Excuse me, but, you know, Congress -- Congress can change the statutory authority of any agency just like that."
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1795.655,1799.441,"--Well, it's certainly part of Congress's control mechanisms."
2009.08-861,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1807.213,1818.421,I'm not sure that -- that the ability to take away responsibility for an agency -- from an agency is the same as controlling what authority that agency does exercise.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1819.921,1821.706,--And I think that the SEC has both.
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1844.786,1850.873,Will that be consistent -- do you think that will be consistent with the intent of Congress in establishing the PCAOB?
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1850.873,1862.83,"--I -- I do think it would be consistent with the intent of Congress, Mr. Chief Justice, because the intent of Congress was to place the Accounting Board under the extremely close and comprehensive supervision of the SEC."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1876.423,1885.529,"Why did -- just out of -- I guess maybe it's not important, but why did the -- why did Congress set up a separate board if it's going to be entirely controlled by the SEC?"
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1885.529,1889.831,"--I think it is important, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think that there were a few reasons."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1941.43,1952.221,"Before we get -- before you get too far into that, of those first two things, is there any reason Congress couldn't have achieved those same objectives by establishing the PCAOB as a division within the SEC?"
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1952.221,1955.006,"--Well, I -- I think so."
2009.08-861,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1975.754,1978.956,"But that's -- that's the history and tradition of this board, which isn't very long."
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1997.53,2033.053,"--Well, I -- I -- I do think, Justice Kennedy, that -- that the way this board is set up, the statutory scheme and structure, makes it clear that the SEC has comprehensive authority not just over the rulemaking, but over the investigative and inspection activities of the board; that no -- no sanction arising from an investigation can be issued except if the board agrees; that no inspection report can be issued except if the -- excuse me -- except if the SEC agrees."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2052.866,2062.572,Does it have consequences for public companies subject to the board if it refuses to turn over documents requested by this -- this board?
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2062.572,2076.646,"Well, for -- for -- for public companies for -- not for the accounting firms in general, but for their public company clients, any subpoena would have to come, as Justice Ginsburg rightly said--"
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2076.646,2079.515,"Oh, I know, but presumably you only get a subpoena when people don't cooperate."
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2079.515,2080.265,--That -- that's correct.
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2086.335,2087.085,And what happens if they don't?
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2087.085,2102.01,"--I -- I think that the board would go to the -- to the SEC for a subpoena, ask the SEC for a subpoena, and the SEC would choose whether to grant that subpoena and whether to allow the kind of investigation that the board wants."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2102.01,2110.533,Are there any other -- are there any consequences from the company's refusal short of -- that would not require the board to get a subpoena?
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2110.533,2114.485,Are there any other consequences for the public company?
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2114.485,2116.318,"In the absence of the subpoena, if nothing happens?"
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2116.318,2118.103,--I -- I -- I believe that that's the case.
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2127.959,2134.613,Is it -- does it have a consequence as a practical matter for the company if it doesn't comply with a request from this board?
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2134.613,2139.517,"Well, the board does not regulate the public companies themselves."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2156.062,2162.299,So there are in fact collateral consequences that take place without any involvement by the SEC?
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2162.299,2171.905,"Well, I -- I -- I think again the SEC could change any of the rules that govern inspections, any of the rules that govern investigations."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2171.905,2186.431,"So if you had a statute here that said, look, if you don't comply with the board's request for documents, your authorities will be suspended, and if that were the statute, you would say, well, that's okay, because the SEC can always change that rule."
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2186.431,2194.085,I think that -- that the relationship between the SEC and the board has to be looked at as a whole.
2009.08-861,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2202.739,2216.264,"General Kagan, I thought that -- the Chief asked a question, he posed a sanction, and I thought that any sanction the board wants to impose has to be approved by the SEC?"
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2216.264,2217.214,"Well, that's exactly right."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2219.866,2229.674,"I'm sorry, I asked you whether there were any consequences from the failure of the company to turn over documents; and is your answer that there are no consequences whatever?"
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2229.674,2242.082,"--There are no consequences with respect to the failure of public companies -- not the accounting firms, but public companies -- to turn over documents absent a subpoena, which the SEC needs to issue."
2009.08-861,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2242.082,2247.803,"As a practical matter, does the President have any ability to control what the board does?"
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2247.803,2256.241,"I think, Justice Alito, the President has the exact same ability that the President has with respect to every other aspect of the SEC's operations."
2009.08-861,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2257.458,2257.791,"No, that's--"
2009.08-861,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2257.791,2258.458,"Well, why is that--"
2009.08-861,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2258.458,2259.124,--But that's not true.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2261.76,2262.76,--And--
2009.08-861,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2262.76,2266.48,And he cannot -- he cannot remove the commissioners.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2269.349,2273.734,"--Well, it's the commissioners that govern all aspects of the SEC's operations."
2009.08-861,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2281.323,2282.573,"--Well, let me give you an example."
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2289.86,2292.845,Excuse me.
2009.08-861,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2295.278,2296.63,And they -- did they decide that themselves?
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2296.63,2299.599,Subject to the review of the commission.
2009.08-861,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2301.765,2306.003,Suppose the President reads about this and he says: This is outrageous; I want to change it.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2308.788,2309.588,"Well, I think he does--"
2009.08-861,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2309.588,2314.359,--remove that -- remove the SEC commissioners unless they take action against the board?
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2314.359,2325.547,"--I think he does everything that he would do with respect to any other SEC function, is that he or some member of his staff would call the chair or would call other commissioners and say: I have a problem with this."
2009.08-861,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2325.547,2326.766,Would you please change it?
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2327.582,2329.368,Would you please change it -- and -- and--
2009.08-861,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2335.955,2337.221,I could do that.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2339.74,2343.125,"--Justice Scalia, that's Humphrey's Executor."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2351.545,2351.981,"Yes, yes."
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2351.981,2353.914,--That's a 70-year-old precedent.
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2353.914,2354.364,Right.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2371.876,2380.064,"I -- I understand the temptation to say something like, well, we don't really much like Humphrey's Executor, but we are stuck with it, but not an inch further."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2380.064,2381.997,I didn't say anything bad about Humphrey's Executor.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2382.597,2383.016,But -- but--
2009.08-861,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2383.016,2384.132,"I did, I did."
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2387.051,2388.401,--But this in--
2009.08-861,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2388.401,2390.836,"We did overrule it, by the way, in -- in Morrison, didn't we?"
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2390.836,2392.622,--But two points.
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2401.727,2402.293,What is -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2406.529,2413.516,--The removal authority of the SEC with respect to -- with respect to board officers is a for-cause removal limitation.
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2413.516,2413.833,All right.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2418.837,2422.122,Let's assume that that's correct.
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2422.122,2430.827,So you need to rely on Morrison to make the limitations on what the SEC can do with respect to the board constitutional.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2430.827,2431.327,I think--
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2431.327,2436.814,And you need to rely on Humphrey's Executor to make the limitations on what the President can tell the SEC constitutional.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2436.814,2439.097,"--Mr. Chief Justice, removal is just a tool."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2454.442,2455.608,"Oh, no, no, because you have got an extra layer there."
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2488.58,2493.198,--But that for-cause provision is surrounded by a panoply of other control mechanisms--
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2493.198,2494.9,"Which one are we talking about, the first one or the second one?"
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2494.9,2504.173,"--The -- the for-cause provision on the board members is surrounded by a panoply of other control mechanisms which function as a complete substitute, which give the SEC--"
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2504.173,2506.156,"Well, let's just talk -- a practical example."
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2520.182,2530.621,"--Well, they can pass a rule that says no, you can't get the -- the documents of company X, and then when the board members go ahead and try to get the documents of company X--"
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2530.621,2530.921,Can they say--
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2530.921,2531.721,--they can remove them.
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2531.721,2532.423,--you are fired?
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2536.942,2538.477,I think that they effectively can.
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2549.701,2552.251,"The easiest way to do it is to pick up the phone, not by promulgating a rule."
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2552.251,2556.771,--I said the most legally secure way to do it would be to do it that way.
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2563.842,2566.644,Can the President pick up the phone and fire the SEC commissioners?
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2566.644,2576.269,"--The President can pick up the phone and fire the SEC commissioners for cause, however ""cause"" has been defined."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2576.269,2583.505,"He thinks -- he thinks they -- the board should be getting the documents from the other company, and the SEC thinks they can't."
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2592.325,2600.598,So now the SEC has given the board one order and the President doesn't like the order that the SEC has given to the board?
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2600.598,2601.217,Right.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2601.217,2605.834,"Again, the President has the same level of control over the SEC as he has with respect to anything else."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2607.37,2607.87,I'm not worried if it's the same.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2608.736,2610.572,"Well, but that's Humphrey's Executor."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2612.172,2612.622,Right.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2613.122,2614.624,And the question is whether this goes any further.
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2614.624,2618.076,--It goes further because you've got to rely on the SEC to get to the board.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2620.178,2636.972,"You always have to rely on the SEC to do anything, to supervise anybody in its field of operations, whether it's the SEC's own staff or whether it's the board members, who stand in essentially the same relationship to the SEC commissioners as the own SEC staff does."
2009.08-861,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2636.972,2644.059,"Well, do you dispute the proposition that the more layers of for-cause removal you add, the -- the less control the President has?"
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2645.093,2648.78,"Justice Alito, I think it all depends."
2009.08-861,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2675.93,2690.774,"Well, what do -- what do you say in response to their formal argument that heads of departments are those people whom the President has at-will control over, like the Secretary of Defense, and Freytag is support for that."
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2713.371,2742.623,"Well, Justice Scalia, who doesn't much like Humphrey's Executor, nevertheless wrote a brilliant opinion in Freytag saying that in fact independent agencies were departments, and -- and -- and so that commissioners of the SEC would be principal officers, their appointees would be inferior officers, if -- if those appointees were subject to the direction and supervision of the principals in exactly the way Justice Scalia said was necessary in the Edmond case."
2009.08-861,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2743.408,2744.175,Yes.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2748.027,2748.677,"--No, no, no."
2009.08-861,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2751.412,2752.431,I see.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2752.431,2769.624,"--whether the independent agencies were departments for purposes of the Appointments Clause and, indeed, in reserving that question, suggested that they thought that the independent agencies, so-called, were a very different kind of creature than the small, specialized units such as the Tax Court."
2009.08-861,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2770.392,2784.735,I want to ask -- I want to ask one thing: You want us to imply or find -- or you want us to infer from the statute that there's a power in the President to remove SEC commissioners for cause?
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2787.319,2798.643,"--Justice Kennedy, the conventional understanding, really, ever -- ever since Humphrey's Executor, is that SEC commissioners are subject to a for-cause removal provision."
2009.08-861,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2799.559,2799.959,All right.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2814.986,2825.543,"--I think that -- if I understand the question correctly, I think that the -- the implication about--"
2009.08-861,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2825.543,2828.578,"I mean, if there is a removal power implied, why isn't it removal for all purposes?"
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2832.73,2848.124,"--Well, I think that the understanding about the SEC commissioners is that the SEC commissioners were, essentially, the same as the FTC commissioners, which, under -- which, under Humphrey's, were removable only for cause, and as I believe--"
2009.08-861,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2848.124,2850.176,But that's because the statute required it.
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2850.176,2868.62,"--Yes, but -- you're exactly right, and it's a -- it's a perplexity of this law, but for many, many decades, everybody has assumed that the SEC commissioners are subject to the same for-cause removal provision, and the government has not contested that in this case, nor has Mr. Carvin."
2009.08-861,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2868.62,2878.761,"General Kagan, the government argues here that the head of department is all of the commissioners."
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2894.271,2900.09,"No, they're not, because all those appointments are made subject to the approval of the commission."
2009.08-861,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2900.09,2901.49,"Well, that's something quite different."
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2911.832,2929.36,"Well, I think practice in this regard has changed in different administrations, but if you look at the amicus brief that was filed by the former chairmen of the SEC, they make clear that in fact the commission has ultimate authority over each and every appointment."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2929.36,2936.098,What do they have to say about the theory that the SEC commissioners can be removed by the President?
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2936.098,2941.251,"I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, that nobody has contested that question."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2941.251,2942.934,And you are not contesting it?
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2942.934,2957.444,"And we are not contesting the question that the SEC commissioners, themselves, are removed by the President for cause under, I would say, a very broad for-cause provision, in the way that Bowsher suggested, not something that's niggling and technical."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2957.444,2958.694,"Thank you, General."
2009.08-861,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2958.694,2960.144,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-861,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2960.144,2970.666,Mr. Lamken.
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2970.666,2977.07,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The SEC has pervasive authority over every aspect of the board's operations."
2009.08-861,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3003.303,3005.037,I thought -- so you disagree with General Kagan?
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3011.993,3017.111,"--Independent of the congressional appropriations process, not independent of the SEC."
2009.08-861,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3036.608,3053.118,"Do you know any other agency composed of inferior officers that has the power to acquire its own budget, as this board does, by simply assessing a tax upon the people that it regulates?"
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3053.118,3058.105,"In fact, this board doesn't have that power, because it can only do so as the SEC allows."
2009.08-861,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.692,3065.208,"The SEC can overturn it, but it's up to the board -- the board can do it."
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3077.182,3086.39,"--Well, there's a bunch of other similar entities, such as the SIPC and the like, that assess fees, and many of their officers are appointed by department heads, rather than the -- than the President."
2009.08-861,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3099.365,3116.076,"Well, the board can act, and the SEC can, I suppose, retroactively veto their actions, but the SEC doesn't propose what actions the board takes, actions that can have significant, devastating consequences for the regulated bodies."
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3116.076,3117.292,"Well, precisely the opposite."
2009.08-861,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3119.944,3121.044,I'm not talking about rules.
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3136.554,3139.422,--And the SEC staff can do precisely the same thing.
2009.08-861,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3161.085,3163.351,But you can say the same -- you can say the same thing about Congress.
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3175.492,3186.614,"Well, Congress would have to do that by legislation, subject to veto by the President, and in fact this is precisely the type of control that powerful executives regularly exercise."
2009.08-861,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3202.206,3203.475,Is there any other--
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3203.475,3205.658,"--and it can issue rules requiring start, stop, or obey my commands."
2009.08-861,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3206.158,3214.764,"--Is there any other situation in the vast federal bureaucracy, where you have this two-level situation that we have here?"
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3214.764,3215.764,--Oh--
2009.08-861,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3215.764,3219.316,"In other words, the President can't remove the SEC commissioners at will."
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3227.053,3240.379,"--Mr. Chief Justice, of course, we view rescinding an officer's authority and paycheck as being exactly like rescinding the officer's position, but if you are going to look at formal removal authority, that exists throughout the United States government."
2009.08-861,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3241.812,3243.747,"What -- well, give me an example."
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3243.747,3250.234,"--1,100 administrative law judges, right now, which are for-cause removed operating in independent agencies with for-cause removal by the President."
2009.08-861,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3260.423,3276.801,"But we are talking -- we are talking about independent or quasi-independent agencies, and I understood Solicitor General Kagan to say that it's quite all right with an independent agency for the President to phone them on an ongoing basis and say, do this, and do that."
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3281.186,3283.288,"--Well, Your Honor, I would think that--"
2009.08-861,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3283.288,3285.924,"Call them on a routine basis, to supervise what they are doing?"
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3285.924,3297.798,"--If the -- if the response from the agency falled out -- falled out -- fell outside the range of reasonable policy responses the agency could adopt, then that might amount to inefficiency, neglect, or malfeasance."
2009.08-861,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3298.982,3306.32,"Well, they -- they -- this board has authority to -- to tax those people it regulates, to issue subpoenas, and so forth."
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3306.32,3307.187,--Right.
2009.08-861,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3307.187,3313.474,"But this isn't subject to the operations of the President, if he has to go through an independent agency."
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3321.163,3330.536,"Your Honor, the President has the same control over the SEC's supervision over the board that he has over everything else that falls within the SEC's jurisdiction."
2009.08-861,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3330.536,3331.953,"Which is nothing, which is nothing."
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3331.953,3332.471,With--
2009.08-861,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3332.471,3348.914,"I -- when I was OLC, I would -- I advised the President, you can't interfere with -- I think, if the President called up the FCC and said, I want you to rule this way, I want this kind of a rule from the FCC, I think there would be an impeachment motion in Congress."
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3348.914,3349.664,--But that -- that--
2009.08-861,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3349.664,3352.349,Congress set up that agency to be independent from the President.

2009.08-861,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3364.656,3368.208,"No, no, Humphrey's -- Humphrey's Executor was not a specific issue."
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3370.16,3373.512,--I'm sorry.

2009.08-861,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3378.915,3379.682,--I -- I understand that.
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3379.682,3382.867,"--is traditionally understood to be inefficiency, neglect, or malfeasance in office."
2009.08-861,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3397.894,3398.31,The formulation--
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3398.31,3400.16,"--regulatory authority, but not the ability to choose its--"
2009.08-861,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3400.16,3400.677,--The formulation -- excuse me.
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3400.677,3401.396,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-861,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3401.396,3414.32,"The formulation that you use and your friend the Solicitor General have used -- has used is that they have the same authority that they have over every other independent agency, but I'm -- it's very hard to find out exactly what that authority is."
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3420.89,3430.615,"Our position is the same as the Solicitor General's, because I represent inferior officers whose positions are controlled by the SEC who are principal officers, and their lawyer is the Solicitor General."
2009.08-861,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3431.348,3432.731,What do you understand that position to be?
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3432.731,3438.935,--The position I understand the Solicitor General to have is that the traditional understanding of the SEC is that it is an independent agency.
2009.08-861,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3439.471,3448.327,"So the President -- I guess I'm following up on Justice Kennedy's question -- the President cannot call them and say, take this particular action in this particular case."
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3448.327,3455.564,"--I don't think he would be able to enforce that in -- by removal, except--"
2009.08-861,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3455.564,3457.081,But it's okay for him to ask them?
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3463.837,3465.853,"--Justice Scalia, the Treasury Department--"
2009.08-861,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3465.853,3466.32,Do you know of any instance where that has happened?
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3466.32,3487.785,"--works closely with the SEC and tells the SEC precisely what it thinks the SEC should do on a regular basis, but the difference is the SEC turns around and can tell the board exactly what it wants the board to do and back it up by taking away their salaries, threatening to rescind the enforcement authority, announcing rules that say you may start, stop, alter investigations upon our direction or the direction of the chief accountant."
2009.08-861,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3492.77,3495.186,But what does the Treasury Department tell the SEC to do?
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3495.186,3500.757,"--Well, it issues recommendations, for example, on how it wants the SEC to handle, for example, international aspects."
2009.08-861,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3508.077,3508.661,It takes the initiative?
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3510.796,3511.163,--Pardon.
2009.08-861,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3511.163,3515.683,The SEC does not request that information; the Treasury Department just butts in?

2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3520.185,3521.269,--and they work closely together--

2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3521.92,3522.42,"--and I can't tell you exactly how they work, but--"
2009.08-861,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3522.42,3525.722,--It's one thing for the SEC to ask the Treasury Department's view.
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3528.757,3533.728,"--I -- I do believe that -- that other agencies do butt in all the time, and the question is--"
2009.08-861,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3533.728,3534.278,What's the reason--
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3534.278,3534.911,--what's the control?
2009.08-861,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3534.911,3536.061,--What is the reason for this?
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3579.44,3583.225,"I think the first half is, What's a department?"
2009.08-861,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3583.558,3584.475,I'm not interested in that.
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3584.475,3584.958,--Okay.
2009.08-861,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3584.958,3587.093,I'm interested in -- I'm developing--
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3587.093,3592.164,The justifications for the limitations on the removal of the officers of the board?
2009.08-861,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3592.164,3592.597,--That's right.
2009.08-861,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3592.597,3593.264,Right.
2009.08-861,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3635.374,3635.941,"Thank you, Mr. Lamken."
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3640.228,3652.619,"The first thing I'd like to address is the Solicitor General's syllogism that because the President can control the SEC, somehow he can control those whom the SEC regulates."
2009.08-861,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3673.881,3678.167,But there is -- there is -- it was working okay with the Stock Exchange.
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3702.984,3712.173,"--No, that's entirely true, Justice Ginsburg, and the point is they could have accomplished all that and made the board members appointed and removable by the President, if -- if--"
2009.08-861,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3712.173,3724.648,"How about if they -- would it work if the board members were proposed by the SEC, by SEC commissioners, subject to the approval of the President?"
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3725.348,3732.252,"--Well, I -- no, because the word ""approval"", as earlier colloquy has suggested, is--"
2009.08-861,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3732.252,3732.835,--But the nominee would be -- by a nomination.
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3734.885,3744.226,"--The President needs the unfettered ability to appoint principal officers, not to have some subordinate agency tell him who he can appoint."
2009.08-861,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3750.964,3751.647,"So, you--"
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3751.647,3752.915,They can't give you -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-861,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3752.915,3753.981,"--You were -- I'm sorry, then."
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3767.489,3773.829,"In the same way they have strong, effective oversight of the communications industry and what the FTC does and the SEC."
2009.08-861,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3784.768,3785.553,So it would be totally separate.
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3796.675,3805.014,"--You could have exactly the same relationship between the SEC and this agency, which I think is not under the wing of the SEC now."
2009.08-861,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3810.566,3819.588,"Well, I would have -- Judge Kavanaugh has suggested there are two ways to cure this problem: One, have the President appoint and remove; and the other thing, make it truly subordinate to the SEC."
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3836.864,3840.168,So why have they created any independence if they really wanted them to be subordinate?
2009.08-861,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3897.255,3897.872,Say it again--
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3897.872,3898.455,--Okay.
2009.08-861,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3899.005,3900.024,--We don't assume that they--
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3900.024,3903.909,--That they have powers they don't have simply because they can reach out and get it.
2009.08-861,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3948.205,3956.876,"We don't know -- we don't know what's fictional and what is not here, because you came in, and you don't have a particular case."
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3956.876,3957.826,--I do have--
2009.08-861,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3957.826,3977.957,"Do you have another instance where Congress set up a scheme, and without having a particular case of an individual who has been hurt, you come in and say: We might sometime be hurt by this, so we want the whole thing knocked down in the absence of any concrete case."
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3977.957,3989.115,"--Justice Ginsburg, we know exactly what the SEC and the Solicitor General think about the interrelationship of the Constitution and the statute, because they have expressed it in briefs from the district court on up."
2009.08-861,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4059.958,4065.012,"If we took away -- I mean, one big point was the double for-cause."
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,4081.855,4089.342,"--Well, I don't think you can sever that provision from the statute, because I don't -- I think you'd be rewriting the statute and re-striking the balance that Congress did."
2009.08-861,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4100.298,4107.137,"So, it's not the double for -- the double for-cause isn't, in your judgment, what sinks this statute?"
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,4107.137,4108.287,"--Well, no."
2009.08-861,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4125.098,4127.781,May I ask one -- one narrow question?
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,4144.06,4154.431,"--Your -- I'm -- I'm to assume that the Appointments Clause problem -- if they are inferior officers, again, I have an Appointments Clause problem, because they are appointed by somebody who is not department head, i.e., the SEC commissioner."
2009.08-861,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4157.467,4157.935,Yes.
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,4157.935,4158.268,Okay.
2009.08-861,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4182.9,4194.108,"But your answer to my question is that even if they are inferior officers and the other conditions have been met, if the Commission had unrestricted power of removal, the statute would still be unconstitutional."
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,4194.108,4195.891,Principally because they are not subject--
2009.08-861,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4195.891,4196.991,The answer is yes is what I just--
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,4196.991,4198.324,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-861,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4199.926,4200.659,--Yes.
2009.08-861,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,4201.193,4208.032,"--They are not subject to the chairman's control, unlike the SEC general counsel, and they have statutory duties entirely distinct from the commission."
