1975.74-5566,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.95,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 74-5566, Barrett against the United States."
1975.74-5566,0,43293,thomas_a_schaffer,,17.063,19.704,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-5566,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,232.393,252.822,"But you say that Congress has no power to forbid the possession of a firearm shipped at any time in the past in those terms in interstate commerce, the prohibition being limited to certain categories, including convicted felons?"
1975.74-5566,0,43293,thomas_a_schaffer,,252.822,254.816,"No sir, that is not our contention at all."
1975.74-5566,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,254.816,258.724,"So you say that the Congress could do it, but they did not do it here?"
1975.74-5566,0,43293,thomas_a_schaffer,,258.724,260.245,Yes Sir that is exactly what we are saying.
1975.74-5566,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,260.245,273.808,"Well, you concede that Congress could make it an offense to buy a pistol that had been in the State of Kentucky for 10 years if 10 years previously that had been shipped in interstate commerce?"
1975.74-5566,0,43293,thomas_a_schaffer,,273.808,283.04,"Your Honor, that is not part of my argument, but I contend that that is most likely what Title VII of the Gun Control Act has done."
1975.74-5566,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,283.04,288.783,You do not think there is any problem as to Congress’ authority to do something like I described?
1975.74-5566,0,43293,thomas_a_schaffer,,288.783,308.393,"I would say that Congress has certain limitations as case history is developed, but in this instance, if a gun can be determined to have affected commerce as the cases have reported in the Title VII situations, I feel that that Congress does have that power."
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,1810.03,1813.687,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-5566,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1910.542,1916.838,Do you not perceive any constitutional difficulties at all with reading the statute that way?
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,1916.838,1920.124,"No, Mr. Justice Brennan we do not."
1975.74-5566,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1920.124,1920.795,I am not Mr. Justice Brennan.
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,1920.795,1922.807,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I apologize."
1975.74-5566,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1951.838,1952.444,Mr. Reich.
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,1952.444,1954.046,"Yes, Mr. Justice Powell?"
1975.74-5566,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1954.046,1960.756,Could the government have prosecuted this defendant under Title VII?
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,1960.756,1963.582,The government could indeed have prosecuted them under Title VII.
1975.74-5566,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1963.582,1970.318,Is there any explanation why he did not in light of a previous interpretation of that section in Bass?
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,1970.318,1973.634,None that I know of Your Honor.
1975.74-5566,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1984.404,1988.295,"He obviously then had not read the Bass opinion, had he?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,1988.295,2054.777,"The Bass opinion we would contend Mr. Justice Stewart, did not authoritatively construe Title IV which was to become Section 922 (h) as being limited to direct interstate receipts and if you enable me to get to the Bass opinion in just one moment, I would like to state that had the government intended to limit the scope of Section 922 (h) to direct interstate receipts as petitioner urges, it presumably, in the Gun Control Act, would have use language to that effect, such as Section 922 (j) which you find on page 12(a) of our appendix which states that it shall be unlawful to receive a stolen firearm which is moving as or which is a part of or which constitutes interstate commerce or Section 922 (k) which is also on page 12(a) of our appendix which states that it shall be unlawful to receive in commerce any firearm which has had the importers or manufacturer’s serial number removed."
1975.74-5566,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2151.913,2155.269,"Well, is the man who sold his weapon, is he an indictee?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2155.269,2156.325,I am sorry Your Honor.
1975.74-5566,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2156.325,2159.964,The man who sold this gun did he violate any law by not getting --
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2159.964,2164.616,The man who sold this gun should have found out.
1975.74-5566,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2165.87,2170.417,"My question was, was he guilty of any crime in doing that?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2170.417,2186.458,He was not guilty of knowingly selling a firearm to a convicted felon as 922 (d) provides because he did not follow the required procedure and have the purchaser fill out a treasury form 4477.
1975.74-5566,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2199.405,2202.22,What has been done to him?
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2202.22,2204.502,He was warned.
1975.74-5566,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2223.335,2226.406,(Inaudible)
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2226.406,2234.26,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall as far as I am aware, all these provisions are being enforced."
1975.74-5566,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2245.214,2247.631,He goes in and says I got a half a price for gun.
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2252.631,2255.898,"Well, I would say that it is not alright."
1975.74-5566,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2272.319,2276.839,Is it a criminal offense to violate the treasury regulations?
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2276.839,2280.547,I simply am not aware or not sure of that answer Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1975.74-5566,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2280.547,2286.25,"Well, what would he had been prosecuted for, if it is not a criminal offense to violate the treasury?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2286.25,2292.533,"Well, if is not a criminal offense to violate this treasury regulations he would not have been prosecuted."
1975.74-5566,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2298.551,2299.487,What difference does it make?
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2301.271,2302.372,"Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1975.74-5566,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2371.018,2373.047,Where in the record is that this is neglect?
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2376.377,2381.293,"Mr. Justice Marshall, the dealer was questioned on the stand."
1975.74-5566,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2413.11,2417.027,"If he had filled it out, we would not have this case, would we?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2417.027,2421.544,"If he had filled it out and if the dealer had looked at it, we would not have this case, that is absolutely correct."
1975.74-5566,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2421.544,2429.508,We would not have the case if both of them non-violated the Act by selling it notwithstanding the disclosure of the conviction?
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2429.508,2431.59,That is conceivable Mr. Justice.
1975.74-5566,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2468.02,2468.99,Mr. Reich.
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2468.99,2469.619,Yes.
1975.74-5566,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2471.806,2473.968,Let me suggest to you.
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2491.092,2514.975,"Under Section 922 (g) which I believe is set out at page 10 (a) of our appendix, under 922 (g), a convicted felon or other category of potentially irresponsible person is barred from shipping or transporting a gun in interstate commerce."
1975.74-5566,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2538.468,2552.227,"You have to bring out as the fact that just the accident of having the gun on the show or not having at all in the shelf, on your opposition’s theory, it would make a difference as to whether the prosecutor is capable of prosecution or not."
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2552.227,2554.691,Absolutely right Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1975.74-5566,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2586.233,2602.857,"Well, if he had that in mind that the statute might well have been written with an insert, known to him to have been shipped in interstate commerce or knowingly receiving?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2602.857,2604.189,That is correct.
1975.74-5566,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2604.189,2607.081,"The scienter factor was left out of the statute, was it not?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2607.081,2628.356,"The scienter is left out of the statute at 922 (h), it is left out of -- scienter enters into one or two other provisions where convicted felons or other individuals are prohibited for instance from knowingly receiving as to one firearm, but you are correct that scienter does not enter into Section 922 (h)."
1975.74-5566,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2628.356,2641.137,"This puts the burden on the purchaser who wants to be careful I suppose on your theory of the case, to inquire whether it is manufactured in Kentucky or elsewhere?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2641.137,2642.187,That is correct.
1975.74-5566,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2655.645,2671.693,"Does that mean that when you take Justice Brennan’s illustration a while ago that if a man in Hartford, Nevada “pistol” manufactured it in New Heaven, Connecticut, he would not be violating a statute, is that it?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2671.693,2686.972,"He could be fairly well sure that he would not be violating the statute, however, there is always the possibility that although manufactured in Connecticut, the firearm had traveled outside the state at some point in its history."
1975.74-5566,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2686.972,2692.476,What if it moved down in interstate train from Hartford to New Heaven?
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2692.476,2711.365,I do not believe that that would violate the statute because the plain words of the statute indicate only that it is illegal to receive a firearm which has been shipped or transported in interstate commerce and presumably that means across a state boundary.
1975.74-5566,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2720.117,2745.166,"What about on page 13(a) Mr. Reich of your brief where you set out 18 U.S.C. appendix 1201 which I believe is the introductory section of Title VII that Congress passed later and there you have a kind of finding that you have in many recent Acts of Congress that Congress finds and declares that the receipt, possession etcetera is a burden on commerce."
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2782.87,2788.159,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, there was a finding in the senate report."
1975.74-5566,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2805.792,2812.331,"Well, is that entitled to the same degree of weight as if it had made its way as you put it into the legislation?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2812.331,2816.035,"No, but it is indicative, I think it is congressional intent as to whether Congress --"
1975.74-5566,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2816.035,2818.397,"It was enacted, is it not?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2818.397,2819.442,As a matter of legislative history --
1975.74-5566,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2819.442,2821.076,It is the opposite.
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2827.888,2849.024,"Well, that may be as a matter of legislative history, however, Mr. Justice Stewart, I think it might be indicative that the Senate did find and declare that the ease with which any person can acquire firearms, including criminals, narcotics addicts, mental defectives, is significant factor in the prevalence of lawlessness."
1975.74-5566,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2884.872,2899.828,"Mr. Reich, the ruling in Title IV with which we are concerned in this case is precisely the words in (Inaudible) that were entitled for when Tot was decided, is that not so?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2899.828,2901.356,That is correct.
1975.74-5566,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2901.356,2932.943,"And certainly, the Court in Tot apparently with the agreement of the government has said reciting what had happened in lower courts, both courts, it held that the offense created by the Act is confined to receipt of the firearms or ammunitions as a part of interstate transportation does not extend to the receipt which is your argument here in an interstate transaction, of such articles which had some prior time have been transported into the state, what are you going to do with that?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2932.943,2934.099,That is right.
1975.74-5566,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2934.099,2935.236,What should we do with it?
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2935.236,2954.2,"Mr. Justice Brennan to be to be sure when Congress enacted the Gun Control Act of 1968 as you point out, it must have been aware to some extent of the Court’s holding in Tot striking down the presumption that was struck down from Section 2 (f) of the Federal Firearms Act which is the predecessor."
1975.74-5566,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2954.2,2958.008,But the Congress was not aware of or ignored?
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2958.008,2980.939,"We would contend that given (a) the plain meaning of the phrase to receive any firearm which has been shipped or transported in interstate commerce plus (b) the fact that in 1943 in the Tot case, this Court did not really focus upon the question of the scope of Section 2 (f) but merely --"
1975.74-5566,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2980.939,2984.89,"Most apparently, your predecessors in the Solicitor General’s Office did."
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,2991.513,2996.998,"Well, I was not alive then[Laughter]"
1975.74-5566,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2996.998,3002.171,"Yes, but can you say in your present brief that the government at that time argued for several pages?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,3002.171,3004.371,It did Mr. Justice White.
1975.74-5566,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3004.371,3024.109,"Can you put your hand here that those words do not to reach what we now heard and furthermore, in both courts, the fact that you have two Courts of Appeals, both courts below held exactly what it said, is that right?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,3024.109,3025.464,Indeed.
1975.74-5566,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3025.464,3036.044,"So you are saying that Congress would have been aware of two Courts of Appeals, the language is not plus the opinions of the Chief Law Enforcement Agency of the United States?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,3036.044,3039.382,We are saying that Congress given the fact that --
1975.74-5566,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3039.382,3043.688,"We know that Congress is not aware of a lot of things that happen around here, that is quite obvious?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,3043.688,3045.245,There is absolutely --
1975.74-5566,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3045.245,3046.868,And that is usually the way we treat these things?
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,3046.868,3049.518,"Well, there is absolutely not indication in any of the legislation history --"
1975.74-5566,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3049.518,3054.784,"We know, but do we not presume that Congress keeps itself familiar with what things that we say around here?"
1975.74-5566,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3054.784,3061.112,The marking of justice is usually is not ignored of what is going on in the Court.
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,3067.257,3071.317,The Department of Justice I assume participated in write-up sessions.
1975.74-5566,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3093.709,3096.565,"Well, this is an issue of statutory construction, is it not?"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,3096.565,3096.998,It is.
1975.74-5566,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3096.998,3100.718,And how frequently do we review which is the statutory construction?
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,3100.718,3102.474,"Well, let me give you an example if I may Your Honor."
1975.74-5566,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3102.474,3105.698,"Well, I (Inaudible) Boys Market, but --"
1975.74-5566,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3105.698,3107.987,"That is a famous case, if you have not heard of it?[Laughter]"
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,3107.987,3110.762,"Yes, I have Mr. Justice White."
1975.74-5566,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3111.495,3114.912,How often outside the situations like Boys Market have we ever done it?
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,3114.912,3122.133,"Well, let me give you an example of Girouard against the United States in which this Court has construed the Naturalization Act."
1975.74-5566,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3122.133,3122.785,What is the name of that?
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,3122.785,3124.205,Girouard against the United States.
1975.74-5566,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3163.153,3169.469,You can suggest to Justice Brennan (Inaudible) [Laughter]
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,3169.469,3171.807,I do not think I would want to do that.
1975.74-5566,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3226.806,3231.273,Congress has not legislated in this area or I will put it as a question.
1975.74-5566,1,40310,robert_b_reich,,3247.607,3253.007,"After Perez, after this Court’s opinion on Perez that is I think an open question."
1975.74-5566,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3296.64,3297.578,Mr. Reich.
