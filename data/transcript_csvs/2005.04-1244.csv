2005.04-1244,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.555,"We'll hear argument first today in Scheidler versus National Organization for Women, and Operation Rescue versus National Organization for Women."
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,10.129,12.316,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1244,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,91.022,97.752,"Counsel, if we were to agree with you on any one of the three questions, would that end the case?"
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,97.752,99.728,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
2005.04-1244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,130.811,147.972,"Yes, but there was a theory that was put to the jury... and it's right there on the special interrogatories... one category was violent acts that obstruct commerce with no connection at all to extortion."
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,174.361,176.237,--No.
2005.04-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,212.655,214.893,Was there any argument on the merits as to those four counts?
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,214.893,216.375,"--No, Justice Stevens."
2005.04-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,216.375,216.428,No.
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,219.726,222.575,"Well, we take the Court to mean what it... what it says."
2005.04-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,222.575,226.587,But if I just... do you think it's conceivable that we just didn't realize those four points were at issue?
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,226.587,228.411,I think it's possible.
2005.04-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,234.712,241.361,And do you think we resolved the statutory construction issue that you're now arguing very carefully at this time?
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,241.361,244.631,"There's no indication, in the court's opinion, that it resolved it."
2005.04-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,248.753,249.003,They may assume it--
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,249.003,250.167,--petition stage--
2005.04-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,250.167,251.571,--but there's nothing in the opinion to give any--
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,251.571,251.991,--That's correct.
2005.04-1244,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,253.867,269.815,"If it's possible, at least, that we just overlooked that aspect in the issuance of our opinion, would it be more helpful to move on to the other two questions at issue here, since they would be determinative?"
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,270.026,271.429,I'd be happy to--
2005.04-1244,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,271.429,278.6,--it's disturbing to think that some court below deliberately was trying to defy what this Court said.
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,297.286,300.065,"--I'd be happy to move on, Justice O'Connor, to those two issues."
2005.04-1244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,421.94,432.031,"The question is whether the Court should rule on it, as in a matter of first decision."
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,468.942,475.823,"Justice Ginsburg, I understand the concern, but the Seventh Circuit did everything but resolve the issue."
2005.04-1244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,496.875,497.476,Excuse me.
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,508.46,509.844,"--Well, what the... what the Court--"
2005.04-1244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,509.844,511.468,Did you raise this issue below?
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,511.468,512.654,"--Yes, we did, Your Honor."
2005.04-1244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,531.108,531.852,Excuse me.
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,539.153,541.22,"Well, that is what the--"
2005.04-1244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,541.22,543.997,I don't understand how that's a resolution of the question.
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,543.997,549.013,--The Seventh Circuit went out of its way to say it was not finally resolving the question.
2005.04-1244,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,582.27,582.441,"Well, I'm with you--"
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,582.441,582.902,--20 years.
2005.04-1244,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,582.902,585.019,--up to the point where you say it went as far as it possibly could.
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,597.435,604.538,"Well, yes, it did leave open the possibility that a court might come to the opposite conclusion."
2005.04-1244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,611.297,611.887,Why?
2005.04-1244,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,611.887,612.138,We got you off of--
2005.04-1244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,612.138,612.691,Were you--
2005.04-1244,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,612.691,617.014,"--We got you off of your first point, but I'd like to just loop back to that for a minute, at this point."
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,636.221,636.722,Well--
2005.04-1244,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,636.722,646.26,Do... is there some prudential argument for us not to reach this issue and just insist on the wording of our earlier mandate?
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,646.26,652.208,--The Court could certainly come out that way on prudential grounds as a reason to avoid deciding a Hobbs Act issue.
2005.04-1244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,661.054,677.335,"--I'm concerned about your characterization, not only of suggesting that there was some attempt to force a particular decision, but I'm reading the Seventh Circuit's remand to the District Court."
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,709.422,716.863,"The Seventh Circuit did everything it could to make it seem like a plausible issue, as opposed to a very clear issue that should be resolved in our favor."
2005.04-1244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,717.877,723.042,I don't understand how they... how they could dispose of the case without resolving that.
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,724.394,724.887,Well--
2005.04-1244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,724.887,727.736,"How... I mean, can we do that in a case that comes up here, and just say,"
2005.04-1244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,734.867,737.777,--They asked the District Court to resolve it.
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,743.403,744.968,"--That's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,758.189,766.703,"--Of course, the reason they said it was plausible is that... and you may well be right, on the bottom line, and the Government agrees with you, but there are... there's a redundancy in the statute."
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,771.399,775.851,"We don't agree that there... well, perhaps Your Honor could elucidate--"
2005.04-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,775.851,779.993,"It seems to me those words... I forget what the... ""commit threats of physical violence""."
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,782.428,783.845,--I don't think that's right.
2005.04-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,785.779,786.372,"Oh, really?"
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,786.372,786.622,--Justice Stevens.
2005.04-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,793.362,795.037,What function do they perform?
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,797.585,801.327,It would cover preparatory acts of violence that do not rise to an attempt.
2005.04-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,803.061,803.955,That do not rise to an obtaining?
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,803.955,810.886,"--No, do not rise to an attempt, an attempted extortion or robbery."
2005.04-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,817.696,817.986,"Oh, I see what you're saying."
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,817.986,818.557,--and--
2005.04-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,818.557,819.34,You're... I understand.
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,819.34,819.831,--Yes.
2005.04-1244,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,833.964,835.168,"No, we didn't reach that, last time."
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,835.168,837.092,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1244,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,837.092,844.265,"Why, if we... if we agree with you on the Hobbs Act, I assume you would not have us reach that third question this time, either."
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,844.265,848.839,"That's correct, there would be no need for the Court to reach that issue this time, either."
2005.04-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,904.747,908.769,"But, of course, at the time they did that, the Clayton Act had already been passed."
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,908.769,910.323,"That's true, Justice Stevens."
2005.04-1244,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,929.772,933.323,"Your argument's a little inconsistent with the Franklin case, though."
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,933.323,935.287,I'm sorry.
2005.04-1244,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,935.287,936.632,Gwinnett... Franklin versus Gwinnett County.
2005.04-1244,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,936.632,941.547,"Mr. Chief Justice, we think that Franklin is distinguishable."
2005.04-1244,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1015.56,1016.371,"Thank you, Counsel."
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1023.384,1027.154,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1244,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1040.151,1040.614,Would you not--
2005.04-1244,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1040.614,1048.687,"Would you tell us what... which one of these questions, in your view, we ought to address, first and foremost?"
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1057.043,1057.353,That's right.
2005.04-1244,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1136.82,1153.461,"Even though two U.S. attorneys, years back, did predicate cases on there being a discrete crime of obstructing commerce through violent means."
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1153.461,1154.383,That's correct.
2005.04-1244,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1167.964,1168.404,--Ms. Blatt--
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1168.404,1168.635,And--
2005.04-1244,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1168.635,1170.009,--can I identify a concern?
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1187.653,1189.617,--Yes.
2005.04-1244,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1202.947,1212.305,"So that you're saying, in substance, that you don't need to read the Hobbs Act the way they do in order to protect the public from the kind of harms that the... they would read the statute as covering."
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1212.305,1213.118,That's correct.
2005.04-1244,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1275.215,1275.475,What do you mean?
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1276.026,1276.426,--two separate offenses.
2005.04-1244,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1276.426,1277.13,--a separate offense?
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1277.13,1279.015,It's a separate offense for--
2005.04-1244,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1279.015,1281.592,So you charge two counts for violating the same section?
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1281.592,1282.907,"--Yes, because there's two distinct harms."
2005.04-1244,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1293.749,1297.499,"Two separate violations, each of which violates the same statute?"
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1297.499,1299.031,"--Yes, that's right."
2005.04-1244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1299.031,1308.982,"Is it... you just... on your list, I had the impression, but tell me if I'm right or wrong, that there's a specific statute dealing with abortion clinics now, though there wasn't when this case began."
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1308.982,1309.463,"Yes, the--"
2005.04-1244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1309.463,1309.673,So that if--
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1309.673,1309.843,--FACE Act.
2005.04-1244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1309.843,1320.945,"--Operation Rescue did the same kind of thing now that they did then, the Petitioners in... the plaintiffs in this case would be able to get relief under that statute."
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1322.25,1323.173,That's absolutely correct.
2005.04-1244,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1367.828,1381.93,"Ms. Blatt, your time is almost over, so, on the injunction part, what remedies are available to the United States under your reading of the provision?"
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1387.978,1395.141,"Well, 1964(a) addresses equitable relief, and the Government can get things like disgorgement under (a)."
2005.04-1244,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1396.976,1397.226,Yes.
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1397.226,1399.031,--no.
2005.04-1244,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1516.876,1518.37,I have... just have one question.
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1539.776,1542.604,"--No, I don't think so."
2005.04-1244,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1557.8,1561.119,"Regardless of whether we knew what we were doing, we said it."
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1561.279,1577.971,"And that's why we think it's appropriate for the Court to say, just like the Court did in the recent per curiam Eberhart, that generally courts are supposed to follow this Court's mandates, and they're supposed to articulate their concerns to facilitate resolution by this Court, and then leave it up to this Court to clarify an earlier decision."
2005.04-1244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1577.971,1580.016,Except if they think we didn't know what we were doing.
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1580.849,1581.55,I think that--
2005.04-1244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1581.55,1586.115,--they ignore it if they... if they think that we didn't know what we were doing.
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1586.115,1587.397,"--Well, they could have--"
2005.04-1244,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1587.397,1589.554,Only when it's perfectly clear that we didn't know it.
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1590.849,1595.804,--We do think that the judgment did sweep more broadly than the circumstances--
2005.04-1244,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1595.804,1603.567,"You don't think there's even an arguable basis for saying we resolved the statutory question that's presented now, do you?"
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1603.567,1609.956,"--No, because usually the Court doesn't decide important... the construction of a Federal statute, a Federal criminal statute, without discussing it."
2005.04-1244,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1619.837,1621.321,But it's not mentioned in the opinion.
2005.04-1244,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1621.321,1622.432,--It's not mentioned in the opinion.
2005.04-1244,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1631.439,1632.443,"Thank you, Ms. Blatt."
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1634.377,1637.809,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1703.257,1715.524,"Well, that's true, but don't you have the further difficulty that we didn't nearly reverse with respect to the... to the Hobbs Act violations, or to the listed ones."
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1723.428,1724.359,"No, Your Honor."

2005.04-1244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3026.519,3027.282,All right.
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3027.523,3027.853,--of the Hobbs Act.
2005.04-1244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3027.853,3031.775,"--Well, the case that interpreted the Hobbs Act, which is Enmons--"
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3031.775,3032.418,Right.
2005.04-1244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3032.418,3045.647,"--seems to rely, for the labor union exemption, on the fact that a threat of violence in effort to obtain legitimate wages is not within the Act."
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3055.347,3056.579,"No, Your Honor."
2005.04-1244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3094.174,3096.862,"No, the... it's not a... that's wrong."
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3099.388,3099.88,--Right.
2005.04-1244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3099.88,3111.735,"And, therefore, we have the instance of any threat of violence that affects commerce becomes a Federal crime subject to 20 years of imprisonment."
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3136.14,3138.798,"No, Your Honor, because of the importance of the word ""plan""."
2005.04-1244,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3206.492,3214.535,"Well, your friend's answer was that that was an implied right of action case; and, therefore, the remedies had not been spelled out; and so, you assume the broader remedies."
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3215.378,3224.856,"--No, Your Honor, because this Court has said, in any instance, Federal courts have equitable power unless Congress has expressly stripped it of that power."
2005.04-1244,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3246.121,3251.055,"As you read it, can a private party get a preliminary injunction?"
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3251.055,3256.963,"No, Your Honor, in terms of the Government specifically authorized by 1964(b) to get a preliminary injunction."
2005.04-1244,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3273.733,3278.469,"So, a private party could get an... not only permanent, but preliminary--"
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3278.469,3279.31,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1244,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3279.31,3279.46,--injunction.
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3279.46,3280.444,Yes.
2005.04-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3311.688,3317.093,"Mr. Chemerinsky, I... you said earlier that our... that we ""reversed and remanded""."
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3324.497,3325.638,Right.
2005.04-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3326.843,3327.656,It just says--
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3327.656,3327.856,--obviously was sent back--
2005.04-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3327.856,3328.036,"--""# reversed""."
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3328.036,3328.407,--to the Seventh Circuit.
2005.04-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3333.12,3333.373,I see.
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3336.041,3338.626,--Because this Court had not considered--
2005.04-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3338.626,3338.789,I see.
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3338.789,3339.41,--the four acts--
2005.04-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3339.41,3340.042,I see.
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3340.042,3341.174,--of violence and threats of violence.
2005.04-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3341.174,3345.66,"So, that enabled them to say that what we meant was not ""reversed"", but ""reversed and remanded""."
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3345.66,3352.61,"What this... what the Seventh Circuit did was look at this Court's opinion and see that the statement of the issues, on page 397--"
2005.04-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3352.61,3356.452,"They didn't look at the last line of our opinion, which said ""reversed""."
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3356.452,3366.15,"--But, Your Honor, that would then assume that this Court decided an issue about the meaning of the Hobbs Act that was never presented in the cert petitions, never briefed, never addressed in the opinion."
2005.04-1244,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3366.15,3376.149,"They made the assumption that this Court has an obligation to reason why, and there was no reason why given as to those four counts."
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3376.149,3376.702,That's right.
2005.04-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3378.117,3378.698,It's a broad principle.
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3386.804,3387.965,"Of course not, Your Honor."
2005.04-1244,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3404.616,3408.458,"Well, Congress never discussed the change in the Hobbs Act that you're proposing, in 1948."
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3408.889,3410.304,That's true.
2005.04-1244,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3417.054,3419.171,"We also actually entered a mandate, too."
2005.04-1244,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3419.392,3420.445,"--Yes, that's true."
2005.04-1244,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3423.424,3424.475,"Thank you, Mr. Chemerinsky."
2005.04-1244,3,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,3427.355,3429.17,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1244,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3506.444,3507.445,"Thank you, Counsel."
