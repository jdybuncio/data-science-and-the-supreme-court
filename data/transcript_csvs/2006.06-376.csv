2006.06-376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.996,"We'll hear argument next in case 06-376, Hinck vs. United States."
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,7.963,10.537,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,84.413,89.506,But not with respect to abatement of interest in particular.
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,89.506,95.972,"Not with respect to abatement of interest, Your Honor, but as a general basis."
2006.06-376,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,136.285,179.783,"That's a... on that point, Mr. Redding, it seems odd that given this tripartite system, Congress would want only the tax court to be restricted in the people who could claim the abatement, the net worth test applicable in the tax court on your theory, if there is authority in the claims court and in the district courts, they're not limited to the net worth restrictions."
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,179.783,193.166,"That is correct, Your Honor, but I do believe that it is consistent with the intent of the formation of the tax court to provide a prepayment forum to especially avoid hardship and the potential even of bankruptcy."
2006.06-376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,219.672,228.839,But why would you not want some... a larger taxpayer to be able to proceed in the tax court if you can also proceed in the claims court?
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,228.839,256.295,"Your Honor, I can't speak to Congress's reasoning behind that but I can understand the logic behind saying we're going to create a special prepayment remedy that allows the smaller taxpayer an expedited means of resolving these issues without having to first pay it and sue, whereas the larger taxpayer is not put into a hardship position, is not inconvenienced as bad by having to follow the old well established procedures of pay and sue."
2006.06-376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,347.525,356.724,"But you have no basis for an abatement of interest action apart from 6404(h), correct?"
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,362.284,365.595,"--Abatement as a prepayment remedy, yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,375.075,383.135,"But what would you cite to, in response to the prior cases that said you had no cause of action for abasement of interest?"
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,383.135,386.96,Actually Your Honor I don't believe that's what the cases said.
2006.06-376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,436.144,439.908,Where is (e)(2)?
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,453.559,460.057,I believe all of 6404 was in the appendix but I don't have it in front of me.
2006.06-376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.1,470.301,Ah.
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,470.301,471.411,"But I mean... I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2006.06-376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.987,476.879,That's one thing about this case I'm sure about.
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,478.673,481.922,"I apologize, Your Honor, but I do not have that."
2006.06-376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,486.328,489.623,Is that the one that says interest abated with respect to erroneous refund check?
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,490.731,491.542,"Yes, Sir, it is."
2006.06-376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,491.542,495.261,But the one I'm looking at just has (e)(1).
2006.06-376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,496.774,515.457,"At page 42 of the appendix, all... all there is is a subsection 1."
2006.06-376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,515.457,516.268,That's right.
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,516.268,527.81,"Well, Your Honor, I have the code section in front of me now but I still do not have the reference in the appendix."
2006.06-376,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,530.373,549.035,"Can I go back to something you just said, that I thought you said that the people would have no remedy if the tax court... were the only forum for abatement claims?"
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,555.22,557.407,Your Honor--
2006.06-376,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,557.407,568.888,"Abatement claim, if you read this as the Government does, is one place where you go, and the tax court but everyone who has an abatement claim could go there."
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,570.635,572.87,"--Well no, Your Honor, everyone cannot go there."
2006.06-376,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,578.056,578.633,"Oh, yes."
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,598.314,610.808,"Your Honor, again, my, my view of that is the Congress intended to limit the special relief of prepayment jurisdiction to the smaller taxpayers."
2006.06-376,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,646.337,657.661,I thought Congress was operating on the assumption that no court could hear an abatement claim?
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,657.661,668.532,"--Your Honor, that comes largely from the legislative history, the House Committee report addressing interestingly, subsection (h)."
2006.06-376,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,681.619,699.44,"Well, give me a decision of the claims court or a district court that said courts have authority to abate the interest before Congress enacted this legislation?"
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,699.44,706.658,--I don't believe there is a specific case out there that I can cite to you where it has happened.
2006.06-376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,719.246,731.662,"Is it fair to say that Congress acted on the assumption that there was no right to the abatement with, and to the payment unless it enacted the statutes?"
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,731.662,733.927,"--Your Honor, I don't believe so."
2006.06-376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,762.838,770.131,It's easy to see why the only cases you have relate to (e)(2) rather than (e)(1).
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,804.52,811.909,"Well... Your Honor, I respectfully disagree because 6404(h) applies to (e)(2) as much as it does to (e)(1)."
2006.06-376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,823.498,823.95,"Well, sure."
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,847.66,848.923,"No it does not, Your Honor."
2006.06-376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,866.324,866.886,I see.
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,878.896,880.004,Of (e)(2)--
2006.06-376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,880.004,883.345,At least as far as suits elsewhere than in the tax court.
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,883.345,884.125,--That's correct.
2006.06-376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,890.173,893.468,It seems to apply just to abuse of discretion.
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,893.468,895.418,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2006.06-376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,895.418,898.838,: Doesn't the new statute just apply to abuse of discretion?
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,898.838,901.228,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
2006.06-376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,906.633,910.053,It says you have jurisdiction to determine whether it's an abusive discretion.
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,914.054,917.287,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is the standard it applies to."
2006.06-376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,917.287,917.833,--Right.
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,929.796,934.186,Well I think it's the standard on which they are to review the Government's action.
2006.06-376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,988.397,1001.688,"But if you went into the district court and claimed that the failure to abate interest was an abuse of discretion, what would you rely on for the... for the cause of action?"
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,1001.688,1007.825,If the failure to abate interest was an abuse of discretion under (e)(1) you would rely on (e)(1) for the cause of action.
2006.06-376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1013.635,1027.146,"I thought the prior cases consistently, consistently said that there was no judicial review because it was 6404(h)(1) that there was a cause of action for abuse of discretion?"
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,1027.146,1038.424,"Yes, Your Honor, but I believe what they actually said is that there was jurisdiction to hear it but there was not a justiciable standard that could be applied with regard to (e)(1)."
2006.06-376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1063.225,1075.564,"So you want to look at 6404(h)(1) saying now we have a standard, but you don't want the other stuff that goes along with 6404(h)(1), which is it's in the tax court; you got to have less than ten million, blah, blah, blah?"
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,1075.564,1077.844,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-376,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1086.778,1089.434,And it didn't exist before this statute?
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,1134.991,1140.506,"--I understand and that's basically the Fifth Circuit's view, Your Honor."
2006.06-376,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1150.551,1152.064,The Fifth Circuit... I thought the Fifth Circuit went your way.
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,1152.064,1153.062,--Pardon?
2006.06-376,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1153.062,1155.687,I thought the Fifth Circuit went your way.
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,1155.687,1156.485,"It did, Your Honor."
2006.06-376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1181.646,1188.894,"Mr.... Mr. Redding, let me come back to the phantom (e)(2) which we have finally traced down."
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,1188.894,1189.565,"I apologize, Your Honor."
2006.06-376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1189.565,1197.61,"I am not sure that (h) would impliedly repeal (e)(2), because (e)(2) is mandatory."
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,1236.063,1239.124,"I understand that argument, Your Honor."
2006.06-376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1239.889,1240.965,"It was a pretty good argument, I thought."
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,1241.652,1242.248,"--I agree, Your Honor."
2006.06-376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1275.499,1282.073,"What about those other sections, (c) and (d), which say the Secretary is authorized?"
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,1290.117,1291.993,"Your Honor, I've been able to find no case--"
2006.06-376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1291.993,1293.46,It's the same as with (e)?
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,1293.46,1294.318,--Yes Your Honor.
2006.06-376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.318,1294.898,As with (e)(1).
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,1294.898,1295.585,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1336.678,1345.081,"Of course, there's a fundamental difference on this particular question between pay and sue and sue--"
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,1345.081,1345.799,Prepay.
2006.06-376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1345.799,1354.389,"--prepay, because if you... in the district court if you're paying and suing you're not really subject to the accrual of interest, right?"
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,1354.389,1356.339,"No, Your Honor, that is not correct."
2006.06-376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1356.339,1366.119,"If I owe the IRS, 1,000 dollars and they send me a bill and I paid the 1,000 dollars, they've got the money, I don't."
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,1367.586,1372.413,"Your Honor, may I reflect it back to the facts in this case."
2006.06-376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1429.419,1432.059,The initial bill includes the interest?
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,1432.059,1435.666,"--Absolutely, Your Honor, that's being asked to be relieved of in this case."
2006.06-376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1435.666,1438.806,"But still, in the tax court situation it's still accruing?"
2006.06-376,0,43261,thomas_e_redding,,1438.806,1442.698,"Well, yes."
2006.06-376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1529.146,1530.191,"Thank you, Mr. Redding."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1537.202,1541.449,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-376,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1599.317,1620.09,"If, if the history of this issue had been such that before the enactment of this section the courts of appeals were divided or the courts were divided as to whether or not there was jurisdiction in the Court of Claims and in the district court, would your position be different?"
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1620.09,1622.102,"No, our position would be the same."
2006.06-376,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1648.826,1654.121,"So it's, so it's only (h) that gives any court any jurisdiction at all?"
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1654.121,1655.415,--That's correct.
2006.06-376,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1655.415,1662.837,Even though in our hypothetical world some courts of general jurisdiction thought that they did have jurisdiction?
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1662.837,1664.806,"That's correct, Justice Kennedy."
2006.06-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.63,1675.503,Did (h) apply to (e)(2) as well as to (e)(1)?
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1679.456,1683.453,"No, it's our position it applies only to discretionary abatement determinations by the Secretary."
2006.06-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.48,1693.701,So what happens with (e)(2)?
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1697.807,1702.51,"Yes, you could use it, although it typically comes up when the Government has filed an action to recover an erroneous refund."
2006.06-376,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1706.164,1712.646,"Well, isn't it an abuse... isn't it an abuse of discretion for the Secretary to fail to do what the statute tells him he absolutely must?"
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1712.646,1715.394,"I think as a technical matter, Justice Kennedy, that's correct."
2006.06-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1727.232,1730.684,"I don't, I don't even think it's technically correct."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1738.292,1747.07,Well I think some cases... there is some case law that has said that when there is an error of law committed by a lower court that can constitute an abuse of discretion.
2006.06-376,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1765.124,1775.508,But what the cases said prior to 6404(h) when they asked for interest abatement was not that we don't have jurisdiction to consider that claim.
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1787.036,1792.051,"I think that's... with respect, I think the Fifth Circuit's reasoning is too clever by half."
2006.06-376,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1803.827,1807.247,"Well, that's because of the way that Congress enacted the language."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1823.193,1829.627,"Well, I think you need to look at what the state of the law was when Congress enacted this provision and think about what Congress would have wanted to do."
2006.06-376,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1846.23,1855.039,"Don't you think it's kind of strange, though, if you have the interest abatement is available only for a particular category of taxpayer and not others?"
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1855.039,1855.913,No.
2006.06-376,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1855.913,1863.895,"If you have a net worth of two million and one dollar you can't get any interest abatement, but if it's $2 million you can."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1863.895,1865.522,"I don't think, I don't think it's anomalous."
2006.06-376,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1889.432,1892.712,"Right, but you abate it in some cases, but you don't abate it in the others."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1892.712,1894.837,Right.
2006.06-376,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1906.412,1907.348,"That's what I thought, too."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1927.137,1928.775,"I don't think that's correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.803,1946.674,"But he doesn't even know what his tax liability is, especially in a partnership situation."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1946.674,1947.517,"Well, the taxpayer--"
2006.06-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.517,1952.029,"He makes the partnership calculation, it goes to the IRS, and then they figure out what the tax is."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1955.34,1959.777,"Well, Justice Scalia, first of all, the taxpayer is in the best position to know what the tax liability is."
2006.06-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1964.04,1965.947,This is quite a different argument.
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1973.768,1975.083,Right.
2006.06-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2001.666,2003.226,Excuse me.
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2011.864,2017.58,"--Until you're notified, until the IRS notifies you that they are looking further at your return."
2006.06-376,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2035.167,2037.104,"But you don't know how much to pay, do you?"
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2049.007,2054.502,"Again, they don't necessarily tell you exactly how much you owe, but it's the taxpayers'--"
2006.06-376,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2054.502,2055.641,Do they name a figure at all--
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2055.641,2056.655,--They sometimes do.
2006.06-376,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2056.655,2057.469,--when they give you the initial notice?
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2057.469,2072.65,"They sometimes do, and then at 18 months, at 18 months under subsection (g), under 18 months under a provision that was acted in 1998, the IRS has to at 18 months tell you how much you owe; otherwise, the interest cannot continue to accrue after that 18-month period."
2006.06-376,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2078.694,2079.333,That's true.
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2087.206,2089.313,"Right, but that's the idea."
2006.06-376,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2101.826,2109.15,"And the question is, why is the grace confined to some taxpayers and not to others?"
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2109.15,2115.164,"--The short answer is because Congress has said that, said that, and the Congress decided to impose the net worth limitation."
2006.06-376,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2115.164,2119.895,They've said it if we accept your view of the exclusivity of the amendment to (h).
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2119.895,2120.316,Right.
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2126.672,2128.891,"Yeah, but is there any other instance in the law?"
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2180.386,2183.791,"--Well, I think there has to be a rational basis for--"
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2183.791,2184.04,No.
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2189.571,2190.397,"--Well, I--"
2006.06-376,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2190.397,2191.645,It's worthless.
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2223.379,2229.849,"--Keep in mind, this is... what you're talking about is, this is interest that's running on money that the taxpayer is borrowing from the Government."
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2234.408,2234.813,Yeah.
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2234.813,2236.298,And so this is money that the taxpayer is borrowing.
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2241.656,2248.465,"But at the end of the day, the claim happens to be interest worth $5,000."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2274.782,2283.965,"And the rational basis is that Congress believed that taxpayers of a high net worth, there would be no hardship, but... in them not having a cause of action."
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2283.965,2286.028,Why would there be no hardship?
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2286.028,2289.807,"Because they can use the money, invest the money."
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2289.807,2290.993,And so can a poor person.
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2290.993,2296.194,"Well, but they're not as well positioned as the wealthy taxpayer, so--"
2006.06-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2296.194,2299.521,"--The next thing you know, they will enact a progressive income tax."
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2300.663,2306.879,"By the way, this has nothing to do with the progressive income tax."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2336.664,2340.27,"--Well, first of all, there are other examples."
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2340.738,2341.175,What.
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2341.175,2350.281,"--This is derived from, ultimately derived from the Equal Access to Justice Act, there are attorneys' fees provisions, but also assistance to taxpayers, and those net worth limitations apply to--"
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2350.281,2355.405,"We know, attorneys' fees you give to poor people more than to rich people."
2006.06-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2362.575,2383.142,"Is there a you cannot enter the courthouse provision here, or is it... as I understand your case, it is that it remains discretionary with the Secretary with respect to people who have more money, but it is not discretionary with respect to people who have less money."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2383.142,2383.969,--That's correct.
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2383.969,2384.702,I don't understand.
2006.06-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2384.702,2385.357,So one has a cause of--
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2401.135,2401.618,That's correct.
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2403.428,2403.865,Wait.
2006.06-376,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2404.865,2406.94,The poor do not have the--
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2418.909,2419.517,--That's exactly right.
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2422.5,2422.844,Wait.
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2430.935,2431.465,--No.
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2432.105,2432.682,Oh.
2006.06-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2432.682,2435.15,"But it's permissive, not mandatory."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2435.15,2437.447,"Yeah, the Secretary has the authority to waive interest."
2006.06-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2437.447,2438.664,But he doesn't have--
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2438.664,2444.506,"He can do it... in the first case with the rich person, he can abuse his discretion."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2444.506,2448.988,With respect to taxpayers who meet the net worth limitations.
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2448.988,2458.593,"In other words, in the one case Congress has passed a law saying with a poor person you cannot abuse your discretion, but with a rich person you can abuse your discretion."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2462.98,2463.791,And there's another--
2006.06-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2463.791,2464.95,--Wait a minute.
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2475.911,2476.488,--That's right.
2006.06-376,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2480.985,2481.406,No.
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2490.137,2490.749,--They have an enforceable right.
2006.06-376,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2490.749,2492.668,"So it's a question of remedy, not standing."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2492.668,2494.62,Right.
2006.06-376,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2498.102,2499.65,Is that the poverty line?
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2499.65,2501.959,"And there's another provision in the tax... I'm sorry, Justice Alito."
2006.06-376,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2501.959,2504.193,Is the net worth of $2 million the poverty line now?
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2507.863,2509.739,Not that I'm aware of.
2006.06-376,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2509.739,2512.286,So what is... so what's the rationale?
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2514.816,2523.06,It's treating exceedingly high net worth individuals and corporations differently from everyone else.
2006.06-376,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2523.06,2528.949,Someone with a net worth of $1.5 million couldn't invest the money in the interim?
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2528.949,2530.528,They could.
2006.06-376,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2537.741,2539.975,This was for purposes of attorneys' fees?
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2539.975,2542.694,"--Right, the provision that applies to attorneys' fees."
2006.06-376,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2611.181,2618.273,"Wouldn't it have been simpler if Congress just said the tax court shall have exclusive jurisdiction, instead of just saying jurisdiction?"
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2618.273,2625.191,"That might have made it simpler, Justice Ginsburg, but it accomplished the same result by imposing the specific restrictions that it did."
2006.06-376,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2652.774,2663.145,"The difference... the difference is that the district court, the claims court already has jurisdiction for pay and sue claims, if you pay the IRS you can sue to get a refund."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2686.699,2691.04,"Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think it was just a matter of not being a standard of review."
2006.06-376,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2698.849,2709.939,But I thought what you had argued before when people would try to seek this release was that there's no standard of review to hold the Secretary's exercise of discretion up against.
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2709.939,2714.093,"--I think that was one of the reasons that the Government cited, but I think there was others as well."
2006.06-376,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2714.093,2721.104,"But one thing you never said was that there was no jurisdiction, because there is jurisdiction in the district court."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2724.84,2728.4,"If you have a legal entitlement to it, and the point is you didn't have a legal entitlement to it before."
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2761.165,2770.867,"I now think maybe I don't agree on this point that there are different standards, because it does say in this abuse of discretion."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2789.591,2792.543,"I'm sorry, Justice Breyer?"
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2793.619,2806.211,"Once they make clear that the standard is abuse of discretion, it only makes clear what's there in the law anyway, that administrative authorities do not have the authority to abuse their discretion."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2812.927,2814.128,--Right.
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2814.128,2816.268,So there's a standard that applies to everybody.
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2855.766,2858.422,"Well, I don't think it's right to characterize it as the closing of the courthouse door."
2006.06-376,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2865.733,2868.201,I'll accept that characterization.
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2887.364,2889.209,"--Justice Breyer, I don't know if I can give you a better one than I gave before."
2006.06-376,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2900.72,2905.574,They're exactly alike but for their ability to earn interest in different ways.
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2905.574,2906.432,Yes.
2006.06-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2906.432,2918.162,"And I would not concede, as you seem to have, that the consequence of (h) is simply to open the door."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2962.85,2965.362,"That's a fine way of looking at it, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-376,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2995.009,3001.99,Can they bring it as additional claim after they get the final determination?
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3005.223,3012.659,"That's... if they, if they, if they got relief on their refund claim, if they prevail on their refund claim there would be no need to do that."
2006.06-376,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3022.404,3025.621,Is it part of the same proceeding or is it a separate proceeding?
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3025.621,3032.336,"Well, it would be, it would be a proceeding that would follow the proceeding on the underlying liability."
2006.06-376,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3032.336,3041.707,"You're making the claim that it's no big deal that you have to go to the district court to get your refund and then go to the tax court to get the interest abatement, which does seem like a big deal to me."
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3047.642,3054.17,"It's not as inconvenient... well, it, it may be inconvenient but it's a necessary consequence of the exclusive review scheme the Congress set up."
2006.06-376,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3063.306,3079.657,"And there is no linkage between the two, with, it's one thing to split a claim when they have common elements, but the interest abatement has nothing to do with the substantive underlying... substantive liability?"
2006.06-376,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3079.657,3081.471,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.06-376,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3112.612,3113.739,Thank you Mr. Marcus.
2006.06-376,2,43261,thomas_e_redding,,3116.378,3122.33,"If I may, there are a couple of brief points I would like to make."
2006.06-376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3134.855,3135.744,Who said that?
2006.06-376,2,43261,thomas_e_redding,,3135.744,3138.914,"--That's in a House committee report, Your Honor."
2006.06-376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3191.877,3209.589,"But the point that Mr. Marcus just made, that the issue is discrete on interest abatement, and it involves mishandling within the Internal Revenue processing, and it's not like other questions that have to do with the... with the intricacies of the Internal Revenue Code--"
2006.06-376,2,43261,thomas_e_redding,,3209.589,3214.588,"That's only relatively true to 6404(e)(1), Your Honor."
2006.06-376,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3405.478,3406.367,"Thank you, Counsel."
