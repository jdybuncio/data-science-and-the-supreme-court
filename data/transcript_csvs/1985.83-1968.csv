1985.83-1968,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.764,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 83-1968, Thornburg against Gingles."
1985.83-1968,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,10.356,25.881,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Honorable Court, this case in its final posture before the Court involves four multi-member House legislative districts and one multi-member Senate district in the State of North Carolina."
1985.83-1968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,218.711,221.726,"Well, don't you think they purported to apply them?"
1985.83-1968,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,221.726,232.909,"I think, Your Honor, that they sought to apply them more as a checklist rather than as an indicator of what actually had occurred, which leads me to call the Court's attention--"
1985.83-1968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,232.909,234.097,"The answer is, yes, they did purport to apply them?"
1985.83-1968,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,234.097,237.877,"--Oh, I think they purported to apply them but--"
1985.83-1968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,237.877,238.906,You disagree with the way they--
1985.83-1968,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,238.906,240.016,--Certainly do.
1985.83-1968,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,318.593,331.307,"--General Thornburg, is it your position that the court below was required to focus on the individual election districts rather than the state as a whole?"
1985.83-1968,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,331.307,331.698,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.83-1968,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,340.35,348.691,"Do the precedents, do the cases from this Court indicate that that is a requirement?"
1985.83-1968,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,348.691,352.002,"As we read them and understand them, Your Honor, that this--"
1985.83-1968,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,352.002,354.032,That you look at the individual--
1985.83-1968,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,354.032,378.257,"--I believe you use the words, 63.5 percent of the popular electorate."
1985.83-1968,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,378.257,385.941,"--Well, do we have to apply a clearly erroneous standard to the review of the factors found by the court below?"
1985.83-1968,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,385.941,396.859,"Your Honor, we do not feel that the clearly erroneous, the Rule 52 standards, should be applied in this case to proscribe your reviewing the facts in the case."
1985.83-1968,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,412.182,419.505,"Well, specifically, what are the legal errors that you believe were made below?"
1985.83-1968,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,419.505,466.642,"We simply say that the court failed to apply the wording of the statute and rather than taking the statute which deals with access and opportunity to participate in the electoral process, clear wording, is simply found the various factors without making a causal connection and applied those, and simply did not apply the law, and fashioned a remedy which is specifically proscribed by the statute where it says that nothing in this should be interpreted, nothing in the section should be interpreted to establish a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population."
1985.83-1968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,479.357,490.04,I suppose you can do things as a remedy for constitutional rights that you just couldn't do in the absence of a remedy... in the absence of a violation.
1985.83-1968,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,495.07,495.677,"--Yes, we do."
1985.83-1968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,503.284,505.032,And no violation of the statute?
1985.83-1968,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,505.032,506.126,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.83-1968,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,665.016,673.81,"Mr. Attorney General, I gather that if you prevail, you suggest you are entitled to an outright reversal, not further proceedings?"
1985.83-1968,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,673.81,680.979,"We would hope for an outright reversal, Your Honor, but certainly we would... whatever the Court suggested--"
1985.83-1968,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,680.979,683.572,"Well, if it were to go back, if it were to go back, for what purpose?"
1985.83-1968,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,683.572,684.822,--If it were to--
1985.83-1968,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,684.822,694.801,"Enough to say there had been an error made in the application of the law and that we should send it back, how to apply it, as we say?"
1985.83-1968,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,694.801,695.598,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.83-1968,1,18942,charles_fried,,1099.029,1102.544,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.83-1968,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1531.201,1533.45,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.83-1968,3,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,3149.111,3151.141,"Nothing further, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.83-1968,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3151.141,3151.688,"Thank you, gentlemen."
