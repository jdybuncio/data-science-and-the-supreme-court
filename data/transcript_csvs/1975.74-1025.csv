1975.74-1025,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,46.973,We will hear arguments next in Hines against Anchor Motor Freight Company.
1975.74-1025,0,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,49.752,50.786,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1975.74-1025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.653,360.527,"Why should the employer be penalized for the shortcomings of the Union here, which is your men’s agent I take it?"
1975.74-1025,0,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,360.527,368.513,Well the employer is; first of all the employer is not to be penalized if he has ordered to reinstate these men—
1975.74-1025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,368.513,372.191,"Well, he is claiming the benefit of the arbitration procedure?"
1975.74-1025,0,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,372.191,372.852,"Well, but—"
1975.74-1025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,372.852,376.556,You say that the union did not do a good job at the arbitration procedure?
1975.74-1025,0,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,379.942,391.439,"The employer should not be permitted to take, to claim the benefit of an arbitration procedure result, which is based on shoddy representation, where all of the evidence of innocence was not presented—"
1975.74-1025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,391.439,395.334,"Well, why are your not people bound by the acts of their own agents?"
1975.74-1025,0,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,395.334,398.063,The agent was not selected by them.
1975.74-1025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,416.995,425.153,"Why does the company vested that in the Union, the Union represents the majority of the employees, the Union demanded that that be done—"
1975.74-1025,0,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,425.153,431.342,For bargaining purposes the Union is the representative of the employees.
1975.74-1025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,457.021,464.541,"But it was the demand of the Union as the agent for the employees that that provision was put in the contract, I take it?"
1975.74-1025,0,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,464.541,466.866,"Well, we do not know how it was demanded."
1975.74-1025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,468.873,473.054,"Well and the company is not your men’s agent, the Union is?"
1975.74-1025,0,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,473.054,475.861,It is not a willing agent under these circumstances.
1975.74-1025,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,495.956,504.795,"If you prevail here, do you think the company has a claim over against the Union?"
1975.74-1025,0,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,504.795,516.44,"No, I think according to Vaca versus Sipes, and Czosek versus O'Mara, the company’s liability is for a back pay."
1975.74-1025,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,573.117,575.584,"Incidentally, has he ever been prosecuted?"
1975.74-1025,0,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,575.584,576.899,"He has not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1975.74-1025,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,576.899,580.867,Have your people ever filed any charges against him?
1975.74-1025,0,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,580.867,581.8,Not to my knowledge.
1975.74-1025,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,581.8,582.947,Why not?
1975.74-1025,0,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,582.947,592.77,"Well, I have already been involved in a tremendous burden in this case, it would not be productive for my people to file charges against the poor motel clerk?"
1975.74-1025,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,592.77,595.509,"No, but it is a crime, is it not?"
1975.74-1025,0,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,595.509,600.694,He submitted the three crimes in his affidavit.
1975.74-1025,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,611.241,616.118,"Have you, what does that answer state?"
1975.74-1025,0,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,616.118,616.24,Well the answer—
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,1671.77,1675.011,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1975.74-1025,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1851.769,1857.187,What is the credibility of the people that filed an affidavit?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,1857.187,1860.048,Because the drivers denied—
1975.74-1025,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1860.048,1864.753,Or is it the credibility of all of then people including hotel clerk?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,1864.753,1865.545,That is right.
1975.74-1025,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1865.545,1867.83,"You did not really mean that, did you?"
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,1869.135,1870.417,They had an affidavit of his.
1975.74-1025,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1870.417,1872.442,Well how does that go to credibility?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,1872.442,1881.829,"Because the drivers denied the efficacy of that affidavit, the driver said that that motel clerk was not telling the truth in that affidavit."
1975.74-1025,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1881.829,1882.774,You decided—
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,1882.774,1883.337,And the arbitral—
1975.74-1025,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1883.337,1888.574,Who decided that the credibility lied with the man who made an affidavit against the man who testified?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,1888.574,1898.934,Obviously the arbitral body accepted the affidavit over and above what the driver said; the notarized affidavit.
1975.74-1025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2018.422,2038.582,"May I ask, Mr. Goldfarb, you referred this as an arbitration award, perhaps inaccurately, it was an award of a joint grievance committee, had the committee, under the collective bargaining agreement, had the committee not been able to decide the merits of this grievance, where would the grievance have gone?"
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2038.582,2040.115,It would have gone to a higher level.
1975.74-1025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2040.115,2040.359,"Where,what?"
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2040.359,2047.43,Other joint national grievance committee made up of an equal number of employers and Union representatives.
1975.74-1025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2047.43,2048.746,If there had been no decision there?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2048.746,2057.159,"If there had been no decision there, it would have gone to a third arbitral process made up of three people with a neutral on the final board."
1975.74-1025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2057.159,2061.63,"That would have been the first truly, true arbitration in the technical sense."
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2061.63,2065.966,"In the technical sense, yes."
1975.74-1025,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2066.626,2081.389,"Mr. Goldfarb, I take it then that it is your position that we should not assume here for the purposes of the present posture of the case, that the discharges were wrongful and in violation of the bargaining agreement?"
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2081.389,2091.58,"Our position is that the discharges were not wrongful, that there has been a determination that they cannot conceivably be wrongful at this stage of the game."
1975.74-1025,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2109.733,2124.12,Maybe that is not the exact question I asked is -- is it conceded today or not that these people were the victims of a dishonesty of Mr. pegano?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2124.12,2125.123,No it is not conceded.
1975.74-1025,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2125.123,2125.689,Not conceded.
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2125.689,2128.616,"It is not conceded, Your Honor."
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.616,2137.715,Certainly the Court of Appeals decided the case on the assumption that the employer should be dismissed even if there had been a wrongful discharge?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2137.715,2138.937,"Correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2138.937,2146.821,And because of refusing summary judgment against the Union left to those issues in the case?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2146.821,2151.494,For the simple reason that there are tow different types of wrongs.
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2151.494,2162.904,"Alright, alright. But nevertheless the court, if a case comes to us, the issues is whether the employer should be dismissed even if he wrongfully discharged."
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2162.904,2163.389,Correct.
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2233.815,2235.729,What do you do with the Vaca case?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2235.729,2237.192,The Vaca case is distinguishable.
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.192,2240.213,"--wrong, but does it not read on this issue?"
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2240.213,2242.937,I do not think it does.
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2262.638,2266.357,You are saying that Vaca is limited to just the exhaustion?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2266.357,2279.603,"Vaca is limited to exhaustion, and plus the fact that the Union is under no compulsion or duty to pursue a grievance to the final stage of arbitration."
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2279.603,2280.893,Oh that is Vaca too?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2280.893,2281.928,That is Vaca.
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2281.928,2282.822,That is Vaca also—
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2282.822,2283.882,But that is not this case.
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2323.518,2341.958,"But you are suggesting that the employer can say to the employee, well, I fired you legally perhaps but even if I did you have no remedy because a have contractual right to rely on the grievance procedure."
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2353.413,2355.647,Not quite.
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.647,2357.705,How do you differ?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2357.705,2364.213,"Merely by saying this to you, that we are under no obligation to accept the second statement of the witness to be true, because --"
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2364.213,2365.094,"Well, I understand that."
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2365.094,2367.471,If that so then we never come to final conclusion.
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2367.471,2374.749,"I know, but the question is whether you should stay in the case until it is decided whether or not there was a wrongful discharge?"
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2374.749,2386.893,"I do not believe so, because the very issue, the very same issue that they want to litigate in the federal District Court is the very same issue that went before the grievance committee."
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2386.893,2398.335,"So you do say, so you do say yes even if it is determined one way or another you have a right to rely on your contractual—"
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2398.335,2401.973,"Precisely, we have been concluded."
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2418.013,2427.228,(Inaudible) there was a wrong discharge because it is already been determined finally that there was none?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2427.228,2431.205,"Correct, Your Honor, absolutely."
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.69,2454.854,"Even though the employer later said, well based on this evidence it is perfectly clear that it was the motel employee that pocketed the money, rather than the employees."
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2459.702,2463.081,"But that is extra legal, but if that were so, isn’t there—"
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2463.081,2463.56,--extra legal.
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2463.56,2473.407,"I know, but isn’t there an affirmative duty on the part of the grievant to go back to the committee that made the award --"
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2473.407,2479.167,"Even though there was a wrongful discharge on the actual facts, you have the right to rely on the grievance procedure."
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2479.167,2482.037,"Correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-1025,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2499.114,2501.245,What year was this grievance heard?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2501.245,2504.745,In 1967.
1975.74-1025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2504.745,2506.912,Is there a procedure for what you have suggested?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2506.912,2512.94,"Yes there is, they followed it once; that is for a rehearing on new evidence, there is a procedure."
1975.74-1025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2512.94,2515.287,"With no limitation, no time limitation?"
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2515.287,2517.3,There is no time limitation.
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2576.526,2583.205,Do you think it makes any difference if the employee has any access to the machinery himself?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2583.205,2586.015,"No, I do not think it makes any difference."
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.015,2592.254,So that in this case the employee may not himself invoke these procedures?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2592.254,2594.632,I do not know of anything in this labor agreement—
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.632,2596.785,Is this difficult that they may not do that?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2596.785,2602.158,"Well, I do not know of any situation where they would be prevented from doing it."
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.714,2616.67,"Well they filed a grievance, but let us assume that the employer rejects it the first level."
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2619.269,2620.998,The Union files it with the committe.
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2620.998,2623.904,Well isn’t only the Union that may do that?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2623.904,2626.969,I do not know of anything in the contract that would prevent the man to file any—
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2626.969,2628.184,Do you know of any instance?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2628.184,2629.107,"No, I know of none."
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2629.107,2630.141,Yes.
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2630.141,2631.391,I know of none.
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2646.774,2649.108,At least the employer then knows there has not been exhaustion.
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2649.108,2650.279,Precisely.
1975.74-1025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2750.001,2754.625,"Mr. Goldfarb, I do not understand that to be your brothers’ submission."
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2782.093,2785.875,"Well, to address myself to that particular—"
1975.74-1025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2785.875,2790.725,If I misunderstand it but it was my understanding of it.
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2790.725,2795.944,Perhaps I did not understand the question?
1975.74-1025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2795.944,2805.594,"The question was, are you -- do you think you are fairly paraphrasing your brother’s position because I thought you weren’t as I understood."
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2805.594,2806.474,I think I am.
1975.74-1025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2822.879,2826.518,"Because they could not be reinstated, because the employer can reinstate them."
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2826.518,2826.777,Correct.
1975.74-1025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2826.777,2828.159,"That is self evident, is it not?"
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2828.159,2832.675,And the Bench addressed the question that he could get a remedy from the Union.
1975.74-1025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2832.675,2833.526,Not reinstatement?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2833.526,2835.899,"But not reinstatement, that is correct."
1975.74-1025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2835.899,2839.598,"And it was wrongful discharge which was, of which they complained."
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2842.106,2851.939,"Yes, but the posture of this case before this court is that the wrongful discharge has been adjudicated and there is some finality."
1975.74-1025,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2852.674,2855.422,They are not asking for back pay?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2857.333,2862.597,Originally in their compliant they ask for a back pay.
1975.74-1025,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2862.597,2871.511,"If the employer is in the District Court, he is certainly exposed to a very-very large back pay award."
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2871.511,2872.778,Correct.
1975.74-1025,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2872.778,2874.572,Apart from reinstatement.
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2874.572,2882.006,"That is correct Mr. Chief Justice, but the Union can also satisfy a back pay award and money damages."
1975.74-1025,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2882.006,2892.851,"And they could satisfy a claim measured by the loss, a value of the failure to get reinstatement, even though that is very difficult to evaluate."
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2892.851,2902.216,"It would not be unique because it is done on wrongful death cases, it is done in all kinds of phases where you have to project earnings into the future."
1975.74-1025,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2906.422,2924.486,"But as I understood Mr. Goldfarb, however the position is that he has no, these employees have no cause of action against the Union for failure to give adequate representation in a discharge case, unless in fact there has been wrongful discharge."
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2963.783,2965.093,And we say—
1975.74-1025,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2965.093,2967.042,I know what you say but that is his position?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2967.042,2967.71,That is his position.
1975.74-1025,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2967.71,2975.863,"So as Mr. Justice Stewart, was suggesting to you earlier your characterization of this position does not seem quite accurate."
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,2975.863,3003.776,"That is the reading I got of it, but in any event this case boils down to a very simple proposition that once there has been an adjudication in the machinery, and the employer is free from any wrong, he should not be exposed to the jeopardy of going through any kind of litigation, if the Union was guilty of unfair representation."
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3004.199,3010.574,"But the duty of fair representation is a statutory duty, isn’t it?"
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,3010.574,3011.156,That is right.
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3011.156,3024.087,And your opponent’s argument is that the finality the attached to the grievance procedure should not obtain in full force unless the statutory duty has been satisfied.
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,3031.484,3049.977,"What inherent evils there would be in that type of situation? How easy it would be for Union to be guilty of unfair representation, and take a chance on a arbitration decision."
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.662,3068.786,Are there some cases that have gone with you on this matter?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,3068.786,3073.144,"No, this is a case of a, from our standpoint of first significance."
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3073.144,3076.392,There are cases against you though?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,3076.392,3080.602,"Not in, Your Honor, I respectfully submit to you Sir."
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3084.348,3085.411,When there has been exhaustion.
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,3085.411,3088.105,When there has been exhaustion.
1975.74-1025,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3118.528,3122.513,"You are quite right Mr. Goldfarb, in this Court’s cases."
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,3145.485,3149.889,"That is precisely it, Mr. Justice Brennan, precisely."
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3163.525,3172.442,"What if the arbitrators decision itself was subject to review on one of the very few grounds it is subject to, let us say for fraud or something."
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,3172.442,3174.58,I think it would be an entirely different situation.
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3178.376,3183.371,Even though you had a contractual right to rely on the grievance procedure?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,3183.371,3190.03,"Right, because fraud, collusion goes to the very higher deals with both parties."
1975.74-1025,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3195.633,3200.855,"No, I guess our cases have always said with that exception to the finality of arbitration?"
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,3200.855,3203.494,"Correct, there is not any question about it."
1975.74-1025,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3226.493,3235.516,Would you say that it is also a different case if in the complaint it were alleged that the Union and the employer were in cahoots?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,3235.516,3240.706,"I do not think there is any question about that either because that takes two, it is bilateral then."
1975.74-1025,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3245.477,3247.761,(Inaudible) if this case alleged him?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,3247.761,3248.986,No.
1975.74-1025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3248.986,3249.53,It did not?
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,3249.53,3250.543,No.
1975.74-1025,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3250.543,3269.241,"Well there is the question presented certainly does not put that to this hour, -- if you have collusion between the Union and the employer, almost by definition you have the sort of fraud that would be included in the grounds for reviewing arbitration?"
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,3269.241,3270.617,Be no question about it.
1975.74-1025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3320.571,3328.503,"Well the District Court granted summary judgment against all the parties, did not it?"
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,3328.503,3328.957,Yes.
1975.74-1025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3328.957,3335.866,"Well, and the Court of Appeals reversed this to one and no review is sought to that, wasn’t it?"
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,3335.866,3336.637,"No, Your Honor."
1975.74-1025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3336.637,3342.847,"See, we were without power to do what you have asked us to do."
1975.74-1025,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3342.847,3353.024,In the effect of the District Court’s action now affirmed or of the Court of Appeal’s action remanding the case for trial on the merits as against the Union.
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,3361.61,3364.951,I think the present posture of the case is precisely that.
1975.74-1025,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3370.132,3372.543,Just as they would have against a lawyer for malpractice --
1975.74-1025,1,17678,bernard_s_goldfarb,,3372.543,3391.295,"Malpractice, and just as against they would have against anybody for any tort that cause them many damage."
1975.74-1025,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3395.337,3397.572,"Thank you, do you have anything further Mr. Schwartz?"
1975.74-1025,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,3397.572,3401.901,"Yes Mr. Chief Justice, thank you."
1975.74-1025,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3452.904,3453.911,When?
1975.74-1025,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,3457.264,3459.082,Yes it was.
1975.74-1025,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3459.082,3477.712,"Do you suggest that it will not undermine grievance and arbitration processes in the area of labor, employer and labor relations, eight years later and you would still be reexamining what appeared to be a final award at that time?"
1975.74-1025,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,3477.712,3482.184,"It is only eight years later, Your Honor, because of all the proceedings in the courts below --"
1975.74-1025,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3482.184,3484.782,"Yes, whatever the reasons it is eight years later?"
1975.74-1025,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,3484.782,3486.096,It is eight years later.
1975.74-1025,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3486.096,3493.46,"Which has greatly enhanced any possible claims, does it here involve?"
1975.74-1025,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,3493.46,3504.24,Except since 1968 the company has been on notice that Mr. Pegano has admitted to his own wrongdoing that the men were innocent.
1975.74-1025,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3543.886,3566.254,"But I am sure it is not beyond the realms of practicalities of employees who lose arbitration awards, thereafter may find a reason of saying that they were not properly represented by the Union in the grievance procedure."
1975.74-1025,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,3566.254,3568.12,It is not also beyond the realm of --
1975.74-1025,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3568.12,3569.947,"No, no, but isn’t that so?"
1975.74-1025,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,3569.947,3570.626,That is within—
1975.74-1025,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3570.626,3580.552,"If that so I suppose this adds something so far at least, that the case that is in uncertainties is to the finality of arbitration awards?"
1975.74-1025,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,3580.552,3589.572,"Except, the Sixth Circuit did not say that the mere allegations of bad faith and misrepresentation entitles us to litigate, there is a substantial amount of evidence of both of those things."
1975.74-1025,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3604.06,3607.623,Nobody says you are staying in Court just by alleging there was a mistake?
1975.74-1025,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,3607.623,3608.198,That is right.
1975.74-1025,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3608.198,3609.025,It would be bad faith.
1975.74-1025,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,3609.025,3613.305,That is right.
1975.74-1025,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3613.486,3613.925,Thank you gentleman.
