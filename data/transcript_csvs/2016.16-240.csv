2016.16-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.125,"We'll hear argument next in Case 16-240, Weaver v. Massachusetts. Mr. Kimberly."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,6.125,32.449,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The upshot in practice of the Commonwealth's proposed rule in this case is that when a criminal defendant like Petitioner demonstrates that his trial counsel failed to preserve the fundamental fairness of the criminal proceeding by failing to object and, therefore, allowing to stand a structural error, the gravest kind of constitutional error there can be in the course of a criminal trial."
2016.16-240,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,58.62,65.795,The problem is the structural errors -- I think one brings -- put it this way -- come in all sizes and shapes.
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,101.3,104.28,"The short answer, Your Honor, is no."
2016.16-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,171.395,180.61,"I -- I -- this may not be directly pertinent, but why was the courtroom considered closed? I mean, it was filled with members of the public."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,200.005,203.97,"Well, I -- I would have thought that the courtroom -- so the --"
2016.16-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,203.97,205.67,"Not -- I mean, it's a limited space."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,206.39,206.52,Sure.
2016.16-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,206.52,212.66,"-- spaces and it's -- you know, he's got to get the jury pool in there and, you know, they took up all the space."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,228.145,231.49,So I -- there are two elements to that question.
2016.16-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,244.76,250.16,"Well, but -- but you -- presumably, I guess the argument is, well, they were turned away because there was no -- no room."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,256.74,259.475,So -- and that leads to the second answer.
2016.16-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,274.175,281.73,"I'll have to go back and look at Presley, but courtroom overcrowding is not a justification for turning away other people, what are they supposed to do?"
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,281.73,285.455,"Well, but to be very clear, that is precisely what happened in Presley."
2016.16-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,286.45,293.85,"What did they say in Presley that you were supposed to do? In other words, there's no room in the courtroom, and you say, well, that's not a justification for keeping people out."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,293.85,301.53,"So the answer is very simply bringing in the jury venire in groups of, say, 40 rather than allowing all 90 in at once."
2016.16-240,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,310.18,312.98,"Presumably, lawyers are members of the public."
2016.16-240,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,326.7,334.78,And so I think they have stopped being a member of the public as might be understood with respect to access.
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,342.21,342.845,Right.
2016.16-240,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,342.845,343.56,All right.
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,354.75,355.87,That's exactly right.
2016.16-240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,416.35,440.54,"So what -- what you're saying, and I -- I think this is true -- is that there are circumstances in which closing the courtroom can have an effect on the outcome of the -- of the trial. But, conversely, is it your position that it's never possible for there to be a violation of the right without there being an effect on the trial; that it's never possible to show that this could not have had any effect on the outcome?"
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,440.54,441.56,I think that's right.
2016.16-240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,445.79,446.61,As a practical matter --
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,446.61,446.86,-- in -- in Waller.
2016.16-240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,446.86,452.34,"As a practical matter, it's never possible to show that it -- there -- it would -- there would be no outcome -- no effect on the outcome?"
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,452.34,459.0,I -- I think this is precisely the sort of situation that the Court recognized in Gonzalez-Lopez about the right to counsel of choice.
2016.16-240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,459.26,459.47,So in this --
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,459.47,460.33,-- speculative inquiry.
2016.16-240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,460.33,465.56,"In -- in this case, what's your best theory about how this could have affected the trial? What happened here?"
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,465.56,481.565,"Well, as I was just describing, there's no way to tell what effect the presence of the defendant's mother would have had on the impression made to the jurors, who, again, were first introduced to him and -- and formed their first impression of him sitting alone without the support of anybody."
2016.16-240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,541.83,549.23,"Well, suppose the two people who couldn't get in were members of the public, but not the defendant's mother and her pastor."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,549.23,552.68,"Well, again, I think it would depend on -- on who they are."
2016.16-240,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,570.87,580.895,"Could -- could I ask you, though, there is a big difference between the absence of an attorney at trial or a conflict of interest."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,601.95,602.31,Sure.
2016.16-240,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,602.31,606.29,The defendant doesn't know enough to object.
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,624.63,627.595,In -- in -- in circumstances where that isn't actually the truth?
2016.16-240,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,627.595,628.22,No.
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,630.105,630.59,So --
2016.16-240,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,630.59,642.055,"In -- in virtually every circumstance, the lawyer knows there's been a closure. There's been plain error in his failure -- his or her failure to object."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,652.845,661.36,"Well, I think the same way that the judge would do so in any case implicating a Strickland claim based on a failure to object."
2016.16-240,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,717.575,725.33,"Well, why doesn't that follow, though? Because it seems to me that if it's unpreserved error at trial and we get to appeal, you -- you have a choice."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,734.195,734.83,Correct.
2016.16-240,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,734.83,739.21,"-- and show it affects the integrity of the proceedings, or you have a choice."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,783.22,788.44,"So the -- the question about plain error, first, I think it depends on the jurisdiction that you're in."
2016.16-240,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,790.88,792.8,"Well, work with me with the typical jurisdiction."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,794.53,797.555,"Well, so there -- there are groups of two."
2016.16-240,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,801.44,811.995,"Work with -- work with the usual, the Federal jurisdiction, which is predominant in most States, which is that IECs are done collaterally."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,811.995,813.73,"And -- and, actually, I appreciate it."
2016.16-240,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,817.21,819.9,"I -- I understand that, but, please, just -- just stick with me."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,819.9,840.785,"So under Rule 54(b) in the Federal proceeding -- in -- in the Federal context, this would be Olano four-pronged plain error context, we -- we think it's true that, for the most part in the way that the lower Federal courts have dealt with it, is that the third prong -- effect on substantial rights, is presumed when there is a structural error."
2016.16-240,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,843.47,845.645,"It's still a prong 4, though, right?"
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,845.645,846.42,It's still a prong 4.
2016.16-240,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,857.34,864.79,"Defense counsel just doesn't bring it -- doesn't bring it on direct appeal. Good defence counsel wouldn't bring it, and would leave it for collateral review in most jurisdictions."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,864.79,865.675,Sure.
2016.16-240,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,874.04,874.87,It's available.
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,892.77,892.86,Uh-huh.
2016.16-240,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,892.86,913.83,"-- so that they could measure the possible effects or not, and end up saying that the substantial integrity of the proceedings haven't been violated? Do you think that, as a matter of law, we could overrule a finding of that nature, if it was in direct review under plain error?"
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,913.83,924.25,"I think in most circumstances in -- in -- where there's a structural error that passes the third, it will almost always pass the fourth."
2016.16-240,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,924.48,927.235,"Oh, that's not the -- the lessons of our case law."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,927.235,928.31,"Well, there's -- I -- I --"
2016.16-240,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,928.31,930.845,I think reverse is true of our case law.
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,930.845,987.37,"I -- I don't mean to deny that the fourth prong has -- has -- does real work. It -- it certainly does, and there are case-specific circumstances in which maybe then the appellate court would decline to grant relief on collateral review, and the defendant would, in that circumstance, be able to bring a collateral challenge under Strickland. The -- the one -- I just want to push back a little bit on the hypothetical, because, in fact, there are a number of State jurisdictions in which plain error review of this sort isn't available at all because they decline to presume prejudice on whatever the equivalent of Olano prong 3 is, and Massachusetts is such a State. And so in our case, in -- in any State court jurisdiction where State courts have leeway to undertake whatever plain error -- procedural plain error rules they like, they aren't bound by this Court's or the Federal courts' precedence on Rule 54(b)"
2016.16-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1065.505,1070.87,The -- the structural errors are not the most grievous errors possible in the criminal process.
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1084.585,1108.375,"Well, I -- I don't think that they're necessarily shocking, but I would say that this Court's structural error precedents make clear that although one feature of a structural error is that it's impossible to -- to determine the practical consequences, it is an independent feature of structural errors that they render the trials fundamentally unfair. The idea is that the rights that are protected by the structural error doctrine are just essential elements to a fair trial."
2016.16-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1114.09,1114.34,Yeah.
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1144.71,1145.16,And --
2016.16-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1145.16,1154.87,"A list of errors that could occur in criminal procedure, I think you'd agree, there's some that you would put ahead of excluding members of the public from voir dire when the courtroom is otherwise full."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1154.87,1159.39,I -- I -- and I didn't mean to suggest or -- or overstate the grievousness of the error.
2016.16-240,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1174.205,1178.51,"But, in a way, Mr. Kimberly, I mean, you don't have to convince us of that, do you?"
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1178.51,1180.125,I -- I hope not.
2016.16-240,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1180.125,1180.74,Yeah.
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1190.95,1192.06,That's correct.
2016.16-240,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1192.06,1205.42,"And -- and that's really what's at issue here, is whether we should put the defendant to the burden of showing how it affected the trial, when, in fact, we've said over and over that you can't do that."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1205.42,1206.03,I think --
2016.16-240,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1206.03,1214.965,"So whether they're important, whether they're not important, whether they're critical to fundamental fairness or not, you know, is, in some ways, beside the point."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1214.965,1221.2,"Well, I -- so I think there are two independent ways of thinking about it, and that certainly is -- is one very important way of thinking about it."
2016.16-240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1228.68,1231.24,"Well, it's not a question of putting two wrongs together."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1298.45,1299.73,I -- I think that's exactly right.
2016.16-240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1338.99,1353.04,"And -- and you have to say that that's always true, or it's -- it's true in such a high percentage of the cases that there's no point in even making that an issue, no matter how steep the burden that the prosecution might have to satisfy."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1353.04,1356.21,That -- that is -- that is the reasoning underlying Cronic.
2016.16-240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1391.28,1394.1,Let's put this label aside for a minute.
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1403.765,1405.07,"Again, I --"
2016.16-240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1405.07,1407.95,It's impossible to ever -- for there ever to be such a case --
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1407.95,1409.25,It's -- it's impossible to tell.
2016.16-240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1467.925,1470.74,"Well, that's a different -- I mean, that's a different situation."
2016.16-240,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1484.775,1491.11,I -- I think -- I think that would implicate many of the same problems that we have here.
2016.16-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1549.96,1559.614,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ravitz."
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,1559.614,1589.615,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The claim before the Court is one of ineffective assistance of counsel, and requiring individualized prejudice to be proven for claims like that, claims like the Petitioner's, ensures that a criminal judgment is not vacated unless a violation of the right to effective counsel is complete. It tells us whether the defendant's own conviction resulted from a breakdown in the adversarial process, or was likely the -- the right outcome."
2016.16-240,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1595.255,1605.84,Supposing this objection had been made at the first opportunity and it's denied by the trial judge.
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,1623.165,1627.775,"Assuming the judge's decision was improper, yes, that -- that's what would happen in Massachusetts."
2016.16-240,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1663.64,1679.12,"Unless it's a -- unless the fact that it's a structural error is fatal, then in the situation -- in -- in the hypothetical Justice Ginsburg provided, wouldn't it be open to you to prove that it was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt?"
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,1679.12,1683.26,That's -- that's correct if -- if it was not a structural error.
2016.16-240,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1690.65,1695.285,"And what's -- and what -- is there a structural error in this case, in your view, under the hypothetical?"
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,1695.285,1717.8,"Where -- where there was an improper closure of the trial, we -- we respect the fact that -- or I should say of jury selection -- we respect the fact that the Court has said that public trial errors are structural, and that the Court has said that the closure of jury selection is a public trial error. However, not all structural errors should be treated the same, and not all public trial errors should be treated the same."
2016.16-240,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1720.76,1726.47,"And under Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, there's an objection, the objection is overruled, it's wrongly overruled."
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,1739.615,1744.4,The -- this Court in Presley did not address remedies.
2016.16-240,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1773.27,1774.935,"Yes, but what -- what's your line?"
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,1774.935,1775.885,Excuse me?
2016.16-240,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1775.885,1786.605,"I mean, do you -- suppose that the structural error were excluding African-Americans from the jury, or women from the jury. Okay? That's the error."
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,1825.249,1828.39,It is our position that prejudice would need to be proven.
2016.16-240,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1828.39,1828.955,You can't.
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,1866.065,1868.7,"Well, the Court hasn't said that --"
2016.16-240,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1868.7,1870.11,I -- I don't care what the Court said.
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,1870.11,1870.28,Okay.
2016.16-240,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1870.28,1885.18,"I'm asking my question. And my question, I thought, until I'm getting this answer, that, of course, in some instances, you say it was such an unfair trial, and you show inadequate assistance of counsel and that's the end of it."
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,1890.845,1891.6,Right.
2016.16-240,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1904.81,1907.55,I'm not interested in Strickland at the moment.
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,1929.735,1931.1,The --
2016.16-240,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1931.1,1940.94,"I -- I would have thought that you would have said, of course, in such a case, inadequate assistance of counsel for not raising that error leads to a new trial."
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,1948.86,1986.73,"I will say that the -- the Court's approach in Cronic made sense, that there what the Court said was prejudice would be presumed where it's highly likely that there was, in fact, prejudice, and not just any type of prejudice, but prejudice in the sense of a breakdown in the adversary process; in other words, prejudice to the right at issue because of circumstances on the order of a -- of a complete denial of counsel. And I say that makes sense because by focusing on the likelihood, the high likelihood, we are not saying that something actually existed merely because we don't know whether it existed."
2016.16-240,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1997.09,1997.24,All right.
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,1997.24,1997.42,-- the Court.
2016.16-240,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1997.42,2007.145,"So the rule that you're asking us to adopt today, Cronic said an absolute absence of counsel, you presume prejudice."
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,2032.91,2033.655,Yes.
2016.16-240,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2058.36,2080.19,"What's wrong -- wouldn't it be logical to say that there are -- that structural errors on the reliability of a trial are affected by the quality of the violation? A partial closure, improper as it may be, is not the same as a total closure."
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,2097.735,2123.28,"Well, but -- but the reliability that Strickland and Cronic talked about is where the result of the trial is rendered unreliable because of a breakdown in -- in the -- the adversary process, so it focuses in on the heart of the right at issue. The Petitioner here could have pursued a standalone public-trial claim, and then we would be talking about the rights underlying that."
2016.16-240,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2207.72,2220.535,"Mr. -- Mr. Ravitz, I don't know, maybe this is a simple-minded way to look at things, but I've always thought Strickland, it's about the fairness and the reliability of the trial process. And that's a pretty important thing to be concerned about."
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,2281.855,2292.54,"Well, when the Court said that it was difficult to prove prejudice from this kind of error, it wasn't talking about the reasonable probability standard of Strickland."
2016.16-240,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2318.125,2326.845,"Well, but then what you're asking us to do is you're asking us to apply Strickland in such a way that we're saying this terrible attorney error took place because we're assuming that."
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,2344.149,2345.35,No.
2016.16-240,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2375.32,2381.025,"I -- I just -- I'm sorry to keep, like, bugging you about this, but it just seems so Kafkaesque to me."
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,2384.405,2388.52,"Well, I wouldn't even say that -- that it can't be proven, because looking --"
2016.16-240,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2388.52,2389.515,But we've said it.
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,2392.16,2396.11,The -- the Court hasn't said it about a reasonable probability standard.
2016.16-240,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2479.535,2489.725,"Well, let's say, I mean, the argument on the other side is that one of the most important things about the trial is to have the mother with the young offender."
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,2506.46,2513.295,They are right that that was unfortunate and it shouldn't have happened. As to whether it had an effect on the judgment --
2016.16-240,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2513.295,2513.47,Yeah.
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,2513.47,2514.81,-- that's something different.
2016.16-240,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2514.81,2516.125,"Well, how do you prove it?"
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,2516.125,2526.665,"Well, again, the -- the -- a defendant can aim to show a connection between the spectators and what happened at the trial."
2016.16-240,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2538.42,2539.37,"Yeah, that's a different case."
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,2542.435,2551.51,"The defendant probably would have had a great difficulty showing it because it was so likely to have occurred, but that doesn't mean that there was a breakdown in the system."
2016.16-240,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2647.965,2649.53,"Thank you, counsel."
2016.16-240,1,62832,rndall_e_ravitz,,2649.53,2662.885,Thank you very much.
2016.16-240,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2662.885,2664.08,Ms. O'Connell.
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2664.08,2677.985,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin where my co-counsel just left off here with the idea that any time a structural error occurs, it leads to fundamental unfairness and unreliability in the outcome of the trial."
2016.16-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2753.55,2758.88,That would be an awful lot of -- that -- that's exactly what's worrying me.
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2830.56,2830.91,Right.
2016.16-240,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2856.17,2870.8,"Is there a distinction between the -- the examples that you gave where -- where it would appear that the issue would be a question of harmless error, and the situation here, where the question is whether there's a constitutional error at all?"
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2870.8,2879.56,"Well -- so I think that this case has been litigated on the assumption that there has been a constitutional error, a -- a Sixth Amendment violation of the public power."
2016.16-240,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2879.56,2879.62,No.
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2885.6,2885.76,"Oh, right."
2016.16-240,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2885.76,2888.405,-- of the right to trial -- the right to counsel.
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2888.405,2890.655,I must have misunderstood the question.
2016.16-240,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2890.83,2891.48,Okay.
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2897.075,2897.815,That's correct.
2016.16-240,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2897.815,2902.975,And there is no violation of the right to counsel based purely on deficient performance; isn't that right?
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2902.975,2903.6,Correct.
2016.16-240,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2903.6,2907.69,So there has to be -- the prejudice prong has to be satisfied.
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2907.69,2908.38,Yes.
2016.16-240,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2908.38,2920.655,"But I thought your understanding of Batson was that you were saying when an attorney is deficient, as respects to a Batson claim, there, too, you would say that -- sort of too bad."
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2920.655,2921.44,Yes.
2016.16-240,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2925.28,2929.89,"So your -- your examples were ineffective assistance of counsel cases, not just Batson cases."
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2929.89,2930.47,No.
2016.16-240,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2934.81,2938.24,But that's the underlying violation of the ineffective assistance claim.
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2938.24,2938.47,Correct.
2016.16-240,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2938.74,2942.65,"And you would say the same rule would go, and you have to prove prejudice."
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2942.65,2943.13,Correct.
2016.16-240,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2943.13,2946.08,Even though we've said over and over that you can't prove prejudice.
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2946.08,2952.16,"Well, I think on that point, Justice Kagan, the idea that you can't prove prejudice, the Court said it's difficult to do."
2016.16-240,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2976.5,2982.575,"You know, I'm not saying that there aren't cases where you can have a sort of gut intuition as to whether it did or not."
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3007.78,3016.43,"And -- and so that, Justice Kagan, is the rationale for -- for not letting the government prove harmless error if the objection is preserved."
2016.16-240,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3060.23,3065.085,I don't think we've ever really talked about burdens when we label things structural errors.
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3084.685,3093.76,"I -- I think in -- in Strickland, it's clear that the -- the -- proving each prong of Strickland deficient performance and prejudice is on the defendant."
2016.16-240,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3103.73,3106.785,"Well, it's not meant to be easy, but it's meant to be possible."
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3113.78,3148.24,"Well, I guess I'd like to push back on that a little bit, though, and -- I mean, I could give an example in the public-trial context in specific where, you know, a lot of times when this particular right is at issue or is violated, it's with respect to the courtroom closure for one witness, say an undercover police officer, a rape victim, a child, or something like that. And if -- you know, if the courtroom is closed for that witness's testimony and there's no objection, and on appeal, the -- the court of appeals says, oh, well, that was a -- that courtroom closure was unjustified under the Waller factors."
2016.16-240,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3170.35,3186.92,"Is the difficulty in any particular case something that can be weighed in determining whether the defendant has carried his burden of showing prejudice? I mean, in some of these, you say -- I guess we haven't required in some Batson cases, I think it would be -- that's where I do think it would be almost impossible to put the burden on showing prejudice."
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3199.7,3208.31,"I -- no, I think so. In Strickland, I think it's page 459 of Strickland, the Court describes the test for how to do a case-by-case prejudice inquiry under Strickland."
2016.16-240,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3233.15,3249.825,"How -- how about here? And we get into the whole problem with speedy trial, they close it -- pardon me -- lack of public trial. They close it for an hour, they close for half a day, they close it for a day, they close it for two days, they close it for the voir dire. How -- how do we go about looking at that? Is -- is that presented in this case?"
2016.16-240,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3249.825,3255.32,"Well, I think this case has been litigated on the assumption that there was a Sixth Amendment violation here."
2016.16-240,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3284.79,3288.98,"Thank you, Ms. O'Connell. Mr. Kimberly."
2016.16-240,3,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3288.98,3291.31,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2016.16-240,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3317.39,3322.93,"What about -- what about counsel's argument we just heard a moment ago, that there's a triviality exception."
2016.16-240,3,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3326.78,3330.015,"So, one, we don't disagree that there is a triviality exception."
2016.16-240,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3362.18,3362.66,I understand.
2016.16-240,3,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3365.81,3372.39,"Well, I don't think the Court needs to look any further than Presley v. Georgia. Presley v. Georgia involved precisely the same circumstances here."
2016.16-240,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3383.2,3386.99,It didn't -- didn't get involved with the structural.
2016.16-240,3,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3406.235,3414.5,"That's correct, Your Honor. That question is answered by Waller itself, which said that it's the proceeding itself that's closed that has to be redone."
2016.16-240,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3433.72,3457.945,"What about using it -- if we're going to distinguish among substantial -- among structural errors, taking the standard out of Allano and saying those that seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, if the -- if the procedural -- if the structural error rises to meet that standard, then -- then you don't have to show prejudice."
2016.16-240,3,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3468.74,3468.96,Yes.
2016.16-240,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3470.71,3472.365,What do you think about that?
2016.16-240,3,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3472.365,3475.65,I don't think that there's a basis in this Court's structural error precedence --
2016.16-240,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3475.65,3476.47,"No, that's true."
2016.16-240,3,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3476.47,3476.8,-- for drawing --
2016.16-240,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3476.8,3479.035,"But you're asking us -- you say, no, none."
2016.16-240,3,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3482.96,3483.27,Right.
2016.16-240,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3483.27,3483.89,Okay.
2016.16-240,3,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3492.99,3515.49,"I -- I guess it's, at least as we understand what this Court has said about structural errors, which is that they undermine -- and I should say, in particular, the public-trial right, which goes to the very perception of the judiciary by the public and -- and undermines, in our view, certainly, and this Court said in Richmond Newspapers and Press-Enterprises, that courtroom closures -- and those cases, by the way, were --"
2016.16-240,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3515.49,3516.63,But that's the third prong.
2016.16-240,3,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3526.085,3526.96,That's true.
2016.16-240,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3534.31,3534.655,Right.
2016.16-240,3,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3534.655,3536.46,-- the two tests don't overlap.
2016.16-240,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3547.89,3557.94,"Doesn't that seem highly unlikely? I mean, a structural error, we think is important, but it isn't automatically a winner every single time if you don't preserve it."
2016.16-240,3,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3557.94,3559.14,May I answer?
2016.16-240,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3559.14,3559.585,Please.
2016.16-240,3,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3559.585,3560.87,"That's right, Your Honor."
2016.16-240,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3578.005,3578.355,Thank you.
2016.16-240,3,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3578.355,3587.18,"-- and -- and so that could be raised on a Strickland basis, and counsel could obtain -- the defendant could obtain relief in that context."
2016.16-240,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3587.18,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
