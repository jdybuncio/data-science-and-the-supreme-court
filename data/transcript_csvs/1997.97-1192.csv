1997.97-1192,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.768,"We'll hear argument now in Number 97-1192, Swidler & Berlin and James Hamilton v. the United States."
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,11.15,16.172,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-1192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.966,177.467,"It's an exception that pretty much swallows up the rule though, isn't it?"
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,177.467,178.368,Well--
1997.97-1192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,178.368,182.191,"I mean, like 95 percent of the cases involve the exception to the rule."
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,182.191,195.74,"--Justice Scalia, that is correct, but they apply to a very specific situation, when there is a will contest, where there is a question about the testator's intent."
1997.97-1192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,195.74,205.948,"It's very specific, but it also happens to be the situation that is most likely to arise with respect to privilege as to a decedent."
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,205.948,206.569,Justice Souter--
1997.97-1192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.569,208.759,It's precisely the situation most likely to arise.
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,208.759,214.043,"--Justice Scalia, it is certainly the situation that has arisen most in the past."
1997.97-1192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,223.77,237.87,"How many cases upholding the privilege uphold it, uphold it against either a demand by a prosecutor in the... in a criminal case, or a grand jury request?"
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,237.87,240.732,There are only two cases that I know of.
1997.97-1192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,249.46,282.782,"Counsel, I recognize that the time frame for your briefing was compressed, but I think there may be at least a misimpression left by your footnote 22 at page 21 and it bears, too, on Judge Tatel's discussion and it bears, too, on your opening remarks that the States say the privilege does not survive."
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,343.053,352.079,"Justice Kennedy, I believe that California is the only jurisdiction that has that specific reservation or provision--"
1997.97-1192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,352.079,355.1,Have other States addressed the problem?
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,358.443,363.475,--Our study of the State statutes find that they do not.
1997.97-1192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,366.098,367.088,That they do not address the point.
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,367.088,370.25,"--That they... well, that they do not specifically address the point."
1997.97-1192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,370.25,386.312,"Well, and if the administrator of the estate is designated as the one to exercise the privilege, then that means the lawyer alone would not be able to exercise it, so it seems to me you can infer that it expires."
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,386.312,407.395,"Justice Kennedy, in a number of States, close to 20 States, the State provisions apply, or say that the lawyer also can assert the privilege, not just the personal representative but the lawyer also and, of course, that indicates that the survival of the privilege has nothing to do with the winding up of the estate."
1997.97-1192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,407.395,417.082,"But if I'm correct about California, you would agree that that is relevant in considering whether or not experience shows that this causes a problem."
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,417.082,421.865,I will agree that it is a relevant factor.
1997.97-1192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,438.567,442.27,"Was that post the 1965 California amendment, do you know?"
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,442.27,445.53,"I believe it was, but I'll have to check the date of the case--"
1997.97-1192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,445.53,445.741,All right.
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,528.877,563.749,"--Well, there certainly are some exceptions that you have mentioned, but so far, with the exception of this case and the one case in Pennsylvania, there has been no case that has found that in a nontestamentary situation that the privilege expires when the client dies, and I would suggest, as I suggested to Justice Scalia, that if this Court upholds the lower court decision we will have many, many more cases that will raise this particular issue."
1997.97-1192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,563.749,566.391,It hasn't happened in California for 35 years.
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,566.391,579.271,"But if the Supreme Court of the United States announces that the privilege expires upon death, I think that we will find many, many more cases raising this particular issue."
1997.97-1192,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,579.271,583.715,May I ask if the California statute has been construed by the California supreme court?
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,583.715,587.117,By the California supreme court?
1997.97-1192,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,598.586,599.728,It barred the testimony--
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,599.728,599.928,Yes.
1997.97-1192,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,599.928,601.508,--in a case construing the statute?
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,601.508,601.749,Yes.
1997.97-1192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,601.749,612.347,"Judge Williams did say further, in some States the privilege does not survive the winding up of an estate, and cited California for that proposition."
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,618.22,620.123,The Foster estate is not wound up.
1997.97-1192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,620.123,628.038,"But the period of claims is 3 months, the period for filing claims against the estate is 3 months in Arkansas?"
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,628.038,629.971,I believe that is correct.
1997.97-1192,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,634.145,639.197,"But if this were California you would be able to assert the privilege, is that right?"
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,656.868,665.564,"I... if the question is whether the attorney is the Personal Representative, I don't believe the statutes have been interpreted that way, Justice Breyer."
1997.97-1192,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,665.564,689.471,"--No, it says in California that if there is... you can't claim the privilege if there is no holder of the privilege in existence, and the holder of the privilege is defined as a Personal Representative of the client, so if you were to construe that as saying the privilege dies after the estate's closed, still you'd be able to assert it here because the estate hasn't closed."
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,689.471,690.192,That's correct.
1997.97-1192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,690.192,691.924,Mr. Hamilton--
1997.97-1192,0,30691,james_hamilton,,697.576,703.681,"Well, under California law the Personal Representative is the one who can assert the privilege."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,1642.015,1649.038,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-1192,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1676.461,1678.02,Who are Mueller & Kirkpatrick?
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,1678.02,1679.442,--They are two commentators on the law of evidence.
1997.97-1192,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1679.442,1679.762,Oh.
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,1679.762,1680.463,That will mean that--
1997.97-1192,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1683.087,1687.108,They're not quite as well known as Professor Wigmore and the like.
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,1687.108,1701.506,"That will mean that innocent people will be wrongly convicted and guilty people will be wrongly exonerated, each of which implicates a substantial societal interest."
1997.97-1192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1706.201,1724.173,"Mr. Kavanaugh, we've been just told by Mr. Hamilton that he wouldn't take it to that extreme, where it's a question of a defendant who was convicted... who's charged with a crime, and the information was that some other person had done that and the lawyer knew that."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,1735.894,1752.874,"If that's true that he's not pressing it to the logical extreme, that undercuts entirely his chilling effect argument, because the person consulting his attorney before death will not have the expectation of confidentiality on which their entire theory is premised."
1997.97-1192,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1752.874,1760.921,"No, you're only leaving out the case where he's confessing to a crime, and there are a lot of consultations between lawyers and clients where the client does not confess to a crime."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,1760.921,1786.056,"That's right, Justice Stevens, but the most likely issue about which a client might consult an attorney in which the communications might be sought after death are testamentary cases, and in that circumstance the law has long established... over a century in this Court... that the privilege does not survive death, notwithstanding, notwithstanding the embarrassment and the harm to reputation that can ensue from disclosure--"
1997.97-1192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1786.056,1787.669,"Yes, but the assumption... no, please."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,1803.989,1804.63,"--Well, in that--"
1997.97-1192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.63,1805.781,My son did the crime.
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,1817.782,1819.571,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-1192,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1819.571,1822.003,"Well, my point is, there are a of consultations where nobody committed a crime."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,1822.003,1823.653,That's right.
1997.97-1192,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1823.653,1828.366,You can't assume all consultations between client and lawyer involve criminal behavior.
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,1832.78,1840.795,"But most likely consultation, again, will be in the testamentary context, and there the law has long established that the privilege--"
1997.97-1192,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1840.795,1844.739,How do we know that's the most likely consultation between lawyer and client?
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,1850.104,1857.498,"--The most likely situation in which the communications would be sought after death, experience tells us, are testamentary cases."
1997.97-1192,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1858.33,1866.414,"And maybe one reason for that is, it has generally been assumed, as the literature is unanimous on it, that these conversations are privileged."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,1866.414,1867.616,--We don't know--
1997.97-1192,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1867.616,1873.188,"That is the background assumption, on the cases you describe all say they are exceptions from the general rule."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,1873.188,1876.571,--Exceptions from the general rule of attorney-client privilege.
1997.97-1192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1895.184,1909.053,"No, but does that prove very much for your side, because the theory of the testamentary exception is that the client would, in fact, want the lawyer to talk for the purpose of implementing whatever the client's intent was."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,1932.948,1934.831,"Two points in response, Justice Souter."
1997.97-1192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1956.916,1988.586,"Well, we may not in the sense that in this case there is in fact a statement that can be attributed to the client saying, I want you to talk or I don't want you to talk, but it seems to me there is a reasonable argument that the client wants the object of his testamentary intent to be served and if in order to serve it, it is necessary to disclose something, it's reasonable to suppose the client would want the disclosure."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,1991.999,2022.339,"--Well, it may be reasonable to suppose but most believe that that's the one situation above all others where clients would be chilled to nondisclosure by the possibility of posthumous disclosure of the attorney-client communications, and if we're going to presume intent in that context, why do we not also presume intent in this context: presume that a person near death would want to fulfill what this Court has called his basic obligation as a citizen to provide information to the grand jury?"
1997.97-1192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2024.332,2033.298,"Because there are a great many people who know they have that obligation, or at least that there is a general theory that they have that obligation, but they do not, in fact, want to fulfill it."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2037.239,2049.498,"--Well, it's again what we should presume someone's intent to be, and if we presume it in the testamentary context, even though it's going to be embarrassing information about one's family members, it could cause great harm--"
1997.97-1192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2049.498,2054.042,"Well, if I may interrupt you, I think it's the difference between a presumption of fact and a presumption of law."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2084.005,2091.639,"--Well, again, I guess we just have a disagreement about what people would want done in the testamentary context as well, but--"
1997.97-1192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2091.639,2096.172,"May I ask you a different question, which hasn't specifically come up, I think."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2100.166,2119.568,"--This Court has stated repeatedly that privileges obstruct the search for truth and thus must be strictly construed, so to the extent there's a burden with respect to a legal issue, we would suppose that the burden would be on petitioners to establish what they want here, which is--"
1997.97-1192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2119.568,2151.97,"What if we... if we assume... and I realize that you dispute this, but if we assume, in fact, the understanding of the profession has been, at least for a very long time, that there is a privilege as broad as Mr. Hamilton argues for, so that we start with a privilege which has been established, then I suppose the burden would be upon you, in fact, to justify a curtailment."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2151.97,2157.045,"--Well, in the... the testamentary exception did not exist forever, either."
1997.97-1192,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2179.29,2185.975,"Mr. Kavanaugh, you're confining your argument to the... to a criminal case?"
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2185.975,2187.606,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.97-1192,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2187.606,2209.862,"Now, when you say a criminal case, do you mean a case where the statement made by the client to the attorney has perhaps some earmarks of a declaration against penal interest, or is it just any statement made by the client towards the attorney which might be admissible or useful to a criminal investigation?"
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2209.862,2211.765,"It's the latter, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.97-1192,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2211.765,2234.078,"In that context your brief, I think at about page 8, indicates, well, there's no danger to the client of criminal liability once... after his death, but there is substantial danger of civil liability."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2247.789,2256.014,The rule we seek in this case leaves open one of two possibilities in a civil case in which the estate is a party.
1997.97-1192,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2301.246,2328.844,"I think that perhaps understates the... one reason which I think is generally agreed to, that the client must feel free to tell the lawyer, you know, the truth, the whole truth, et cetera, so that the lawyer will be able to give him good legal advice, and it seems to me when you narrow the rationale the way you do, perhaps you overlook some of that."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2328.844,2335.729,"--Well, we think the attorney-client privilege, as it is developed over time, represents not a single policy."
1997.97-1192,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2352.321,2352.87,Mr.--
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2393.703,2407.754,"The American Law Institute, which does represent the interest of judges and lawyers, and has been followed by this Court in many different bodies of law, has concluded, in agreement with our position, that the privilege should end after death."
1997.97-1192,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2408.496,2416.522,"Well, Mr. Kavanaugh, that position is not really supported by much of any case law that I can find."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2449.055,2449.426,--The--
1997.97-1192,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2449.426,2451.216,Is that how you understand the holding?
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2451.216,2460.182,"--The court of appeals did require that the information be, quote, of relative importance, a standard that they said was plainly met in this case."
1997.97-1192,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2460.182,2465.305,But it seemed to be some kind of a balancing test applied case by case.
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2472.663,2480.94,"We support that approach, but we also pointed out in our brief that it may be somewhat inconsistent with what this Court has done in cases such as Branzburg, where--"
1997.97-1192,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2480.94,2481.72,"Yes, I think it is."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2485.683,2501.243,"--In many cases it has, and that's why we pointed out in our brief that in cases such as Branzburg and University of Pennsylvania within the context of grand jury proceedings the need has already been established."
1997.97-1192,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2507.718,2507.948,Mr.--
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2517.015,2524.09,We're arguing for affirmance of the judgment and we pointed out an alternative legal standard in support of the judgment below.
1997.97-1192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2527.362,2528.754,What was the judgment below?
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2539.261,2545.166,It reversed and remanded without specific directions as to what was going to happen on remand.
1997.97-1192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2553.644,2558.586,"Well, did it tell the district court to apply the weighing test that it enunciated?"
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2558.586,2563.18,"It simply said, reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, so--"
1997.97-1192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2563.18,2569.185,"Well, wouldn't one think that further proceedings consistent with this opinion would be to apply the weighing test that the court announced?"
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2569.185,2574.267,"--We don't think so, because the court said the standard was plainly met here, and it was talking about--"

1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2582.995,2591.261,"--On page 11a of the petition appendix, where the proponent has offered facts supporting a--"
1997.97-1192,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2591.261,2593.411,Whereabouts on page 11a are you reading from?
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2593.411,2608.812,"--The beginning of the first full paragraph, where the proponent has offered facts supporting a good faith reasonable belief that the materials may qualify for the exception, a standard plainly met here by the Independent Counsel, and the preceding paragraph--"
1997.97-1192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2608.812,2610.364,But what does it say after that?
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2628.775,2636.112,"--Well, we think the communications have to be examined to determine whether they're relevant to our investigation."
1997.97-1192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2645.259,2662.751,"And then the court goes on to say, to the extent that the court finds an interest in confidentiality... the district court... it can take steps to limit access, et cetera, so it's hardly an instruction to the district court to go ahead and order the divulgence of these notes."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2676.051,2677.871,No.
1997.97-1192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2693.906,2703.68,"But you would not have been entitled to these notes if the client were alive, so it's his death that establishes your qualification for something you could not have gotten."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2731.159,2732.959,If he were alive?
1997.97-1192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2732.959,2733.66,No.
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2734.931,2735.262,In the current situation?
1997.97-1192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2735.262,2735.472,--Yes.
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2735.913,2736.113,Yes.
1997.97-1192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2736.113,2737.854,--you have a right to his notes.
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2740.846,2742.078,"Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg."
1997.97-1192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2742.078,2746.072,"And is it up to you interchangeably, or do you have to do one before the other?"
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2746.072,2751.885,"The orderly process of a grand jury, you usually seek someone's documents and then question them about those documents."
1997.97-1192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2751.885,2752.075,How--
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2761.272,2770.057,Because the notes may help to show what was discussed in the conversations between Mr. Foster and Mr. Hamilton and refresh Mr. Hamilton's recollection.
1997.97-1192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2770.057,2772.25,"Well, he can use them to refresh his recollection."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2790.012,2809.716,"The settled case law in the lower courts, Justice Ginsburg, is in situations where the witness who communicated with the lawyer is unavailable, then those portions of the notes that at least reflect the factual statements of the witness and surrounding information must be disclosed, even when the client, the witness is still alive."
1997.97-1192,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2809.716,2818.505,"But you have to make a substantial showing under the rule, don't you, and for those perhaps under Upjohn you have to make even more of a showing."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2821.928,2842.664,"The showing that has to be made, Mr. Chief Justice, is a showing that the witness in question is no longer available for questioning, as the Second and Third Circuit stated, and that is what the showing is, and that's been a traditional showing in the lower courts and is approved in the Restatement, that suggest that the notes must be produced in that circumstance."
1997.97-1192,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2842.664,2847.429,That itself is a substantial showing that the witness is no longer available?
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2847.429,2853.503,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and those opinions have... and the Restatement follow what Upjohn stated on that point."
1997.97-1192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2879.622,2882.065,"Well, you can't question a person after his death... sorry."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2886.439,2887.831,"--No, but the same information--"
1997.97-1192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2887.831,2893.856,"Well, how do you know that he didn't talk to the lawyer about privileged matters, matters that were the subject of some other privilege?"
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2896.53,2898.2,"--We don't know what's in the notes, correct."
1997.97-1192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2898.2,2898.401,All right.
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2915.083,2916.325,Well--
1997.97-1192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2916.325,2920.589,"I mean, some conversations with lawyers would survive death as privileged."
1997.97-1192,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,,2920.589,2921.591,--Ordinarily--
1997.97-1192,2,30691,james_hamilton,,3450.348,3463.737,"Mr. Chief Justice, I want to come back to the work product issue, because I believe Mr. Kavanaugh has misstated the law in that... in that area."
1997.97-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3491.608,3502.673,Don't these cases usually come up in the context where somebody would want to use... where insight into the lawyer's thinking would be useful in litigation against the lawyer's client?
1997.97-1192,2,30691,james_hamilton,,3521.339,3527.833,The work product privilege is intended to protect the adversary system.
1997.97-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3533.717,3539.649,"Sure, so that your opponent can't see behind your thinking, your strategizing in this particular case."
1997.97-1192,2,30691,james_hamilton,,3539.649,3539.91,That's--
1997.97-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3539.91,3547.586,"But when the case is all gone, when there's no case left at all, is there something sacrosanct about the way this lawyer's mind was working--"
1997.97-1192,2,30691,james_hamilton,,3547.586,3547.806,--Well--
1997.97-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3547.806,3551.229,--in a long gone case that has no future implications?
1997.97-1192,2,30691,james_hamilton,,3551.229,3569.422,"--I think this Court, in the Grolyer case, has said that the work product privilege extends even after the litigation involved has concluded, but the purpose is to protect the lawyer's thought processes, his methods of working."
1997.97-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3570.363,3571.615,So it is sort of a copyright.
1997.97-1192,2,30691,james_hamilton,,3575.328,3603.668,"--I have not read any opinion, Justice Scalia, that describes it that way, but there are opinions, including the Moody case that Mr. Kavanaugh cites, that say that the work product privilege belongs to the lawyer as well as to the client, because the cases recognize that the lawyer has an interest to protect and the lawyer can assert that work product privilege even though the client does not."
1997.97-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3603.668,3605.408,What is that interest that he has to protect?
1997.97-1192,2,30691,james_hamilton,,3605.408,3606.049,It is--
1997.97-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3606.049,3614.113,"When there's... this litigation is all gone, it's not usable in any other litigation, what is the interest that the lawyer has to protect?"
1997.97-1192,2,30691,james_hamilton,,3614.113,3618.147,"--It is protecting his thought processes, his methods of operation."
1997.97-1192,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3626.595,3628.084,"Thank you, Mr. Hamilton."
