1963.264,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,10.095,"-- 264, James P. Donovan et al., Petitioners, versus City of Dallas, et al."
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,14.77,20.688,"Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court."
1963.264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,190.954,194.752,(Inaudible)
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,194.752,202.734,"It isn't -- no, we have a -- an affirmance in the rules too where we have an affirmance that affirms the law stated in the decision of the lower court."
1963.264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,202.734,205.14,(Inaudible)
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,205.14,207.274,It affirms the judgment but --
1963.264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,207.274,208.21,(Inaudible)
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,208.21,212.562,Not for the reasons -- not necessarily for the reason stated in the opinion of the lower court.
1963.264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,212.562,219.455,But then there is something else (Inaudible)
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,219.455,224.581,"Yes, there is a -- there is another ruling error refused, period."
1963.264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,229.398,232.319,Is that also (Inaudible)
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,232.319,234.123,It -- it is for practical fact.
1963.264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,241.961,246.559,(Inaudible)
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,246.559,249.311,"No, sir, there is no way."
1963.264,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,291.587,293.654,(Inaudible)
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,293.654,294.543,"Yes, sir."
1963.264,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,430.899,440.449,(Inaudible)
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,440.449,440.99,"Yes, sir."
1963.264,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,440.99,454.439,(Inaudible)
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,454.439,459.341,"Yes, sir, to straight -- to straighten all on our suit, it was actually filed April 3rd, 1961."
1963.264,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,459.341,460.179,(Inaudible)
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,460.179,460.485,That's right.
1963.264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,565.335,568.216,The first -- the first action is purportedly an applied action?
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,568.216,569.624,"Yes, sir."
1963.264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,569.624,574.862,Why -- why would the plaintiffs in that case represent all the plaintiffs in the second case?
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,574.862,577.295,Because they did not sue as taxpayers.
1963.264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,591.898,601.017,There were no parties in the second suit of -- were there parties in the second suit of and bond holders or other than -- what was the class represented in the first action?
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,601.017,615.246,"This -- the class represented in the first action were the homeowners, families and individuals who live, work, reside and attend schools, churches and other community centers in the area embraced within the approach areas of plan runaway of 13R-31L."
1963.264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,615.246,617.072,Who were the plaintiffs in the second?
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,617.072,625.019,"The plaintiffs in the second were 122 individuals who sought to represent themselves, all of whom were taxpayers."
1963.264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,625.019,627.351,"Yes, but were they also homeowners and things in that area?"
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,627.351,628.887,"Yes, sir, they live in the area --"
1963.264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,628.887,639.417,None of -- none of them was -- at least one-half they were wearing was -- the fact was -- represented people that were representing the first action.
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,639.417,655.037,They were a part of the class in the first action except that they were -- our first action was not a taxpayer's action and our first action did not attack any outstanding bonds because of the fact that there were no bond owners represented as defendants.
1963.264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,655.037,667.549,"Now, if there was no difference between the first and the second suit other than the -- than the identity of the defendants, would you -- would you say that res judicata was not to be imposed?"
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,667.549,674.66,"Yes, I would, Your Honor, because I believe that when a group of people -- I mean these were not necessarily taxpayers, not first class."
1963.264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,676.066,677.538,We're talk about defendants.
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,677.538,678.418,About defendants.
1963.264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.324,682.491,"Well, I know but --"
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,682.491,684.349,And I think that the addition of the --
1963.264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.349,690.028,Say the only case between the two -- since -- then -- in -- in the defendants.
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,692.072,700.233,I would say that still there would be no application of res judicata because there was no privity of parties.
1963.264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,770.708,773.112,None of these federal questions are raised in the first suit.
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,773.112,774.891,None of those were raised in the first suit.
1963.264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,774.891,776.594,Any constitutional question?
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,776.594,782.31,The constitutional question of the first suit was the seizure of property without -- without compensation.
1963.264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,782.31,783.807,That was raised in the second?
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,783.807,788.703,It's also raised in the second suit merely for the purposes joined special interest.
1963.264,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,964.979,969.971,(Inaudible)
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,969.971,971.13,"No sir, not at this point."
1963.264,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,971.13,972.519,(Inaudible)
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,972.519,974.167,That's later.
1963.264,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1006.972,1008.879,(Inaudible)
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,1008.879,1028.647,"That judgment was December 16, I believe."
1963.264,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1028.647,1030.218,(Inaudible)
1963.264,0,29925,james_p_donovan,,1030.218,1031.006,It's in the record.
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,1896.321,1902.023,May it please the Court.
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2033.636,2036.468,Suppose you're right on the law of Texas --
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2036.468,2036.941,Sir?
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2036.941,2044.766,"-- suppose you're right on the law and that a man had no case in federal courts, is that the issue before us here?"
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2044.766,2045.601,Yes.
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2049.655,2059.677,"Well, I thought the real issue was whether Texas courts could enjoin litigants who are rightfully in federal courts pursuing their claim."
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2059.677,2061.016,"Well, that's --"
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2061.016,2066.693,Or whether the lawyers can be put in jail for not dismissing a suit in the federal court.
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2066.693,2070.781,"On the ground that the -- the matter had already been litigated, it -- they are both --"
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2070.781,2075.402,"On -- on the ground -- on one ground of which has the premises, I would suppose."
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2075.402,2075.81,Well --
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2075.81,2093.752,"Can -- can any man who filed a civil rights sue in Texas that -- his civil rights, let's forget this case, that his civil rights, can the state courts can get him into the Court and enjoin him from pursuing his suit in the federal court --"
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2093.752,2093.891,If the state --
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2093.891,2096.203,-- suppose the federal court passes on him?
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2096.203,2106.401,"Our position is this that since they submitted that question to the state court over here, this claim in the state court was the right of franchise, that it was denied the civil rights."
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2114.149,2124.547,The two courts there involved and the question of a man's right to pursue a claim that he had certainly has in the federal court where the federal court has not dismissed it.
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2144.635,2152.791,My -- my position in this case is this that he has submitted that question in the state court and it was adjudicated against him and this Court --
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2152.791,2165.412,"Suppose it had been, suppose he went into the federal court and claimed that it was wrong for violating his right or take a man in the civil rights where there's more involved in it in this simple bond issue."
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2174.745,2182.315,"He exercise is right, Your Honor, by asking for a certiorari to have the judgment of Texas court reviewed by this Court."
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2185.339,2191.752,"Yes, but what is it -- he's asked to release here on the ground of what's going on there, hadn't he?"
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2197.23,2200.843,Because of the -- the fact that he has been litigated otherwise he -- there was --
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2200.843,2201.249,"Well, that's right because -- because the state --"
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2201.249,2202.59,-- a litigation somewhere in those -- somewhere.
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2202.59,2221.28,"-- the state court says now that it has the right to determine whether each are gone in the federal court which it can enforce by putting a lawyer in the federal courts litigant in jail either him or as -- well, you -- it pursues."
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2224.134,2224.495,Yes.
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2270.583,2291.721,"What you are saying as I understand it, when a man -- when the state court thinks a man is barred by formal adjudication, he files a suit in the federal courts that the state court is the one that has the right to determine that question and he -- he doesn't -- he has no right in the federal court at all which the state court paid enjoined him for -- from pursuing."
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2291.721,2296.246,"Well, he certainly again that it would never be in to litigation."
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2296.643,2297.358,"Well, it might be."
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2301.495,2306.721,"Well, we think it is allowed because it's almost four years but still -- still arguing by the one that has started in --"
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2306.721,2306.745,But --
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2306.745,2307.497,1861.
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2307.497,2314.204,"-- basically, this question, so far as I'm concerned unless you can show me differently, gets down to this."
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2335.198,2342.325,"I am saying the law with reference to this case, they should be applied from the standpoint of what we were litigating over here."
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2343.062,2343.276,But it -- but --
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2343.276,2344.723,-- he had litigated a question on civil rights.
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2344.723,2361.217,-- but it's raised not in the question of which you are litigating but it's raised in question with the power of the Court or state court to put a lawyer representing a party and the federal court in jail if he doesn't dismiss this case in the federal court.
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2361.217,2368.139,"Your Honor, in the case of Princess Lida against Thompson, same situation happened there."
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2428.487,2433.954,You -- you are resting again on that point on what is the main issue on the Thompson.
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2433.954,2450.475,"The issue was this that these parties have headed them in court, litigating their problem that they have -- with the courts and having, the first of page -- jurisdiction -- they have the right to proceed to or judgment is in that case."
1963.264,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2465.968,2469.428,"That was a -- the Thompson case was in rem, wasn't it?"
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2470.763,2473.291,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1963.264,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2496.368,2497.607,It -- it doesn't say that.
1963.264,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2499.962,2501.153,At least.
1963.264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2713.068,2732.969,"Could I ask you if -- if you were right on (Inaudible) brought the suit, what would have been wrong if presenting to Judge Hughes your plea of res judicata and your motion to dismiss on the ground of res judicata can -- base from the state court action, why wasn't that the proper way of pursuing?"
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2732.969,2741.228,"Your Honor, again, the delay over -- of an appeal to the U.S. Circuit Court and a writ over here which it would take another year."
1963.264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2763.45,2775.838,"Now -- but you wouldn't have been to anymore delay than you have been because here, your -- your prohibition action, prohibition mandamus action was brought here and it was granted and here you are."
1963.264,1,27391,h_p_kucera,,2775.838,2778.923,"Well, that's just the tragedy of the whole --"
1963.264,2,29925,james_p_donovan,,3748.615,3762.168,"If the Court please, on this question of the mere filing of a suit stopping sale bonds, counsel would like to call the Court's attention that the bonds that under attack in the Brown case had already been solved."
