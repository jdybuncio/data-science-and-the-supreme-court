2003.02-1060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.142,"We'll hear argument now in No. 20...  02-1060, Illinois v. Robert S. Lidster."
2003.02-1060,0,25292,gary_feinerman,,8.545,11.146,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1060,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,83.304,91.932,"Well, I suppose we'd have to decide here not only whether it was per se invalid, but whether it was reasonable under any other standard."
2003.02-1060,0,25292,gary_feinerman,,91.932,94.056,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-1060,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,94.056,101.925,"And let me ask you, is it often that roadblocks are set up just to get information like this?"
2003.02-1060,0,25292,gary_feinerman,,101.925,119.636,"I...  I would rely on the amicus briefs submitted by the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police and the Major Cities Chiefs Association, and they...  they have informed the Court that roadblocks are not used frequently, rather they are used judiciously in order to solve certain..."
2003.02-1060,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,119.636,120.629,This was a little odd.
2003.02-1060,0,25292,gary_feinerman,,121.827,129.136,"It was a week later, but there was a very good reason why the checkpoint was set up at that particular place and at that particular time."
2003.02-1060,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,158.236,174.006,"The...  the...  you...  you said that they had to be used judiciously and that's a good word, but our...  do our precedents in this area generally say, well, we defer to the good judgement of the police, they won't use them too often."
2003.02-1060,0,25292,gary_feinerman,,199.186,202.984,"Well, it's used judiciously for a number of reasons."
2003.02-1060,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,219.165,219.946,What if that isn't enough?
2003.02-1060,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,230.06,230.886,What do we do then?
2003.02-1060,0,25292,gary_feinerman,,230.886,233.858,Then the courts step in and apply the Brown reasonableness factors.
2003.02-1060,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,233.858,235.633,"Well, what...  that's what I'm asking."
2003.02-1060,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.258,249.713,Would that be...
2003.02-1060,0,25292,gary_feinerman,,249.713,265.854,"That would be closer...  that would be closer to the situation that was presented in Edmond, although it wouldn't...  it wouldn't present one of the hallmarks of what we believe is a general crime control roadblock, which is that it's the goal of the police to incriminate the motorists as opposed to simply seek information."
2003.02-1060,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,265.854,275.431,"No, it wouldn't...  it wouldn't come within that, but you think that that would...  would be invalid even though you would support these informational roadblocks in some circumstances?"
2003.02-1060,0,25292,gary_feinerman,,275.431,278.282,"That...  that question, of course, isn't presented here, but I...  I..."
2003.02-1060,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,278.282,278.775,No kidding.
2003.02-1060,0,25292,gary_feinerman,,278.775,288.972,"I understand, but our...  I...  I suppose we would say that such roadblocks should not be declared per se invalid under the Fourth Amendment, but rather they ought to be subject to the Brown balancing test."
2003.02-1060,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.972,290.086,You going to answer my question?
2003.02-1060,0,25292,gary_feinerman,,292.399,294.44,It would depend upon the circumstances.
2003.02-1060,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,295.183,296.381,I gave you the circumstances.
2003.02-1060,0,25292,gary_feinerman,,308.891,310.953,I think there...  there would be...
2003.02-1060,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.953,312.067,What other circumstances do you need?
2003.02-1060,0,25292,gary_feinerman,,313.182,314.025,No.
2003.02-1060,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,314.025,314.957,Okay.
2003.02-1060,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,314.957,316.155,"Now, can you give me..."
2003.02-1060,0,25292,gary_feinerman,,316.155,316.238,I can't...
2003.02-1060,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,316.238,316.61,a yes or no?
2003.02-1060,0,25292,gary_feinerman,,317.353,320.863,"It's, in my most instances it would be bad, but..."
2003.02-1060,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,320.863,321.318,Okay.
2003.02-1060,0,25292,gary_feinerman,,321.318,328.31,I...  I don't know if we could foreclose the possibility that there might be some circumstances were such a roadblock would be reasonable.
2003.02-1060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,363.3,363.838,"Well, what...  what about..."
2003.02-1060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,363.838,364.209,Mr....
2003.02-1060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,364.209,372.632,a road...  roadblock that you find in perhaps some smaller towns where the police just very briefly stop you and ask you to contribute to the police boys fund.
2003.02-1060,0,25292,gary_feinerman,,372.632,376.635,I'm...  I'm not sure that would be a...  a crime control roadblock.
2003.02-1060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,376.635,377.667,I don't think it is.
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1062.192,1077.674,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1060,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.951,1130.058,But can you stop the person?
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1138.725,1140.461,"No, absolutely not, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-1060,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1160.373,1176.991,"Why...  why does the distinction...  you've mentioned it and...  and Mr. Feinerman mentioned it...  why does the distinction between cars and pedestrians apply in a case in which the...  the justification for making that distinction, regulation, a risk of impaired driving, does not apply?"
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1176.991,1187.931,What...  what is relevant is what this Court has long recognized is...  is the difference in your reasonable expectations of freedom of movement between people in cars and pedestrians on the sidewalk.
2003.02-1060,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1187.931,1212.451,"No, but my expectation of freedom of movement in the car is that, yeah, the police can stop to...  for a sobriety checkpoint and I'll assume they can...  they can stop to...  to check my...  my license and the registration of the car, but I also assume that they can't, you know, barring today, the result of today's case, I...  I'm assuming that they...  they can't stop me for...  for other reasons, barring some really exigent circumstance."
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1233.256,1246.344,"Justice Souter, the essential command of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and there's nothing in the Fourth Amendment that says stops for sobriety or stops to see if you have any aliens in your trunk are inherently reasonable and nothing else is."
2003.02-1060,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1272.804,1284.754,"You're...  you're saying that because they might have observed or...  or observed evidence in the exercise of their privilege that that would be a regulatory basis for stopping them in the cars, whereas there wouldn't be any such basis for the pedestrian?"
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1284.754,1296.726,"The regulatory need for it is that there's...  you have a very common police practice here, and one that we expect the police to do if a...  a fatality has been committed is try to find witnesses who were there at the time."
2003.02-1060,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1298.955,1304.035,And...  and we understand that when...  when there's something pretty contemporaneous between the stopping and the...  and the accident.
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1311.094,1314.642,It is extremely common for these types of informational checkpoints.
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1319.349,1319.926,Yeah.
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1319.926,1337.099,"But the witness checkpoints are quite routinely done, either 24 hours, or very routinely, a week after, because people are creatures of habit and they tend to drive the same roads at the same time of...  the same days, and so it's very common...  a number...  a number of Federal checkpoints have been done exactly like this."
2003.02-1060,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1356.79,1357.821,Have they been successful?
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1362.445,1363.354,I...  I can't give you...
2003.02-1060,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.354,1364.319,Do you know of any that have been successful?
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1364.319,1364.924,"Yes, absolutely."
2003.02-1060,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1388.579,1392.583,But you couldn't...  you couldn't do this to try to get the perpetrator.
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1411.28,1414.252,"Justice Ginsburg, I...  two responses."
2003.02-1060,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1461.73,1464.741,"Well, following Justice Ginsburg's question, which is the easier of the two cases?"
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1478.737,1483.317,Assuming that this is not...  it's not right after the crime that I have the description...
2003.02-1060,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1483.317,1484.514,"A week later, everything else the same."
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1484.514,1497.806,"I think this Court's...  I think both of them are different from Edmond, but I do think this Court's doctrines establish why the witness approach is...  is more...  is less intrusive on Fourth Amendment interests for...  for three reasons."
2003.02-1060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1510.416,1511.325,I...  I wonder if you'd answer Justice Kennedy's question.
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1512.418,1516.095,I...  I'm...
2003.02-1060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1516.095,1516.433,You don't know?
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1516.433,1517.042,"oh, I'm sorry..."
2003.02-1060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1517.042,1517.619,Pardon me?
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1517.619,1522.16,"We would like to have them both sustained, quite frankly, and we don't think they're...  they're exactly covered by Edmond..."
2003.02-1060,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1522.16,1525.875,"Yes, yes, but which is more consistent...  which is easier to say is consistent with the Fourth Amendment?"
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1525.875,1526.33,There...
2003.02-1060,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1526.33,1535.18,"I would just...  I'm mixed up with easier because I don't...  which is...  the two cases that he gave, in which do you think it's easier for you to win your argument?"
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1535.18,1546.969,"I...  I think the witness one is easier for three reasons, and one is because the Fourth Amendment has this self-protection principle, which is not implicated when you're...  you're looking for witnesses."
2003.02-1060,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1548.167,1549.364,"In other words, this case is easier?"
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1549.364,1551.965,"Yes, yes, the witness checkpoint, the looking for information checkpoint."
2003.02-1060,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1551.965,1552.198,All right.
2003.02-1060,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1552.198,1552.419,I got mixed up...
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1552.419,1553.328,I'm sorry if I'm not...
2003.02-1060,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1553.328,1553.866,This case is easier?
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1553.866,1554.154,Yes.
2003.02-1060,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1581.275,1582.101,And what's the third reason?
2003.02-1060,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1582.101,1582.844,And...  and the third...
2003.02-1060,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1582.844,1584.33,The Fourth Amendment is an anxiety thing?
2003.02-1060,2,21411,donald_j_ramsell,,1687.125,1691.667,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1060,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1707.847,1717.795,"Well, that sounds a little colorful, but...  but in my own mind I'm thinking that this is asking people to help with crime investigation and to spend 10 seconds listening to the request."
2003.02-1060,3,25292,gary_feinerman,,3497.122,3521.475,"This Court in Edmond found that narcotics check...  narcotics checkpoints are so obnoxious to core Fourth Amendment values that a per se rule of invalidity was justified and the principal question here is whether informational checkpoints present the same Fourth Amendment dangers that general crime control checkpoints present, and the answer to that is no."
2003.02-1060,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3652.499,3653.242,"Thank you, Mr. Feinerman."
