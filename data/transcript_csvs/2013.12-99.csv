2013.12-99,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.655,We will hear argument first in Case 12-99.
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,9.543,12.324,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-99,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,39.704,43.561,I -- I think there's substantial force to that argument.
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,92.729,93.369,Yeah.
2013.12-99,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,105.754,108.378,"But in the abstract, wouldn't that be property?"
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,108.378,110.815,They -- money is property.
2013.12-99,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,112.845,115.422,And isn't the thing that's exchanged for the money also property?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,115.422,121.779,"The -- this statute focuses on what is paid, lent or delivered by the employer to--"
2013.12-99,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,121.779,127.058,"I'm just talking about common definition, our common agreement as to what property means."
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,127.058,146.222,"--In this case, the all -- the only thing given by the union was a promise not to strike, picket or boycott this business, to help supply labor if the employer needed it, not to coerce or threaten employees in the course of the organizing effort and to -- and to arbitrate in the event that there was any dispute."
2013.12-99,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,146.222,150.393,And the list -- the list of -- the list of employees.
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,150.393,150.704,Yes.
2013.12-99,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,155.906,156.453,"Oh, I see."
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,156.453,157.702,--Because it was a mutual agreement.
2013.12-99,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,157.702,163.325,What -- what about support of the legislation to permit slot machines?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,165.683,176.898,It is so alleged and there's no question that the union did tell the employer and the other employers that it would work to pass the legislation necessary for these employers to get into business in the first place.
2013.12-99,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,185.364,189.252,"But as the case comes to us, we assume that there was such a commitment by the union."
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,189.252,189.938,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-99,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,189.938,190.438,Okay.
2013.12-99,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,190.438,201.184,"So suppose the company manufactures widgets and the union says, we'll spend $100,000 advertising your widgets if you so -- if you sign the recognition agreement."
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,201.184,202.825,Yes.
2013.12-99,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,203.309,204.167,Is that lawful?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,204.167,208.354,--It would be lawful because the union would not have received any widgets.
2013.12-99,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,218.678,223.239,"Well, there would have been a quid pro quo for that, certainly."
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,243.058,243.886,Unquestionably.
2013.12-99,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,246.85,251.976,So why isn't that the property that Justice Kennedy referred to?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,266.971,268.251,--They are desired by the union.
2013.12-99,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,275.359,276.046,But why?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,294.819,295.724,--And--
2013.12-99,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,295.724,301.019,I think that is the essence of -- because the union paying money is not a violation of the Act.
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,301.019,304.955,--The -- there's no prohibition against the union paying money to an employer.
2013.12-99,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,304.955,305.94,Right.
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,305.94,307.063,It's only the other way around.
2013.12-99,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.027,333.881,"Mr. McCracken, the Respondent's brief here asserts that these kinds of precertification agreements have only been common since the -- the '90s."
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,335.599,338.317,"It is not, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-99,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,383.751,390.733,"Sometimes there's a conflict between two different groups that want to unionize the same workforce, right?"
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,390.733,391.15,Yes.
2013.12-99,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,391.15,392.04,How would this work in that case?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,400.803,412.001,The NLRB has dealt with that quite a few times and takes the position and has required employers to give equal rights to both unions.
2013.12-99,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,412.001,415.906,Doesn't that suggest it's a thing of value in -- in this context?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,415.906,429.229,"It's certainly not a thing of value in the sense of marketability, because the one union could not sell it to the second union because the other union could get it free from the employer because the employer must give equal rights to all comers."
2013.12-99,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,429.229,434.868,"In the typical case, how important is an agreement like this to the union?"
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,441.303,459.763,"The same article that I mentioned, Justice Kagan, shows that the differential is between about -- about 67 percent success rate in NLRB elections and about a 76 percent success rate under these agreements."
2013.12-99,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,459.763,465.511,Are the agreements -- are the agreements uniform or do they have varying elements?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,465.511,467.98,There are some things that are quite standard.
2013.12-99,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,467.98,471.212,Is -- is the card check provision standard?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,471.212,479.006,"It is found in most agreements, neutrality somewhat less so, but still in the vast majority of them."
2013.12-99,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,479.006,488.315,"I don't -- I think this is slightly different from Justice Kagan, but can you give us some indication of how often employers make these agreements?"
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,492.343,493.422,Yes.
2013.12-99,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,513.741,514.21,Why is that?
2013.12-99,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,514.21,535.42,"Mr. McCracken, could you -- could you tell -- tell us about this particular contract, because as far as I can fathom from what we have it expired at least a year ago and there was -- there was no recognition, there was no election; is that right?"
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,535.42,536.482,"Yes, that's correct."
2013.12-99,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,536.482,543.744,"So, are we dealing with a live case considering that the -- the agreement has expired?"
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,543.744,549.337,"Justice Ginsburg, the complaint in this case prays for two different forms of relief."
2013.12-99,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,565.566,568.393,So what would be -- what would be the relief?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,568.393,591.555,"The relief -- if this case went forward and was found meritorious, the relief would be an injunction against the union from ever asking an employer for -- this employer for neutrality or for the names and addresses of employees or for any form of access to the premises and not--"
2013.12-99,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,591.555,593.102,"Because -- is it on the theory that it did it once, so it might do it again?"
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,595.022,607.658,"--The -- I believe that the theory that the plaintiff has here is that an employer may never give these things, whether it's in an agreement or not in an agreement, that even if -- pardon me."
2013.12-99,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,607.658,614.437,Would Mr. Mulhall have to face an imminent threat in order for him to have standing?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,614.437,615.67,"He would, Your Honor."
2013.12-99,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,615.67,618.576,And why is the threat imminent at this time?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,618.576,619.122,I'm sorry?
2013.12-99,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,619.122,621.996,Why is the threat imminent at this time?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,621.996,627.743,"Your Honor, we -- we advocated during an earlier phase of this case that there was no standing."
2013.12-99,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,627.743,630.477,What is your position now?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,630.477,635.773,"We -- we still do not believe that he has standing, because there is no imminent harm here."
2013.12-99,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,663.994,670.899,Did you also raise in an earlier stage an argument that he had no private right of action?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,670.899,671.805,We did not.
2013.12-99,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,671.805,673.382,That has never been litigated?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,673.382,675.131,It hasn't -- it has been litigated.
2013.12-99,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,694.093,694.904,--But not in this -- not in this case.
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,696.248,697.482,It was not raised in this case.
2013.12-99,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,699.918,710.273,And Sinclair is of a certain age before this Court looked more carefully at the implication of private rights of action.
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,710.273,711.725,"That's true, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-99,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,746.836,754.849,Why wouldn't the right to use private property in a way that otherwise wouldn't be allowed constitute a thing of value?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,770.452,776.103,"It would qualify both as a thing of value and one that is paid, lent, or delivered by the employer to the union."
2013.12-99,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,776.103,777.434,So what's the difference here?
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,785.478,800.238,"Because the union really only had a right of access, not any exclusive possession of any property, and only for the very limited purpose of communicating with employees about their Section 7 rights."
2013.12-99,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,800.238,803.987,"But it's still -- it's a lesser property right, but isn't it a property right?"
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,817.653,819.933,"Not under Florida law, Your Honor."
2013.12-99,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,826.15,826.372,All right.
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,828.419,835.603,"A license may be a thing of value that -- that is paid, lent or delivered."
2013.12-99,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,847.365,849.083,"Well, that's true of all property owners."
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,861.5,862.173,--Yes.
2013.12-99,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,876.916,883.803,"Counsel, it's clear that there's some difficulty in defining the limits of property."
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,925.583,926.802,Yes.
2013.12-99,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,927.63,929.363,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,929.363,930.972,May I reserve my remaining time?
2013.12-99,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,930.972,931.613,"Yes, of course."
2013.12-99,0,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,931.613,932.893,Thank you very much.
2013.12-99,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,932.893,938.719,Mr. Dreeben.
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,938.719,941.468,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-99,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,965.786,971.8,"Well, before you get too much into the merits, could -- does the United States have a position on whether this case satisfies Article 3."
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,971.8,974.425,"We don't, Justice Alito."
2013.12-99,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,995.633,1001.302,Does the United States have a position on the implication of a private right of action under 302?
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1001.302,1012.112,"Justice Ginsburg, it seems to have been accepted historically and, as my co-counsel mentioned, it was referenced in dictum by this Court; it's been accepted by the lower courts."
2013.12-99,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1063.996,1070.292,Are you saying “ thing of value ” means something different in 302 than it means elsewhere in -- in the code?
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1070.292,1071.089,--I think--
2013.12-99,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1071.089,1083.88,"I -- I can see if there was a conspiracy to extort these benefits, that the government would take the position that there was a crime because there was a thing of value, a thing of property."
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1083.88,1097.155,"--Well, under this statute, the government's position is that the three terms that are at issue -- “ neutrality ”, “ access ”, and “ employee list ” -- are not prohibited by Section 302."
2013.12-99,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1122.926,1126.346,"Isn't Billing your best argument, the framework of Billing?"
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1126.346,1128.955,"Yes, I think it is, Justice Sotomayor."
2013.12-99,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1162.894,1167.065,Some people have suggested that Billings is limited to the antitrust area.
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1167.065,1168.1,--I don't think that--
2013.12-99,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1168.1,1176.551,And how do you respond to that belief and -- and how do you convince us to expand the doctrine outside its traditional context?
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1176.551,1188.5,"--Billing is simply an application of this Court's responsibility to divine Congress's intent based on language, structure, and history and policy of the relevant laws."
2013.12-99,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1202.058,1202.355,Fine.
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1221.737,1222.081,Yes.
2013.12-99,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1222.331,1229.407,"So then when I write the opinion that says that is covered, but the access, the employer lists, and the--"
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1229.407,1233.921,Neutrality.
2013.12-99,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1233.921,1237.138,"--yes, and the neutrality, those are not covered because."
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1242.73,1246.118,"Two things, Justice Breyer, and they're both equally important."
2013.12-99,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1252.742,1252.193,"No, no."
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1255.865,1262.316,It can't be -- it can't be restricted in that way because the origins of Section 302 came from--
2013.12-99,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1262.316,1267.735,--Okay.
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1269.298,1283.98,"--The other is that reading the policies of the Act as a whole, we start from the proposition, which is undisputed by Respondent and reveals that his purportedly literal application of Section 302 just does not wash."
2013.12-99,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1300.644,1302.439,"Well, if -- if there--"
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1302.439,1307.485,"If I could just finish this one point, Mr. Chief justice, to answer Justice Breyer's question."
2013.12-99,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1318.871,1319.886,--If I may?
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1319.886,1320.48,Thank you.
2013.12-99,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1322.292,1351.28,"But if you recall the point you made earlier, the point is, yes, voluntary agreement, but if a majority of the workforce wants to be organized and represented by that union, and the argument here, as I understand it, is that this agreement taints that process, in particular, by allowing the card check procedure that it has been argued exercises coercion against employees to support the union."
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1351.28,1355.404,"Well, this Court in the Gissel Packing case many years ago rejected that argument."
2013.12-99,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1358.637,1360.152,The argument that the card check--
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1360.152,1362.229,"--Card check agreements are inherently coercive, yes."
2013.12-99,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1363.12,1366.556,"--Well, will you -- will you concede that they're more coercive than a secret ballot?"
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1366.556,1369.351,I don't think they're coercive at all inherently.
2013.12-99,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1370.57,1373.647,"The union organizer comes up to you and says, well, here's a card."
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1382.05,1383.628,"--Well, some would argue--"
2013.12-99,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1383.628,1384.392,And he's a big guy.
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1385.158,1398.685,--Some would argue that employers also have big guys and it's very coercive to have your employer in there on the factory floor reminding employees daily that they're very anti-union and that there are a lot of costs to joining a union.
2013.12-99,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1456.598,1461.814,One curious thing about the Eleventh Circuit's opinion is it didn't reject.
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1495.005,1501.423,"All of the courts of appeals, Justice Ginsburg, have concluded that ground rules agreements are inherently lawful."
2013.12-99,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1509.936,1511.325,What about slot machines?
2013.12-99,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1521.65,1522.275,That's right.
2013.12-99,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1546.78,1547.811,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,1553.403,1556.401,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-99,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1583.281,1588.95,"But, Mr. Messenger, you are dealing with a decision that seems to uphold organizing agreements."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,1617.891,1619.766,"--Well, I would say two things."
2013.12-99,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1641.961,1643.102,Where is that?
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,1643.102,1661.858,"It's at the Eleventh Circuit's opinion, right above the section that you just read from, where the court held that it didn't believe that things could be delivered, which we disagree with, but they can be paid; and therefore, if consideration is given, then you have a violation."
2013.12-99,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1684.366,1693.158,"It says -- it says that, at the end of that passage, curbing bribery and extortion are implicated."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,1693.158,1693.924,Yes.
2013.12-99,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1693.924,1694.735,And said that's what--
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,1694.735,1696.703,If there is consideration.
2013.12-99,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1710.355,1720.694,--What is your position on the effect of the expiration of this agreement?
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,1720.694,1733.235,"I don't believe that it renders the case moot, for two reasons, the first of which is that UNITE has pending a lawsuit to compel arbitration in which it is alleging violations of the agreement that occurred before it expired."
2013.12-99,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1767.72,1779.638,"Mr. Messenger, could -- could all of these things that the employer gave to the union be included in a finally-negotiated collective bargaining agreement?"
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,1811.704,1818.873,"The first two could because the exceptions to 302 start to apply, the exceptions found at 302(c)."
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1864.231,1889.063,"Mr. Messenger, do I understand the structure of your argument to be as follows: That whether before certification or afterwards in a collective bargaining agreement along the lines that Justice Scalia said, the only thing that an employer can promise a union or agree to provide to a union are things that are specifically authorized in other parts of the labor law?"
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,1891.126,1892.297,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1907.212,1935.497,"You see, I would have thought that the premise and the policies of the labor laws are to encourage a wide variety of employer/employee agreements, both things that are listed in the labor laws, that are provided for in the labor laws, but many things that are not; that the idea is to get these parties together to reach agreements on a wide variety of things that matter to them regardless whether the labor law specifically refers to that."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,1935.497,1936.965,"Well, the structure--"
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1936.965,1953.74,"It seems sort of turning the whole thing on its head to say that the only things that are allowed in terms of promises, whether in a collective bargaining agreement or prior to that, are the things that the law itself requires."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,1953.74,1956.738,"--Well, I believe that is the structure of Section 302."
2013.12-99,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1979.011,1985.758,"Counsel, why don't -- why doesn't the Billings -- Billing framework apply beautifully here?"
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,1985.758,1986.257,--Because--
2013.12-99,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1986.257,2018.728,"What it holds is that where there's a regulatory framework, and here there is, that produces standards of conduct, going to Justice Kagan's point, that almost all of the three things that you're arguing against are standards of conduct that have been approved by -- have been approved by the government, and when those conflict with the separate Federal statute, then they are implicitly preempted, essentially."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2023.57,2029.287,"--Well, for two reasons, but the first and most important is that Section 302 is part of the labor law."
2013.12-99,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2047.997,2055.98,"But we have conflicting provisions within standard statutes anyway, so why doesn't the concept behind it still apply?"
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2055.98,2063.835,The concept would if there was a direct conflict between the general prohibition of 302 and any right granted by the National Labor Relations Act.
2013.12-99,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2127.044,2127.497,It's not covering.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2206.309,2210.105,--That nothing in the National Labor Relations Act gives them a right to that.
2013.12-99,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2210.105,2211.9,I didn't say they had a right.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2213.709,2214.199,Exactly.
2013.12-99,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2214.199,2226.569,What they said was the kinds of property or things of value are at issue here are the kinds of things that play important roles in organizing campaigns.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2241.297,2242.188,But Section--
2013.12-99,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2242.188,2243.718,--just like the Jeep on the pedestal.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2243.718,2249.436,--But Section 302 was specifically amended in 1959 to apply to union organizing.
2013.12-99,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2262.836,2263.289,Yes.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2308.381,2308.633,Yes.
2013.12-99,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2320.619,2329.975,"Then may I ask you, Mr. Messenger, to clarify, because I thought you told me before that some organizing agreements are okay."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2348.217,2354.309,"Yes, because the issue, I believe, with any agreement is each particular term has to be looked at individually."
2013.12-99,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2365.46,2371.427,"So you -- you do you want us to say that -- that to the extent that the Eleventh Circuit said,"
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2381.487,2382.408,Yes.
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2396.042,2403.209,"So, Mr. Messenger, just to make sure I understand that, you're saying that regardless of whether there was a bargain in this case, forget the bargain."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2426.372,2427.652,--That's correct.
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2432.404,2433.023,But we -- we don't need this.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2434.038,2434.354,--Yes.
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2434.354,2443.71,"--of course, this is important to the union, so your argument is that it falls within the statute, regardless of whether there's any consideration or quid pro quo."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2443.71,2444.45,Exactly.
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2445.054,2446.208,I'm sorry.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2446.208,2446.821,Exactly.
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2452.991,2469.968,"So this is to say that the National Labor Relations Act prohibits employers from providing access to their premises, from granting a union a list of employees, or from declaring itself neutral as to a union election."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2469.968,2473.482,"--Yes, with caveats."
2013.12-99,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2497.87,2506.554,Do you acknowledge that your -- that your answer to Justice Kagan is -- is contrary to years of settled practices and understandings?
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2506.554,2510.334,"--No, Your Honor, I don't believe that it is."
2013.12-99,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2511.551,2513.691,"In other words, this kind of an agreement is very rare?"
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2513.691,2515.176,--It's not rare now.
2013.12-99,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2518.268,2521.126,And it has -- it has been enforced under 301.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2534.028,2535.715,--The exact opposite is true.
2013.12-99,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2547.506,2553.363,Have -- have courts enforced agreements just like this one under 301?
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2553.363,2554.16,Many times.
2013.12-99,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2564.062,2566.124,"The question is the same, I think."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2575.188,2575.735,Yes.
2013.12-99,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2576.0,2577.401,"In fact, I think you said a big hole."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2577.401,2577.7,--Yes.
2013.12-99,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2579.425,2580.0,All right.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2580.05,2581.0,--because of anything enforceable--
2013.12-99,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2581.0,2581.525,--I get the point.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2581.525,2581.6,--I'm sorry.
2013.12-99,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2581.6,2583.163,I'm focusing on the hole.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2583.163,2582.271,Yes.
2013.12-99,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2582.271,2599.625,"Now, I thought the area that you're calling a hole is an area where the National Labor Relations Act gives the National Labor Relations Board all kinds of authority to set rules and to say what is an appropriate practice and not."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2600.812,2602.093,"To a degree, yes, but 302 always covers--"
2013.12-99,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2602.093,2602.322,All right.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2660.096,2667.891,"--The difference, Your Honor -- I can't speak for Bologna, but 302 is meant to govern labor relations--"
2013.12-99,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2667.891,2668.343,Yes.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2668.343,2670.998,"--including organizing, including collective bargaining."
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2677.964,2681.791,"Mr. Messenger, suppose that there was a -- a union and it was striking."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2708.139,2718.362,"--No, because in that case, there's no thing that's actually be given to the union, especially if you're talking about negotiating a collectively bargaining agreement, which, of course, those benefits go to employees."
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2718.362,2719.284,There's no thing that's given to the union?
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2730.639,2732.967,But the question becomes negotiate what?
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2751.492,2761.566,"Well, I guess -- I mean, we're going to negotiate about all kinds of things, things -- things that unions and employers negotiate about, and that's of great benefit to the union."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2768.671,2773.357,"I would say in that case, even if it did have value, no thing is delivered to the union."
2013.12-99,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2774.419,2777.558,"Well, benefits -- benefits to the employees always benefit the union."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2813.857,2815.107,--No.
2013.12-99,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2815.107,2816.511,I don't understand what that means.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2816.511,2817.933,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-99,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2829.679,2838.691,"And what if the employer does not oppose the union, he neither speaks against it nor for it?"
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2841.595,2843.141,Not if he does so unilaterally.
2013.12-99,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2858.901,2865.196,It has no meaning to say you agree to something when you're not getting anything in return.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2876.472,2878.049,And there will be consideration.
2013.12-99,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2884.469,2888.701,"But if it did happen, you'd say it would be a violation."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2888.701,2889.576,--Yes.
2013.12-99,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2922.531,2930.388,"You would argue that the three items in dispute -- the access to property, etc."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2939.15,2940.305,The interest arbitration?
2013.12-99,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2940.305,2948.926,The arbitration of disputes that was promised by the employer and the union under this agreement.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2948.926,2951.426,I wouldn't call that consideration.
2013.12-99,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2958.656,2959.813,Not to strike.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2959.813,2960.483,"Yes, not to strike."
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2960.483,2964.889,"Mr. Messenger, would your argument apply to the following?"
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2972.604,2977.041,"During collective bargaining, no, because it would fall under the final clause of Section (c)(2)."
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2977.041,2982.147,But not if not during collective bargaining?
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2982.147,2985.24,"Then if that had value to the union, yes."
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2985.24,2986.1,I'm sure it does.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,2990.363,2995.581,"No, because the grievance procedures ultimately go to the employee."
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3000.218,3005.107,"Could you explain that distinction to me, ultimately go to the employee?"
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,3011.776,3024.506,"Well, but 302, its very structure sort of differentiates the union from the employee, so the thought of what's good for the union is good for the employee is somewhat rejected implicitly in 302, that there's a separation there."
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3026.677,3041.873,"But the union, on the ones that you say, well, the neutrality agreements, the access, that's just to the union, the union can turn around and say: No, ultimately it's to the employee, that we're going to represent the employees well."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,3048.2,3050.198,--I believe I didn't perhaps explain it correctly.
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3062.7,3063.1,"Okay, so the--"
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,3063.1,3065.363,--Payment or delivery -- I'm sorry.
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3065.363,3066.737,"--No, please."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,3066.737,3067.862,Payment or delivery.
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3079.232,3084.512,"Yes, but my hypothetical is the thing, was the union's role in grievance procedures."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,3084.512,3085.184,--Grievance procedures--
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3085.184,3086.293,"So the union gets it, right?"
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,3086.293,3087.493,--No.
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3110.908,3120.544,"Well, I guess I'll tell you that a union that can say that it has a role in grievance procedures is, that's an important thing for a union to be able to tell its employees."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,3123.075,3126.073,But is the value coming from the employer?
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3132.195,3142.316,"How about -- how about if a company gives a union a role in company decision-making, any kind, hiring, any other kind of company decision-making?"
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,3144.955,3150.407,"I would say probably not, because what is ultimately the thing?"
2013.12-99,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3187.377,3197.419,"It's hard to think that one really pays or lends or delivers, which is are statutory words, neutrality of speech."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,3197.419,3200.011,It would be control.
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3219.941,3231.737,"Mr. Messenger, the Excelsior rule, if I understand it correctly, the NLRB says that an employer absolutely has to give a list of employees--"
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,3231.737,3231.937,Yes.
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3231.937,3236.686,--to the union seven days after an election is called; is that correct?
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,3236.686,3237.623,Not exactly.
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3243.684,3244.059,"Okay, okay."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,3246.136,3246.713,"Eventually, yes."
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3246.713,3248.729,And that's by requirement.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,3256.896,3257.739,Yes.
2013.12-99,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3257.739,3267.111,"So it goes within a period of 24 hours, something that no employer can do voluntarily to something that has to be done."
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,3267.111,3271.437,"Yes, and the reason is it's not the possession of the list that's somehow wrongful."
2013.12-99,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3314.061,3333.883,Is it -- we heard from the other side that that hundred-thousand-dollar payment for the ballot initiative was a benefit both because it would mean that there would be many more workers employed by the casino if they were allowed to go into this new line of business.
2013.12-99,2,45468,william_l_messenger,,3345.407,3346.704,Yes.
2013.12-99,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3357.309,3357.762,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-99,3,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,3359.543,3360.824,Thank you.
2013.12-99,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3362.699,3363.115,Mr. McCracken--
2013.12-99,3,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,3363.115,3363.503,--Yes.
2013.12-99,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3363.503,3391.539,"--If I understood the circuit below, it was suggesting, like the government, that an exchange of agreements for purposes of peaceful recognition, terms that were given for that purpose were legal, but that things given for -- that were not solely for recognition, had value outside of that, like money, would be wrong."
2013.12-99,3,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,3433.475,3465.166,"And the -- reading the Eleventh Circuit's decision is actually somewhat difficult, because the -- it appears that the court suspected that there must be something else in the picture that had not been disclosed and that's why it ordered the district court to find out why the two parties had cooperated with each other, despite the fact that no one had alleged anything else in the picture besides what is before us all now."
2013.12-99,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3476.302,3480.723,I don't think it -- it was puzzled by the provisions at issue.
2013.12-99,3,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,3482.456,3483.003,--Yes.
2013.12-99,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3520.238,3526.375,"Well, but there was a promise to exercise the First Amendment rights in a particular way up to the amount of $100,000."
2013.12-99,3,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,3526.375,3527.047,Yes.
2013.12-99,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3527.047,3527.937,That -- that's a little different.
2013.12-99,3,39904,richard_g_mccracken,,3527.937,3549.038,"It's a little different, but also very similar to the promises that are actually on the face of the memorandum itself, because the union agrees to waive its First Amendment rights to engage in picketing and boycott activity, as well as the employer waiving some of its rights with respect to its freedom of speech."
2013.12-99,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3645.225,3645.912,"Thank you, counsel."
