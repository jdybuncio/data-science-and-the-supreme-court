1977.76-1159,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,45.76,"We will hear arguments next in 1159, Quern against Mandley, and 1416, Califano against Mandley."
1977.76-1159,0,25689,george_w_lindberg,,50.254,53.411,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1159,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,625.196,634.027,"Mr. Lindberg, is there any further definition of special need items in the regulations or anywhere else?"
1977.76-1159,0,25689,george_w_lindberg,,643.354,646.487,"No, are you referring to the statute or the Secretary?"
1977.76-1159,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,646.487,653.454,"I am asking you, is there anything anywhere defining special need items except the definition of historical experience?"
1977.76-1159,0,25689,george_w_lindberg,,653.454,665.693,"I believe that what you have said is correct in your question that it is a generally accepted, understood term of art in the field."
1977.76-1159,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,665.693,672.229,"To cover or at least to include, what is the emergency?"
1977.76-1159,0,25689,george_w_lindberg,,672.229,677.606,Non-reoccurring needs.
1977.76-1159,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,703.201,710.149,"Special need items do not freely translate into emergency assistance, does it?"
1977.76-1159,0,25689,george_w_lindberg,,710.149,714.011,Only by use and application.
1977.76-1159,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,714.011,725.544,"And you say in your state of Illinois, the history has been that these payments do include the same payments that would have been provided under the other program."
1977.76-1159,0,25689,george_w_lindberg,,725.544,726.897,That is correct.
1977.76-1159,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,726.897,730.233,Do you know any of the experience or history in other states?
1977.76-1159,0,25689,george_w_lindberg,,730.233,757.942,"Yes, I understand that there are 27 states that have special need items attached to their AFDC Programs and I am also to understand that five or slightly more of those states do meet emergency needs under their special needs item under their AFDC Program."
1977.76-1159,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,757.942,760.26,"Mr. Lindberg, can I just be sure I am following this."
1977.76-1159,0,25689,george_w_lindberg,,766.051,770.277,"Yes, that is correct, special need items."
1977.76-1159,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,770.277,771.537,That is AFDC.
1977.76-1159,0,25689,george_w_lindberg,,771.537,772.631,Yes.
1977.76-1159,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,772.631,774.925,That is the AFDC rather than the emergency?
1977.76-1159,0,25689,george_w_lindberg,,774.925,775.543,Yes.
1977.76-1159,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,775.543,780.174,So that your point is that it did expressly authorize emergency assistance?
1977.76-1159,0,25689,george_w_lindberg,,780.174,794.984,"My point is that there is a Secretary’s regulation indicating that it is legal, regular, authorized for an AFDC Program to have a special needs provision."
1977.76-1159,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,834.281,851.3,"Perhaps I am repeating what Justice Stewart asked, but I want to be sure I follow, the question that I was not sure of is, how much of the states had previously been doing, although it was special, could properly be classified as emergency and how do we know how much there was of that character?"
1977.76-1159,0,25689,george_w_lindberg,,851.3,853.015,I am afraid we do not know.
1977.76-1159,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,853.015,854.137,The record really does not tell us?
1977.76-1159,0,25689,george_w_lindberg,,854.137,859.129,"No, we can indicate that there were man-made catastrophes and natural catastrophes."
1977.76-1159,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,859.129,869.851,"I suppose the inference Mr. Justice Stewart may have been drawing is that since Congress sought that we needed another statute to deal with this problem, that perhaps it is reasonable to infer that it was not adequately dealt with before?"
1977.76-1159,0,25689,george_w_lindberg,,869.851,874.631,"Well, I think in part, that is a part of the rationale of Congress."
1977.76-1159,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,902.421,903.661,For not longer than 30 days?
1977.76-1159,0,25689,george_w_lindberg,,903.661,905.726,Not longer than 30 days in one year --
1977.76-1159,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,905.726,908.234,In any twelve-month period?
1977.76-1159,0,25689,george_w_lindberg,,908.234,911.155,-- and that was the objective of that provision.
1977.76-1159,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,919.803,967.768,"The question which has aroused my brother Stevens' interest as well as my own is whether or not special need items, which you tell us is nowhere defined, includes the very specific definition of emergency assistance appearing in 606 (e) (1) and reproduced on page A6 of the Appendix of your brief, the term “emergency assistance to needy families and children means any of the following: furnished for a period of not less than 30 days in any twelve-month period and so on, which is very, very specific and does, and does deal with emergencies which as I say, does not translate freely into special need items?"
1977.76-1159,0,25689,george_w_lindberg,,967.768,972.635,"Well, very honestly Mr. Justice, that is a difficulty."
1977.76-1159,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,986.575,988.701,Mr. Jones?
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,988.701,992.291,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1159,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1266.806,1270.865,"When you say “states have,” do you mean all the states have?"
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,1270.865,1273.118,Not all states.
1977.76-1159,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1280.478,1286.382,"Your colleague says there are probably 27 states, is that the figure that apply --?"
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,1286.382,1288.959,I think that is not accurate.
1977.76-1159,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1417.678,1434.192,"I suppose the best test of the administrative interpretation of special need items is its, as you are standing here on behalf of the agency and I guess that they do include what Illinois is now doing?"
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,1434.192,1436.15,There is more in the record.
1977.76-1159,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1490.579,1515.991,"Mr. Jones, could I ask you a question that you can cover as you go along, just looking at it rather broadly, if the EA Program allows 50% reimbursement and the AFDC Program allows a larger percentage of reimbursement, and if the state could be covered under either program, why would it ever elect to be under the EA program?"
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,1515.991,1518.582,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1977.76-1159,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1518.582,1520.592,Illinois does give to broader category?
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,1520.592,1532.778,"Well, that is right and I think, frankly, one of the mysteries in this case is why Illinois ever chose to have an EA Program rather than an AFDC Emergency Program."
1977.76-1159,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1532.778,1537.196,Unless it thought that was the only legitimate source of funds?
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,1537.196,1550.264,"Well, there are some minor differences between the two programs that I will reach in a moment and I have no independent knowledge of whether those differences affected the state’s decision."
1977.76-1159,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1591.7,1594.551,Was that true at the time of the program involved here too?
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,1594.551,1596.442,"I do not know, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1977.76-1159,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1751.475,1755.245,Some other little typo or something in your brief to us?
1977.76-1159,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1755.245,1756.563,That is correct.
1977.76-1159,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2211.589,2213.825,That was the Court of Appeals’ first decision which is the Mandley --
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2213.825,2217.986,"That is correct, that is the so-called Mandley I decision."
1977.76-1159,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2252.307,2268.73,"Mr. Jones, is it truly moot because if we should buy your argument that you made thus far and let the state know that it has the option to reinstate an EA Plan, is it not something that might be likely to reoccur?"
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2276.035,2277.694,That may be very well be.
1977.76-1159,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2306.251,2307.307,That is what I was going to ask you.
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2310.344,2315.949,"Well, I had it rest that in reverse order, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1977.76-1159,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2342.736,2343.714,"That is the end of it, is it not?"
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2343.714,2352.85,That is the end of it and all of my efforts with regard to the rest of the case would have been wasted.
1977.76-1159,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2375.962,2384.486,"Mr. Jones, under the normal test, if the litigation is the real life controversy when the complainant is filed and when the District Court first decides the merits."
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2400.768,2411.236,The Court would have to evaluate the likelihood that the state would recur to the behavior that caused the lawsuit to be shaped in the first place.
1977.76-1159,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2411.236,2437.967,"That case has involved a violator from the idea was that after somebody has voluntary ceased activity and a claim was made, there is no point in enjoining them, but this Court in that and other cases held that, yes, you can enjoin them because they might, sometime in the future want to continue their violations, but your claim here is that there was no violation, that we should decide that?"
1977.76-1159,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2437.967,2441.242,"I think it is clear that even if there was a violation, it is moot."
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2443.096,2449.547,"Well, there was a violation in the terms of the Court of Appeals on that order, that is correct."
1977.76-1159,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2462.56,2466.472,But it is not voluntary if it is undertaken in the face of a court order?
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2466.472,2470.843,"No, the order did not require to an AFCD Program."
1977.76-1159,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2470.843,2473.845,"I know, but it found a violation."
1977.76-1159,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2473.845,2476.038,It does not complain to everybody.
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2476.038,2481.032,That would be the correct in the WT Grant situation as well.
1977.76-1159,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2486.489,2491.336,"All on your own now, what do you want us to do, now on your own?"
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2491.336,2494.102,"Speaking for the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare?"
1977.76-1159,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2494.102,2497.103,Right.
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2497.103,2506.939,We would very much like the Court to dispose of the merits because that would give both the states and federal government the guidelines that they need.
1977.76-1159,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2506.939,2508.838,There are at least two issues involving the merits.
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2514.159,2515.73,And the second is whether Mandley II was correctly decided?
1977.76-1159,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2515.73,2523.057,And secondly was Mandley II correctly decided on the merits and those are two quite different though perhaps related issues?
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2523.057,2526.835,Let me state my position this way.
1977.76-1159,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2537.64,2538.91,Because that is what is going on now?
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2538.91,2540.059,That is correct.
1977.76-1159,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2559.642,2569.887,"But unless this Court were to consider Mandley I, the state would be forbidden by the mandate of the Court of Appeals in Mandley I from going back to that?"
1977.76-1159,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2569.887,2571.311,Going back to EA and just say everybody?
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2571.311,2576.323,Not if this case were to be declared moot.
1977.76-1159,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2596.575,2603.531,Was WT Grant a mootness case?[Laughter]
1977.76-1159,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2603.531,2614.78,The discontinuance of the illegal practice is a factor that chancellor may consider in deciding whether or not to grant an injunction that does not render the controversy moot and that is exactly what we have got here?
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2614.78,2634.278,"We have proceeded under the hypothesis that the state would not revert to an EA Program since it can satisfy its needs under the AFDC Program, but there may be reasons why the state would actually prefer an EA Program because of the differences between the two programs."
1977.76-1159,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2634.278,2641.895,"Yes, but if the state is here saying “I want to establish whether I am free to go one route or another” why is the case moot?"
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2641.895,2644.38,"The state has asked the case to be dismissed, is it not?"
1977.76-1159,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2644.38,2648.375,"Yes, but the state’s position is that it can do either one?"
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2648.375,2651.082,That is correct.
1977.76-1159,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2651.082,2651.911,And you do not want --
1977.76-1159,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2651.911,2655.163,We are certainly not bound by the state’s view of mootness?
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2655.163,2655.72,That is correct.
1977.76-1159,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2655.72,2666.692,"And if they are asserting that they can do either one, how is the case moot?"
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2669.882,2676.194,It was preparatory to a speech.[Laughter]
1977.76-1159,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2696.308,2711.571,"Do you think the state’s behavior in this case is in any way, influenced by their concern about what might happen by what the Court of Appeals in Mandley II regarded as rather flagrant misrepresentations to the District Court and if that was all wiped clean they might have a attitude?"
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2714.916,2716.946,Absolutely.
1977.76-1159,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2716.946,2740.74,"And I think in that situation they would have very strong motivation for saying “this case is awfully moot, please leave us alone,” but if you are talking about running a welfare program and if a lot of states, and I assume some do, want to include in their EA Program certain beneficiaries who are ineligible under the AFDC Program, it seems to me it is entirely reasonable to assume Illinois might want to broaden its coverage sometime in the future."
1977.76-1159,1,33870,keith_jones,,2742.646,2744.729,That is a likely possibility.
1977.76-1159,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2796.706,2821.2,Mr. Lefkow?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,2821.2,2824.043,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1159,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2911.89,2918.012,Is it your position that Mandley II is entirely separate litigation from Mandley I?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,2918.012,2922.563,"We believe it is a sequel, Your Honor, but it is different in that --"
1977.76-1159,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2922.563,2926.261,Is it a different case in the District Court?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,2926.261,2929.853,"No, both decisions arose from the same complaint, Your Honor."
1977.76-1159,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2929.853,2944.04,"So then this Court is not bound, of course, by any Court of Appeals' decision and I presume the parties to Mandley I are not bound under any Doctrine of Res Judicata by Mandley I?"
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,2944.04,2946.517,I believe they are bound under Mandley I.
1977.76-1159,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2949.472,2951.933,You believe they are bound in what sense?
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2951.933,2953.546,"It is the law of the case, is it not?"
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,2953.546,2954.4,"It is the law of case, Your Honor."
1977.76-1159,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2954.4,2958.799,"Well, but it is not the law of the case in this Court, it is the law of the case in the Seventh Circuit?"
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,2958.799,2960.408,"I understand that, Your Honor."
1977.76-1159,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3008.242,3012.546,Why should they have given notice to the Court?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3012.546,3018.953,They should have given notice to the Court because it is a court of equity that was considering an Emergency Assistance Program.
1977.76-1159,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3036.118,3037.839,They were parties to the litigation?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3037.839,3039.41,They were parties to the litigation.
1977.76-1159,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3040.075,3050.254,"Well, you say that as soon as you are a party to a litigation then whatever you do thereafter, you have to give notice to the court in which the litigation was commenced?"
1977.76-1159,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3050.254,3052.318,If it affects the litigation?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3052.318,3056.142,"Well Your Honor, I think it is clear that it did affect in our opinion, the litigation."
1977.76-1159,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3082.994,3085.481,Was HEW a party to the first litigation?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3085.481,3086.158,"They were, Your Honor."
1977.76-1159,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3642.396,3660.522,"Mr. Lefkow, do you not leap one point to what state say, to be sure that I have your answer to, they say that the mandatory language in 402 (a) (10) is that it was controlling in Townsend does not apply to the EA Program, and therefore, you do not have the same argument that you had in Townsend."
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3662.198,3667.421,"My answer is that there was an error in their understanding, I believe, of the case."
1977.76-1159,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3732.92,3741.121,You are affirming completely that you have any quarrel with the second opinion?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3741.121,3744.5,We have no quarrel Your Honor.
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3744.5,3751.45,"Now that you have been interrupted, Mr. Lefkow, I am not sure I understand what you say is now before the Court."
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3757.795,3758.181,Yes.
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3758.181,3775.903,"Is that correct and Mandley II really presents only the issue of whether the program that Illinois is now carrying on under the AFDC is permissible under AFDC, is that correct?"
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3775.903,3776.939,"Yes, that is essentially true."
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3776.939,3798.279,"That is really what it comes down to and if we hold that it is, you lose and that is the end of the case and if we hold that it is not, you win and that is the end of the case that way, without considering Mandley I at all or without considering mootness at all, is that not right?"
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3798.279,3805.643,"I think it would be very difficult, Your Honor, to reverse Mandley II without considering Mandley I."
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3805.643,3822.53,"If this is a permissible course of action which Illinois has now taken, under its understanding of the authorization given to it by the AFDC provisions, then that is the end of it, is it not?"
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3822.53,3823.364,"I do not think so, Your Honor."
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3823.364,3823.92,"Now, why not?"
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3826.582,3828.72,"Well, if I did, let me make a small extension to it."
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3828.72,3830.019,Alright.
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3833.965,3850.935,It seems to me that they have accepted Mandley I and that is that emergency assistance is provided pursuant to Section 406 (e) (1) of the Act if they accept federal funds.
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3851.822,3854.769,I am not sure it does and maybe it is because of my lack of understanding?
1977.76-1159,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3854.769,3859.716,I do not see how Mandley I is here at all.
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3868.142,3869.451,Mandley I.
1977.76-1159,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3869.451,3871.389,Mandley I.
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3871.389,3890.322,"Your honor, the reason, it is to an extent alive is we oppose the petition for certiorari and the court did not expressly read the limit the grant of jurisdiction in Mandley II so we felt compelled of course to brief the merits in Mandley I and to present an argument upon it."
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3891.555,3891.957,You concede --
1977.76-1159,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3891.957,3894.919,All I am asking you is how do we get it?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3899.196,3904.979,Where the federal defendant has waited 548 days to petition for certiorari?
1977.76-1159,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3905.719,3917.273,"No, where you have two cases and one is past the time for certiorari and once the period of time to apply the certiorari is over, that is the judgment, is it not?"
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3917.273,3918.448,"I believe it is, Your Honor."
1977.76-1159,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3918.448,3919.865,Is it final?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3919.865,3920.563,The Mandley II --
1977.76-1159,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3920.563,3922.385,Is it final?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3922.385,3925.532,"In my opinion, it is, Your Honor."
1977.76-1159,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3925.532,3928.792,Was it appealed in this case?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3928.792,3930.254,"No, it was not."
1977.76-1159,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3930.254,3931.177,"Well, how is it here?"
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3931.177,3937.529,Although the HEW did receive from this Court an extension of time within which to petition for certiorari.
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3937.529,3939.199,To review the Mandley II decision?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3939.199,3940.494,"No, to review Mandley I."
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3940.494,3941.845,Oh! To they did not petition.
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3941.845,3950.868,"Did not petition and the Court of Appeals in Mandley lI noted that they considered Mandley I final and I think, of course, from the Court of Appeals’ position they had to consider Mandley I."
1977.76-1159,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3950.868,3961.02,"Well, are any of the issues raised in the petition for certiorari in this case that is now before us dependent in any way or question in any way on Mandley I?"
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3961.02,3962.006,"Yes, they do."
1977.76-1159,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3962.006,3980.629,"Well, then I do not see how you can say that Mandley I is not before us in the sense that petitioners are entitled to argue perhaps unsuccessfully whatever issues that they raised in their petition for certiorari."
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,3992.76,3996.555,"Your honor, I would not suggest that this court could not review Mandley I."
1977.76-1159,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4002.349,4027.832,Would you say that if the Illinois welfare people had never tried what they tried in that Mandley I under AFDC and simply started the program challenged in Mandley II that the case before us would be any different than the one that now is?
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4027.832,4028.915,"That is it, is it not?"
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,4032.787,4038.991,"The answer to that is, I think, Your Honor, if they believe they could do it they should have told the District Court the first time."
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4040.56,4043.444,Was that a federal question?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,4043.444,4043.842,It is a federal question.
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4043.842,4055.593,"I think that is maybe a failure of protocol or courtesy, but I am asking what issues are before us? Is it not just the permissibility under AFDC of what Illinois is now doing?"
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,4063.956,4067.308,"Well, it will depend on the state’s own law."
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4078.625,4080.181,It is a matter of state law?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,4080.181,4082.102,"Right, but we allege that in our complaint, Your Honor."
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4082.102,4084.795,That is a matter of state law.
1977.76-1159,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4087.837,4090.875,"Mr. Lefkow, can I approach this from just a slightly different angle?"
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,4127.546,4138.58,"No, it would not, Your Honor because, as we mentioned, the state has a statute which requires them to fully participate and number two, we have alleged equal protection violation."
1977.76-1159,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4138.58,4155.564,"But say we disagree with you entirely on the merits of your claim that they must provide more than they originally provided under EA, then you really do not have any reason to object to the program now in effect because all you would be saying now is that it is wrong to do as much as you are doing?"
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,4155.564,4162.492,"Well Your honor, my clients would have a reason to object to it, but whether it would be a legally cognizable reason would be another question."
1977.76-1159,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4162.492,4171.742,"It is critical to your case that you win on Mandley I or we assume Mandley I was correctly decided, one of the two?"
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,4171.742,4172.779,We certainly believe that it was.
1977.76-1159,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4172.779,4187.301,"However we so allow the case or merits or anything, there is no reason to get to Mandley II if we do not make the assumption that you correctly prevailed in Mandley I because it seems to me, otherwise, you would have no interest in Mandley II?"
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4187.301,4199.952,"There is a question, whether quite apart from previous history, whether a state right now can under AFDC authority do what Illinois is doing or must it do more?"
1977.76-1159,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4199.952,4204.706,But this litigant has no interest in that question unless it was right in Mandley I?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,4204.706,4213.957,"Well Your Honor, there is no express authority in the Social Security Act for providing emergency assistance as a special need."
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4407.604,4411.022,It is emergency disaster program?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,4411.022,4412.215,"Well, it is not a disaster."
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4412.215,4422.085,But it is limited to 30 days in any twelve-months period and the state can set the need and the amount?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,4422.085,4427.118,"Yes Your Honor, subject to providing aid to really relieved destitution."
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4430.3,4432.53,For evictions or casualty losses and so on?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,4432.53,4434.994,"Well, or food or clothing or shelter."
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4434.994,4441.047,"But resulting from emergency catastrophes, is it not, or individual catastrophes, it does not have to be --?"
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,4441.047,4451.294,"Well, the language of the reports and the remarks on the floor is that when a family suffered an emergency without limitation as to the cause or the type."
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4477.184,4478.502,It is what this legislation is about?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,4478.502,4479.765,It certainly is.
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4558.862,4560.664,But all less than the full?
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,4560.664,4561.056,Right.
1977.76-1159,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4561.056,4565.39,"So all of those 12 would be in violation under Mandley I, correct?"
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,4565.39,4567.478,"That would be correct, Your Honor."
1977.76-1159,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4794.656,4796.217,We will resume there at 1 o' clock counsel.
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,4796.217,4813.316,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1977.76-1159,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4813.316,4816.068,"Counsel, you may continue."
1977.76-1159,2,36175,michael_f_lefkow,,4816.068,4819.193,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1159,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5051.574,5052.499,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
