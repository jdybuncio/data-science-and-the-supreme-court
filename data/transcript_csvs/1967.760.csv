1967.760,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,20.368,"Number 760, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, petitioner versus Irving Gordon et al. and number 781 Oscar E. Bann, et al. petitioners versus Commissioner of Internal Revenue."
1967.760,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,27.125,30.783,May it please the Court.
1967.760,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,53.67,56.705,"Who won, Mr. Solicitor General?"
1967.760,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,56.705,58.521,It was a tie.
1967.760,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,58.521,60.724,How badly did they divide --
1967.760,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,60.724,61.269,How --
1967.760,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,61.269,67.174,How badly did they divide -- on the result.
1967.760,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,67.174,72.464,"That, I do not (Voice Overlap) [Laughter]"
1967.760,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1278.488,1298.827,"Mr. Solicitor General, could I ask you about what are the provisions of the -- on page 54 and 55 that says paragraph (1) shall not apply, if, then go to (B), securities in the controlled corporation are received and no securities are surrendered in connection with such distribution."
1967.760,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1298.827,1303.078,"That relates to debt securities, Mr. Justice."
1967.760,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1311.422,1315.877,So security -- so the security does not apply to stock?
1967.760,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1315.877,1317.317,Security does not apply to stock --
1967.760,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1317.317,1321.235,That's just wholly inapplicable to this case because securities weren't involved?
1967.760,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1321.235,1325.768,And that is only inapplicable because securities are not involved.
1967.760,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1408.956,1418.951,"Mr. Solicitor General, do you mind telling me where the name spin-off came from?"
1967.760,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1418.951,1422.214,"Frankly, I don't know."
1967.760,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1504.244,1505.923,This is a spin-off?
1967.760,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1508.18,1514.782,This -- this case would have been a spin-off if they had distributed the stock in Pacific.
1967.760,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1522.731,1526.93,"And if it is -- if it is not a spin-off, well, what is it?"
1967.760,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1526.93,1539.048,"Well, I referred to it in my opening statement as a kind of a spin-off [Attempt to Laughter] and if it's not a spin-off, it's a sale of the Pacific stock through the issuance of rights."
1967.760,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1583.355,1587.275,"Then, it is a spin-off or is this a sale, not any of these other two --"
1967.760,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1587.275,1605.669,"No, it is not -- I'm sorry, I referred to split-up and split-off, but Section 355 does relate to them as well as to distributions without the giving up of any other property."
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,3389.748,3393.589,May it please the Court.
1967.760,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3718.879,3720.675,But that isn't quite so.
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,3748.851,3760.478,"The net effect is to increase the capital of Pacific, but it need not to be considered, as the Second Circuit considered it from a tax standpoint, as a contribution to capital."
1967.760,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3781.448,3787.629,"And that's the way it was set up actually in the plan, wasn't it, as announced to the shareholders."
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,3790.388,3800.888,"Yes, Your Honor, so that the rights or the means whereby the Northwest stock was distributed to the Pacific shareholders."
1967.760,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3902.233,3905.362,They did that less $16 though?
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,3905.362,3925.795,"That is true, but the payment of cash into the corporation should not be a vice to a tax and I will advert to that Your Honor if I may in pointing to the question raised by the -- by Judge Moore and which properly was raised."
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4052.371,4066.463,"May I ask you when the shareholder received what he gets, did he receive in stock, plus rights, something of greater value than he had in the original company?"
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4066.463,4068.886,No Your Honor.
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4068.886,4074.333,"Why he didn't, if the rights worth more than when they were assessed and as valued?"
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4074.333,4081.105,"When the rights were issued, there was no reduction in the aggregated net worth of Pacific."
1967.760,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4141.189,4153.335,"Suppose instead of -- suppose instead of it being a loss to the right holder or the stockholder, it was a profit."
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4157.502,4162.6,"There would have to be a profit in some tangible form as the Court asked, â€œWhere is it?"
1967.760,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4163.349,4165.051,You say there cannot be --
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4165.051,4172.156,There cannot be a profit here because the taxpayers receive nothing more than what they have before.
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4214.481,4219.137,"-- it's more specific in the same condition it had been, when the stock was issued?"
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4219.137,4221.64,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4233.351,4237.235,"But, it wasn't -- this went to different shareholders, isn't it?"
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4237.235,4237.752,"No, Your Honor."
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4237.752,4241.656,I mean to the same shareholders but with a different company.
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4241.656,4253.295,"The Northwest stock represented the investment of the shareholders through Pacific, and the assets in business in the three Northwest states."
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4253.295,4271.717,"But why if, I'll just say if -- why if the stock was worth more, I mean the right was worth more than it was assessed there, when it passed out to the Pacific's holding, was not then a distribution of dividend so far as Pacific was concerned?"
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4271.717,4288.867,"Well, I will deal with that Your Honor. I think the answer to that question is found in the Palmer case and this case was cited and discussed in our brief and in the government's briefs, the Palmer case dealt with the nature of stock rights."
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4288.867,4291.664,Under the same statute?
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4291.664,4299.05,The Palmer case dealt with the question of whether the issuance of stock rights gave rise to a dividend.
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4299.05,4300.926,Under the same statute or different?
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4300.926,4305.229,"Under a different statute, but essentially the same language."
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4380.324,4389.31,"But why wouldn't that be if the rights were created in a way, it gave the man something more valuable than what that which he hadn't before?"
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4389.31,4393.403,There is no reduction in the corporate property or net worth.
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4403.395,4405.361,Property is something of value?
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4405.361,4408.344,Property maybe something of value.
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4442.679,4447.493,"But isn't it accepted, when it's accepted as a stock in the new corporation?"
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4447.493,4448.265,That is so.
1967.760,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4490.049,4526.034,"The Solicitor General suggests that if you pursue that line of argument, you would find yourself impaled on the other horn of the dilemma that he presents, because in that event, there haven't been some trading in the warrants of the stock that was not distributed to the stockholders of Pacific, but it was distributed in part of the stockholders and in part to others and in any event, there is no assurance that it was distributed as a statute seems to contemplate pro rata (Voice Overlap) Pacific."
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4526.034,4547.533,"Your Honor, I think that is one of the questions involved in the interpretation of 355 (a) (1) (A) that can be most easily disposed of because the statute does not say distribute it to all of the shareholders of Pacific and the rights were issued to the Pacific shareholders as shareholders."
1967.760,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4548.872,4561.659,"No, but in your colloquy with Justice Black, you said that the distribution did not take place until the stock of Northwest was distributed."
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4580.742,4581.713,That is correct.
1967.760,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4616.218,4630.547,"Do I understand Mr. Horrow that, under your argument, it makes no difference what the value of these rights on the market was?"
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4630.547,4639.461,"In our view, it could make a difference, but not under the facts of this case or these cases, simply this."
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4795.786,4827.025,"I understood you to say or assert that these sections which requires the distribution, immediately before the stock and securities in the controlled corporation, immediately withhold the distribution, then referred all of it, but it says all of the stock and the securities and you say that they did not get it actually until rights had been exercised and cover it within the form."
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4827.025,4828.047,"Well, Your Honor, the --"
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4828.047,4829.954,It says all of the stock?
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4829.954,4830.761,Yes Your Honor.
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4839.386,4839.978,(D) (1)?
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4839.978,4849.452,"And D (1), yes, and the inquiry of Mr. Justice Fortas as I understood was directed at 355 (a) (1) (A) and that was the language --"
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4849.452,4851.071,I thought (Voice Overlap) been mistaken.
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4855.646,4860.394,"No, I believe that he was addressing his remarks to --"
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4860.394,4863.131,"Well, whether he was or not, what do you say about that?"
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4863.131,4878.816,355 (a) (1) (D) requires a distribution of either all of the stock of the controlled corporation or at least 80% --
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4878.816,4887.203,It says all of the stock and securities in the controlled corporation?
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4887.203,4908.121,"The statute, Your Honor, permits retention of some shares as long as these shares are not retained for the purpose of avoidance of federal income tax, but in any event, it is our position that all of the shares of Northwest were distributed."
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4910.294,4913.974,"But the rights were not distributed, I understood you to say --"
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4913.974,4914.52,Rights were not distributed.
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4914.52,4918.821,-- until they were cashed in?
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4918.821,4931.916,"The rights were not the subject to the distribution, but rather the stock, but all of the stock was offered to the Pacific shareholders and all of the stock was thereby distributed."
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4931.916,4934.362,Plus the rights --
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4934.362,4934.973,Well Your Honor --
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4934.973,4936.021,-- wasn't it?
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4936.021,4940.379,-- the rights were the means whereby the stock was distributed.
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4941.177,4945.826,"Whatever it was, they didn't get the stock, did they until they cashed in those rights."
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4945.826,4948.69,They exercised their rights and thereby received the stock.
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4948.69,4951.551,"Tell me, that was how many years?"
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4951.551,4955.084,There was a period of 21 months between --
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4955.084,4956.87,After the distribution?
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4956.87,4964.788,There was a period of 21 months before Pacific completed the distribution of all of the Northwest stock.
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4972.841,4976.76,Suppose it wasn't?
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4976.76,4977.722,The Commissioner then --
1967.760,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4977.722,4982.745,(Voice Overlap) would he overlook at the grades here?
1967.760,1,27252,harry_r_horrow,,4982.745,4985.836,There are two elements involved in this contention.
1967.760,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7146.623,7166.476,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the full quotation from the committee report is given accurately in the taxpayers brief in the footnote at the bottom of page 33 and 34 and I have -- I agree with it entirely."
