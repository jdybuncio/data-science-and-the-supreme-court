1966.800,0,27154,harold_n_hill_jr,,66.501,68.2,May it please the Court.
1966.800,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,222.234,231.685,-- circumstances by majority?
1966.800,0,27154,harold_n_hill_jr,,235.356,236.372,They do.
1966.800,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,236.372,238.496,-- or some other format?
1966.800,0,27154,harold_n_hill_jr,,238.496,241.071,They elect by a majority vote.
1966.800,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,260.444,271.716,"Mr. Hill, is you're suggestion that at least one of the briefs I made the Democratic legislator would be oath bound to vote for the Democratic candidate?"
1966.800,0,27154,harold_n_hill_jr,,271.716,274.171,There is that suggestion in the briefs.
1966.800,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.96,290.578,You're saying that if that's not so that no Democratic legislator would be oath bound to support the Democratic --
1966.800,0,27154,harold_n_hill_jr,,290.578,290.985,That is correct.
1966.800,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,290.985,294.474,He is perfectly free to vote for the Republican.
1966.800,0,27154,harold_n_hill_jr,,294.474,300.776,The Constitution of Georgia says in this particular provision that he shall -- can vote from the top two whichever they maybe.
1966.800,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,310.781,317.572,How do we strike the oath if we're going to let them invoke on it?
1966.800,0,27154,harold_n_hill_jr,,324.763,334.573,"Your Honor could not strike from their minds the fact that they are either Democrats or Republicans but that is a political matter, I believe, which this Court has never gone into."
1966.800,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,362.557,367.431,But we've said they're not bound by it in the situation in the effect.
1966.800,0,27154,harold_n_hill_jr,,367.431,371.612,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1966.800,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,371.795,379.736,But that was the question of the oath ways below -- Mr. Hill in the sense that it's argued in this brief?
1966.800,0,27154,harold_n_hill_jr,,379.736,380.716,I do not recall.
1966.800,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,387.395,398.059,"It's not referred doing -- you've got so much stuff here, I haven't been -- unable to go through all of them but the -- is that the third one in the opinion of the three-judged court, is it?"
1966.800,0,27154,harold_n_hill_jr,,398.059,401.157,"No, it's not referred to in the opinions."
1966.800,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,414.778,424.917,I assume you would say that no voter swore to vote for the -- one of the high men.
1966.800,0,27154,harold_n_hill_jr,,445.963,447.635,That is absolutely correct.
1966.800,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,463.649,466.097,Is this oath in the record somewhere?
1966.800,0,27154,harold_n_hill_jr,,466.097,467.311,"Yes, it is Your Honor."
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2381.83,2385.237,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.800,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2436.169,2436.618,Yes.
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2436.618,2439.419,"-- case, we did enter Court on three counts on a complaint."
1966.800,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2495.421,2497.177,I don't understand what the word is?
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2497.177,2497.959,Yes.
1966.800,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2497.959,2510.318,"Are you suggesting in light of our affirmance with the three-judge order that this legislature taking office in January, is it constitutionally malapportionment?"
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2510.318,2510.622,Yes.
1966.800,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2562.338,2565.626,Because that had been fashioned by the -- a malapportioned legislature?
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2565.626,2567.067,By a malapportioned legislature.
1966.800,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2567.067,2567.655,Yes.
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2567.655,2577.289,And the Court's reasoning in that case was that it would take a two-thirds vote by a properly apportioned legislature to amend that -- to propose an amendment to that new Constitution.
1966.800,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2617.556,2632.993,"Well, I just have trouble, you concede -- extricating how you can characterize this new legislature as malapportioned when for the purposes of this election at least in this constitute as a legislative body."
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2639.475,2655.631,"Oh, I think then you get to the general, the position that Mr. Justice Harlan took which was that it -- once the legislature was empowered, you know to continue to operate that it had the right to do anything in the former case, the Fortson v. Toombs."
1966.800,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2655.631,2660.994,"Well, do you urge that the -- with this legislature can perform no functions --"
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2660.994,2661.128,"No, sir."
1966.800,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2661.128,2662.594,"-- because it's malapportioned, (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2662.594,2662.873,"No, sir we --"
1966.800,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2662.873,2666.14,What distinction do you make?
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2667.874,2670.535,"Well, I'd say under the same reason --"
1966.800,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2670.535,2677.519,Why don't you go the larger question counsel because I -- as I read your brief that you're merely emphasizing a malapportionment only aggravates --
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2677.519,2679.591,Aggravates --
1966.800,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2679.591,2682.325,-- what you deemed to be the unconstitutional features anyway.
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2682.325,2682.479,"Yes, sir."
1966.800,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2682.479,2684.278,It's not an independent ground.
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2684.278,2685.063,"Yes, sir."
1966.800,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2715.165,2726.118,But you would be making the argument Mr. Justice Douglas indicates whether or not this legislature was not apportioned and you would also make the same argument if there was a tie --
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2726.118,2726.306,Correct.
1966.800,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2726.306,2741.019,"-- within the popular vote and you would say that any provision over a -- or the legislature breaking a tie wherever, whatever the state -- whatever the apportionment would be unconstitutional in your --"
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2741.019,2743.657,I would -- I pretty won't have to take that position.
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2748.002,2750.891,Because you have reached the (Inaudible)
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2750.891,2752.859,Not -- I hope not.
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2752.999,2760.779,I understood your complaint did raise it precisely as an alternative ground of the injunction?
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2760.779,2760.811,The --
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2760.811,2762.799,That this legislature was malapportioned (Voice Overlap) --
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2762.799,2762.931,"Yes, it have --"
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2762.931,2765.249,-- but not as a mere -- not an aggravation?
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2765.249,2766.007,"No, that's right."
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2766.385,2768.497,Have you abandoned that part of your complaint?
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2768.497,2774.166,"Well, the Court -- we have not filed a cross-appeal in the court below decided under count three which was straight Gray v. Sanders county unit --"
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2774.166,2777.745,Does that mean that you've abandon that part of your compliant?
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2781.253,2781.359,"Yes, sir."
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2781.359,2784.868,-- if we decided the other against it?
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2784.868,2792.152,"No, no, no sir, I think that that -- if you decide the other against us, either this Court or the court below on remand would have to decide that question."
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2792.152,2795.029,"Oh, do you -- you would say that that has to be decided."
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2801.612,2802.083,I had --
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2802.083,2803.823,That the legislature is malapportioned?
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2803.823,2805.338,"Yes, sir."
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2910.105,2916.226,What you would say Georgia was compelled to do if it has two elections?
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2922.562,2922.862,"Well, sir --"
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2922.862,2927.229,-- for the Federal Constitution?
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2927.229,2934.185,I do not know that it is compelled to continue to have elections after it had -- we're talking of a general election not of course the primary.
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2934.185,2935.444,Exactly.
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2935.444,2940.221,I should think that that -- I should think first of all and if I may take this a little backwards.
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2948.397,2951.915,"Well, I wanted to know is what do you say Georgia should do?"
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2964.015,2967.686,"Well, yes, sir I am."
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2967.686,2969.769,"Well, what would it have to do?"
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2969.769,2972.132,"Well, I think the State of Georgia would then have to have a special election."
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2976.726,2982.981,That's the holding in the Federal Constitution regarding Georgia to elect its Governor by the people.
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2982.981,2983.83,"No, I think Georgia is required by --"
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2983.83,2997.702,"Did -- do you find any sentence or words in Gray, in the Gray case indicating that its holding that Georgia is compelled to elect its Governors by the people?"
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2997.702,2999.189,"No, sir, but I find this."
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3007.896,3008.75,"Oh, certainly."
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3008.75,3008.866,And --
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3008.866,3012.96,But did they filter their vote in this election?
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3012.96,3013.395,They will up against --
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3013.395,3015.277,Get it filtered to get a majority?
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3015.277,3017.639,It will be filtered if they get to the General Assembly.
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3017.639,3020.676,You're saying it'll be filtered if they elect by the legislature.
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3020.676,3022.461,That's right.
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3035.02,3038.998,"Runoff general election, of course they don't get a majority here."
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3038.998,3040.445,"Well, then we've got a problem of course --"
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3040.445,3041.962,They'll have another?
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3041.962,3042.375,No.
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3059.892,3062.102,Suppose you didn't get a majority?
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3062.102,3064.79,"Well, I've -- I should think that the --"
1966.800,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3064.79,3066.191,"Then, you'd have to have another, wouldn't you?"
1966.800,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3066.191,3068.856,"Well, they'd get a majority between two men."
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,4816.049,4818.799,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.800,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4907.731,4909.667,How many do you have Mr. Bondurant?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,4909.667,4913.928,148 of the 159 counties have notified us.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4921.305,4924.816,And this -- and the notification is to what effect?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,4924.816,4928.483,The notification is that no candidate has received the majority.
1966.800,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4949.287,4956.399,"Well, what was it that the Attorney General mentioned earlier about to being some discrepancies in figures?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,4956.399,4972.946,The news election service as I understand it Justice Brennan computed returns through noon on Friday following the election on Tuesday and at the time when we were in the District Court this was the most current information which we then have.
1966.800,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4997.501,5003.712,But what you now have represent the final figures from these 158 counties together?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5003.712,5021.182,"As we understand it with the exception of 11 counties, these are according to the ordinaries, communicated by wired to us or by letter that which is shown by the certified copies which they maintained by law in their respective offices open to public inspection."
1966.800,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5042.842,5045.328,There are -- were there absentee ballots?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5045.328,5047.017,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.800,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5047.72,5047.746,(Inaudible)
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5047.746,5060.682,"The absentee ballots were necessarily excluded from the news selection service tabulation and were counted more slowly and therefore later, when their service terminated on noon on Friday after the election on Tuesday."
1966.800,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5068.139,5068.992,They are included?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5068.992,5070.061,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5300.548,5310.596,"That law may I ask you is not in effect, is it if the old provisions of the Constitution, State Constitution is constitutional?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5310.596,5311.587,That is correct Your Honor.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5312.805,5319.225,It's true what the law would be if this other law is unconstitutional?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5319.225,5337.091,The election code expresses what the General Assembly of Georgia attempted to provide in 1964 and which but for conflict with this archaic 1824 provision would be the situation prescribed by the elected representatives in Georgia for election by the people in 1966.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5337.091,5339.011,"There's nothing wrong with these ages, right?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5339.011,5342.001,Age itself is nothing -- is not wrong.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5342.001,5346.496,"It's been (Inaudible) the constitutional code, doesn't it?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5346.496,5350.524,Yet in many other things which were not constructional have been reincorporated.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5450.371,5454.43,It would divide as in -- indicates there's something wrong.
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5466.322,5472.109,I think it would be difficult to predict exactly what's its purpose was in 1824 Justice Black.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5490.371,5493.543,Do you think those are unrepresented?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5500.626,5501.649,"Yes, Your Honor, we are."
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5563.622,5574.461,"Well, the majority of states have a provision in their constitution, do they not that in case of a tie, selection shall be by the legislative body?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5574.461,5577.404,The overwhelming majority of states do Your Honor.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5646.881,5657.949,"Well, do you claim that they have that right under the Constitution of the United States to elect – to provide for the election of the Governor by the legislative body if it wants to?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5657.949,5677.117,"Your Honor, we feel again that this is a question which may not be reached in this litigation because whether or not the Constitution of the United States confers a right on every citizen of Georgia in the first instance to elect its Governor had Georgia chosen a prime minister system or some other system."
1966.800,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5717.256,5727.66,"That were the basic changed made in 1824, wasn't it, because under your Constitution of 1798 as I understand Georgia history, the legislature at that time chose the Governor?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5727.66,5729.43,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5753.383,5757.443,Do I understand that you are arguing (Inaudible) or for anything else.
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5773.568,5789.378,Our position is Your Honor that these provisions which I have been discussing demonstrate in the same sense that the county unit legislation and the county unit case demonstrated that the election in Georgia is on the basis of the people that the state has made a conscious choice.
1966.800,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5796.188,5809.635,"As I remember our cases in this field, Reynold, Sims, Lucas, Gray and Sanders, they dealt with on a statewide election by the people, is that right?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5809.635,5814.24,"Of course, Reynolds involved district elections in one sense."
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5842.564,5856.501,"If the Federal Constitution forbids the election of a Governor by anything but the people, how low down would that government offices, statewide offices in your judgment?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5856.501,5858.226,"Your Honor, I -- again, I suggest --"
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5858.226,5861.081,"What about (Voice Overlap) states, they'd audit?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5861.081,5881.863,"The Secretary of -- neither the Secretary of State nor the State Auditor nor the Attorney General nor many of the other period myriad of imperious state offices expressed the position, power, prestige and importance of the Chief Executive of the state who heads one of the major three branches of State Government."
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5881.863,5885.017,"Is this important, important for him as an officer?"
1966.800,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5897.737,5899.47,I suppose our question goes different.
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5909.944,5912.684,I would suggest that precisely the question and that answers the --
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5912.684,5915.309,I would suggest that its not the only question?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5926.602,5939.681,"If that were the question Your Honor, we would unhesitatingly take the position that the Federal Constitution would not permit us now to go back to monarchy or any other form of Government."
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5948.883,5962.959,"In order words, if the Constitution has changed and it is no longer that law of the Constitution if the states and the people of states have all the powers reserved to them except those that are expressly forbidden."
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5962.959,5982.74,"I would say that it is changed in the same sense that apportionment of legislatures has changed since 1790.In 1790, at the time of the final ratification of the Constitution over half of the 13 original colonies elected their Governor in a popular and or immediately thereafter even when the first constitution inducted after that time."
1966.800,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5982.74,5989.779,"But we have a more immediate question than that and that is what do you mean in -- all these cases by saying one person, one vote?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5989.779,5992.207,I agree completely Mr. Justice Douglas --
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5992.207,5996.555,"I suppose we meant one person, one vote in an election by the people?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5996.555,5996.74,And --
1966.800,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5996.74,5998.077,That's the question is then -- is this a part of the election?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,5998.077,6005.665,We suggest that we have precisely that an election by the people if the General Assembly is not involved at any other stage.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6019.212,6021.827,"But it hasn't gone back, it hasn't going back?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6025.992,6032.391,But Gray could not be evaded by that sort of device.This device works at the other end of the legislative process.
1966.800,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6032.391,6038.516,"Counsel, do you remember when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, was it after 1824?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6038.516,6040.253,It was considerably after 1824.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6087.78,6090.993,But wouldn't that be the right place to do it if he was in Georgia?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6090.993,6101.71,"Well, Your Honor I would suggest that the General Assembly has attempted to do precisely that and which would have occurred but for two – for two of the circumstances not now before the Court."
1966.800,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6124.452,6140.003,"So, you don't suggest counsel then that Georgia could not constitutionally have the election of a good Governor by the legislature without any popular votes?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6140.003,6142.63,I would suggest that's just simply not this case.
1966.800,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6152.649,6160.808,"Well, I know -- I personally don't think it's such an abstract question and irrelevant."
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6198.574,6201.598,We would feel of course that we don't have to reach the tie situation.
1966.800,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6201.598,6201.989,"I understand that, --"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6201.989,6202.847,The tie situation --
1966.800,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6202.847,6210.635,"I know you'd -- you wouldn't like to reach any of these questions and I take it, they're very relevant."
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6210.635,6217.834,We would say if compelled to reach it to justify our position if a tie situation would also be unconstitutional.
1966.800,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6238.31,6245.884,"In your runoff elections, if you won, what's your answer to all the people who -- write-in votes would be thrown away?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6248.946,6250.192,We are suggesting that they have --
1966.800,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6250.192,6256.004,You're just saying if they must vote for somebody they didn't want to vote for in the first place and don't want to vote for now.
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6260.202,6264.353,"Oh, I would suggest that this is in the nature of Republican Government."
1966.800,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6272.264,6274.162,Very good then.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6274.162,6277.785,What is Republican Government?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6277.785,6278.931,"Excuse me, Mr. Justice Black."
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6279.429,6283.226,What is a Republican Government?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6287.011,6287.43,I didn't realize that I --
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6287.43,6288.671,That was your idea.
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6288.671,6289.461,Alright.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6296.967,6300.21,But you referred to it as the -- to give you a Republican Government.
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6302.9,6304.563,I don't real -- I don't even recall that.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6336.968,6342.19,"In other words, the right of the people to elect their Governor, that's what makes it a Republican Government?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6342.19,6345.92,I would think that would certainly be indicative of that in our situation.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6349.963,6353.45,"Well, how many times would they have to hold separate elections?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6362.748,6362.924,Certainly --
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6362.924,6364.515,-- we have five or six elections --
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6364.515,6379.297,"Certainly, that's a reasonable accommodation of the right of the people to select their representatives in a reasonable sort of manner and the right of the state to get on with State Government and get an executive qualified within the time limits available."
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6396.768,6402.788,But why shouldn't you have if you got to accommodate everybody who's candidate -- people who wanted to vote for?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6402.788,6403.186,Not at all.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6429.933,6433.378,Even though it's in a tie and can't get it going?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6433.378,6435.123,Even though they try and cannot get the majority --
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6435.123,6445.179,"You say then it requires at least two shots, you've got to take shots for the – before they could – that the sort – select the Governor in some other manner?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6445.179,6448.207,I would say that it takes at most two shots.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6559.428,6562.54,"That's an equal protection question, one man, one vote."
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6562.54,6566.13,One man one vote where the state has selected the unit and we suggest that unit is the people.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6566.13,6571.367,"Whether to make this by a primary election, by election, a vote?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6571.367,6572.833,That's correct Your Honor.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6651.858,6654.748,"They lost them when they failed to get a majority, isn't it?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6654.748,6657.625,Are the people to be penalized because of this?
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6657.625,6659.121,Because they don't get a majority?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6659.121,6666.73,It's unconscionable to have the division in the electorate -- deprive the electorate of any right to choose all together.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6670.979,6676.021,What you are saying is its unconscionable not to elect the Governor?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6676.021,6676.69,If forced to that I would --
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6676.69,6692.868,"Suppose it is, if – does this Court had power to fasten its judgment on the people of Georgia to add to the Constitution a provision because they think its unconscionable not to elect the Governor, if they're going to hold this law in the constitution?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6692.868,6702.071,This Court need only say that it seems to us as it did in the county unit case that Georgia has placed this election on the basis of the people.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6859.829,6863.001,"There's nothing wrong with this age, is there?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6863.001,6867.575,I agree completely that not just age but the change policy.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6869.879,6872.883,It doesn't have the same constitution?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6872.883,6875.325,We don't have the same State Constitution Mr. Justice Black.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6875.325,6878.71,We've had the same federal concepts and you were here under federal laws.
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6878.71,6882.633,We do not have the Fourteenth Amendment since 1824.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6882.633,6882.891,(Inaudible)
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6882.891,6883.687,Did not had it --
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6883.687,6887.373,"That is since 1868 or whatever that is, the adoption."
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6887.373,6888.062,That's correct.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6895.057,6897.722,-- when they amended the Federal Constitution.
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6897.722,6897.927,That's right.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6897.927,6900.171,When the people amended and not this Court?
1966.800,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6900.195,6902.691,We have Baker versus Carr.
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6902.691,6903.289,That's right.
1966.800,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6905.003,6912.381,Baker versus Carr rely on the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution as between -- discrimination between individuals who are allowed to vote in an election.
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6912.381,6927.309,"Well, we suggest that there is -- that discrimination in this precise situation between citizens living in the Cobb County of Georgia and citizens living in Bulloch County and all the other counties of the state who are --"
1966.800,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6927.309,6936.026,"Mr. Bondurant, you have this provision I gather in the Constitution in 1870 as I understand it would be."
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,6943.418,6954.109,I would recognize that it was in the Constitution of 1868 which at the time of our readmission would have at least presumptively been reviewed by the Congress.
1966.800,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7008.712,7013.684,Mr. Bondurant maybe you could help me.
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,7032.545,7033.702,"Precisely, at the same session –"
1966.800,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7033.702,7034.326,Why?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,7034.326,7044.289,-- it was an extraordinary May-June session in the days of the malapportionment in the House before this Court's decision in Reynolds against Sims.
1966.800,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7085.589,7098.86,But it seems to us -- it seems to assume of course that it was necessary to change the constitutional provision in order to -- for them to be permitted to pass the runoff provisions.
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,7098.86,7113.611,"Having plenary power to propose amendments to the Constitution, I would suggest that the General Assembly chose to use that means rather the means which we have been forced to resort to in this litigation to delete the 1824 provision."
1966.800,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7113.611,7118.693,But until then there was no provision for a runoff for a Governor?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,7118.693,7119.838,That is correct.
1966.800,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7134.398,7142.292,"Mr. Bondurant, the three-judged court enjoined the submission on that new Constitution of the electorate, is it not?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,7142.292,7144.176,As an entire document.
1966.800,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7150.259,7154.441,But the whole new -- I'm a little vague about this but didn't that issue come here?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,7154.441,7162.287,"The issue came here and this Court declined to advance hearing before the November 8, 1964 general election."
1966.800,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7200.303,7206.675,"Well, we had taken -- if we advance that case, maybe you wouldn't be here today, isn't it?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,7206.675,7221.655,"Ironically, that it happens to be the result that the General Assembly far more malapportioned than today has recognized more fully than perhaps others that the people should make this choice."
1966.800,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7228.152,7238.324,"But that -- what would you – do you suppose the legislature would be discharging its powers under the Constitution or its authority of it – itself, all the runoff election?"
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,7238.324,7250.875,"If this provision is not eliminated Mr. Justice White, the legislature would not have the power to do so since an amendment could only be submitted at a two-year general election under state law."
1966.800,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7293.461,7308.31,Did you come across any explanation as to why 1824 amendment says that the General Assembly has to elect the Governor viva voce?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,7308.31,7308.848,"No, I haven't --"
1966.800,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7308.848,7314.365,If there's any particular reason to become -- as justifying that?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,7314.365,7325.62,"Frankly, I know of no explanation other than that seems to have been common in similar provisions of other State Constitutions which most of which provided for tie vote situations which never arose."
1966.800,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7411.294,7420.384,(Inaudible) that plan were the purposes of election of the 1966 collegium?
1966.800,2,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,7420.384,7431.607,I would say that the significance to that fact is that this Court under the circumstances which it then foresaw in recognizing its retained powers as the court of equity and that of the District Court.
1966.800,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7509.191,7510.929,Mr. Hill.
