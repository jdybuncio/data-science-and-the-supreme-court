1980.80-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.045,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in Metromedia, Incorporated v. City of San Diego."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,10.341,16.103,"Mr Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,64.896,69.91,"Would it make any difference, Mr. Abrams, if this were a town of 10,000?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,69.91,92.401,"It would make a difference only in this sense, Mr. Chief Justice, we do think that it is relevant that this is a case which arises entirely out of a ban which takes place in an industrial and commercial area, in part because we are met with the argument by our opponents that outdoor advertising is in its entirety commercial speech, which it is not."
1980.80-195,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,131.494,143.911,"Mr. Abrams, I gather that you concede, at least implicitly, that outdoor advertising could constitutionally be banned in a residential area?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,143.911,157.062,"We do concede, Mr. Justice Stewart, that it could be banned in certain residential areas, particularly, for example, a residential area as part of a larger community where it is allowed elsewhere; yes."
1980.80-195,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,157.062,162.951,Some communities are zoned entirely residential?
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,162.951,163.951,"Yes, and--"
1980.80-195,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,163.951,167.449,"Some governmental entities are, almost?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,167.449,177.335,"--All I'm saying is that we think it does depend, as a number of the cases of this Court in other areas have indicated, upon the relationship between one area and another."
1980.80-195,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,183.129,189.221,"Some governmental entities are so-called bedroom communities, under the law entirely residential."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,189.221,192.578,"Yes, and that does not raise in the same acute fashion the issue--"
1980.80-195,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,192.578,197.031,So the size and characteristics of San Diego are relevant?
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,197.031,197.64,"--Yes, sir."
1980.80-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,197.64,211.462,"Would that mean that in an area that was mixed, that is, residences and stores and theaters and the usual mix, you'd have a different rule?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,211.462,216.178,We think the rule of law that we would urge on you today would be the same.
1980.80-195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,319.138,332.756,"But it's a medium of communication that is made a medium of communication only by the fact that the city has put in roads which lead past the billboard, is it not?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,333.85,338.316,"It would not exist, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if there were no roads."
1980.80-195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,338.316,343.846,"--Well, you wouldn't have a big billboard 50 miles out in the desert where no one could see it."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,343.846,346.22,That's correct.
1980.80-195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,371.413,377.488,But a billboard wouldn't be constructed before the road was there.
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,377.488,379.956,That's correct.
1980.80-195,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,379.956,381.409,A sound truck wouldn't either.
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,381.409,382.908,A sound truck wouldn't be there.
1980.80-195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,415.113,425.328,"Mr. Abrams, does your approach suggest that the analysis is time, place, and manner, rather than content?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,426.906,436.153,"We would urge on you, as strenuously as we can, Mr. Justice Brennan, that no less than a compelling state interest test ought to be applied."
1980.80-195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,440.276,442.916,"Whether as commercial advertising, ideological or whatever?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,442.916,457.628,"--That the medium itself can't be destroyed unless you meet something in the order of a compelling state interest test and a statute drafted as the compelling state interest test requires, of the narrowest possible nature to serve the interest."
1980.80-195,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,457.628,468.951,"Well, now, Mr. Abrams, zoning ordinances and zoning laws typically if not universally ban outdoor advertising from residential areas throughout the country."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,473.763,475.402,"That's correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.80-195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,475.402,488.584,Is it also true that the First Amendment issue would be the same if there had been no history of outdoor advertising in San Diego but that you wanted to enter the market for the first time?
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,488.584,491.864,"It would in the main be the same, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.80-195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,575.361,578.437,I'm not familiar with that part of the stipulation.
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,581.156,586.279,"Well, stipulation 28 entered into by the parties--"
1980.80-195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,586.279,589.887,Where can we find that?
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,589.887,595.448,--It's at page 125a and 126a of the jurisdictional statement.
1980.80-195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,649.394,655.406,I suppose that's really just another way of saying there's a market for outdoor advertising?
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,658.671,663.138,"Well, I think the parties, Mr. Justice Stevens, really would have said ""some"" if they had meant ""some""."
1980.80-195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,664.559,665.559,"Well, ""many""."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,665.559,668.137,"--The dictionary definition of ""many"" is ""large""--"
1980.80-195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,668.137,668.84,Over 20?
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,668.84,671.292,"--Oh, no, no, not over 20."
1980.80-195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,674.025,680.819,"However, the number of people who use outdoor advertising probably is related to the number of signs you have up, because they're all being sold and used."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,686.66,687.55,--That's true.
1980.80-195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,714.132,719.21,"Mr. Abrams, along with my brother Stevens I have trouble with the word ""many""."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,719.21,722.584,"Well, the dictionary definition, Mr. Justice Marshall, is ""large""."
1980.80-195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,728.721,740.732,"Well, I mean, without precedent, our opinion would have to say that the precedent is that in the case where ""many businesses"" et cetera et cetera, that this would be invalid."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,740.732,740.872,--No.
1980.80-195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,760.662,768.627,"But it doesn't say that they're... this does not say that they are insufficient, it says many people think it is insufficient."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,772.001,781.185,"--Well, it says, many people of a variety of sorts rely upon it because other means are insufficient, inappropriate, and prohibitively expensive."
1980.80-195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,781.185,782.855,"Well, it doesn't say it's true or not."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,782.855,783.105,I'm sorry?
1980.80-195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,783.105,787.526,"It doesn't say it's a fact or not, it just says, many people think it's a fact."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,787.526,816.201,"Well, if I can go back to the Linmark case, for example, which Your Honor wrote a few years ago, in the context of dealing with signs on lawns, the Court indicated that it was by no means clear that other means of communication would serve, even though that was a situation in which ads could be put in the newspaper and that there were other ways to communicate."
1980.80-195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,842.676,845.408,One more question and then I'm true.
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,847.673,850.625,"--There was no testimony, Your Honor, because this case came up--"
1980.80-195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,850.625,851.188,That's right.
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,857.295,862.981,--That is the record on this subject.
1980.80-195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,862.981,863.293,That's what I'm saying.
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,863.293,871.322,"There are briefs which lend support to that record, but the record as such, on that point, is the stipulation."
1980.80-195,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,871.916,878.492,"Mr. Abrams, is the joint stipulation of facts in the joint appendix the same stipulation?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,878.492,879.523,"--Yes, sir."
1980.80-195,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,879.523,888.535,"I'd prefer to use it because the one in the jurisdictional statement has an amazing word ""prohibitilly"" in there."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,888.535,892.534,"Yes, that was a typographical error that should be corrected."
1980.80-195,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,892.534,898.063,"It's corrected in the other one and I think the Joint Stipulation probably is the preferred one to use, the one in the Joint Appendix."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,898.063,909.761,"Yes... I must tell you, though, Mr. Justice Blackmun, that the typographical error was in the stipulation and we corrected it, as it were."
1980.80-195,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,909.761,911.464,"You were not a party to it, anyway."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,911.464,914.791,"No, sir, and I don't think anyone's to blame for it."
1980.80-195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,918.289,936.58,"Mr. Abrams, supposing that the City of San Diego, instead of barring outside advertising, had barred dirigibles from coming below a 500-foot level over the city limits, which carried signs similar to billboard signs?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,938.033,941.092,"I hope not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.80-195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,968.956,971.97,"Well, we all know that Goodyear or Goodrich, I forget which it is, blimp."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,971.97,997.867,"No, I think that, you know, one is entitled... I would like to put it this way, that the response that I would give to the question of, how can you tell if something is a medium of communication, because I think that's what we're really addressing now, is well put by Mr. Justice Black in the Martin v. Struthers case when he dealt with door-to-door solicitation."
1980.80-195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1023.872,1027.542,"It could be with respect to small airplanes carrying signs in Miami, though."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1030.197,1035.289,"--That, too... I mean, the fact that these things happen, and they do, they are really not--"
1980.80-195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1035.289,1040.536,"And they're a regular, customary method of advertising, frequently used, and some people regard them as rather an unpleasant sight."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1040.536,1049.658,"--But if airplanes went about dropping leaflets, say, I don't think one would call that a medium of communication, even though leaflets are."
1980.80-195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1069.993,1077.335,But you've acknowledged that a residential community which may be growing could start out with no billboard advertising.
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1092.797,1106.042,"I responded earlier to Justice Stewart by saying that we do not quarrel with the constitutionality, per se, at least, of zoning regulations which ban outdoor advertising in residential areas."
1980.80-195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1173.468,1178.216,Do you accept the validity of both the Saia and the Kovacs decisions?
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1178.216,1181.4,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.80-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1181.4,1186.539,"Mr. Abrams, may I add one more easy hypothetical?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1212.435,1219.338,"It would depend, Mr. Justice Powell, it seems to me, on where it is."
1980.80-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1247.701,1252.309,What about Pennsylvania Avenue?
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1252.309,1254.965,"Pennsylvania Avenue, alone?"
1980.80-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1257.072,1259.166,"That area; that area, downtown Washington."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1259.166,1259.479,--Yes.
1980.80-195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1298.962,1317.548,"To the extent you're admitting that there may be situations where such bans might be constitutional, at least presenting no First Amendment difficulties, is this because in those situations you think your test for compelling state interest could be satisfied?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1333.557,1335.198,We believe that compelling state interest--
1980.80-195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1335.198,1336.634,"Well, now, wait a minute."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1342.226,1350.379,"--I must say, Mr. Justice Brennan, I was premising my answer on the possibility that an even lesser standard could be applied."
1980.80-195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1350.379,1358.109,"Well, I thought, as time, place, and manner ordinarily does apply a significant state interest standard rather than compelling, doesn't it?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1358.109,1363.998,"If I may, I'd like to do a time, place, and manner analysis for you."
1980.80-195,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1432.58,1436.657,"But it can hardly be said that it's a time, place, and manner regulation, if it's a total prohibition."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1436.657,1438.765,"Well, our view is that it is not."
1980.80-195,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1451.933,1452.277,It's self-contradictory.
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1452.277,1485.232,"Now, it happens in this case that we believe, for reasons I've indicated earlier, that even if we had to show you the absence of alternative channels of communication, that the stipulation of the parties goes a long way, and that for reasons stated in our brief the statute is underinclusive in other ways, and so we think it can't be shown by them, as they must show, even in the time, place, and manner test, it can't be shown by the City of San Diego that it is in fact content neutral, because of what it leaves untouched."
1980.80-195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1485.232,1497.149,"Mr. Abrams, in your answer to Justice Powell's question a moment ago, you said that if it were federal land here in the District involved, it perhaps could be sustained."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1511.098,1512.393,Absolutely not.
1980.80-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1560.453,1569.091,"How can you justify a ban on billboards across the street from the Supreme Court, as you suggested?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1569.091,1573.825,"I can justify that as a time, place, and manner limitation."
1980.80-195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1594.049,1605.498,"Well, if Washington had been limited to the governmental buildings and the park and historic areas and residential areas and there had been no manufacturing area, could there be a total ban in the city of Washington?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1605.498,1613.434,"Mr. Justice Stevens, I don't think there could be a total ban, but I would have to concede that the balance would be a different kind of balance."
1980.80-195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1613.434,1617.212,"How about the city of Williamsburg, Virginia, historic restoration?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1618.54,1627.647,"I would give the same answer, that a different balance would have to be struck based on the nature of the community and the activities which occur."
1980.80-195,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1627.647,1634.611,"But your basic answer, Mr. Abrams, I think is that it would depend upon what you produced by the evidence in such a case."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1634.611,1639.968,"Yes, in each of these cases there would necessarily be a different factual record."
1980.80-195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1639.968,1642.904,"What you're really saying, I think, is a constitutional right to have billboards if you have factories."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1642.904,1646.091,"No, I'm not saying, if you have factories."
1980.80-195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.107,1653.792,"Well, what other than factories, what kind of community that does not have any manufacturing district in it could not ban billboards?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1668.161,1680.437,"--Well, what I'm saying is that the easiest case for determination is one in which there is a manufacturing area, and that that, in and of itself, ought to at least presumptively lead you to say that you can't have a total ban."
1980.80-195,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1682.264,1686.419,Because esthetic considerations of the governmental entity are minimal within such an area.
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1686.419,1687.543,--Yes; absolutely.
1980.80-195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1726.543,1743.428,"But, Mr. Abrams, if in the Williamsburg case, to the extent you say that the ban does not offend the First Amendment, it has to be because esthetics around Williamsburg might be said to be a compelling state interest?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1743.428,1745.099,One of the--
1980.80-195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1745.099,1745.63,Is that the reason?
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1745.63,1749.582,"--The reason in part, about Williamsburg."
1980.80-195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1756.499,1759.67,I'm trying to get to the First Amendment analysis that you're submitting to us.
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1759.67,1759.983,Yes.
1980.80-195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1759.983,1774.29,"If you concede that that might be, at least, I think you've said, a constitutional, notwithstanding, a First Amendment attack, on your submission isn't this because the state interest there is compelling, in esthetics?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1774.29,1789.237,"On my submission, what I am conceding arguendo is that a sufficient showing of esthetic claim could conceivably be made and proved by the state, which has the burden of proving it."
1980.80-195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1789.237,1790.159,Of proving what?
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1791.532,1794.687,Of proving even by compelling state interest test.
1980.80-195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1794.687,1796.983,What is a compelling state interest?
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1796.983,1804.277,"Well, it is something more than a significant state interest."
1980.80-195,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1824.191,1835.592,"Let me... this test, this so-called test, I'm sure, is meaningful to many members of the Court and maybe to every member of the Court except one, but to at least one it is no test whatsoever."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1864.471,1879.668,"--Notwithstanding that radio and television is a regulated industry and that Congress has a significant amount of power with respect to it, I believe it would raise very grave constitutional problems."
1980.80-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1879.668,1881.793,But they've banned some kinds of advertising?
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1881.793,1899.255,"They have indeed, Mr. Chief Justice, but to have a total ban would in effect preclude radio and television from covering the news, because they wouldn't be able to do it, from doing other things which on anyone's theory in this room would be First Amendment-protected."
1980.80-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1900.004,1902.909,"Well, in some countries they do it without advertising."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1902.909,1905.113,--In some countries they do it without advertising.
1980.80-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.509,1947.313,"Mr. Abrams, suppose the ordinance permitted signs carrying noncommercial advertising, but forbade commercial advertising in this commercial zone?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1953.373,1954.857,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1954.857,1959.635,But other ordinances keep it out of the city entirely?
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1959.635,1960.651,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1960.651,1962.65,"Now, how about my first question?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1962.65,1971.803,We think it would violate the First Amendment if the statute contained a flat ban on all of commercial speech.
1980.80-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1973.958,1977.879,"No, I mean, billboard advertising, commercial billboard--"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1977.879,1978.129,"--Yes, sir."
1980.80-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1978.41,1981.972,"--The same argument as you've been making, with respect to that?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1981.972,2007.414,"Yes, I would think that the same argument I would be making, I would perhaps emphasize a little more, that even if you were to apply the commercial speech cases of this Court, and even if you were to assume that there was nothing more to protect here than that which this Court has said must be protected in the area of commercial speech, that this statute cannot meet a test which says that it's no more extensive than necessary."
1980.80-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2007.414,2010.974,"But that isn't the compelling interest test, is it?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,2010.974,2023.017,"No, I'm saying that even if you apply a much lower level test, even if you apply a pure commercial speech test, that a statute which is a flat ban on all commercial billboard speech within a commercial area--"
1980.80-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.017,2026.735,So your facial attack on this ordinance is really an overbreadth attack?
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,2026.735,2030.749,--That that is one of the devices of this statute.
1980.80-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2030.749,2042.587,"To the extent that you're invoking the compelling state interest, you're really arguing that the ordinance is invalid because it bans noncommercial billboard?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,2042.587,2055.488,"No, sir, I'm saying that it is, that the reason we urge upon you a compelling state interest test or a test of that order of magnitude is because of the flatness of the ban here."
1980.80-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2055.488,2062.063,"Well, and because it's... but if it only banned commercial speech, you wouldn't invoke the compelling state interest?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,2062.063,2067.5,If it only banned commercial speech I would urge upon you a test which is of less protection--
1980.80-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.5,2077.776,"Well, I know, but the only reason then that you're urging on us the compelling state interest test is because it is a flat ban and includes noncommercial billboarding things."
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,2077.776,2078.87,"--But, what I'm saying--"
1980.80-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.87,2079.323,Is that right or not?
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,2079.323,2092.488,--It is correct that the advocacy of the compelling state interest test arises out of the totality of the ban which includes ideological and commercial speech.
1980.80-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2092.488,2111.231,"Well, why... well, in that event, why wouldn't we have to divide the case up into whether the ordinance is valid with respect to commercial speech and valid in... and the test would be the noncommercial speech?"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,2111.231,2121.649,"Well, let me say, first of all because we have agreement of the parties here that if commercial speech is not allowed there can be no so-called ideological speech on outdoor advertising."
1980.80-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2126.6,2129.224,"Well, I know, but you can't stipulate us in--"
1980.80-195,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,2129.224,2138.861,"--I'm not saying that you are bound by that, I'm saying that it is certainly relevant in your consideration of the effects of a total ban."
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2371.283,2380.139,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.80-195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2464.182,2467.883,Do you think that amendment strengthens or hurts your case?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2467.883,2478.427,"It strengthens the case, Your Honor, because without it it would mean, it would ban political campaign signs."
1980.80-195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2570.185,2570.951,Is that sufficient?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2570.951,2572.17,"Yes, Your Honor?"
1980.80-195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2572.17,2574.918,Is the fact that it's commercial sufficient for you to win?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2574.918,2577.605,Is the fact that it's commercial sufficient?
1980.80-195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2580.479,2582.681,"Is it sufficient, was my question."
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2582.681,2592.473,--I think that in view of some of the past decisions of this Court the fact that it's commercial is sufficient.
1980.80-195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2592.473,2594.91,"Mr. Sumption, let me get back to your amendments."
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2612.856,2616.136,"Well, there are several reasons, I think, behind that."
1980.80-195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2637.33,2638.329,I take it that this one on
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2646.607,2654.23,"--The copy itself may be somewhat temporary, but the sign is there long after the message is gone."
1980.80-195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2654.23,2661.961,Wasn't there a campaign on for an increase in the salary of city employees?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2661.961,2662.851,I believe that's correct.
1980.80-195,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2663.68,2680.609,"But if they succeed in getting their raise, presumably the owner of the billboard will just find another customer to put another message on?"
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2680.609,2685.326,That's also my understanding of the way they operate their business.
1980.80-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2706.74,2715.577,"Mr. Sumption, I'm not entirely clear on the amendment to the ordinance after the stipulation, does that allow the permanent billboards to be used for these political ads?"
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2716.033,2723.795,"Well, the actual language of the exception simply says they're not prohibited by the ordinance, so it's permanent."
1980.80-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2723.795,2727.168,"I mean, can they use the permanent billboard structures on these temporary political?"
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2727.168,2729.698,The ordinance is silent on the intent.
1980.80-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2729.698,2731.073,But what are you telling us here?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2741.397,2754.361,"I think that the logical intent would be that political campaign signs should be something less than on permanent structures, of the structures remaining, because of the esthetic justifications and rationale of the ordinance."
1980.80-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2754.361,2758.952,So this amendment will not change the need to tear down all the permanent structures?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2758.952,2759.999,That would be correct.
1980.80-195,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2761.468,2765.966,"Where do we find the amendment, in the papers we have?"
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2765.966,2769.401,It's in the version of the ordinance that is--
1980.80-195,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2769.401,2771.62,On page 106a?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2771.62,2778.68,"--It begins at page 104a in the Appendix to the jurisdictional statement, Your Honor."
1980.80-195,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2792.127,2796.563,And when was that added?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2796.563,2805.122,"That was added, Your Honor, while the case was pending before the California Supreme Court, before they heard oral argument the first time on the case."
1980.80-195,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2805.122,2807.292,So that is before us?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2807.292,2809.354,"Yes, it certainly is, Your Honor."
1980.80-195,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2811.572,2814.462,"112a, I think you said?"
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2814.462,2815.32,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-195,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2827.941,2839.17,"The history of this case was that it was... I know, in the California Supreme Court, there was but one dissenter."
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2844.527,2849.245,"As it came up, all the way up, or from the California Supreme Court level?"
1980.80-195,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2849.245,2851.4,"No, as it came up through the California court system?"
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2851.4,2857.288,"As it came up, the trial court issued summary judgment on cross-motions for summary judgment."
1980.80-195,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2874.672,2878.982,That court's judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of California--
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2878.982,2880.981,--That court's judgment was reversed by the California--
1980.80-195,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2880.981,2881.356,--In which Justice Clark dissented.
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2881.356,2887.791,"--Yes, Your Honor, and the California Supreme Court did grant a rehearing on the case, and it was argued a second time before the California Supreme Court."
1980.80-195,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2978.551,2981.488,Does Houston have outdoor advertising in some areas?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2981.488,2983.393,"--I'm not certain, Your Honor, if they do."
1980.80-195,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2985.237,2986.251,Last time I was there they did.
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2989.641,3013.162,"The other thing about allowing billboards in commercial zones but not in others is, it seems to me that the esthetic justification of the ordinance should apply equally in commercial areas because municipalities including San Diego are recognizing perhaps their past mistakes in allowing commercial areas to be eyesores and trying to improve those areas."
1980.80-195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3018.613,3022.096,Is San Diego's only justification here the esthetic one?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3022.096,3036.449,It's esthetics and traffic safety and along the esthetic lines it is also to the extent that esthetics have an economic or a monetary value by encouraging tourists to come.
1980.80-195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3051.63,3053.271,But that's in the content of esthetics?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3053.271,3054.676,--It's all tied into esthetics.
1980.80-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3054.676,3067.203,"Before this argument, Mr. Sumption, was there any limitation on kinetic signs, the kind that have something moving to attract the eye?"
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3067.203,3079.729,San Diego has attempted to broach the subject of regulating signs by dividing them into off-premise or off-site and on-site.
1980.80-195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3088.054,3094.63,"So, what about signs... there's an exception here, among one of these, about signs for news?"
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3094.63,3101.142,"Yes, and that is specifically, defined, those public message, or public service--"
1980.80-195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3101.142,3102.376,You mean it isn't a moving--
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3102.376,3103.548,--No.
1980.80-195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3103.548,3106.843,--It isn't a moving sign that has spot news on it?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3106.843,3107.172,No.
1980.80-195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.824,3116.012,"Well, what kind of news goes on those signs?"
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3116.012,3127.787,"--What they're talking about is if it comes on and shows a time or temperature or a word message, but it cannot appear to move, and it cannot have flashing lights."
1980.80-195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3127.787,3128.365,Oh.
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3131.02,3136.316,"It can change, and I think there is some time period so that it isn't just constantly coming on and coming off."
1980.80-195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3139.673,3148.108,"Now, is San Diego submitting that its esthetic justification is a compelling state interest or something less?"
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3148.108,3151.013,"Well, Your Honor, again I think we get into semantics."
1980.80-195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3173.097,3174.301,Significant?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3174.301,3175.191,Significant.
1980.80-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3185.936,3192.059,One writer has suggested that the compelling state interest as a test is a test that a state can't pass.
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3192.059,3196.01,I'm sorry.
1980.80-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3198.9,3206.63,I was just picking up what Justice Stewart and Justice Rehnquist had mentioned about this semantical problem that you mentioned.
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3206.63,3206.974,"Yes, and I think--"
1980.80-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3206.974,3209.833,The test is one that simply can't be met.
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3209.833,3212.472,"--Yes, I think it's very difficult."
1980.80-195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3212.472,3219.328,"Since the ban is a total one, I gather you're not defending this as a time, place, and manner justification?"

1980.80-195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3222.062,3222.639,"Oh, I see."
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3223.342,3225.217,--And that's where we get into the other semantical--
1980.80-195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3225.217,3228.731,"But it says, no time, no place, in no manner, doesn't it?"
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3228.731,3241.258,"--First of all, Mr. Justice Marshall, what we're talking about is signs, more specifically off-site signs."
1980.80-195,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3283.038,3302.685,"Well, large parts of the entire state of Vermont are regulated in such a manner that there may be no billboards whatever except a sign white on black, two feet high and three feet wide, and on site."
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3309.965,3318.586,"That's the kind of semantical problem, I think, that we get into when we start putting these in categories like ""total prohibition"", ""total ban""."
1980.80-195,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3400.802,3404.644,"And the claim could be made that it's a total ban of any billboard in that 1,000-foot stretch?"
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3404.644,3405.783,--That's correct.
1980.80-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3428.181,3445.05,"Yes, but I suppose, as Mr. Abrams pointed out, that magazines and newspapers sometimes create environmental problems, an awful lot of garbage is created, and litter, and trucks driving at night, waking people up, throwing to the newsboys, and all the rest."
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3454.796,3460.387,"Well, but the distinction between that category of case is that the problem can really be dealt with."
1980.80-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3486.44,3493.358,"Well, I suppose you could regulate the size of structures, size and shape of structures, as you do with buildings, and say, ""no structure"", you know."
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3504.322,3507.728,I think you're right and I think different people could differ on that type of thing.
1980.80-195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3539.355,3541.619,--Could Los Angeles ban all billboards?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3541.619,3544.478,--Does Los Angeles ban billboards?
1980.80-195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3544.478,3546.259,"Could they, under your argument?"
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3546.259,3546.681,Could they?
1980.80-195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3547.476,3548.757,Any city could?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3548.757,3549.211,Yes.
1980.80-195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3578.871,3581.604,"Well, why don't you ban women walking down the street?"
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3581.604,3588.946,"Well, there are certain things that obviously, you know, we just can't get rid of women."
1980.80-195,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3655.279,3668.381,"Well, the arguments are that the First Amendment protects their freedom to do exactly as they wish in this regard in the commercial and industrial areas, at least, of San Diego."
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3674.192,3677.581,"--To that extent, I think they're incorrect."
1980.80-195,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3678.113,3678.628,I know you do.
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3678.628,3680.112,--The First Amendment does compel that.
1980.80-195,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3680.112,3682.206,At least it's that argument.
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3682.206,3682.969,Yes.
1980.80-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3733.887,3743.711,"Mr. Sumption, does San Diego allow advertising in... do you have buses or street cars?"
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3744.461,3748.006,We have buses and we are soon to have a street car system in San Diego.
1980.80-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3748.006,3750.084,Is there going to be advertising in?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3750.084,3762.142,"There is advertising, and that's on buses, and the signs... specifically exempts that category of off-site advertising as well as on taxicabs and other vehicles."
1980.80-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3762.142,3765.297,What about in your ballpark or your football stadium?
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3765.297,3772.184,There has been... that's been a matter of controversy.
1980.80-195,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3794.939,3799.532,"Of course, in that area there would be no traffic safety arguments, I would assume?"
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3799.532,3800.064,That's correct.
1980.80-195,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3848.574,3855.885,"Before you sit down, Mr. Sumption, I for one would like to congratulate you for getting through an entire argument without using the word analysis."
1980.80-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3855.885,3863.084,And we would add to that your yielding some of the Court's time back to us.
1980.80-195,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3863.084,3864.599,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1980.80-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3864.599,3865.286,"Thank you, gentlemen."
