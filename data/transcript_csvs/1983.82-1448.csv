1983.82-1448,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,65.192,"Mr. Claiborne, I think you may proceed when you're ready."
1983.82-1448,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,65.192,68.644,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1448,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,1940.488,1945.123,Thank you.
1983.82-1448,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1972.606,1975.142,"Would you raise your voice a little, Mr. Lettow."
1983.82-1448,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,1975.142,1976.325,Yes.
1983.82-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2213.562,2214.812,Would you say that would last forever?
1983.82-1448,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2214.812,2215.362,No.
1983.82-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2226.453,2241.23,"Well, but what about the circumstance, what if in litigating with other parties the EPA established the controlling law in this Court that was contrary to the decision you want?"
1983.82-1448,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2241.23,2253.972,"I think both under the ruling in Moser, which has already been discussed, and Montana, which explained Moser, we would not be able any longer to assert collateral estoppel against the Government."
1983.82-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2253.972,2258.174,"Until the controlling law was changed, though, you think--"
1983.82-1448,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2258.174,2259.258,That's correct.
1983.82-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2259.258,2261.793,--that during that time you should be entitled to your judgment?
1983.82-1448,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2261.793,2270.582,"That's correct, as long as there is nothing in the factual circumstances that arise in the successive case that would change how the rule of law arises."
1983.82-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2277.755,2287.027,"Well, it might be the same question of law, but if the controlling law has changed you just shouldn't be entitled any longer to rely on that Court of Appeals opinion."
1983.82-1448,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2287.027,2287.943,"No, we would agree."
1983.82-1448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.524,2319.249,"What if the Sixth Circuit in this case had thought you were wrong on the merits, but nevertheless affirmed on estoppel grounds, so that we wouldn't really be changing the law then?"
1983.82-1448,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2319.249,2325.485,"Well, in that particular instance I don't think the Sixth Circuit would have said anything at all about the merits."
1983.82-1448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.156,2339.578,"Well, they might have had a panel decision that went off on the merits and then heard the case en banc and decided en banc that estoppel applies."
1983.82-1448,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2339.578,2344.547,"Well, again, I don't think it would have done that in this case, in Stauffer II."
1983.82-1448,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.443,2370.947,You say that the EPA is not entitled to try to change the controlling law by litigating with you.
1983.82-1448,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2370.947,2372.03,That's correct.
1983.82-1448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2377.367,2380.485,But let's follow up on your Ninth Circuit.
1983.82-1448,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2389.425,2391.958,"Well, but if you decided--"
1983.82-1448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2391.958,2395.845,Would you nevertheless agree you would not be able to plead collateral estoppel?
1983.82-1448,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2395.845,2396.362,--I agree.
