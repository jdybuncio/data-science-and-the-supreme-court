1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,60.975,We'll hear arguments next in Jackson against Virginia.
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,63.946,64.992,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,173.112,179.707,"Now, how did this district judge come to be addressing this subject?"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,179.707,187.01,Mr. Jackson alleged in his petition that his evidence -- that his conviction was not supported by evidence of premeditation.
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,187.01,192.777,It wasn't -- this wasn't the first time the case had been before a court.
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,195.003,197.047,"No, it is initiated in the Circuit Court of Chesterfield County, Virginia."
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,197.047,199.211,Yes.
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,199.211,203.151,He then an unsuccessfully appeal in the case of Virginia Supreme Court.
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,203.151,205.59,What was the federal court doing with it?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,209.126,211.934,He was alleging a deprivation of rights.
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,211.934,217.401,"Well, by what kind of a procedure was he in federal court?"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,217.401,219.673,He filed petition for writ of habeas corpus.
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,219.673,221.128,For a writ of habeas corpus.
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,221.128,221.537,Right.
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,221.537,222.755,Yes.
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,222.755,223.042,And in the petition --
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,223.042,227.124,I have the impression from your earlier remarks that the case was being tried by a federal court.
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,227.124,229.01,"No, no."
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,229.529,230.997,"There's federal difference, isn't there?"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,230.997,232.602,"Yes, yes there is Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,322.574,325.608,Do you think that's the situation here on this record?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,325.608,326.686,"Yes, I do Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,330.018,333.17,I take it you will expand on that in due course on your comment?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,333.17,334.455,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,334.455,337.978,Could you find him guilty of manslaughter?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,337.978,340.838,I think it's possible that they could've found him guilty of manslaughter.
1978.78-5283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,340.838,343.803,But doesn't that take it out from under Thompson?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,343.803,344.769,Excuse me?
1978.78-5283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,344.769,348.688,"Thompson, they said, you couldn't debate him under anything."
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,348.688,350.675,I think the --
1978.78-5283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,350.675,352.901,This was a question of degree.
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,352.901,355.733,Certainly it is a question of degree.
1978.78-5283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,357.308,360.282,They have no difference in Thompson and Louisville.
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,360.282,375.36,"Well I think the holdings of this Court after Thompson in at least four years after about 1974, indicated that there has to be some evidence of every element of the offense."
1978.78-5283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,377.843,381.785,Well do you think -- do you think he should go free?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,381.785,383.93,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,420.648,424.748,They renewed Thompson v. Louisville to do that.
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,424.748,427.001,To send it back to the state courts?
1978.78-5283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,427.001,428.389,For re-sentence?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,428.389,429.205,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,429.205,431.132,"You're relying on the Winship case, is that it?"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,431.132,431.938,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,431.938,446.775,"And the question, I suppose, is whether the Winship case is a constitutional matter beyond -- requires that there be proof beyond the reasonable doubt in order to supply --"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,446.775,446.963,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,446.963,455.132,"-- a conviction that is for in a state court, or only that the jury be instructed that they must find guilt beyond the reasonable doubt."
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,456.5,457.237,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,457.606,462.025,"If the jury was so instructed in this case, wasn't it?"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,462.025,462.364,"Yes, well --"
1978.78-5283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,462.364,465.365,"And maybe, arguably that's all that Winship requires."
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,465.365,468.111,"Well, Your Honor first of all, there was not a jury in this case."
1978.78-5283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,469.037,470.554,Well then the -- presumably that the --
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,470.554,470.644,Certainly.
1978.78-5283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,470.644,472.331,-- trier of fact followed that state --
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,472.331,485.022,"Your Honor, it's our contention that In re Winship, which held the due process clause as a Fourteenth Amendment requires that there be proof beyond the reasonable doubt."
1978.78-5283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,498.948,513.486,"Mrs. Colville, the facts of Winship, were that the trial judge stated that he could find these particular defendant's guilty by a preponderance of the evidence, but he couldn't bring himself to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt."
1978.78-5283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,513.486,514.205,That's right.
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,514.205,516.634,"Certainly, yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,554.05,559.838,How do you define -- where do you get your definition of beyond a reasonable doubt from?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,559.838,571.212,"From In re Winship, which held that the Due Process Clause requires this in a criminal setting that there must be -- that you could not convict a person unless there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt."
1978.78-5283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,571.212,585.513,"I realize that, but I presume that if your argument were accepted by this Court, other courts would have to decide was there or was there not proof “beyond a reasonable doubt.”"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,590.567,592.757,"Your Honor, that's not an easy question."
1978.78-5283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,592.965,595.488,"No, it isn't."
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,595.488,599.628,-- that in -- that it has been a standard.
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,605.662,608.534,"For some time, it was accepted before the Constitution was developed, wasn't it?"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,608.534,609.512,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,633.459,646.5,But you are not prepared at least now to expand on simply the phrase “beyond a reasonable doubt” in offering guidances to how courts would analyze transcripts under situations like this?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,646.5,651.448,"Well certainly, well, Your Honor, if you mean by can we offer a definition?"
1978.78-5283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,651.448,651.548,Yes.
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,651.548,652.434,No.
1978.78-5283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,697.71,702.638,Well how does the -- in your state what is the reviewing standard?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,702.638,705.722,"Clearly erroneous, Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.722,722.433,"Well when a convicted criminal appeals and says that the evidence was insufficient is this to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, what standard does the appellate court use in your state?"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,722.433,732.425,"In Virginia, there has not been a ruling indicating that In re Winship requires a proof beyond a reasonable doubt for this state to overrule the lower court findings."
1978.78-5283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,748.019,759.02,"Well is this between in the ordinary criminal case in Virginia, no constitutional issues involved in it, they're just conviction and a claim that the evidence was insufficient."
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,764.66,765.518,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,765.518,773.861,"And in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, what does the -- you say the Virginia appellate court simply say is there --"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,773.861,776.021,If it's clearly erroneous.
1978.78-5283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,776.604,778.259,What's clearly erroneous?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,778.259,781.636,The judgment of the lower court.
1978.78-5283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,782.008,783.912,The decision of the jury or what?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,783.912,785.349,Yes.
1978.78-5283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,785.349,786.297,Clearly erroneous that the --
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,786.297,788.962,"Clearly erroneous, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt."
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,788.962,794.071,Is there a difference in the standard when a judge tries a case without a jury and when he tries it with a jury?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,794.071,801.283,"No, Your Honor, both would be under an obligation to find proof beyond a reasonable doubt."
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,818.43,827.374,Well are you suggesting that the federal court should apply a different standard from the highest court of the state in reviewing the conviction?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,827.374,834.768,"Your Honor, I think if Virginia has not accepted In re Winship as requiring as substantive right to proof --"
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,834.768,841.265,"What evidence do you base your statement on, Mrs. Colville, that Virginia has not accepted Winship?"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,841.265,842.044,"Your Honor, they've --"
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,842.044,843.03,Have they said so?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,843.03,855.134,"No, there's simply has not been any holding where they have come down and said that we will overturn if the proof is insufficient, if the proof has not been beyond a reasonable doubt."
1978.78-5283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,855.134,863.642,"Well, generally reviewing courts in states had very clearly do accept Winship, as you say Virginia has not."
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,873.845,874.252,Certainly are.
1978.78-5283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,874.252,875.33,That's the test.
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,875.33,875.56,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,875.56,876.955,Or a rational judge --
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,876.955,877.444,A rational trier.
1978.78-5283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,877.444,877.764,Fact finder.
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,877.764,879.119,-- fact finder.
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,879.119,886.302,"They're saying that if someone had acted non-arbitrarily, they would have found the person not guilty."
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,886.302,888.286,"What I want to get at, and I'm not clear on."
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,889.254,892.797,Okay.
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,892.797,905.734,Are you suggesting that there should be the same standard in the federal district court on the writ of habeas corpus as there would be in the state review?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,905.734,911.88,I'm suggesting that if In re Winship which we feel establishes a substantive right of proof --
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,911.88,915.99,"Well that's a substantive for the trial in the state court, isn't it?"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,915.99,916.776,-- yes we would argue --
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,916.776,924.681,"But does that continue -- does that continue all the way through up in habeas corpus or 2255, 2254 if the state have a similar remedy?"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,924.681,932.593,"Well Your Honor, we would argue that if the there is a several right to a proof then certainly yes."
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,936.335,946.552,But doesn't this case come to us with a presumption that of regularity in the application of the federal constitution by the Virginia courts?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,946.552,949.923,"Yes, Your Honor, but we feel the mistake has been made."
1978.78-5283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,964.64,971.597,"Well, I thought your argument was that in federal habeas corpus, the wrong standard was applied, isn't that it?"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,971.597,981.923,"Our argument is at this point, the federal courts have seemingly not adopted the position of rational trier of fact as to habeas corpus and we refer --"
1978.78-5283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,981.923,997.294,"Well, was I wrong or right in understanding your argument to be that in this federal habeas corpus case, the District Court and the Court of Appeals were in error in applying the Thompson standard rather than the Winship standard?"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,997.294,998.382,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,998.382,999.141,Isn't that your claim?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,999.141,1002.023,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1091.459,1101.137,"Mrs. Colville, could I ask you a question about your theory as to why there -- rather why the judgment is arbitrary of premeditation issue."
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1119.367,1125.575,My argument would be that he was indeed so intoxicated as to being capable of premeditation.
1978.78-5283,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1125.575,1129.118,But no rational judge could believe he was not intoxicated.
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1129.118,1138.948,That would be my argument and the Virginia law in mind maybe so be -- by intoxicating beverages as to being capable of deliberation.
1978.78-5283,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.948,1149.604,The Court of Appeals sought relied on the fact that the deputy sheriff obviously didn't think he was totally intoxicated because he let him retain his weapon after he'd seen him with the weapon.
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1149.604,1149.702,"Your Honor, --"
1978.78-5283,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1149.702,1153.712,Is that some evidence of non -- not being totally being intoxicated?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1153.712,1156.774,"No, Your Honor we would not agree that that would be some evidence."
1978.78-5283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1196.338,1202.446,But isn't it a question in fact as to whether the man is drunk at night?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1202.446,1204.969,"Yes, Your Honor, it would be a matter of fact, where were asked --"
1978.78-5283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1204.969,1210.077,And didn't the judge decide that fact?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1210.077,1211.482,"Yes, Your Honor, where --"
1978.78-5283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1211.482,1213.857,Well how can you attack that?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1213.857,1219.749,"Well Your Honor, we're arguing that a rational trier of fact could not have determined."
1978.78-5283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1219.749,1221.286,Why?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1226.855,1228.31,Because I think the record --
1978.78-5283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1228.31,1235.872,"And what evidence do you have to show that he was not too drunk, or that he was too drunk?"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1235.872,1236.838,I think the fact --
1978.78-5283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1236.838,1239.004,All you have is that he was drunk.
1978.78-5283,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1239.004,1241.188,"And he'd consumed the fifth of whiskey, but you're asking --"
1978.78-5283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1241.188,1247.853,"But I know some people who get drunk over one drink of whiskey, and I know others who can drink two-fifths --"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1247.853,1247.876,Well --
1978.78-5283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1247.876,1247.924,-- before getting drunk.
1978.78-5283,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1247.924,1260.176,"You said you're asking for a constitutional rule that proof that the man has consumed at least a fifth of whiskey, demolishes the possibility that he could not be -- could not have the record and ability to kill someone."
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1260.176,1263.32,"Well Your Honor, I'm not asking your constitutional rule as to that."
1978.78-5283,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1277.01,1277.06,Right.
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1277.06,1279.923,"The deputy sheriff that you referred to early, Mr. Justice Stevens --"
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1279.923,1300.124,"Aren't you really arguing that because the federal district judge on habeas corpus or that a federal district judge on habeas corpus, if that judge disagrees with the state court judge who tried out the fact issue, then the federal court determination prevails, isn't it?"
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1300.124,1307.435,I would say it was the federal district court judge if he gives all the deference necessary to the state court judge.
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1323.237,1329.253,And then three other federal court judges on the Fourth Circuit can do an opposite conclusion from that of a district judge.
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1329.253,1346.809,"Well -- well Your Honor, I think the Fourth Circuit in its opinion first of all held that it was under the obligation to follow Thompson versus City of Louisville and then went on to say that it did not feel that it needed to look at if there was sufficient evidence to convince a rational trial."
1978.78-5283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1346.809,1370.292,"Really, that's what I thought your argument was Mrs. Colville, not what their result should be in this case, on the facts of this case, but rather that the federal courts and federal habeas corpus since the Winship case which came in after the Thompson case are obligated by the Constitution to apply a different test and a different rule than was applied here."
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1370.292,1371.118,"Certainly Your Honor, we're arguing --"
1978.78-5283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1371.118,1372.136,Isn't that your argument?
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1372.136,1380.217,"-- we're arguing that the Fourth Circuit and the District Court applied the wrong standard. They applied the 1960 standard, the Thompson."
1978.78-5283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1411.548,1416.983,"Well counsel, you just said that the innocence is of overwriting importance."
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1436.411,1439.276,"Excuse me Your Honor, I didn't catch that, I'm sorry."
1978.78-5283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1439.276,1446.43,Well I'm just curious now whether you think that innocence is -- the possibility of innocence is a --
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1446.43,1447.386,Is the only determination?
1978.78-5283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1447.386,1449.053,"-- the only factor, yes."
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1449.053,1462.583,"No, but I think when -- I think in granting writ of habeas corpus, we have to look at if there is been a deprivation to due process rights then I think other principles can come into play."
1978.78-5283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1483.086,1491.173,"But Patterson against New York was a direct appeal here from the state court, so there wasn't any problem of comity on federal habeas."
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1504.693,1518.203,"Well Your Honor, I can just go back to my argument of Stone versus Powell, of innocence in the footnote indicating that innocence is at the heart of habeas corpus."
1978.78-5283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1518.203,1528.649,"Yes well but that was on exclusionary sense, in the sense that if you -- if there was no -- if the claim made had no bearing on innocence, perhaps it couldn't be treated in federal habeas."
1978.78-5283,0,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,1537.311,1538.721,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1548.669,1551.581,Very well.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1561.825,1565.049,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if it may please the Court."
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1639.169,1658.864,"But not -- despite your practice since time in memorial in the State of Virginia, not until the Winship case was it squarely decided that the federal constitution required that a state prove a person guilty beyond a reasonable doubt before it could convict them, isn't it?"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1658.864,1674.54,"My reading of Winship is that the Court was sitting in that case that as to a juvenile trial, the proof had to be beyond a reasonable doubt if the preponderance of the evidence was not sufficient, and that less there be any doubt it would say as a matter of constitutional law, that was the rule."
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1681.759,1688.181,"Well certainly not a new rule in the common law, but I -- it's my understanding that not until the Winship case had it been squarely decided by this Court that it's constitutional --"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1688.181,1691.145,"I think that's right, it was constitutionalized at that point clearly."
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1691.145,1704.587,"Right and since it was constitutionalized at that point and since it's been the practice since time almost in memorial, a federal courts on federal habeas corpus to apply constitutional test to state criminal convictions."
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1711.113,1712.82,Well I think for several reasons.
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1719.286,1724.824,"Well on that basis we could just not consider First Amendment questions, for example."
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1724.824,1725.703,Well that's certainly correct.
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1725.703,1727.497,That will save some time.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1727.497,1736.458,"It would save some time, but in this case you see there is never -- the case is tried first in the state court then it's taken on appeal."
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1736.458,1736.957,Yes.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1736.957,1739.692,Then it comes back to the federal courts.
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1739.692,1739.912,Yes.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1739.912,1741.457,And then the question there becomes --
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1741.457,1743.231,And that's true on any federal habeas corpus.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1743.231,1743.87,"It is, except --"
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1743.87,1745.726,Because you have to exhaust your state remedies before you can even go into federal court.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1745.726,1750.833,"That's right, but with respect to sufficiency of the evidence first."
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1767.807,1771.37,"Yes but if it's a constitutional duty to do it, it's a constitutional duty to do it."
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1771.37,1773.085,Well I think the constitutional duty if --
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1773.085,1774.331,"I mean that is the question, isn't it?"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1774.331,1775.197,The question is it seems to me --
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1775.197,1781.006,"It'd be too bad if it's going to add a lot of business to the federal courts, but if that's their job, it's their job."
1978.78-5283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1781.006,1793.152,"Well is it not the question, Mr. Attorney General, whether after Winship the states in the trial of criminal cases are constitutionally obliged to find --"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1793.152,1794.687,That's precisely the point.
1978.78-5283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1794.687,1799.406,"-- the reasonable doubt standard, isn't that all Winship decided?"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1799.406,1802.089,That's precisely the point that is made in the brief.
1978.78-5283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1802.089,1805.47,It had nothing to do directly with collateral attacks.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1805.47,1806.109,That's exactly right.
1978.78-5283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1806.109,1812.544,Was there any state in the union if you know at the time of Winship that did not apply?
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1812.544,1813.061,I don't know of any.
1978.78-5283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1813.061,1814.458,The reasonable out rule?
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1814.458,1823.232,"But I do think that after Winship, in every case, the rule was is there proof beyond a reasonable doubt as a standard in the state court."
1978.78-5283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1852.925,1862.563,Well may I ask Mr. Attorney General of course review was not sought of the decision of your Supreme Court in this case?
1978.78-5283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1862.563,1862.761,That's right.
1978.78-5283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1862.761,1871.889,Suppose there had been a petition to review your Supreme Court on the ground that Winship had not been properly applied?
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1875.123,1875.66,That's right and --
1978.78-5283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1875.66,1879.65,And we might have disagreed with your Supreme Court and reversed this conviction?
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1879.65,1880.339,That's right.
1978.78-5283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1880.339,1890.272,And now your suggestion is that we ought -- litigants ought to be limited to come in to us directly and review from state courts rather than go into federal habeas?
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1890.272,1894.522,Well I'm making -- I'm making that suggestion to the Court.
1978.78-5283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1894.71,1898.101,"Why, don't we have enough to do up here?"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1898.101,1905.206,I'm suggesting to the Court if they come up on direct review that's sufficient to protection and check and supervision over what's happening to peoples --
1978.78-5283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1905.206,1912.685,"Oh now, you know what's -- you know something about the happenstance of certiorari grants, don't you?"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1912.685,1914.779,I do.
1978.78-5283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1923.382,1937.872,"But as I understand your argument, perhaps I misunderstand it, you suggest we ought to foreclose habeas review in cases like this and limit the review if there's to be any federal review to direct review by this Court of your higher state court?"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1937.872,1940.803,I'm suggesting to the Court to consider that as a possibility.
1978.78-5283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1957.03,1959.912,"That's no secret to you, I didn't agree with any of those."
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1959.912,1964.343,I read that.
1978.78-5283,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1967.756,1972.405,"Well surely Stone against Powell is different form this case, isn't it?"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1972.405,1972.862,Well in Stone --
1978.78-5283,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1972.862,1985.206,Of course you adversary's argument has in his substance that innocence is involved and is at the heart of federal habeas.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,1985.206,1987.242,That was not true in Stone against Powell.
1978.78-5283,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2005.605,2012.24,Of course we haven't pursued Stone against Powell every time we've been asked to.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2012.24,2012.338,I understand that.
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2012.338,2022.818,"Your argument would lead, I should think inexorably to the conclusion that if there has been a valid conviction in the state court, that's the end of the matter."
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2025.071,2025.99,Well as far as sufficiency of evidence is concerned.
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2025.99,2029.122,I mean that would've denied review in Thompson against Louisville.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2037.034,2041.414,"Well there've always be the opportunity for direct review, and there've always be I think Your Honor --"
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2041.414,2049.389,"I know but -- that of course there's opportunity for discretionary direct review, the petition for certiorari here."
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2062.411,2064.844,Well I think it is available for the Court to determine --
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2064.844,2065.204,For what?
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2065.204,2070.751,"-- the question of the opportunity of the full and fair hearing, I don't think that's been completely flushed out I don't think we know exactly what the confines were of."
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2070.751,2073.513,But when there's been a full and fair hearing that's the end of the matter.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2075.32,2076.875,For sufficiency of the evidence.
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2076.875,2080.136,For anything that's where your argument leads.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2080.136,2086.621,Well I think what the effect of habeas corpus would be is to see still if constitutional rights are being violated.
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2087.219,2096.859,Well and would constitutional rights be violated if a state had convicted a person on evidence of a lesser standard than beyond a reasonable doubt under Winship?
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2096.859,2102.736,"I think that under Winship, the only test would be had that -- has that standard of proof been applied in the case."
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2102.736,2106.706,"Had they mouthed the right things to the jury, is that it?"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2106.706,2114.39,But I think that there would be ways to look behind the substance -- look to the substance if the appearance of justice did not conform with the substance about there.
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2114.39,2117.053,"Well that's just what this is about, isn't it?"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2119.865,2122.312,"Well if it please the Court, I will settle for the adoption as I say in the brief of the Thompson rule, but I --"
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2122.312,2127.629,"Mr. Attorney General, let me give you an easy one Mr. Attorney General."
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2143.915,2146.508,If there'd been a jury in this case?
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2146.508,2151.426,With the full instruction on reasonable doubt right out of Winship.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2151.426,2153.143,Well except that the law -- you may be right about that.
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2153.143,2156.255,Wouldn't you be have been -- wouldn't you be in better shape?
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2156.255,2165.226,Well there couldn't be argument about what standard they were supposed to apply but the law in Virginia is that the judge is supposed to apply the same standard that the trier of fact does.
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2165.226,2168.43,Well you don't want to draw the line between those two?
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2168.43,2169.975,Well I haven't thought about that.
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2170.831,2173.466,I'm just being helpful that's all.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2173.466,2176.221,Well if it's helpful I'll adopt it.
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2176.221,2197.599,"But what if, to go a little further with my brother Marshall's suggestion and this had been a jury trial and there had been absolutely perfect instructions on the duty of a jury not to convict until it found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and on the presumption of innocence and all the rest of it."
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2224.463,2233.289,"If you adopt the standard, I think that you're in the same position that you're in with Wainwright that you are cut off because of procedural default there."
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2234.086,2236.393,"No, there's no procedural default at all."
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2238.732,2243.273,"I think you're right, as long as there's the ability to raise that question and get a full and fair hearing under those standards that's the end of it."
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2243.273,2244.896,That's the end of federal habeas corpus.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2245.739,2255.713,"Now, my point on that Your Honor is simply that there is I think in this Court a greater sensitivity to the integrity and capacities of the state courts."
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2276.171,2283.114,Well that I argument I think leads to overruling Thompson against Louisville at least in so far as its applicability to collateral attack goes?
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2283.114,2283.851,I think that's right.
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2283.851,2285.945,"Yes I think it's right, isn't it -- it's correct?"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2285.945,2286.163,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2286.163,2289.654,Not that it's -- I don't agree that it's necessarily right.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2289.654,2292.551,"Well obviously, in order to uphold the judgment of the Fourth Circuit."
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2320.074,2322.719,"Well that would be of an expansion of Stone against Powell, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2322.719,2323.567,It would.
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2324.007,2325.881,"I mean, but the Stone against Powell approach."
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2325.881,2327.558,Appropriate as it mentioned but --
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2327.558,2329.103,But a Stone against Powell approach.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2329.103,2330.867,"It would be, certainly it would be."
1978.78-5283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2330.867,2331.167,Through this kind of --
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2331.167,2335.067,It'd be the application of the Stone against Powell doctrine into this case.
1978.78-5283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2335.067,2343.571,And to that extent I gather a pro tanto appeal by the court of the federal habeas corpus statute that Congress enacted --
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2343.571,2346.583,"You know, I think there'd still be something there for habeas."
1978.78-5283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2346.583,2348.088,I said a pro tanto.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2348.088,2348.805,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2348.805,2349.112,I believe --
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2349.112,2350.07,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2350.07,2352.176,-- a great amount of --
1978.78-5283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2352.176,2352.965,As I said --
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2352.965,2353.272,Excuse me?
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2353.272,2358.702,-- with the judge trial as compared with the jury trial.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2380.792,2382.876,You've seen where the state judge is what?
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2384.122,2386.984,Where the district judge is a former state judge.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2386.984,2388.471,"Right, that's right."
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2388.471,2402.19,"And you ask him to pass on a judgment by a state judge in a trial without a jury, wouldn't you give him some leeway?"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2402.19,2406.719,Well it be true in people that had gone before a jury in a different manner --
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2406.719,2406.827,Yes.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2406.827,2415.327,"-- I suppose because you'd be cutting off, you'd be chilling somewhat, I suppose, their interest in taking the jury trial."
1978.78-5283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2510.418,2521.596,"You know what Mr. Attorney General, of course the federal habeas statue requires that all issues presented to federal habeas court be exhausted in the state courts first."
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2521.596,2522.534,That's right.
1978.78-5283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2522.534,2525.738,So that I suppose --
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2525.738,2526.864,That's limited to --
1978.78-5283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2526.864,2534.929,"-- the logical end of you position is that not only pro tanto repeal of the habeas corpus statute, but let's just repeal it."
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2534.929,2535.975,"No I don't want to that, Your Honor."
1978.78-5283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.975,2546.704,Well every question if -- every question that comes to a federal habeas court shouldn't be adjudicated there at all unless its -- the state courts have already adjudicated it.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2546.704,2546.822,That's right.
1978.78-5283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2546.822,2550.762,"And there's been completely exhaustion, so why shouldn't that be the end of it?"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2550.762,2560.266,Well I think that it's there for cases where there is not proper respect and regard for the Federal Bill of Rights.
1978.78-5283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2561.504,2587.341,"Well I know, but are you suggesting that if all the -- if all the plaintiff does in a -- if all the petitioner does in the federal habeas corpus petition is to claim the state court made a mistake, I got a good hearing and they applied the right rules, the only thing is they came to the wrong result."
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2591.01,2597.76,Well I don't think the result ought to have an effect now with the sufficiency of the evidence you might disagree with the result.
1978.78-5283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2599.776,2603.02,Well what about voluntariness of a confession?
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2603.02,2606.89,Well I think that we've seen in Wainwright that the Court is willing to decide --
1978.78-5283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2606.89,2611.926,I know but say it's been raised absolutely correctly and it's been adjudicated.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2623.233,2626.674,Well I confess that I've had trouble in figuring where this line ought to be drawn.
1978.78-5283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2648.401,2657.133,"Well I don't understand Mr. Attorney General why if that can be the end of it, why couldn't it be the end of review by this Court directly of the Virginia Supreme Court?"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2660.474,2669.016,Well I think that one reason is that that does give you check and as you say it seems sometimes to be in frequent that you get certiorari but you --
1978.78-5283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2669.016,2673.877,When you not concede -- you concede it's not the end of it to the extent of direct review by this --
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2673.877,2679.514,It's not and I think when you take weigh all these habeas corpus petitions you're going to have an ability to render more suits.
1978.78-5283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2679.514,2682.067,And surely we'll be swamped.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2689.031,2689.259,Well I think in --
1978.78-5283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2689.259,2689.806,Where's the --
1978.78-5283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2689.806,2691.071,Clearly so.
1978.78-5283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2691.071,2700.432,-- you think the habeas -- federal habeas statute was intended as a substitute or an additional layer of review in the conventional sense of review?
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2700.432,2706.173,Well the habeas statute has of course been a changing thing over the years.
1978.78-5283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2726.714,2734.918,The scope of the federal judge in Virginia then is not the same as the scope of the highest court in the State of Virginia.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2734.918,2735.92,Well I don't think it is.
1978.78-5283,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2744.234,2757.682,"General Coleman, I don't know whether you are in on the initial habeas proceedings or not, but I notice on page 25 of the appendix that the case not only has a civil number, it has a magistrate number."
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2763.169,2764.711,"No, it wasn't."
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2764.711,2768.614,"Mr. Attorney General, another easy one."
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2791.012,2792.356,Well I think that the --
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2792.356,2795.633,The trial judge could've been -- couldn't he?
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2795.633,2799.228,Well the trial judge had to determine whether or not --
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2799.228,2803.665,"Yes, I mean we don't know how he knows when a man is too drunk."
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2803.665,2806.63,Well but the same thing is true of the Supreme Court of Virginia.
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2806.63,2807.82,"Yes, exactly."
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2807.82,2808.903,And it would be true here.
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2808.903,2811.997,"That's what I'm saying, but what we'll we do?"
1978.78-5283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2812.992,2819.821,"If we had 12 lay jurors who passed on this issue, Mr. Attorney General, would we have any better information or knowledge about their capacity to make that judgment?"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2819.821,2820.816,I don't think we would.
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2822.756,2827.471,"You could have an instruction on it, couldn't you, with the jury?"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2827.471,2828.187,You could.
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2828.187,2829.532,"Yes, I thought so."
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2829.532,2831.322,Of course the judge also is supposed to know the law.
1978.78-5283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2831.322,2833.54,Instructs himself.
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2833.54,2836.475,I said but there's nothing in the record to show it.
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2836.475,2837.033,Well the point that I would --
1978.78-5283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2837.033,2848.997,"The composition is that he has trained as a Virginia judge to do the same thing a jury does, and he does it that way --"
1978.78-5283,1,35656,marshall_coleman,,2848.997,2851.304,He does it and he's familiar with the law.
1978.78-5283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2912.38,2915.752,"Do you have anything further, Mrs. Colville?"
1978.78-5283,2,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,2915.752,2920.514,"Your Honor, just a very brief statement about what exactly we are seeking."
1978.78-5283,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2956.769,2959.535,"Mrs. Colville, let me ask you one question if I might?"
1978.78-5283,2,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,2981.093,2986.731,"Well, my basic inclination is that the transcript would go to the federal district judge."
1978.78-5283,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2998.314,3001.479,How would you swiftly review several thousand pages?
1978.78-5283,2,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,3001.479,3009.859,Well I think what I'm saying is that it would be far more easier if the state says “This is where we say that there's reasonable doubt.”
1978.78-5283,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3022.708,3027.073,"Like a sufficiency of evidence argument on appeal, say the Supreme Court of Virginia?"
1978.78-5283,2,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,3027.073,3028.456,Certainly.
1978.78-5283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3028.456,3033.155,"Mrs. Colville, you just gave me an answer that I know but I'm just little confused."
1978.78-5283,2,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,3038.125,3044.152,"No, Your Honor, I could not find that reasonable doubt was the rule applied in Virginia, no."
1978.78-5283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3044.152,3046.259,So it's somewhat narrower standard I would presume then?
1978.78-5283,2,18604,carolyn_j_colville,,3046.259,3047.525,Yes.
1978.78-5283,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3048.417,3049.102,Thank you counsel.
