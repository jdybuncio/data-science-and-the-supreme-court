1987.87-267,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.747,"We will hear arguments next in Number D. H. Holmes Company, Limited, against Shirley McNamara, Secretary of Revenue and Taxation of Louisiana."
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,13.167,32.705,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in this case for the first time since its decision in the Complete Auto Transit versus Brady the Court is faced with a question of whether a state may constitutionally impose a direct use tax on the value of goods while those goods are still in the stream of interstate commerce."
1987.87-267,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,82.842,85.965,How many states did these residents reside in?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,85.965,90.277,They are in the State of Louisiana and three other states located in the Gulf Coast areas.
1987.87-267,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,90.277,90.558,Three?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,90.839,93.135,"Florida, Mississippi, and Alabama."
1987.87-267,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,93.135,97.992,The facts here only apply to the--
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,97.992,101.6,To the 82 percent of the catalogues which actually went into the State of Louisiana.
1987.87-267,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,101.882,105.16,"--And Holmes owned those catalogues, didn't they?"
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,105.16,108.769,"Well, sir, that question is still at issue."
1987.87-267,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,136.195,139.804,"Well, what happened to any catalogues that weren't delivered?"
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,139.804,153.61,"If the catalogues weren't delivered to the selected residents in Louisiana, the post office was instructed by the instructions on the catalogue to leave those catalogues with the then current resident, and if they weren't distributed to the then current resident they were distributed or sent back to the home store."
1987.87-267,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,153.61,155.188,So Holmes got them back.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,155.188,158.545,Holmes ultimately would get the catalogues back that weren't actually distributed.
1987.87-267,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,159.404,162.918,Even though you suggest they are not taxable?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,162.918,173.321,"Those, the ones that Holmes got back, yes, Your Honor, are subject to tax because in that particular situation Holmes then obtained possession and control over those catalogues incident to ownership."
1987.87-267,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,175.149,180.677,Do you think that that much should turn on an incident of title?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,185.16,189.751,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but we have to focus on the purpose and the incidence of a use tax."
1987.87-267,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,221.209,233.344,"Well, Mr. Harrison, I guess, though, that Holmes caused the distribution in Louisiana of the catalogues for its benefit."
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,233.344,235.406,Holmes... the only activity--
1987.87-267,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,235.406,244.823,So is the taxable activity the causing of distribution of the catalogues for its benefit in the state?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,244.823,245.65,--Basically that's correct.
1987.87-267,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,251.883,256.023,Is that not an activity that can be taxed in the jurisdiction?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,256.023,261.176,--In the court below the only incident of taxation was causing these catalogues to be imported.
1987.87-267,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,269.828,275.388,Is that an insufficient activity for a jurisdiction to impose a tax?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,275.388,276.341,"--Yes, it is."
1987.87-267,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,276.341,276.716,Why?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,276.716,281.042,This Court has focused on jurisdiction to impose a tax in two separate areas.
1987.87-267,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.181,289.726,You didn't raise a due process issue here.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,289.726,290.226,That's correct.
1987.87-267,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,314.529,315.997,I just don't understand the argument.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,327.867,336.942,"I don't agree with your premises, Justice O'Connor, and that is that the activity does not create the right of a state to tax."
1987.87-267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,376.13,384.985,Suppose a customer of Holmes ordered from Holmes an item of equipment.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,394.81,395.935,That's correct.
1987.87-267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,395.935,399.699,That is because they are going to use it in the State of Louisiana.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,399.699,401.559,"You are exactly correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,403.166,406.603,"But also Holmes, Holmes could be made to collect that tax."
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,406.603,407.993,"That's correct, but--"
1987.87-267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,407.993,414.257,"Now, I don't... and the activity is the receipt and use of something in Louisiana."
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,414.257,415.022,"--You're right, Your Honor."
1987.87-267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,431.265,440.761,Holmes certainly is having these catalogues imported and delivered to its customers for use by them in the State of Louisiana.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,440.761,443.667,"That's correct, the customers are in fact using the catalogues."
1987.87-267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,445.743,451.6,Why can't you tax Holmes for having these things imported for use in Louisiana?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,451.6,458.818,"--Well, Justice White, as you just pointed out, the person who is actually using the catalogues within the State of Louisiana is the recipient, not Holmes."
1987.87-267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,460.066,463.158,"Yes, but Holmes is certainly having that use provided."
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,463.158,469.421,--Holmes receives the benefit of people's using its catalogues within the taxing jurisdiction.
1987.87-267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,470.748,471.545,Hopefully.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,471.545,472.139,Hopefully will receive them.
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,499.441,504.531,Could Holmes have made a dollar in Louisiana without those catalogues?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,504.531,505.672,"Yes, they could have, Your Honor."
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,505.672,505.953,How?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,505.953,512.403,"People go and shop at Holmes and have been shopping at Holmes for over 150 years, long before catalogues ever became--"
1987.87-267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,512.403,513.512,Those are pretty old people.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,518.417,519.104,--Somebody would still be shopping over there also.
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,519.104,521.603,You mean in the Holmes stores.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,521.603,528.96,"Yes, Your Honor, they have been shopping at the Holmes stores, and it was not necessary for the catalogues to be distributed in order for them to purchase items from Holmes."
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,528.96,531.428,"Well, why did Holmes waste all that money if it wasn't necessary?"
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,531.428,534.286,Holmes at one time was contemplating--
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,534.286,535.566,Did it have a loss or something?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,535.566,544.343,"--No, there wasn't a loss involved, Your Honor, but there are several reasons for distributing catalogues other than the cases that you faced... other than the situations in the cases that you faced where there is--"
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,544.343,544.687,To get business.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,550.7,551.028,--That is correct.
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,552.278,555.637,And to get... the only business they were interested in was selling.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,555.637,557.573,"That's correct, Your Honor, just as Holmes--"
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,557.573,564.274,And the only interest in Louisiana was to sell something to a Louisiana citizen.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,564.274,565.21,--That's right.
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,570.553,573.973,You say Holmes caused it to be imported.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,573.973,576.207,"--That's correct, Your Honor, they did cause it to be imported."
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,576.207,579.97,And if they had picked them up and delivered them themselves they would have been in trouble.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,579.97,588.639,"If they had to come up and deliver it themselves, there is no question that at that point Holmes would have had possession and control of the catalogues within the State of Louisiana."
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,591.808,593.621,I can now see the memorandum that the law department gave Holmes.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,593.621,594.995,"I apologize, Your Honor."
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,594.995,600.602,I can now give you the law memorandum that the lawyers gave Holmes.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,606.568,607.803,That's basically correct.
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,613.519,615.237,"Well, what other reason?"
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,615.237,621.532,Holmes ordered its catalogues in this manner because it participated in what is called the Atkins Buying Organization.
1987.87-267,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,762.287,781.264,"But if one looks at the whole plan, so to speak, certainly you can pick out incidents that took place elsewhere, as you point out, but the idea was Holmes', they wanted to engender a distribution of catalogues in Louisiana that would help sell their products in Louisiana."
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,783.545,789.276,"You are correct, there are a lot of Louisiana ties sufficient for establishing of the due process, for example."
1987.87-267,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,814.594,821.436,"But they wouldn't have nearly the claim that Louisiana would, because Holmes is located in Louisiana."
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,829.119,834.194,But the due process contacts between Holmes and the State of Louisiana exist in those states.
1987.87-267,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,878.723,887.002,You say no one is deemed to have any control incident to ownership when goods are placed in the stream of interstate commerce.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,887.002,888.236,For purposes of use taxation.
1987.87-267,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,888.846,893.671,"Well, when you add for purposes of use taxation then you are relying on some cases of this Court?"
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,893.671,895.265,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-267,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,948.882,949.336,Mr. Rinker--
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,949.336,950.899,--incident to ownership sufficient for taxation.
1987.87-267,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,950.899,956.099,--Why do you say that presumably Complete Auto Transit does not overrule those cases?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,956.099,962.096,"Well, in... Complete Auto Transit dealt with, again, activities rather than taxation of goods."
1987.87-267,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,963.425,973.826,You can tax the activity of conducting interstate commerce but you can't tax the goods that are going through interstate commerce?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,973.826,983.463,--The activities taxed in Complete Auto and its progeny are solely related to indirect benefits to interstate commerce.
1987.87-267,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1003.455,1019.433,Why is it more harmful to what the commerce clause seeks to protect to allow the goods to be taxed than it is to allow the activity of carrying the goods to be taxed?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1024.259,1030.038,"In the first place, the activities can be more clearly identified with a particular taxing jurisdiction."
1987.87-267,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1070.694,1073.488,Why isn't that the same thing with the trucker who carries the goods?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1080.532,1081.828,"That's correct, but there--"
1987.87-267,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1081.828,1083.672,I don't see a whole lot of difference between the two.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1083.672,1111.785,"--In the case of the goods, the goods are isolated... in the case of goods or the catalogues in this particular case, there has to be some kind of activity, as the Court pointed out, and the nexus test in the Complete Auto case is that there must be some nexus between... and Justice Brennan, who wrote the opinion, pointed very clearly that the connexity has to be between the activity and the taxing state."
1987.87-267,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1122.469,1124.265,"Well, Mr. Honchell--"
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1124.265,1125.234,--involved in affording the catalogues.
1987.87-267,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1125.234,1125.937,"--Now, wait a minute."
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1133.011,1141.476,But there is no operational incidence of any activity within the State of Louisiana which can be taxed.
1987.87-267,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1141.476,1144.257,"Well, sure, it is having the catalogues distributed there."
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1144.257,1155.08,"Having the catalogues distributed in Louisiana does not involve any operational incidence, does not involve any act by Holmes within the taxing state."
1987.87-267,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1156.798,1158.111,Holmes caused--
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1158.111,1158.969,--even assuming the state's theory--
1987.87-267,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1158.969,1161.374,--Holmes caused the distribution.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1168.419,1179.055,"--Correct, it did cause the distribution in Louisiana simply by placing an order for the catalogues, but that activity took place outside of the State of Louisiana."
1987.87-267,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1187.989,1190.863,I thought the distribution occurred within the state.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1190.863,1193.954,"The actual transfer of title, perhaps, under the state's theory."
1987.87-267,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1193.954,1194.22,Okay.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1195.658,1203.654,"But Holmes did not engage... because the catalogues at all times, even when they are in the state, when they are in the mailbox, when they are in the postal service--"
1987.87-267,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1203.654,1213.307,Before they got to the mailbox there was a direction by Holmes in Alabama to the printer in--
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1213.307,1216.713,"--Atlanta, Boston, and Oklahoma City."
1987.87-267,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1217.025,1217.416,--Yes.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1217.883,1218.946,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-267,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1218.946,1223.07,Directing the precise addresses to which the catalogues were to be delivered?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1223.07,1223.599,That's--
1987.87-267,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1223.599,1228.645,"And that action took place in Louisiana, didn't it?"
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1228.645,1230.879,"--That is not correct, Your Honor, and the record certainly does not support that."
1987.87-267,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1230.879,1236.266,The direction to the printer to mail them to those addresses--
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1236.266,1246.466,"The actual instruction... in the first place, the record does not support that the Holmes person who said, we want to order the catalogues, actually placed the order from within the State of Louisiana."
1987.87-267,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1261.429,1262.49,--Who gave the printer the addresses?
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1262.49,1267.333,"Holmes provided them to the buying organization, which ultimately got to the printer."
1987.87-267,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1267.941,1268.488,I see.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1268.488,1271.737,But all of those activities took place outside of the State of Louisiana.
1987.87-267,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1271.737,1296.414,"Mr. Rinker, supposing that you were looking at this transaction from a philosophical point of view, from on high, and you looked at what took place in Georgia, and what took place in Louisiana, and what took place in Mississippi and Alabama and the states... which state do you think would have the greatest claim, just in a perfectly common sense way, to put a tax on this transaction?"
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1296.414,1319.373,"Assuming that there was an actual transfer of title to the catalogues, which I mentioned earlier is still in dispute, transfer of title to Holmes prior to delivery to the particular residents, any of those states, assuming a sale had been completed there, could have imposed a sales tax, but all of those states happen to have exemptions for printed materials."
1987.87-267,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1334.179,1337.491,"Yes, but why don't you answer the Chief Justice's question?"
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1337.491,1339.787,As to which one has the closest contact?
1987.87-267,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1339.787,1340.396,Yes.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1340.396,1354.594,"The one that has the closest due process contact with the State of Louisiana is Holmes, but I think the problem is, we are trying to mix two different concepts, the due process concept versus the interstate commerce clause concept."
1987.87-267,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1354.594,1366.135,"Mr. Rinker, does it make any difference to you... from your response to the questions I gather it doesn't... that the tax is not upon the activity but upon the property?"
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1366.135,1367.026,It--
1987.87-267,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.026,1377.647,"I mean, so long as the activity would justify a tax on the activity we can assume that the tax is a tax on the activity as opposed to a tax on the property, which is what it is?"
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1379.006,1399.716,"--In brief, our argument is that since there are no activities by Holmes within the State of Louisiana, activities being those types of activities similar to the ones that this Court has addressed in its previous decisions after Complete Auto, that in fact there are no activities, and because of that the tax must be imposed on the goods."
1987.87-267,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1399.716,1414.194,"But you concede that if there is an activity that could be taxed as an activity, then this tax, even though it is not a tax on an activity but simply a property tax, must be upheld under the commerce clause?"
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1414.194,1425.674,"Assuming there is an activity which has sufficient connexity and sufficient operating incidences under the state statute which requires distribution, then it would be subject to tax."
1987.87-267,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1462.566,1464.721,"Mr. Rinker, let me ask you a question, if I may."
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1481.729,1484.759,"Under existing jurisprudence, yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-267,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1489.57,1490.648,There is an activity involving all 100 percent.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1501.565,1507.547,--In that particular case I would think Louisiana might try and tax 100 percent.
1987.87-267,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1514.561,1515.373,You may the same argument you make--
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1515.373,1530.287,"--and they are just temporarily stopped over, that they are intended to be continuously in interstate commerce and that that incidental stopover, we will say, to be shifted from a common carrier to the postal service is not sufficient to impose the tax on Holmes of the value of catalogues sent outside of the state."
1987.87-267,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1530.287,1541.533,"--You are going to lose that once you have conceded that so long as there is an activity that the state could place a tax on, and if we find there is such an activity here, it really wouldn't matter where the catalogues were shipped, right?"
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1542.47,1543.877,"No, Justice Scalia."
1987.87-267,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.183,1572.943,"You would also be engaged in the activity of shipping 82 percent to local residents and 18 percent to out of state residents, and your opponent argues, well, this is the... what you have got here is the functional equivalent of that but you have just used the mails."
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1577.862,1585.562,"But the state tax statute deals with use, which can be defined as any type of use, including storage."
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1616.971,1621.454,An order for transportation.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1621.454,1621.626,I beg--
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1621.626,1622.267,An order for transportation.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1622.267,1624.562,"--And orders the transportation, but does not perform the activities."
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1624.562,1627.124,But if they had done it with their own trucks it would be.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1627.124,1629.717,If they did it with their own trucks?
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1629.717,1630.013,Yes.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1630.013,1636.839,"The trucking activity could be taxed, but not necessarily the goods in interstate commerce unless the state tried to tax them because they were storing them--"
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1636.839,1637.402,But they could be taxed.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1637.402,1638.4,--on the trucks.
1987.87-267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1638.4,1643.679,And so to escape the tax you send it by parcel post.
1987.87-267,0,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,1643.679,1648.912,"We didn't do it for that reason, Your Honor, but that is what actually happened in fact."
1987.87-267,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1652.552,1654.441,"Thank you, Mr. Rinker."
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1656.19,1664.796,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I am delighted that you asked the trucking question."
1987.87-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1719.523,1726.707,"Now, does this include... suppose I am... well, could you tax the mailman for distributing these catalogues?"
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1726.707,1728.629,"No, Your Honor."
1987.87-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1728.629,1730.956,"You see, the property tax, it is on the catalogues, isn't it?"
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1739.125,1741.233,"It is the use of the property, Your Honor."
1987.87-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1743.561,1743.952,Of your own property.
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1746.717,1747.074,--It is Holmes' property.
1987.87-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1747.074,1752.822,"--If I borrow a neighbor's catalogue and read it, you wouldn't hit me with a use tax, would you?"
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1752.822,1753.228,"No, sir."
1987.87-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1819.218,1820.218,Mr. Pugh--
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1820.218,1822.498,It was so found by the state court below.
1987.87-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1822.498,1823.467,--Mr. Pugh?
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1823.467,1824.263,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1824.263,1829.308,"If Holmes owned the catalogues in Louisiana, did they also own the catalogues that were sent to the Mississippi customers?"
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1829.308,1839.085,"Well, Holmes would own those catalogues just the same as if they had been sent in Louisiana, but to answer the Court--"
1987.87-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1839.085,1843.442,Could Louisiana impose a use tax on the 18 percent that went to out of state customers?
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1843.442,1844.956,"--No, sir, and would not attempt to."
1987.87-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1844.956,1849.815,Could Mississippi impose a use tax on the 18 percent that went to Mississippi?
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1849.815,1851.142,"It could if it chose to do so, Your Honor."
1987.87-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1851.142,1851.955,You think it could.
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1851.955,1854.015,It may be that 18 percent is de minimis.
1987.87-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1855.0,1856.655,"Well, it is a fifth of the total amount."
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1870.837,1875.227,"--Well, I would have a case insofar as Louisiana is concerned."
1987.87-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1875.227,1875.414,Right.
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1875.414,1877.085,"In fact, I've got a strong case because the other--"
1987.87-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1877.085,1881.256,But you do not rely on the fact that the stores are located in Louisiana?
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1881.256,1891.579,"--I rely on the fact that the stores are located in Louisiana to assist in the nexus question, and in addition to that the whole purpose--"
1987.87-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1891.579,1892.203,Do you think you need that?
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1894.234,1896.624,"--No, sir, I don't think I need the stores."
1987.87-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1901.043,1902.934,But if we are focusing on the activity--
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1902.934,1904.715,--The activity is the distribution.
1987.87-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1904.715,1908.572,--and their ownership of the catalogues just before they are turned over to their customers--
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1908.572,1909.104,"Yes, sir."
1987.87-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1909.104,1913.007,"--it would be the same case, as I understand it, if the stores were located in Mississippi."
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1913.007,1918.038,"As I can appreciate what the Court is saying, I do not disagree with what the Court is saying."
1987.87-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1923.831,1936.702,"So that if any manufacturer mails something to a customer in another state, even free, the manufacturer can be taxed on that item in the other state, or causes it to be mailed by a third party."
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1936.702,1941.699,"--Well, I guess we had better decide now whether we are talking about who is going to collect the tax."
1987.87-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1967.486,1969.579,We are concerned about who else can be hit with this kind of tax.
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1995.349,1999.973,That could certainly be construed under the position that we are taking.
1987.87-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1999.973,2000.176,Yes.
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2005.236,2028.96,"Well, the strongest support for the position that I am primarily taking in this case is the one that was handed down, xx Pipe, last year, when the suggestion was made xx the... excuse me... here it is, taxpayers are better... to establish and maintain a market in this state for the sales."
1987.87-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2058.278,2060.386,"More than that, you are promoting out of state business."
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2066.554,2067.164,You own it.
1987.87-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2067.164,2070.084,And if you are distributing it in Louisiana that is enough.
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2070.084,2070.787,It is.
1987.87-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.644,2198.408,"Don't provoke me, Mr. Pugh."
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2200.016,2202.765,"--You gave me enough trouble earlier, Your Honor, I'll tell you."
1987.87-267,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2237.313,2239.765,"Thank you, Mr. Pugh."
1987.87-267,1,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2239.765,2240.093,Thank you.
1987.87-267,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2240.093,2242.593,"Mr. Rinker, you have three minutes remaining."
1987.87-267,2,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,2242.593,2260.601,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in focusing again on Justice O'Connor's question about the fact that Holmes caused the importation of these catalogues, can Holmes be subject to the tax for causing this importation?"
1987.87-267,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2271.316,2282.295,"Suppose Holmes had ordered 3,000 travel alarm clocks to give to their best customers, and they told... they ordered them from out of state and gave the names and addresses of the customers they wanted the clocks mailed to."
1987.87-267,2,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,2291.573,2298.757,"--Justice White, no, they could not, because Holmes does not exercise any power or control over those clocks once they come into the taxing state."
1987.87-267,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.833,2308.973,They certainly made them available to their customers.
1987.87-267,2,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,2308.973,2317.296,"It's true, but once those clocks go into the hands of the customer, they are not in Holmes's hands, and a use tax on Holmes cannot be imposed."
1987.87-267,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2317.296,2320.404,"Say they ordered 3,000 alarm clocks."
1987.87-267,2,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,2336.352,2338.32,"Yes, because there is a use within the taxing state."
1987.87-267,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2370.072,2373.086,But the construction of the state statute is not for us.
1987.87-267,2,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,2377.101,2382.364,"In determining the operational incidence of the statute, you are correct, the state court does determine that."
1987.87-267,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2471.907,2473.516,"Your time has expired, Mr. Rinker."
1987.87-267,2,16888,andrew_rinker_jr,,2473.516,2473.688,"--Oh, sorry."
1987.87-267,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2474.407,2475.172,The case is submitted.
