1986.86-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.404,I'll proceed with the arguments in Burlington Northern v. Oklahoma Tax Commission.
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,10.106,13.491,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,273.243,285.401,"Mrs. Christian, there is a pretty well recognized distinction in state property tax law isn't there between valuation relief or valuation and equalization?"
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,285.401,289.789,"I believe that those terms are misleading and confusing, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,290.472,292.491,Well why do you think they're misleading and confusing?
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,292.491,301.097,--Equalization essentially refers to equalizing the percentages of assessed value to true market value.
1986.86-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,311.202,331.699,"Well, I had thought that valuation was the determining what the fair market value of the property was and that equalization meant the desire to assess at the same percentage of fair market value all classes of property."
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,333.032,338.02,"No, it is directed to the desire to assess at the same percentage of true market value--"
1986.86-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,338.02,338.57,Well why do you think--
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,338.57,339.972,--all classes of property but--
1986.86-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,339.972,344.107,--Why do you think the terms are misleading then?
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,344.107,352.029,"--The petitioners, the respondents in this case have used the term equalization as synonymous with undervaluation."
1986.86-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,361.968,368.039,"But as you have used the term and perhaps as, I think I have used it the same, do you find that confusing?"
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,368.039,370.657,"No, not as we have used the term here."
1986.86-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,530.511,538.501,Your claim here is that 306 Section 28(a) was violated.
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,538.501,541.203,"--Subsection 1(a), that is correct."
1986.86-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,541.203,542.303,1(a).
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,542.303,545.321,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-337,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,546.904,565.115,"Mrs. Christian, there is certainly some indication in the legislative history that the representatives of the railroad industry seeking this legislation did not expect it to be applied as you would have us apply it today."
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,565.115,571.702,"--We do not believe that that is a correct characterization of what the railroad witnesses actually said, Justice O'Connor."
1986.86-337,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,605.275,605.942,Mr. Lanier.
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,605.942,618.167,"--Mr. Lanier, expressly stated in written testimony subsequent to the oral exchanges recited by respondents that in his view the valuation of railroad property would be an issue."
1986.86-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,658.792,674.652,"Mrs. Christian, what does it mean to say, as you just have, that the statute does not require any particular valuation methodology so long as it produces real market value."
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,723.032,727.119,"I see no reason why that would necessarily be the result, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,775.333,777.969,Which one produces the fair market value?
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,799.699,806.471,"--First, Justice Scalia, if properly applied all of these methodologies will yield results that are very close together."
1986.86-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,848.631,859.503,"So you concede then that all the federal court would have to do is use whatever methodology the state used, assuming that was a reasonable methodology?"
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,859.503,866.593,We think the door would have to be open for the railroad to challenge a particular methodology as not being a reasonable methodology.
1986.86-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,866.593,867.059,Right.
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,867.059,883.368,"But given that caveat, yes his role would be to determine on the basis of the evidence before him, which would include the evidence of the state's expert and the railroad's expert as to whether these methodologies have been properly applied."
1986.86-337,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,894.89,897.176,May I ask before you leave the methodology point.
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,899.794,903.93,"--In this case, Burlington Northern would be raising two contentions."
1986.86-337,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,950.893,955.511,"In other words, both methodologies were permissible but they were misapplied in this particular case for the reason--"
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,955.511,960.582,"In this particular case, Burlington Northern is claiming that they were misapplied."
1986.86-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,961.865,984.198,"--Would the federal court give any deference to the state's judgment on those matters, or, in other words, would the federal court be reviewing the state's rate making or assessments similar more or less the way it would review a rate making by the ICC, giving the agency the benefit of the doubt."
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,989.351,992.553,--The federal court has to de novo make those determinations.
1986.86-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,992.553,994.053,It's a lot of work.
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,994.053,1009.73,It would of course determine on the basis of the experience and expertise of the individual expert witnesses what degree of deference should be given to each witness but it would not give deference to the state merely because it was the state.
1986.86-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1030.076,1038.38,How do you square that with your concession that you have to accept whatever method of valuation the state uses.
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1038.38,1045.319,"--Justice Scalia, we certainly remain free to challenge a particular valuation as totally unreasonable."
1986.86-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1047.053,1056.659,"How about within the range of reasonable ones you have, you say we have to, the federal court has to accept the methodology that the state chooses."
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1067.717,1073.62,"--Justice Scalia, I apologize if I said the state would have, the court would have to accept the methodology."
1986.86-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1095.467,1100.685,"And I think they will lead to the result, the same results system wide."
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1109.275,1122.534,"The states, Justice Scalia, do the valuation of the railroad property on a system wide basis and then they allocate a portion of that to the state on the basis of track miles, or some other technique."
1986.86-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.534,1123.034,Or--
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1123.034,1125.236,So that the valuation of each state is--
1986.86-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1125.236,1127.719,"--Well, I'm including that in the methodology though."
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1135.875,1138.294,--That is not normally considered a part of the methodology.
1986.86-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1138.294,1138.694,Oh.
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1138.694,1141.012,That would be considered something separate.
1986.86-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1141.496,1141.979,I see.
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1148.602,1156.938,"In this particular case, Justice Scalia, there is no challenge as to the allocation factor and that is true of all of the cases I'm familiar with."
1986.86-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1163.944,1170.948,"What if it's... but there, but you know, I mean there are a lot of different reasonable ways of allocating."
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1174.633,1183.839,The railroads expect the federal courts to engage in a de novo determination of whether the true market value has been properly determined.
1986.86-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1198.182,1200.8,There normally will be over the allocation.
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1200.8,1209.823,"Thus far, in the cases litigated to date, Justice Scalia, to the best of my knowledge none of the cases has involved a dispute over the allocation to the state."
1986.86-337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.579,1224.899,"Could I ask you, I take it that the earlier Burlington case in Kansas, with respect to Kansas--"
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1224.899,1225.499,--Yes.
1986.86-337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1225.499,1237.291,--I thought that the Court of Appeals said that this kind of a suit would be entertained if the railroad could make out a decent claim of intentional and purposeful overvaluation?
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1237.291,1238.841,"That is correct, Justice White."
1986.86-337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.841,1245.146,"Well, isn't it almost inherent in your claim that it was intentional."
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1245.146,1247.412,We think that it was and that we made that showing.
1986.86-337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1257.037,1257.62,"Well,--"
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1257.62,1258.12,We certainly--
1986.86-337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1258.12,1261.339,--Was there a finding about intentional discrimination in this case?
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1261.339,1274.666,"--In this case, Justice White, the District Court received affidavits but did not conduct a hearing, and concluded on the basis of those affidavits that Burlington Northern had not made a strong showing of overvaluation with discriminatory intent."
1986.86-337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1276.149,1279.284,So they said with discriminatory--
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1279.284,1282.152,Purposeful overvaluation with discriminatory intent.
1986.86-337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1291.608,1299.614,"--And so, both courts seemed to say that even if there was overvaluation it wasn't discriminatory, intentionally discriminatory?"
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1299.614,1301.899,"Both courts upheld that, Justice White."
1986.86-337,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1301.899,1309.636,"Mrs. Christian do you defend, or support, or agree with the requirement of intentional discrimination as being an element."
1986.86-337,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1309.636,1316.659,"We believe that intent is not a relevant element at all, Justice O'Connor."
1986.86-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1347.594,1348.528,"Thank you, Mrs. Christian."
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1365.239,1368.691,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1398.527,1402.847,"Both those things are likely to be true of course, aren't they, Mr. Lauber."
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1402.847,1405.966,Well I hope to show that they are not both true.
1986.86-337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1479.765,1483.717,"Where do you find this requirement in the statute, Mr. Lauber?"
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1483.717,1484.617,Of the discrimination?
1986.86-337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1484.617,1485.517,Yes.
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1485.517,1492.753,"Well, it comes from the fact that you have these two fractions, the two assessment ratios that have to either be equivalent or not."
1986.86-337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1506.18,1510.048,Well then you're not using discrimination in any intentional sense at all.
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1510.048,1510.582,Exactly right.
1986.86-337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1510.582,1511.882,A disparity is what you're--
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1511.882,1512.417,Exactly right.
1986.86-337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1521.023,1530.595,"--So your point is if all the property in the state is valued wrong, but it's not done in any way that discriminates against the railroad that would not be an object of xxx."
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1530.595,1532.078,Exactly right.
1986.86-337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1537.415,1545.721,"Well did you read the word assessment, the second word in subsection (a) as being the same as valuation?"
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1545.721,1547.59,Well assessed value--
1986.86-337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1547.59,1549.323,"Well, but it doesn't say assessed value."
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1558.029,1559.815,--At a higher ratio.
1986.86-337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1559.815,1560.315,Yes.
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1560.315,1561.665,"xxx assess it, it means, yes the value--"
1986.86-337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1561.665,1568.586,"Well, why doesn't that refer to the equalization process rather than the valuation process?"
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1568.586,1575.324,--Well what the two fractions represent is perfect equalization.
1986.86-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1610.08,1620.603,The thing doesn't really work if you read it literally and if you assess the property higher but tax it at a lower rate.
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1621.471,1623.055,"Well, taxing at a higher rate--"
1986.86-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1623.055,1632.244,There would not be any discrimination against the railroad if although you violated subsection A by assessing the property too high.
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1638.148,1644.085,"--Well, the rate disparity is a separate offense xxx."
1986.86-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1644.085,1647.187,"You taxed it at a lower rate, the railroad property at a lower rate."
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1651.574,1652.29,It could be--
1986.86-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1652.29,1655.359,"It would still violate A wouldn't it, even though the railroad isn't being discriminated against."
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1655.359,1665.165,"--It could be a railroad might, a railroad might be able to defend, the state might, be able to defend on the ground that any over-assessment was cured."
1986.86-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1680.142,1680.96,One would hope not.
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1682.894,1695.103,"--Even after a railroad proves discrimination in objective terms, the court cannot grant relief unless the railroad proves that the disparity in the two assessment ratios is greater than five percent."
1986.86-337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1762.546,1774.286,"Mr. Lauber, do you think the statute would permit states to impose a burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence on the railroads in these cases?"
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1774.286,1776.471,I don't think the statute would permit that.
1986.86-337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1778.257,1778.623,Why not?
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1789.831,1794.867,"Oh, so you're saying if state law itself imposed a clear and convincing burden of proof that would be--"
1986.86-337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1794.867,1795.35,On the railroads.
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1795.35,1796.485,--incorporated into federal law.
1986.86-337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1796.485,1797.269,Right.
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1797.269,1799.754,I don't think that was the intent of the statute.
1986.86-337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1799.754,1814.596,"Well, now why doesn't the statute provide exactly that in subsection 2(d): the burden of proof with respect to the determination of assessed value and true market value shall be that declared by the applicable state law."
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1814.596,1816.798,"Well I would read that, the words"
1986.86-337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1840.664,1848.402,I think I might be inclined to give it its ordinary meaning and say it would encompass the level of the burden.
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1848.402,1855.257,"--Well, the problem is that the state could then have it be beyond a reasonable doubt and kind of get at the railroads that way."
1986.86-337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1904.773,1906.023,"Mr. Lauber, oh I'm sorry, go on."
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1906.023,1909.558,--It could very well be that the state would respond by saying yes.
1986.86-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1936.309,1936.692,Mr. Lauber--
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1936.692,1939.494,"If that is right, it would be crazy if the railroad couldn't do the same thing."
1986.86-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1939.494,1947.367,--Do you agree with Mrs. Christian as to what has to be accepted?
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1957.825,1964.395,"I would agree that there are probably some methodologies like underappreciated book cost, that simply would be ridiculous."
1986.86-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1965.279,1965.829,I understand.
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1970.799,1972.099,--I would say it ought to accept it.
1986.86-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1977.369,1980.338,And what about the factual determinations under each of those?
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1985.325,1991.129,"Well generally speaking, you won't really have a lot of factual determinations about how much is that hopper car worth."
1986.86-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1997.55,1998.45,Whatever.
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1998.45,2005.306,"Under those questions the court would hear expert testimony about what the ICC would require, the federal tax law would require--"
1986.86-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.306,2007.072,Any deference to the state?
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2007.072,2007.556,--Pardon me?
1986.86-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2007.556,2012.96,Any deference to the state if there are various reasonable positions that could be taken.
1986.86-337,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2012.96,2017.696,I would think there would be no deference to the state on the subsidiary questions.
1986.86-337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2017.696,2019.496,"Thank you, Mr. Lauber."
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2043.329,2046.031,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2134.153,2137.538,"May I ask, General Lee on that, you mentioned the other states' cooperation."
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2147.71,2148.21,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2148.21,2148.912,--jurisdiction.
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2156.083,2158.535,The valuation of a railroad varies from state to state.
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2158.535,2159.251,It does?
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2159.251,2160.335,And also--
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2160.335,2163.387,You don't use a multi-state tax commission approach of any kind?
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2163.387,2168.541,"--No, there is tremendous disagreement with the methodology that should be applied and I--"
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2168.541,2174.128,Isn't it true that most states start with a system-wide value figure and then work back from that?
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2174.128,2174.795,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2182.717,2190.656,"So if we got a case involving this particular railroad from Kansas or Missouri, we might find a dramatically different figure as the starting point?"
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2190.656,2192.156,"Yes, I think it so."
1986.86-337,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.877,2226.412,"Well, that isn't what she said."
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2235.935,2242.172,"Well, our methodology that we used in 1981, we attributed 25 percent to the income, Kevlaw's income method."
1986.86-337,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2329.663,2339.753,"Well, Mr. Lee, part of the equation referred to in subsection (a) is the ratio in relation to true market value isn't it?"
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2339.753,2340.269,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-337,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2340.269,2341.871,"I mean, that's part of the equation."
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2341.871,2342.588,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-337,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2342.588,2364.32,"And then when you come down to part 2(d) of this section where it deals with burden of proof, it does refer to burden of proof of true market value, so apparently Congress did envision some inquiry into true market value--"
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2364.32,2364.803,We think that--
1986.86-337,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2364.803,2367.938,--as part of the assessment equation.
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2367.938,2377.211,--We think that they meant the inquiry into true market value is to be made only with regard to a determination of the sales assessment ratio study.
1986.86-337,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2402.778,2415.586,"Well, do you think that it's open to the federal court to inquire into the true market value of the commercial and industrial property in the tax jurisdiction?"
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2415.586,2417.003,Yes.
1986.86-337,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2426.476,2438.884,"So as part of the inquiry into subsection (1)(a), the court can examine the true market value by the sampling technique of the commercial and industrial property?"
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2438.884,2439.951,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-337,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2440.418,2450.176,But where in the statute do you see that the court is prohibited from making the same inquiry as to the railroad's true market value?
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2450.176,2452.878,"--Well, we think that this is not a plain meaning case."
1986.86-337,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2469.653,2480.528,"Well the language of the statute itself could at least support the reading given it by the railroad and the Solicitor General, could it not?"
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2480.528,2483.563,--If you take that single sentence out of context.
1986.86-337,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2509.297,2525.14,"If its overall object is to prevent singling out the railroads unfairly in the ad valorem property tax structure of the various jurisdictions then it wouldn't necessarily support you, would it?"
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2525.14,2531.894,--We think the Congress was advised that there were only two problems with the way that railroads were being treated.
1986.86-337,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2595.903,2611.18,Well if you are right about the interpretation it certainly leaves it open to the states to recoup all the money they otherwise would lose by jacking up the value of the railroad property.
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2611.18,2617.484,"Well, I think that's the concern of the 10th Circuit and why they said what they did with regard to their rule."
1986.86-337,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2633.445,2640.765,Do you support the requirement of finding intentional discrimination and if so where do you find that in the statute?
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2640.765,2665.315,"--Well we, Kansas spoke to this in detail in their amicus brief and they felt, their contention was, and we agree with it, that a federal court sits as a court of equity and if there has been a blatant or an egregious retaliation or circumvention of the assessment ratio equalization requirements that a federal court should not cover its eyes to that and can act to prevent a state from doing that."
1986.86-337,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2678.14,2678.824,I think you're right.
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2707.16,2708.177,"Well, and we think--"
1986.86-337,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2708.177,2709.36,"I mean, I can see two different statutes."
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2734.627,2741.981,"--Well, we think that the five percent provision of the statute refers strictly to equalization of the assessment ratio."
1986.86-337,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2785.994,2801.788,"Why would it make any sense to conduct the inquiry of fair market valuation of non-railroad property, if you don't have the authority to conduct fair market valuation of railroad property?"
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2801.788,2808.275,"--Well, because they prescribe the means by which that the inquiry into the true market value of non-railroad property is to be made."
1986.86-337,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2812.477,2813.196,Well what difference does that make?
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2826.337,2826.737,"--Well,--"
1986.86-337,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2826.737,2830.456,Because the ratio depends upon the comparison of the one to the other.
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2852.621,2855.673,--Well the sales assessment ratio study is a sampling.
1986.86-337,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2865.529,2867.981,"I know it's easy, but what's the purpose of doing it?"
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2867.981,2877.169,Because that sets the standard that the federal court is to look at in equalizing the ratio that is to be applied to non-railroad property with that of railroad.
1986.86-337,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2950.935,2951.502,I see what you mean.
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2951.502,2953.12,--the assessed value and you come out with a ratio.
1986.86-337,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2953.12,2953.454,But generally--
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2953.454,2956.955,And our state wide ratio is 10.87 percent.
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2956.955,2975.1,"--What you're saying, if I understand you is that in, I'm thinking in terms of burden on the courts and the like, that it would be permissible for the railroad to come in and say that the state has to follow the general policy of undervaluing all other commercial and industrial property, and that's how they get a 10.87 ratio, because they're really undervalued it all."
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2983.539,2985.075,"Well, I don't think they can."
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2987.427,2988.727,I thought that was what you just said?
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2988.727,2989.66,No.
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2989.66,2998.166,"Didn't you say that it is, the issue of the valuation of non-railroad commercial property can be addressed by a federal court?"
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,2998.166,2998.733,That's correct.
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2998.733,3004.07,And the reason for doing it would be to show that that property was all undervalued?
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3005.053,3008.605,"Well, I guess if you mean assessment value as being undervaluation--"
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3008.605,3009.556,Yes.
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3009.556,3010.19,--you're correct.
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3018.579,3019.062,All right.
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3019.062,3019.946,So all properties under--
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3019.946,3023.798,"But it's 35 percent of X, of true market value."
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3040.843,3041.862,"--Well, a trial--"
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3041.862,3043.912,"As I understand, you're saying that would be permissible."
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3043.912,3067.81,"--Well, a trial on the validity and the proper ratio as determined by a sales assessment ratio study has not been a problem and there has been some litigation about it, but it's just not anything compared to what would follow if the federal courts were allowed to look at the entire methodology that a state has applied."
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3076.883,3085.772,I thought all she said was that there are three general methodologies that are used and both the states and the railroads all agree that any one of the three is generally acceptable.
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3087.974,3105.268,"--Well there have been disagreements about how much weight to accord each one of them within the different methodologies and income value indicators there's enormous disagreement, tremendous disagreement."
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3155.135,3160.605,"--I suppose once he's decided it for 1982, it probably wouldn't be as hard to do it in 1983."
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3160.605,3161.539,"--Well, that depends."
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3164.391,3169.378,"Yes, but I mean you've got some basic disagreements that probably would be ironed out after a few years, I would think."
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3169.378,3177.214,"Well, in this particular case the railroad said that, they said that we disagree with what they're saying about our valuation of the property."
1986.86-337,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3183.035,3190.808,"Well does the federal judge when he hears all these experts, simply sit as a finder of fact and decide what he thinks the right value is?"
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3190.808,3191.924,That's what they want.
1986.86-337,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3218.977,3220.91,"Clearly the statute rules that out, doesn't it?"
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3220.91,3221.293,Yes.
1986.86-337,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3226.631,3228.499,And promptly raised the valuation.
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3229.116,3229.616,"--No, we didn't do that."
1986.86-337,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3234.07,3236.939,"You didn't, you mean you raised it, but not immediately."
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3236.939,3237.372,"--No, we didn't."
1986.86-337,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3272.159,3273.859,Then why are the railroads complaining?
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3273.859,3275.527,"Well, because they want more."
1986.86-337,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3286.585,3304.63,Do you agree that if the railroad made a decent case out of the fact that there was an intentional overvaluation of their property that you could really inquire into the reasonableness of the valuation?
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3304.63,3306.665,"Well, we think there's a real problem with that."
1986.86-337,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3307.198,3308.265,"Well, yes or no."
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3309.148,3309.7,"--No, we don't."
1986.86-337,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3309.7,3313.486,--I would think you're argument would say it doesn't make any difference what they allege.
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3319.306,3319.956,That's correct.
1986.86-337,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3332.031,3336.602,So you don't defend the Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit then in that respect?
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3336.602,3345.207,If it's interpreted in such a way which would allow them every year to delve into the intention of our tax commissioners or our ad valorem division director--
1986.86-337,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3345.207,3347.84,Well that sounds like what they mean.
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3347.84,3357.515,"--Well, we can live with the Lennen rule if it's properly applied and if the same protections with regard to summary judgment are given to our tax officials that are given to public employees generally--"
1986.86-337,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3357.515,3367.621,"Well wouldn't the 14th, or wouldn't the equal protection clause give the railroads some constitutional claim in the event of intentional discrimination and without the 4-R statute?"
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3367.621,3368.237,--I don't think so.
1986.86-337,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3375.56,3378.762,Even in a showing of intentional discrimination?
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3378.762,3385.998,"I, Your Honor, I really think that and the fair assessment case in 1982 mean that they really can't do that."
1986.86-337,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3411.233,3424.742,"I would think you really take this 10th Circuit seriously in saying that it's open to proof whether there was an intentional overvaluation, intentional discriminatory overvaluation."
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3436.717,3437.767,Yes.
1986.86-337,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3439.083,3444.637,"And so I, so I just don't understand the 10th Circuit--"
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3444.637,3445.573,Well we think that--
1986.86-337,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3445.573,3450.025,"--saying that you can't get into valuation, but you can get into intent."
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3450.025,3450.341,--Yes.
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3479.394,3487.9,"It is correct, is it not that your 1982 value was a great deal higher than your 1981 system value, a $2 billion to $3.5 billion--"
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3487.9,3489.233,That's where we have a disagreement.

1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3533.881,3534.414,"--Yes, but--"
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3534.414,3537.499,Absent the negotiation it would have been $3.6.
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3537.499,3542.737,"--Well, he said even in his deposition that the valuation of that railroad is $3.6 billion."
1986.86-337,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3550.39,3552.342,Did he retain his position after...--
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3553.392,3553.858,No.

1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3561.231,3563.566,--is because he was engaging in these and they--
1986.86-337,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3563.566,3568.018,"Not working for the railroads now, is he?"
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3576.041,3577.358,--We like it better than the 8th and the 9th.
1986.86-337,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3577.358,3578.326,I understand.
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3597.352,3599.054,But Congress told them how to do that.
1986.86-337,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3599.054,3601.923,"Well, they told them how to do it, but sometimes that doesn't work."
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3608.41,3611.029,"Well, or they could adopt another ratio study."
1986.86-337,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3611.645,3612.595,"Well, whatever, I mean."
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3612.595,3613.981,--Appoint their own appraiser to conduct a ratio study.

1986.86-337,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3718.731,3721.333,Now how do you explain the burden of proof provision?
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3733.891,3743.247,--But the next sentence says that if the correct ratio cannot be established by using the sales assessment ratio study then the federal court is to be left on its own.
1986.86-337,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3744.616,3746.499,"--No, I'm not sure you answered my question."
1986.86-337,2,21166,david_w_lee,,3756.34,3756.857,--That's correct.
