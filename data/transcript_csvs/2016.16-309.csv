2016.16-309,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.33,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 16-309, Maslenjak v. United States. Mr. Landau."
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,8.33,23.18,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1425(a) of the Federal Criminal Code authorizes the government to strip a naturalized American of citizenship if it was procured contrary to law."
2016.16-309,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,62.41,72.05,"Even -- even assuming I bought your argument, that's a very broad statement, any effect."
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,75.185,76.205,"Well, your Honor --"
2016.16-309,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,76.205,80.705,Because you can never predict what will actually happen in the end.
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,84.27,90.96,"And we would be happy -- what we asked for was a materiality standard, which I think is very much along the lines, as Your Honor, just suggested."
2016.16-309,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,109.96,119.06,"Well, but -- but what Justice Sotomayor said, in essence, means sometimes we -- causality is known only after the fact."
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,127.475,135.15,"Well, the government, if it wants to strip an American of citizenship, which is about the most grave thing it can do, probably short of taking away someone's --"
2016.16-309,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,135.15,136.395,I fully -- I fully understand that.
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,136.395,136.61,Right.
2016.16-309,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,136.61,153.065,"But the idea of what's material and what's immaterial, and -- and what's a causal link and what is not in a sense can be understood and analyzed only after the fact."
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,153.065,172.39,"Well, I think, Your Honor, the government has the burden -- if it wants to show that the Petitioner or the defendant procured citizenship contrary to law, the government has to show, at the very least, that, based on a false statement, that the false statement was material. Our basic submission --"
2016.16-309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,172.39,208.55,"Can you explain why this wouldn't be harmless area? You're arguing about material or not, but why isn't this obviously material? She lied about her husband's -- what he was doing in Bosnia, right? She said he -- he was trying to avoid military conscription when, in fact, he was in the service and in -- in the unit that was committing atrocities. Under what circumstances would that be immaterial?"
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,208.55,218.86,"Your Honor, we would like a chance to argue the materiality question to a jury, which is the general decider of what is material under this Court's decision in Gaudin."
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,227.88,237.68,I -- I understand that. What -- they were given refugee status based on well-founded fear of persecution where and for what reason?
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,237.68,240.115,"Well, this is the crux of the dispute, Your Honor."
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,251.22,252.57,Where? In -- in Bosnia?
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,252.57,253.43,"In Bosnia, yes."
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,253.43,253.97,This is -- yes.
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,253.97,254.06,Yes.
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,259.08,259.35,Right.
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,259.35,262.24,"And this was, in a sense, the heart of the dispute at trial."
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,283.435,285.44,We don't know which it was based on?
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,285.44,285.85,No.
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,291.47,301.785,"Well, if -- I mean, if -- this isn't the issue that we -- that we took cert to decide, but it does raise the question whether there's really anything at stake here."
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,309.77,310.53,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,310.53,315.055,So merely being a Serb there where I think they're about 30 percent of the population would not be --
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,315.055,315.96,That is correct.
2016.16-309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,372.68,382.74,"Can you explain to me how the good moral character works into this, because even if it's immaterial, it is a lie."
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,386.08,396.13,"The -- the good moral character provision, Your Honor, which is 1101(f)(6), 8 U.S.C 1106(f)(6), is our friend in this case, because you're absolutely right."
2016.16-309,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,494.41,505.64,"Well, that's -- that's the anomaly I'm stuck with, and maybe you can help me with, Mr. Landau, is that 1425 doesn't contain an express materiality provision."
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,509.46,509.895,Right.
2016.16-309,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,509.895,514.415,And then some of the predicate acts for 1425 do and others don't.
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,514.415,515.62,Right.
2016.16-309,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,515.62,528.2,"So it seems like, linguistically, we have to do some somersaults to get where you want to go, because no one would say that to violate 1425, you have to prove, say, a material genocide, right?"
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,528.2,529.3,"I couldn't agree with you more, Your Honor."
2016.16-309,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,529.3,529.42,Okay.
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,539.74,541.21,"Your Honor, I --"
2016.16-309,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,541.21,542.97,"Statement-based ones, I think your position is."
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,547.18,548.48,"I -- I don't think so at all, Your Honor."
2016.16-309,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,558.685,564.66,"How is that? Because it says illegally procure, and then it talks about material misrepresentations in two separate clauses."
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,564.66,565.26,Correct.
2016.16-309,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,591.74,598.75,"Suppose Fedorenko's interpreted the language ""procure,"" and doing it illegally, is anything in the course of the proceeding --"
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,598.75,599.02,Well --
2016.16-309,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,599.02,600.99,"-- right? So that's the answer to that, isn't it?"
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,600.99,601.09,No.
2016.16-309,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,608.9,612.25,"Well, then -- then, that concession right there answers my problem, doesn't it?"
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,612.25,642.25,"I mean, it's -- I -- I might have misspoken if I said -- 1425(a) includes -- it includes bribery, it includes things to which the word ""material"" wouldn't naturally apply, which I think answers your question right there, in the sense that it would have been nonsensical for Congress to put in a general illegally-procured statute the word ""material."" It just wouldn't fit there because it's a general one. Where they use the word ""material"" in 1451, that's because historically, 1451 has had illegally procured, the kind of the catch-all, and a separate statement one."
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,650.25,650.82,Mr. Landau --
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,650.82,651.86,-- it just doesn't make sense.
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,651.86,668.77,"-- hasn't the -- the briefing in this case really clarified what the issue is? And in a way, it seemed to me that what was being debated in the district court was the wrong issue about whether to charge the jury on materiality, because materiality is not in this statute."
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,674.165,675.16,That's absolutely --
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,675.16,678.69,"-- which may or may not mean exactly the same thing as ""materiality."""
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,678.69,680.94,"I think you are absolutely correct, Your Honor."
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,702.63,718.58,"Within your brief, you, I -- I think, have possibly tried to read more into ""procure"" than you can, because in a number of spots you seem -- you argued that it means ""but for causation."" Now, this morning you have said that's not your argument."
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,728.69,736.785,"Your Honor, our position in this case was always relying on the line of circuit precedent going our way was that it was materiality."
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,755.38,760.65,"Well, I -- I don't know whether you can get that out of ""procured."" Let me give you this example."
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,799.695,814.84,"Your Honor, I think your question points out some of the very difficult questions of causation that -- that are really, you know, implicated by the word ""procure,"" and -- and on which the Court, frankly, fractured in Kungys."
2016.16-309,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,850.605,852.26,"Yeah -- please, finish."
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,852.26,861.87,"I'm sorry, Your Honor. That -- I mean, my point really was there is some starch in the -- the standard of materiality, and it really goes to qualifications for citizenship."
2016.16-309,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,870.635,872.17,"Can I ask you, Mr. Landau --"
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,872.17,872.62,Sure.
2016.16-309,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,872.62,876.04,-- about a -- a different interpretation of the statute.
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,899.26,899.69,Right.
2016.16-309,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,899.69,908.9,And that both are limited to failures to satisfy the prerequisites to naturalization. And that's really what we should be thinking about when we interpret that.
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,908.9,914.01,"I think that that -- you know, I think that makes a lot of sense, that -- that this is really -- that's what it's about."
2016.16-309,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,923.66,928.25,"And that would, in this case, presumably, be because of bad character; is that right?"
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,928.25,932.16,"Well, I mean, no, the -- well, the government, I think, thinks a lot more than that."
2016.16-309,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,952.88,962.33,"I'm not sure this helps you under our case law under Ginsberg and Ness, and that line of cases --"
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,962.33,962.48,Right.
2016.16-309,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,962.48,964.43,-- that the government relies on.
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,977.96,978.46,But so --
2016.16-309,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,978.46,980.96,"So how do you win, and how do you get causation into that?"
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,980.96,995.735,"But that is -- that is what I was trying to get at before with 1101(f)(6), which goes to the things that categorically preclude a finding of good moral character, does not say any falsehood in the application process is enough to disqualify you."
2016.16-309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1009.57,1011.96,I hate to be --
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1011.96,1012.93,I find --
2016.16-309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1012.93,1013.445,-- inconcrete.
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1037.895,1058.39,"Well, we would go back to -- we would get a witness to talk about, you know, how her two sisters got here, for instance, that -- that they were victims of ethnic persecution by the Muslims in Bosnia, and that she would have gotten the refugee status regardless of the -- the point about the husband's military service."
2016.16-309,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1091.84,1092.36,I'm sorry.
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1105.205,1105.77,"Well, but --"
2016.16-309,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1105.77,1110.01,"She had to lie about his military service, otherwise, he would have been disqualified --"
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1110.01,1110.79,"Well, but they didn't do it."
2016.16-309,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1110.79,1111.41,-- from naturalization.
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1111.41,1113.475,"They allege -- and this is exactly right, Your Honor."
2016.16-309,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1133.82,1136.605,Is there any way they could have found otherwise?
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1136.605,1138.48,"Well, I -- I think --"
2016.16-309,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1138.48,1140.51,I -- I understand there are case laws.
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1140.51,1140.64,No.
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1163.77,1173.665,Do you think this well -- this well-instructed jury would be entitled to hear evidence about Srebrenica and about her husband's military service?
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1173.665,1179.18,"I think, you know, that that raises some interesting questions."
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1179.34,1181.7,I -- I don't know how well you're going to do in front of this well-instructed --
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1181.7,1182.15,"Well, yeah."
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1182.53,1182.97,-- jury.
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1182.97,1186.82,"-- Your Honor, again, I am not here to say that -- to predict --"
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1186.82,1187.31,"No, I -- I understand."
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1187.31,1190.76,-- that people are going to be throwing roses in our path on remand.
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1367.66,1372.51,But failing to meet the qualifications for naturalization sounds to me like but-for causation.
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1372.51,1373.0,Well --
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1373.0,1375.97,"So is that your argument, or is it something less than but-for?"
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1375.97,1376.905,Well --
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1376.905,1381.38,"I mean, you can say it should be but-for but I -- I'll win if it's anything."
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1381.38,1382.57,Right.
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1382.57,1384.83,What is your -- do you have a firm position or --
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1384.83,1390.93,"We -- if we were starting this on tabula rasa and we had not argued materiality below, I would say that it's but-for."
2016.16-309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1393.87,1408.47,"Well, that's -- I mean, that's awfully hard, because then you have to go back and determine, even if somebody says something that has a real potential to affect the naturalization decision, you still would have to go back and show that in this case it actually did make the difference."
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1408.47,1415.18,"And, Your Honor, this was the crux of the debate in the plurality opinion in Kungys between Justice Scalia and Justice Stevens."
2016.16-309,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1453.33,1468.58,"Well, if that's the case, how do we distinguish between 1425(a) and (b)? (a) says that it has to be a procured contrary to law; (b) says, you know, procured when it's not -- when you're not entitled to it."
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1485.52,1485.7,Yeah.
2016.16-309,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1485.7,1486.37,I'm just stuck there.
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1486.37,1499.98,"I mean, I -- I think again, you know, (a) -- (a) is really about the procurement of citizenship -- you know, that's an interesting point, Your Honor."
2016.16-309,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1503.16,1506.04,You have to do something different; right?
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1506.04,1506.41,Well --
2016.16-309,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1506.41,1507.345,One would hope.
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1507.345,1519.67,"But -- - but again, I think (a) is clearly about, you know, they both use the words ""procure"" or ""obtain,"" and, again, you know -- I'm not sure."
2016.16-309,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1522.57,1523.08,Thank --
2016.16-309,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1523.08,1524.615,If there are no further questions.
2016.16-309,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1524.615,1533.81,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Parker."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1533.81,1541.625,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Naturalization is the highest privilege the United States can bestow upon on individual."
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1556.12,1560.18,"But, scrupulously, I -- I looked at -- on the naturalization form, there is a question."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1564.39,1564.74,Uh-huh.
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1564.74,1577.21,"-- ""committed, assisted in committing, or attempted to commit a crime or offense for which you were not arrested?"" Some time ago, outside the statute of limitations, I drove 60 miles an hour in a 55-mile-an-hour zone. (Laughter.)"
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1577.21,1581.175,I'm sorry to hear that.
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1581.175,1596.485,"I was -- I was not arrested. Now, you say that if I answer that question no, 20 years after I was naturalized as a citizen, you can knock on my door and say, guess what, you're not an American citizen after all."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1596.485,1597.935,Well --
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1597.935,1599.46,Is that right?
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1599.46,1600.605,"If -- well, I would say two things."
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1606.38,1606.67,"Oh, come on."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1611.63,1612.0,No.
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1612.0,1613.1,-- except when they were arrested.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1613.1,1626.75,"Well, what I think the -- what I think that particular question demonstrates is -- and I will readily acknowledge, number one, that is a very broad question, and, number two, and I think that there is a great deal of ambiguity in what exactly is meant by ""crime and offense."" And --"
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1626.75,1628.025,"Well, but just -- it's worse."
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1630.22,1640.145,"In Black's Law Dictionary, I looked up what's an offense? And this is what it says: It says it's a violation of the law, a crime, often a minor one."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1640.145,1640.31,Uh-huh.
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1640.31,1644.485,So you really are looking for the listing of every time somebody drove over the speed limit.

2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1658.36,1658.69,I knew --
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1658.69,1658.93,-- they knew --
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1658.93,1659.95,-- I drove over 55.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1659.95,1660.42,Right.
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1679.41,1680.62,"No, it's not a lot of ifs."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1682.34,1682.715,Uh-huh.
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1682.715,1682.93,Okay.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1686.185,1686.6,Uh-huh.
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1686.6,1690.18,I researched it in Black's Law Dictionary and it said an offense -- (Laughter.)
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1690.18,1691.715,-- no matter how minor.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1706.555,1712.28,"If we can prove that you deliberately lied in answering that question, then yes. I think --"
2016.16-309,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1712.28,1715.05,How about -- let me give you another example.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1721.1,1721.44,Uh-huh.
2016.16-309,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1721.44,1730.78,"All right? When I was a child -- not me, but some imagined applicant -- (Laughter.)"
2016.16-309,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1730.78,1734.85,I was very slight of built -- I wasn't. (Laughter.)
2016.16-309,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1734.85,1737.36,The applicant was.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1779.48,1783.47,"No -- well, I -- I think that you may be overreading that particular question."
2016.16-309,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1798.15,1798.78,Exactly.
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1798.78,1799.15,There are.
2016.16-309,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1799.33,1799.92,Exactly.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1799.92,1803.75,"But I -- I mean, I don't mean to -- to push back against that hypothetical."
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1810.66,1811.28,"Oh, but that isn't the point."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1815.475,1815.84,Uh-huh.
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1815.84,1820.2,You've read the briefs. The questions are unbelievably broad.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1824.58,1825.315,Uh-huh. (Laughter.)
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1825.315,1828.67,-- of the kind that the Chief Justice gave.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1847.705,1848.11,"Well, I --"
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1848.11,1852.88,"I mean, isn't -- now, you explain -- you explain to me why that isn't so."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1852.88,1855.55,I don't think that it would throw into doubt -- I -- I --
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1855.55,1859.765,You want 15 more examples such as the one that the Chief Justice gave?
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1859.765,1860.02,"Well, I --"
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1860.02,1865.41,"I'm truly shocked by the one he gave, by the way. (Laughter.)"
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1865.41,1878.16,"But -- but -- so -- so what is the answer? You want to fight that? Do you want to say, no, I don't have listed on the page in front of me 15 such examples and the briefs didn't list 23 and -- and we couldn't think of 100 others?"
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1878.16,1890.03,"I think that we can -- look, I -- I would readily agree with you that there are a number of questions on this form that, taken in isolation, would appear to be, if -- if you gave an untruthful answer to one of those questions --"
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1890.03,1890.51,It wasn't just --
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1890.51,1890.8,-- it would be --
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1890.8,1891.455,-- the questions.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1891.455,1891.66,Yes.
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1891.66,1898.61,"I walked into the immigration hearing with a pocketknife in a government building, a Boy Scout knife I carry on my key chain."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1902.19,1902.575,Uh-huh.
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1902.575,1904.3,It was there the whole time.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1909.225,1909.925,"No, I --"
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1909.925,1910.73,I knew there was.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1917.515,1918.18,No.
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1926.17,1927.35,Forget my last examples.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1927.35,1927.66,Okay.
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1927.66,1931.72,"Look to the general example, and you've read through the ones in the brief."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1931.72,1931.915,Uh-huh.
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1931.915,1935.825,I don't want to repeat it. It's the same underlying question.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1935.825,1949.8,"There are a number of answers that could be given in the naturalization process that could be false and might seem to be, in isolation, immaterial, completely immaterial, for example."
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1982.095,1982.98,Mr. Parker?
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1982.98,1983.31,Yes.
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1983.31,1984.1,"Please, I'm sorry."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1984.6,2015.93,"I -- I was just going to say that there are a number of reasons why Congress did not want to require that the government prove that a particular lie is material or immaterial in this context, and I -- I think it's important to understand what those are. The first is, when an individual lies, even -- remember, this has to be a lie under oath after you've sworn that you will tell the truth and you are deliberately lying about something, it calls into question the veracity of your other answers, and that is very important in the naturalization process, for the reason --"
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2015.93,2016.02,Okay.
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2016.48,2017.08,I'm sorry.
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2017.88,2022.865,And you'll be glad to know I don't have another of these questions for you. (Laughter.)
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2022.865,2030.25,"Although I am a little bit horrified to know that every time I lie about my weight, it has those kinds of consequences. (Laughter.)"
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2030.25,2031.93,Only -- only under oath.
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2031.93,2040.27,Yeah. Can I just ask you -- can I ask you to take you through a few parts of your brief?
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2040.27,2040.58,Uh-huh.
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2040.58,2045.795,Because I guess I felt a little bit confused on reading what your standard is.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2045.795,2046.08,Uh-huh.
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2046.08,2058.22,"So on page 14, you say that the question is whether Petitioner violated the law in the course of procuring naturalization, in the course of procuring naturalization."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2079.06,2082.28,"Well, I -- I -- my -- my apologies if that wasn't clear."
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2088.26,2088.59,Yeah.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2098.12,2098.405,Uh-huh.
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2098.405,2108.66,"But what -- so what you're saying -- but we -- you -- I can just choose, you -- you can tell me, your standard is in a manner that violates other laws."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2108.66,2113.37,"Well, I think that's right. And I think what that means is the same as what the -- the jury was instructed in this case."
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2113.83,2113.93,Okay.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2154.335,2155.92,No.
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2156.895,2170.325,"You procure naturalization -- this is, again, on page 18 -- a person who knowingly procures naturalization in an unlawful manner, and then you clarify that that means by violating the laws Congress has enacted."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2184.985,2185.69,"Well, I --"
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2185.69,2189.315,And I guess if that's not what you meant to say -- and I don't mean to trick you here --
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2189.315,2189.61,Right.
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2189.61,2199.765,"-- if that's not what you meant to say in this brief, although it suggests -- it -- it -- I think it is what you say, but if it's not what you meant to say, well, how could it be anything else?"
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2199.765,2203.46,"Well, I -- I think it is not. And my apologies if that sentence is unclear."
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2221.98,2225.0,"Well, number one, where is that in the statute?"
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2225.0,2231.91,"Well, I think that it is a necessary construction of the -- of the phrase, ""procure contrary to law naturalization."" So --"
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2231.91,2233.02,But it doesn't say the statute.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2244.46,2244.61,Uh-huh.
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2244.61,2250.95,"Whatever laws it is, whether it's all laws or whether it's laws relating to the naturalization process."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2250.95,2251.685,Uh-huh.
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2251.685,2266.18,"When you describe what you mean when you say in a manner that violates the laws, it's when you say, you say it's by -- you -- you procure naturalization by violating the laws, you very naturally -- I think it's a totally naturally -- natural --"
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2266.18,2266.375,Uh-huh.
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2266.375,2286.83,"-- construction of the language, you very naturally say you got the naturalization by violating those laws, meaning that the naturalization is the result of those -- that violation. Because what else could you mean when you say -- when you -- when you have a naturalization and you have these violation of laws?"
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2286.83,2287.65,"Well, again --"
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2287.65,2291.845,"Again, that the violation led to the naturalization."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2291.845,2304.22,"Well, again, I mean, just with respect to the sentence that you're quoting, I think what we were -- what we were saying is by violating the laws, we were trying to describe what it means to act in an unlawful manner."
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2306.73,2306.82,I know.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2317.71,2318.24,"Well, I don't think --"
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2318.24,2322.79,-- to describe what it means and say in a manner that violates those laws.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2322.79,2325.76,"I don't think that it is natural, and -- and let me explain why."
2016.16-309,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2349.14,2351.055,Can I -- can I ask you this --
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2351.055,2351.32,Yes.
2016.16-309,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2351.32,2359.86,"This may be a simpleminded question, but how can an immaterial statement procure naturalization?"
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2359.86,2362.12,I think that the -- the --
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2362.12,2367.1,That's such a shorter statement of my question.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2369.025,2377.21,"I think the answer is, we at least don't read the statute to require that the statement be procuring the naturalization."
2016.16-309,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2413.1,2420.72,That's the same question. It may be the same question in a -- in a different form. Just give me a sentence that has this pattern.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2437.205,2439.0,Had no -- well --
2016.16-309,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2439.0,2447.765,"She -- she procured X contrary to law, but the thing that she did had no potential to help her get that thing."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2447.765,2464.88,"If -- if what we are saying, as -- as Petitioner has argued, is that it has to be something that -- where you either could not get it, or it would be much less likely to get it if you did Y instead of X, I think one example might be, you know, you -- you go to a gallery."
2016.16-309,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2484.775,2492.37,"But the -- the thing -- the thing that was done there, stealing the painting certainly had the potential to help the thief get the painting."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2492.37,2493.36,That's true.
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2502.7,2510.235,"Well, what about, what sort would you accept; that is, you've heard two right there. Forget the word ""materiality."" From your point of view, you don't."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2527.47,2527.86,Well --
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2527.86,2532.345,What about the one you just used? It was a means towards getting.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2534.8,2535.21,Well --
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2535.21,2544.45,"But which ones -- well, here I have about five -- would influence the decision? It had the possibility or tendency to influence the decision."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2544.45,2544.84,Uh-huh.
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2544.84,2547.44,You say all those are wrong?
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2547.44,2551.01,"I think they are, but the reason is that Congress has said that --"
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2551.01,2552.415,"Well, which one do you accept?"
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2552.415,2554.64,I -- I don't think I would accept any of them.
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2558.06,2560.355,"Oh, I know -- I know you say Congress said that."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2587.24,2629.35,"I -- I don't think so, because Congress has said, for example, that even -- and -- and this was the Court's decision in Kungys -- that even an immaterial false statement about the most immaterial of matters can be a categorical bar to the abilities -- ability of the person to be naturalized. And the -- the point there is that it would be very odd, I think, to read the statute to say that if a person procures naturalization despite having done that, that somehow that was not done contrary to law because materiality or some -- some other formulation would be required in addition in order to establish that."
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2629.35,2631.435,"Well, Mr. Parker, let me -- let me try this another way."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2645.26,2646.18,I think so.
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2646.18,2649.85,"Procure contrary to law and naturalization, it's procure naturalization --"
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2649.85,2652.395,"Yes, if you violated laws governing naturalization, right."
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2652.395,2669.56,"So the idea that procuring naturalization illegally somehow includes illegal acts that have no effect on naturalization, or on procuring naturalization, it's -- it's just not how we use language. How could it be that that is true?"
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2669.56,2670.82,But it's not.
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2680.05,2685.0,But it has -- but it has no effect on the decision to naturalize.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2685.0,2700.54,Whether a truthful answer would have had an effect on the decision to naturalize versus an untruthful one? I -- I think that Congress has said quite clearly that that is not the relevant consideration for purposes of these -- applying these statutes.
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2700.54,2700.74,Yes.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2712.195,2714.5,"Well, I think there does have to be a relationship."
2016.16-309,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2717.07,2717.4,Will you tell us --
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2717.4,2718.55,-- think that there is a causal nexus.
2016.16-309,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2718.55,2721.185,Will you tell us what that relationship is?
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2721.185,2726.79,"That -- that relationship, in our view, is that the laws have to be the laws governing naturalization."
2016.16-309,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2734.42,2751.72,"If that's true, though, Mr. Parker, what do you do with 15 -- 1425(b)? What's the difference between (a) and (b) on the government's account? (a) says you -- you procure contrary to law, naturalization; (b) says you procure naturalization you're not entitled to."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2751.72,2768.5,"Well, I think that the reference to being entitled in subsection (b) reinforces our point that ""contrary to law"" doesn't necessarily mean that you weren't entitled to the naturalization. It means that you violated the rules that Congress had set forth governing who can be naturalized and how they must do to."
2016.16-309,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2768.5,2776.92,"So (b) would be you were -- you were not entitled to begin with, and (a) is you may have been entitled, but you lied in the process of."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2776.92,2788.95,"I think that's a fair reading. I mean, I would note that -- that (b) also sweeps more broadly than (a), because it includes things like obtaining a certificate of naturalization rather than the actual procurement of naturalization. I think --"
2016.16-309,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2788.95,2789.3,Mr. Parker --
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2789.3,2789.48,Yes.
2016.16-309,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2789.48,2800.625,The government -- the Congress doesn't have the power to denaturalize someone. At least so far we haven't let them do that as punishment for a criminal act.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2800.625,2802.575,Uh-huh.
2016.16-309,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2802.575,2831.165,"So how -- go back to Justice Kagan's question about footnote 4 in your brief, and your adversary's position that if it's a prerequisite to naturalization -- that's what this means -- that that's the only time Congress can deprive you of citizenship is when something actually would have barred you from getting it."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2831.165,2835.33,"Well, the only point that we were trying to make in that footnote --"
2016.16-309,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2835.33,2836.8,I know the point you were trying to make --
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2836.8,2836.94,Yes.
2016.16-309,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2836.94,2839.79,-- but answer the point he has made --
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2839.79,2840.25,Yes.
2016.16-309,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2840.46,2856.43,"-- and the point I have made, which is, if Congress doesn't have the power, ex post facto, to denaturalize you, we're giving them this power, should we be reading it narrowly or broadly?"
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2856.43,2864.81,"Well, I don't think that there is -- I think that it shouldn't necessarily be read broadly, but I think that any fair reading of the statute would include this."
2016.16-309,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2871.65,2872.28,May I --
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2872.28,2872.49,Yes.
2016.16-309,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2872.49,2877.77,"-- ask you before that, we've been concentrating on this statute."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2891.695,2892.2,Yes.
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2901.46,2903.48,I think Justice Sotomayor has a question pending.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2903.48,2903.93,Yes.
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2931.21,2934.57,Is -- is that the false statement for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit?
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2934.57,2934.81,Yes.
2016.16-309,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2936.375,2936.77,Okay.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2936.77,2950.405,"So that would be one. If it is not that, let's say it's a -- it's a violation of Section 1015, but it didn't involve oral testimony, and in -- in Kungys, this Court held that -- that 1101(f)(6) requires oral testimony."
2016.16-309,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3000.94,3001.35,Demonstrating --
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3001.35,3002.98,This is a whole -- I'm sorry?
2016.16-309,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3002.98,3004.095,Demonstrating what?
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3004.095,3005.7,Extenuating circumstances.
2016.16-309,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3014.51,3035.77,"In which of those processes has there ever been the kind of immaterial statement that the Chief Justice gave, lying about a traffic ticket, where there's been no injury to anybody and no claim of reckless driving, other than the speeding?"
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3035.77,3037.135,Uh-huh.
2016.16-309,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3037.135,3046.32,Where has the agency ever denied naturalization because of an -- an immaterial statement?
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3046.32,3050.13,I'm not aware of a particular case in which that has occurred.
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3085.67,3101.86,"Your interpretation on that interpretation, and on your interpretation of 1425, and the words that say in 1451, ""shall be deprived of his citizenship."" Given the seriousness of that, your interpretation would raise a pretty serious constitutional question, wouldn't it?"
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3101.86,3102.83,I don't think so.
2016.16-309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3102.83,3123.91,"It's not a serious constitutional question of whether an American citizen can be -- have his citizenship taken away because 40 years before, he did not deliberately put on paper what his nickname was or what -- or what his speeding record was 30 years before that, which was, in fact, totally immaterial."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3126.11,3134.32,"Well, I -- I don't think so, because Congress has, number one, specified that immaterial false statements are grounds for denying naturalization."
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3163.21,3172.22,"I don't think this is problem of -- of a constitutional statute, but it is certainly a problem of prosecutorial abuse."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3209.92,3210.39,"Well, I --"
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3210.39,3212.075,That strikes me as a serious problem.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3212.075,3215.11,"I certainly understand your concern, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.16-309,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3222.53,3222.88,But it --
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3222.88,3224.19,-- but there are a number of other --
2016.16-309,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3224.19,3231.35,It -- it seems to me that your argument is demeaning the -- the priceless value of citizenship.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3241.09,3241.4,I would --
2016.16-309,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3241.4,3247.62,"You're arguing for the government of the United States, talking about what citizenship is and ought to mean."
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3247.62,3248.4,Right.
2016.16-309,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3301.88,3303.21,"Before you finish, may --"
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3303.21,3303.44,Yes.
2016.16-309,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3303.44,3307.99,-- I ask you one other thing about the character of this statute.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3315.97,3316.4,Correct.
2016.16-309,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3316.4,3317.83,-- and a criminal.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3336.36,3336.745,May I?
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3336.745,3337.29,Sure.
2016.16-309,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3337.29,3348.54,"I -- we would say no, because we believe that the language ""illegally procured"" in the civil provision is effectively synonymous with procurement contrary to law."
2016.16-309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3357.55,3360.575,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Landau."
2016.16-309,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3360.575,3364.63,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to make three quick points, if I might."
2016.16-309,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3513.125,3513.52,Do you --
2016.16-309,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3513.52,3513.84,If you --
2016.16-309,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3513.84,3518.08,Do you read Wells as having a causal requirement -- as being a causal requirement.
2016.16-309,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3518.08,3521.61,I think it's -- it's -- it basically says for the purpose of --
2016.16-309,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3521.61,3526.59,If the speaker knows the falsity of what he says and intends to influence the institution.
2016.16-309,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3526.59,3527.05,Correct.
2016.16-309,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3576.43,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
