2002.00-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.718,"We'll hear argument next in Number 00-1471, The Kentucky Association of Health Plans versus Janie A. Miller."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,9.718,34.178,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.00-1471,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,90.408,94.237,"Now, I take it these laws have become fairly common--"
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,94.237,95.816,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.00-1471,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,95.816,100.077,"--around the country, so Kentucky's not alone in having such a law."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,100.077,101.938,"Kentucky has a relatively broad law, Your Honor."
2002.00-1471,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,106.532,106.97,Yes.
2002.00-1471,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,106.97,112.486,"Can... can Kentucky exclude certain specialties, like they say, we will not have chiropractors?"
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,115.776,116.639,No.
2002.00-1471,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,116.639,120.157,"In other words, they have to be open to various subspecialties?"
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,120.157,122.583,There are... there are different laws about that.
2002.00-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,164.78,172.496,But they... they do have something to say about who's going to be available as a doctor on the plan.
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,172.496,174.643,"They... they change the network, that's correct, Your Honor."
2002.00-1471,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,186.145,187.903,But isn't that a change in the policy?
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,191.883,192.484,"--No, Your Honor."
2002.00-1471,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,203.644,233.795,"Well, there's nothing in the policy term that is changed in... in the literal sense of a change in language, but it seems to me that it does mean that under a policy subject to a law like Kentucky's, the person who joins the HMO, in effect the person who obtains the insurance, has a far greater choice, in... in effect, in... in the expenditure of benefits under that policy than he otherwise has."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,246.822,248.616,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
2002.00-1471,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,254.344,272.068,"Well... well, sure, but I mean, the point of the statute and the point of the case is that providers do elect, and to the extent that they elect, the... the person subject to the policy has a choice that is a... a breadth of options that otherwise are not going to be available."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,272.068,273.285,--Potentially.
2002.00-1471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,273.809,275.39,Even... not potentially.
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,311.35,315.114,"--Not... the policy does not change in that way, Justice Scalia."
2002.00-1471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,316.652,321.7,"It's not rewritten, but doesn't the law have that effect, to... to effectively change the term of the policy?"
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,321.7,334.653,"--No... no, it does not, and the reason is, what the policy provides is, we will pay for care from participating physicians, from network providers, and that is still the policy."
2002.00-1471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,338.402,355.781,"Well, to use your term, physicians, before the law, is defined as those physicians whom we are willing to accept as part of the plan, and after the law, the definition of participating physician is any physician who wants to join the plan."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,355.781,360.983,"It... it has taken away the HMO's ability to select, that's correct--"
2002.00-1471,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,360.983,361.115,It's--
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,361.115,366.367,--but the definition of who... it is still limited to participating physicians who meet its own--
2002.00-1471,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,366.367,368.901,"--In... in your opening remarks, you said it doesn't change the bargain."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,375.364,382.254,"--But the... before or after the AWP law, the participant has no right to choose any particular provider."
2002.00-1471,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,387.304,387.569,Yes.
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,387.569,394.278,"After the AWP law, if a provider joins the network, the participant still has exactly the same right."
2002.00-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,396.251,398.393,But... but that... that really does not seem to make sense to me.
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,408.412,413.279,"Under that hypothetical, that's correct, Your Honor, you know, if that's--"
2002.00-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,413.279,414.435,What's hypothetical about it?
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,414.435,418.357,"--Well, we don't know the effect of the law on the networks--"
2002.00-1471,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,418.357,455.367,"Well, for instance, here, if it's chiropractic services, and let's assume the HMO did not previously include chiropractic physicians as providers, after this law, if a chiropractic physician in good standing were willing to come in under the HMO, then the HMO would have to take that physician, and then the... the patient would have a possibility, at least, of having paid services seeing a chiropractor that formerly would not have been available."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,455.367,459.159,"--That... that would be a significantly different law, Justice O'Connor, and for this reason."
2002.00-1471,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.508,480.645,"No, well, why... why is what I said different from what happens here?"
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,480.645,486.909,Because the terms of the... the network would already provide for chiropractors.
2002.00-1471,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,494.039,526.152,"Well, it... it's... maybe I'm under a misapprehension as to how the bill... I... I thought that the... one of the examples given in the brief was, a woman is being treated during the term of her pregnancy, she changes her employer, she wants the same doctor to... to treat her, and she is the one that can initiate the request to the HMO, please allow this doctor to treat me, and the doctor then says yes, I'm willing to be bound by the terms of the HMO, and... and she has that doctor."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,529.59,543.679,"But the... the bargain in that circumstance, if it... if it works out that way, she... she is able to stay with the doctor, but under... only if the doctor can get into the network, and is willing to meet the terms of the network."
2002.00-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,546.231,552.815,"Yes, but before the law, the network could have refused him categorically, even though he were willing to meet the terms."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,552.815,553.792,"That... that's correct, Your Honor."
2002.00-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,553.792,554.407,I... is--
2002.00-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,554.407,559.455,"--I hear you, I just don't see that... that you... you make much headway in saying that isn't a change."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,559.455,568.335,"Because the... the change is the legal right of the insured, which was never to any particular provider, and that's still true after the... the law."
2002.00-1471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,568.335,600.739,"I don't... you... you're really asserting that... that two insurance policies are exactly the same, their terms haven't changed, or their terms aren't different, where one says you can get your automobile fixed, we will pay to get your automobile fixed by these companies, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and the other one says, we will pay to get your automobile fixed by any company that is willing to do the job up to our standards, and... and you think those two insurance policies are saying exactly the same thing, that there's only a hypothetical difference between the two."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,600.739,615.58,"I... I think the difference between that hypothetical and... and mine is, the... the standard with or without the law is still, if the provider comes into the network, and you have the right to the network provider, and that's all."
2002.00-1471,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,615.58,617.618,"The thing I don't understand is, if your view is correct, why are you objecting to the law?"
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,617.618,622.254,We believe that the law interferes--
2002.00-1471,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,622.254,623.229,Doesn't have any impact on your business.
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,623.229,657.382,"--Yes, it couldn't, Your Honor, it precludes the plans from limited networks, and what that does, and this is the point made by the FTC staff, which has been writing States objecting to these laws, is it creates an uncertainty in the network, because the bargain that's been made, the noninsurance bargain between the HMO and the providers is, it's altered, although the policy is not, and... and suddenly, the providers who are in the network already, they... they signed up for a different deal, which was a limited network."
2002.00-1471,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,677.841,689.006,"But you're complaining about the... the increase in the number of providers, and it's that increase that is what might be desirable from the patient's standpoint."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,689.006,700.134,"--Well, we're really complaining about the uncertainty that's created, that the networks can no longer be selective, which has quality and cost implications, including fee implications."
2002.00-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,700.134,704.176,The... the any willing provider statutes have been around now for sometime.
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,738.993,743.714,"I... I can't tell you about the number of doctors, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.00-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,752.875,780.216,"If that's so, I mean, since... I'm not sure of the relevance of this, but I mean, if it turned out that this law or others like it drove up costs for no advantages, couldn't the Federal Government stop them by... under Medicare and Medicaid, wouldn't they have enough power, or would they, to simply write regulations such that they won't reimburse States for... if these circumstances were quite bad?"
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,780.216,784.716,"--I... I'm not sure they could do it in... in that avenue, through Medicare or Medicaid."
2002.00-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,790.506,792.417,That would require an act of Congress.
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,792.417,793.087,"--Yes, that's correct."
2002.00-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,793.087,795.464,I want to... you think they don't have the authority?
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,795.464,796.834,I... I don't think it would do the--
2002.00-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,796.834,800.269,"But anyway, as far as the harm is concerned, a) we don't know that there's any harm."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,800.269,800.981,--Right.
2002.00-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,800.981,808.752,"b) We don't know that the Government could deal with it in some other way, and so it's pretty much irrelevant to our decision, is that right?"
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,808.752,809.421,Right.
2002.00-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,815.369,817.151,Then we're back at Justice Scalia's question.
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,817.151,819.916,--The--
2002.00-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,819.916,826.786,Is the whole distinction that here the direct beneficiary is the provider?
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,842.906,846.033,"--That... that's certainly a major part of our distinction, Justice Ginsberg."
2002.00-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,846.033,853.57,"Is... is there anything more than that that... here, the patient is the indirect beneficiary of opening the door to the provider."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,864.924,874.312,"The... the patient, I would say, is a potential beneficiary, but without rehashing that, those two cases, a legal right was created for the insured."
2002.00-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,905.084,906.374,But that was not true in either--
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,906.374,906.498,--That's right.
2002.00-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,906.498,907.403,--Ward or--
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,907.403,913.147,"Or, as in Ward and Rush Prudential, must affect the legal rights of the insured."
2002.00-1471,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,939.32,960.291,"--Yes, but nobody... nobody can seriously deny, on the common sense criterion, that a person who gets HMO coverage... whether it's subject to a law like Kentucky's, is getting a far greater choice, potentially and, I presume, actually, since you're here, than a person who signs up for an HMO without the choice guaranteed."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,960.291,961.941,--But--
2002.00-1471,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,961.941,972.982,"In a common sense way, someone is getting a different kind of coverage, i.e., a breadth of choice under the medical coverage, that otherwise wouldn't be available."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,972.982,984.181,"--I... I think the common sense approach can be viewed by looking at this Court's decision in Royal Drug, and particularly if you look at the factual parallels with this case."
2002.00-1471,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1010.277,1029.31,"Well, considered by itself, if... if you simply narrow to the provider subcategory of pharmacists, I... I assume you're right, but if you look at the... at the broad category that is covered by this statute, there is one, I think, significant difference between this and the... and the limited to pharmacy coverage in Royal Drug."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1068.501,1073.586,"But under the Kentucky law, the patient has no right to choose the family doctor."
2002.00-1471,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1073.586,1079.472,"Well, the... the patient, in fact, is... is given in practical terms a breadth of option."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1111.196,1118.488,"I... I understand the point, Justice Souter, although the... the option and the... the preference don't match up perfectly."
2002.00-1471,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1125.467,1126.06,Absolutely... absolutely right.
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1126.06,1153.674,"But returning to the pharmacy, it's true that the aspirin is all the same wherever you go, but the... the agreements at issue in Royal Drug, besides giving the benefits of pure convenience, the ability to get the drug at the corner drug store, which is not nothing, also gave a very important financial advantage if you... if your pharmacy were participating, and--"
2002.00-1471,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1153.674,1157.953,"Yes, but another difference is, there... there is an any willing provider law here."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1162.346,1163.273,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.00-1471,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1163.273,1164.262,--with the... the Blue Cross.
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1164.262,1175.499,"That's correct, Your Honor, but the effect that the agreements that were being regulated in Blue... with Blue Shield and Royal Drug, the Court held were not part of insurance."
2002.00-1471,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1175.499,1176.027,Right.
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1176.027,1186.685,"And we have functionally the same type of agreements here, an agreement between the HMO and the pharmacy or other provider, and they also should not be part of insurance."
2002.00-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1204.145,1207.629,You mean just as a matter of convenience?
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1207.629,1209.979,"Besides convenience, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.00-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1251.65,1252.646,"It's an antitrust case, then."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1252.646,1254.299,"That's correct, Justice Breyer."
2002.00-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1254.299,1255.825,I would think maybe that makes a difference.
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1255.825,1261.122,"That's argued in the briefs that it... that it makes a difference, and we understand it's an antitrust case."
2002.00-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1381.54,1383.854,How would you characterize them?
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1383.854,1394.067,"I would characterize them as a law that gives a right to a provider and makes it difficult for HMO's and ERISA plans, but gives nothing of enforceable right to the insurers."
2002.00-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1394.067,1396.593,"Well, you... you don't like the label, insurance."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1402.006,1414.784,"It... it might be considered a health care law, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct, and in that case, it would not come within the Savings Clause, but it's a law that regulates the contracts between the providers and the HMO's."
2002.00-1471,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1462.934,1470.005,"--I... I recognize that we have the risk-spreading and the factors, and then we have the common sense test... we can all have tests floating around here."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1473.973,1479.617,"But it regulates only the noninsurance relationships, Justice Kennedy."
2002.00-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1491.066,1494.068,How do you... what about Metropolitan Life?
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1528.461,1530.889,"That's absolutely regulation of the business of insurance, and that's--"
2002.00-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1530.889,1531.019,All right.
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1536.79,1537.622,"--Well, what--"
2002.00-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1537.622,1538.998,How do we... how do you get out of that?
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1538.998,1539.152,--Sure.
2002.00-1471,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1579.098,1585.434,But you would not consider the... the benefit of having the selection among physicians as a benefit?
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1585.434,1590.731,"That's... in a colloquial sense, of course, if all these things fall into play."
2002.00-1471,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1590.731,1590.99,So you say it's purely financial.
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1594.331,1607.072,"If all these eventualities fall into place and you do have a broader choice, that's obviously, in a colloquial sense, of some benefit, but it's not what benefit means under, and insurance means under the Court's Savings Clause process."
2002.00-1471,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1607.072,1617.166,"Well, of course, the... the criteria, the way we refer to that criterion under the McCarran-Walter trio is... is not in terms strictly of legal right, though that will satisfy it."
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1633.543,1639.171,"That... that's correct, Justice Souter, it is phrased in terms of, integral to the relationship."
2002.00-1471,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1650.584,1655.188,No... no question that that certainly is a... an example of something that is integral.
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1655.188,1655.328,Right.
2002.00-1471,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1655.328,1672.987,But I would suppose that the difference in... in the kind of policy choices that we've been talking about would be regarded as a... by a potential HMO subscriber as... as integral to what he is purchasing when he signs up with... with one HMO rather than another.
2002.00-1471,0,39156,robert_n_eccles,,1672.987,1687.58,"Our point... in Pilot Life, the Court described the second factor as not satisfied because the, you know, the cause of action does not define the terms of the relationship, and we would say, you know, that has not... does not occur, either, under any willing provider."
2002.00-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1690.839,1692.025,"Very well, Mr. Eccles."
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,1694.241,1701.253,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.00-1471,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1734.01,1739.754,"But that's... they could just as well have been in something labeled, Health Code."
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,1745.859,1746.764,That's--
2002.00-1471,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1746.764,1758.385,"--but here, wouldn't it have been... suppose the law had been written to say that no doctor can join a closed plan."
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,1761.02,1767.443,"--If that law was not in the Insurance Code, first of all it would not be enforceable by Commissioner Miller."
2002.00-1471,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1797.439,1800.652,"Well, there would be the equivalent of disbarment."
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,1829.75,1857.594,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, but this Court has found that relevant to the inquiry, and the fact that this is a insurance law that is only directed toward those insurers regulated by the Commissioner of Insurance is very important, and it is relevant, and the fact that these statutes are in subtitle 17A of the Kentucky Insurance Code, which dictates the benefits to be included in a Kentucky health benefit, and the requirements for those insurers offering those plans."
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1872.177,1888.36,"I... I would... I would be sympathetic to your case... I... I keep bumping up against the Royal Drug case, where it seems to me all of the practical things you say about this case could have been said there."
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,1922.526,1923.622,"Your Honor, Royal--"
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.622,1925.23,How do you distinguish that from this case?
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,1925.23,1929.551,"--Your Honor, Royal Drug is both factually and legally distinguishable from the present case."
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.881,1931.729,I know it is factually.
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,1935.394,1940.249,"--Well, legally distinguishable is that you're... in Royal Drug you were looking at one Federal statute."
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1943.149,1943.739,"Well, now, wait."
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,1954.257,1955.176,"--No, Your Honor."
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1955.176,1955.772,--As it is here?
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,1955.772,1956.968,I believe the--
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.968,1960.929,"Unless you want us to abandon that, then... then what you've just said doesn't make any sense."
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,1960.929,1961.401,"--No, Your Honor."
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1972.348,1974.464,So you say the same analysis does not apply.
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,1983.152,1989.24,"--No, Your Honor, they are relevant, as this Court has said, but they are not required, and in this Court--"
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1989.24,1991.228,--They are relevant but not required?
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,1991.228,2005.202,"--In this, in Metropolitan Life this Court came up with a... a broader test than the common sense test, and that test is tested by the McCarran-Ferguson factors that were developed in Royal Drug--"
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.202,2005.608,I see.
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,2005.608,2007.971,--but they are not required.
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2010.21,2015.531,So the very... the very factor that qualifies as... the very same factor.
2002.00-1471,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2035.074,2037.708,Vice versa.
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,2037.708,2040.236,"In an ERISA case, this Court starts with--"
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2040.236,2041.093,Vice versa means the same.
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,2041.093,2046.543,"--the common sense test, and under the common sense test this Court looks at whether or not--"
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2046.543,2049.241,"No, but just answer yes or no to what I just said."
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,2051.452,2054.33,--Would you please restate your question?
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2057.136,2068.302,"Let's take the very same factor, like the exclusion of certain pharmacies, which... which was the case in Royal Drug."
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,2092.42,2097.123,The common sense test controls in ERISA preemption analysis.
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2097.123,2100.734,So your answer to my question is yes or no?
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,2100.734,2107.841,"In your analysis is there a State law that requires, or is it the Royal Drug--"
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2107.841,2110.173,"Well, in the ERISA case there is, in the antitrust case there isn't."
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,2113.453,2113.743,--Right.
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.743,2125.356,"But... but they both focus on the very same factor, the provision of... the ability of the insured to select pharmacists."
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,2143.267,2147.896,Yes.
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2147.896,2148.701,Okay.
2002.00-1471,1,22553,elizabeth_a_johnson,,2149.978,2150.166,Yes.
2002.00-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2150.166,2151.157,--That's the right answer.
2002.00-1471,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2623.093,2637.389,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.00-1471,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2637.389,2643.961,"Mr. Feldman, what would be an example of a measure which did spread the risk, as that term was referred to in Royal Drug?"
2002.00-1471,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2643.961,2665.479,"--Well, I think one example would in Metropolitan Life against Massachusetts, certainly I think everybody... I understand everybody here to agree that a law that required an insurance policy to include insurance against a particular risk would spread the risk, but I think what... in this case also comes right... it spreads the risk at least for purposes of... of ERISA for this reason."
2002.00-1471,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2680.507,2693.615,"So, you're... you're saying the first McCarran-Ferguson factor includes a provision that determines the way the insurer manages the risk, even though it may not affect the risk as between the insurer and the insured."
2002.00-1471,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2693.615,2695.807,I think it does... not quite.
2002.00-1471,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2700.354,2701.566,"No, but I thought that was the argument you were making right then and there."
2002.00-1471,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2701.566,2715.757,"--It's a condition on the spreading of risk, or a condition on the performance of the insurance contract, and in the Fabe case, which was a McCarran-Ferguson Act case, but involved a different provision of the McCarran-Ferguson Act than at issue in Royal Drug and the Pireno case that followed it--"
2002.00-1471,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2715.757,2719.059,"Well, how, as a practical matter, does it affect the risk here?"
2002.00-1471,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2732.123,2738.838,--It would... I guess... for you... it certainly could be... I think semantically it could be said to just increase the risk in just that way.
2002.00-1471,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2752.723,2753.671,That's what... that was going to be my second question.
2002.00-1471,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2755.205,2764.134,"--Right, and here the risk-spreading is so long... we're going to spread this... such-and-such a risk, but so long as you go to any willing provider, and that's a different condition."
2002.00-1471,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2764.134,2764.331,But it doesn't spread the risk.
2002.00-1471,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2778.219,2779.042,Right.
2002.00-1471,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2779.042,2782.374,It's a regulation of the goods or services that an insurer provides.
2002.00-1471,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2782.374,2783.005,That... that's correct.
2002.00-1471,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2783.005,2783.737,"Now, if you're going to--"
2002.00-1471,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2783.737,2787.041,"--And the risk is a condition, is a health condition of the patient that will be covered."
2002.00-1471,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2787.041,2791.63,"Yes, but... but it's really exactly the same as what this Court faced in Fabe, where--"
2002.00-1471,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2791.63,2793.098,What's the name of the case?
2002.00-1471,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2793.098,2795.112,--Department of Treasury against Fabe.
2002.00-1471,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2819.009,2822.131,What... what if the risk were tied... the risk is that the patient becomes ill and needs--
2002.00-1471,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2822.131,2822.268,Yes.
2002.00-1471,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2822.268,2823.23,"--medical care, isn't it?"
2002.00-1471,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2823.23,2824.806,"Yes, and this is a condition on that, but I don't--"
2002.00-1471,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2824.806,2830.26,"So... so how... how does this measure spread the risk, or why does it not spread the risk?"
2002.00-1471,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2830.26,2836.71,"--It... it operates as a condition on the spreading of risk, because without this law, there--"
2002.00-1471,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2836.71,2836.858,Well--
2002.00-1471,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2836.858,2843.192,--the risk will... it's... the insurance policy says we... you... we will spread this risk among all our insurers.
2002.00-1471,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2850.731,2857.24,"--Which is to say, it doesn't spread the risk, so if the other case means you have to have a risk, then you lose."
2002.00-1471,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2857.24,2857.957,"Right, but the Court--"
2002.00-1471,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2857.957,2887.019,"But it doesn't... I thought that that other case has... since it involves the provision by an insurer of goods and services, and a regulation of how, when the risk eventuates, it is pretty similar, and so the difference is, what they say in footnote 18, I guess, which is probably what was going on here, which is that we're interpreting not the McCarran Act's effort to allow States to regulate insurance."
2002.00-1471,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2899.801,2908.97,"--Right, and... that is true, and the Court repeated that in Royal Drug, and in Pireno, and in Fabe, in all of those McCarran-Ferguson Act cases it made exactly that point, and it--"
2002.00-1471,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2908.97,2912.109,"But is that the key distinction, or is there another one, too?"
2002.00-1471,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2912.109,2915.291,"--Well, I think that's the most important one, but there's a number that are related."
2002.00-1471,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2944.528,2955.447,"This is all very sophisticated, but I... it just seems to me that what constitutes the... insurance in one... in one situation ought to constitute insurance in another, and it--"
2002.00-1471,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2955.447,2955.92,--It's just common sense.
2002.00-1471,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2955.92,2957.023,--it's just common sense.
2002.00-1471,3,39156,robert_n_eccles,,3221.174,3223.679,"I'll address four points, if I may."
