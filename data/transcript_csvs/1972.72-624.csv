1972.72-624,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,43.777,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-624, United States against Pennsylvania Industrial Chemical Corporation."
1972.72-624,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,47.406,50.993,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-624,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,114.153,119.241,Mr. Reynolds what was the date of the alleged offense here charged?
1972.72-624,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,119.241,122.416,The date were -- there were two dates.
1972.72-624,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,126.194,136.669,"Do you know why though why the complaint, I think it was by complaint here, didn’t zero in on a post December date?"
1972.72-624,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,136.669,138.449,"No, Your Honor, I don’t know why they --"
1972.72-624,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,138.449,139.999,Would it simplify the case somewhat --
1972.72-624,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,139.999,142.663,It certainly would’ve made a much different --
1972.72-624,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,142.663,147.121,I suppose they weren’t anybody canoeing on the Monongahela in December?
1972.72-624,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,147.121,161.425,"Well, at least nobody apparently was sampling the discharges on the Monongahela after that date, but the date of the offenses though were August 7 and August 19, 1970."
1972.72-624,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,330.915,344.049,You’re suggesting that the navigable water are irrelevant whether these discharges would mean --- would passed or must under existing regulation Act or under the State Act?
1972.72-624,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,344.049,348.844,I’m suggesting that that is irrelevant for purposes of this case.
1972.72-624,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,356.633,360.853,With the state water quality standards approved by the federal authority?
1972.72-624,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,360.853,368.108,The 1967 state quality standards for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania had been approved.
1972.72-624,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,368.805,380.738,"Assume for the moment that those regulations approved by the federal authorities, these discharges could continue to be made?"
1972.72-624,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,380.738,381.99,Assume that I still think --
1972.72-624,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,381.99,389.702,Wouldn’t that have some significance for whether or not a criminal prosecution under another Act to go forward for making these very discharges?
1972.72-624,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,389.702,400.176,"It would have significance, Your Honor, to the extent that the plant sought permission from the federal government also to discharge."
1972.72-624,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,412.679,419.979,"So for this prosecution we’re not getting a permit, not whether or not you could get one if you apply?"
1972.72-624,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,419.979,427.449,"For discharging without getting a permit, without getting a federal permit, or without getting any permission from the federal government."
1972.72-624,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,447.056,455.005,"If that sort of thing were relevant if the Government lose its case here since they did make an offer of proof, wouldn’t they?"
1972.72-624,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,460.108,471.404,"That’s right, but it’s irrelevant because they never, in any event, they never presented that certification, even if they did have it to the federal government, and therefore, sought a federal permit."
1972.72-624,1,27063,harold_gondelman,,1700.07,1703.627,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-624,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3731.613,3737.5,Just one or two points Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.72-624,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3738.45,3751.094,You don’t refer in your briefs to the all well-established federal law of public nuisance in navigable streams.
1972.72-624,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3753.342,3762.466,"No, Your Honor, that -- this case was exclusively under the statute and the public nuisance federal law was not involved in this particular case."
1972.72-624,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3762.466,3771.125,"Conceivably, you might have been able to get an injunction under the law of nuisance that Mr. Justice Douglas was suggesting?"
1972.72-624,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3771.125,3772.28,"Conceivably, I think that --"
1972.72-624,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3772.28,3773.792,But that couldn’t be a criminal prosecution?
1972.72-624,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3773.792,3790.31,"-- Illinois and the City of Milwaukee I believe this Court indicated that under the -- there is a federal law of nuisance which conceivably would be available, but this was an action brought under the federal statute and that was not involved."
1972.72-624,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3919.932,3920.588,Thank you gentlemen.
