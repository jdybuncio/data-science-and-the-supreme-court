1981.80-1074,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.956,We will hear arguments next in Velde against National Black Police Association.
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,62.823,64.056,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1981.80-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,203.414,210.353,"Mr. Geller, are you also going to address the Simon versus Eastern Kentucky standing problem?"
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,210.353,231.25,"We have not raised standing as a separate issue in this case, although we do think that the failure of these plaintiffs to show how the defendant's actions violated their constitutional rights shows that the complaint in this case does not allege violation of the due process clause, and we have raised that question."
1981.80-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,235.068,245.01,"Well, but standing is an Article 3 requirement in many cases, is it not?"
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,245.01,245.726,"Yes, yes, it is."
1981.80-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,245.726,251.08,A jurisdictional thing which both counsel and the court are obliged to notice--
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,251.08,251.997,Yes.
1981.80-1074,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,259.184,265.756,"--All three judges below felt there was sufficient standing here on the motion to dismiss, I take it."
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,265.756,272.827,"Well, we said that, I think, in our petition, but on further reading of the case, I am not sure that is correct."
1981.80-1074,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,310.218,312.485,So you are... off the statement in your brief then.
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,312.485,337.886,"--Yes, but as I reread the court of appeals opinion just the other day, it seems quite clear that Judge Tam is saying that as to the claimant, the plaintiffs now tell the court they are raising, which has nothing at all to do with the discrimination allegedly practiced by the grantees, but only focuses on the federal government's failure to enforce the laws, he says that is essentially a citizen standing suit, and he does not agree that these plaintiffs have standing."
1981.80-1074,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,344.107,349.093,"Well, do you agree with him or not?"
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,349.093,355.831,We think that the case should be analyzed in terms of whether the complaint states a cause of action under the Fifth Amendment.
1981.80-1074,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,360.485,375.245,"Well, if the reason doesn't state a cause of action, there are no allegations of injury flowing from allegedly unconstitutional action, it is a standing question, isn't it?"
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,375.245,380.23,--It really depends upon how the Court analyzes the duties under the Fifth Amendment in this area.
1981.80-1074,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,382.932,387.834,"Well, if it can be, and may just as well, don't you have to state it that way?"
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,387.834,389.602,"--Well, I would like--"
1981.80-1074,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,389.602,390.552,If it is a jurisdictional question?
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,393.904,414.734,"--I think, as Justice Rehnquist was alluding to, that if there is no standing here, then the Court does not have jurisdiction under Article 3 of the Constitution, because there is no case or controversy, and we have cited the relevant cases in the portion of our brief, and made, I think, the relevant arguments that would be addressed in a standing issue, but we have placed it in the section of our brief that is addressed to whether the complaint states a cause of action."
1981.80-1074,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,421.64,424.425,And hence no standing?
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,424.425,432.662,"And hence no standing, because the actions of these defendants did not cause any harm to these plaintiffs--"
1981.80-1074,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,432.662,434.814,No injury in fact.
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,434.814,436.666,--Right.
1981.80-1074,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.645,644.981,"What was the cause of action that was attempted to be stated, a constitutional tort or complaint?"
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,644.981,651.204,"Well, the complaint raised a number of causes of action under Section 1981, under executive orders."
1981.80-1074,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,665.312,673.384,Has the government ever suggested that there isn't a private cause of action in the context of this case?
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,673.384,690.262,"Yes, the argument that was pushed in the court of appeals, although the court of appeals decision does not address it at all, is that using the analysis the court later adopted in Carlson against Green, that there should not be a cause of action implied here under the Fifth Amendment."
1981.80-1074,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,700.368,702.653,Why do you think that is prior?
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,702.653,703.403,--Excuse me?
1981.80-1074,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,703.403,707.438,"If there is no private cause of action, you never get to the merits."
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,708.89,717.83,"Well, but this Court in Davis against Passman has held that under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment there is an implied--"
1981.80-1074,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,717.83,726.935,"Yes, but not in the... there you don't have the administrative detail, the administrative enforcement scheme."
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,726.935,728.537,"--No, I understand, and there is an argument in--"
1981.80-1074,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.537,733.355,Suppose that was a valid argument.
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,742.461,743.963,"--Well, I understand that."
1981.80-1074,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,748.382,749.284,Why?
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,749.284,752.586,In this case we think there is a very easy answer to that question.
1981.80-1074,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,752.586,754.386,"I know you would like it answered, but--"
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,754.386,754.969,Well--
1981.80-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,754.969,764.876,"--That is like saying, before you decide whether you can sue in this Court, we will decide the merits of your lawsuit."
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,764.876,771.63,"--No, I think cases like Bivens and Carlson against Green proceeded on the assumption that there had been a constitutional violation."
1981.80-1074,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,799.065,819.461,"Well, certainly that issue about implied cause of action, I would take it... I would classify as a non constitutional question, and you are just telling us that we have to reach a constitutional issue, although there very well may be a non constitutional way of disposing of the case."
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,819.461,824.598,We think the court of appeals made a number of errors in its opinion.
1981.80-1074,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,835.306,837.54,And you think that you can make us reach a constitutional issue.
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,837.54,844.178,"--I would be, I think, on behalf of the defendants, they would be delighted if this Court were to reverse on the ground that there is no Bivens action here."
1981.80-1074,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,844.178,847.463,What if the Court held there is no case or controversy?
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,849.213,850.932,I think that would be the end of this case as well.
1981.80-1074,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,850.932,853.867,"You don't reach Bivens, you don't reach any other questions."
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,853.867,854.934,That's correct.
1981.80-1074,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,854.934,859.688,And you wouldn't reach Bivens if you said there wasn't a private cause of action at all.
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,863.923,872.429,"I think, though, that in light of this Court's decision in cases like Carlson against Green, Davis against Passman, it is a more difficult analysis."
1981.80-1074,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,938.807,973.128,"Mr. Geller, I am not sure, based on what has been said, that the Court will find that we reach the merits, but assuming that the Court were to do so, do you think that the complaint that was filed, the amended complaint can be read to incorporate allegations of action by at least some of the defendants that are not discretionary type actions, which poses additional problems, of course, for the Court?"
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,973.128,977.73,"No, I don't think it can, for a number of reasons, Justice O'Connor."
1981.80-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1021.042,1022.359,Where are you reading from?
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1022.359,1029.731,"--I am reading from the joint appendix, where the complaint is reprinted, starting on Page 13."
1981.80-1074,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1061.084,1067.79,"How about all those statements on Page 20, and so forth?"
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1067.79,1069.24,"--Well, on Pages--"
1981.80-1074,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1069.24,1073.125,Like a policy of not conducting any pre award compliance--
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1073.125,1107.331,"--I understand that there are a lot of allegations in the complaint about what collectively the defendants did, but I am trying to focus on what the plaintiffs have described as their constitutional harm, and on Pages 14 and 15 of the complaint, where each of the plaintiffs is identified, and each of the plaintiffs specifically states how he or she was harmed, in every single instance the only harm that is identified is the refusal to terminate LEAA funding, and I might add that both the majority and the dissent in the court of appeals construed the complaint in that fashion."
1981.80-1074,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1131.913,1133.982,--It also said willful and malicious.
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1133.982,1136.167,--I understand that that is what they--
1981.80-1074,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1136.167,1136.984,That was a quote.
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1136.984,1140.502,--That is how the plaintiffs have described the defendant's action.
1981.80-1074,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1140.502,1141.388,That is what they allege.
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1141.388,1169.421,"That is what they allege, but the only constitutional action that the defendants are alleged to have taken here that caused constitutional harm was the failure to terminate funding, and Judge Tam on Page 17A agrees with that description, and therefore we think that since that is clearly a discretionary determination under the statute, that there is no reason for this Court to wade through the rest of the plaintiff's prolix complaint to see what other grievances they have stated."
1981.80-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1173.859,1212.684,"If in fact the case were to go off on standing, and the Court were to decide that even assuming that everything was true in plaintiff's complaint there was nothing but the most speculative sort of benefit that would result to them from any judicial relief that could be granted, wouldn't that also avoid going through the prolix allegations of the complaint?"
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1212.684,1218.169,"I think it would, but I think it is important even for the purposes of determining whether the plaintiffs have standing."
1981.80-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1355.509,1356.909,Was there a trial?
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1356.909,1360.145,"There was not a trial, but there were summary judgment motions."
1981.80-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1360.145,1369.768,"Well, but on summary judgment motions all the well pleaded allegations are treated favorably to the plaintiffs, are they not?"
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1369.768,1371.718,I think that would be the case on a motion to dismiss.
1981.80-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1377.788,1388.663,"But qualified immunity always involves state of mind, and that is something that a defendant can't negate."
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1388.663,1399.852,"Well, that was one of the issues raised in Butz against Economou as an example of why absolute immunity was needed as a protection against lawsuits designed to intimidate or harass."
1981.80-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1426.15,1428.702,By repealing the federal rules.
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1428.702,1434.139,"Well, I am reading from the Court's opinion, and my point is that that was a basic assumption."
1981.80-1074,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1434.139,1435.358,He agrees with your reading.
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1435.358,1437.208,I gather as much.
1981.80-1074,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1437.208,1440.727,Is this qualified immunity raised?
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1440.727,1441.645,"Yes, it was."
1981.80-1074,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1444.131,1448.883,"Well, if it goes back, couldn't it be raised again?"
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1456.272,1468.213,"Well, there were... voluminous evidence was submitted in this case both by the plaintiffs and by the defendants, although the district court did not dismiss this case on summary judgment grounds."
1981.80-1074,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1475.433,1477.333,Did it rule on qualified immunity?
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1478.385,1480.085,--It was dismissed on immunity grounds.
1981.80-1074,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1491.726,1494.445,Did the court of appeals rule on the qualified immunity point?
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1494.445,1496.096,--The court of appeals did not.
1981.80-1074,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1496.096,1497.079,Did not.
1981.80-1074,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1513.855,1538.487,"I think that... I think even under the good faith aspect qualified immunity should have been accorded here, but certainly if the only inquiry was whether the law was clearly established, where the defendants violated some clearly established rule of law, I think it is quite clear in this case that the motion for summary judgment based on those grounds should have been granted since I don't think even today it is clear that what the defendants did here violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights."
1981.80-1074,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1623.273,1625.809,Mr. Larson.
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,1625.809,1636.83,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, initially I will respond to the government's characterization of several of the facts in this case."
1981.80-1074,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1779.352,1780.069,Mr. Larson--
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,1780.069,1783.704,"As we point out also, there was no discovery in this case whatsoever."
1981.80-1074,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1784.837,1785.654,--Just affidavits?
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,1785.654,1786.656,Just affidavits.
1981.80-1074,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1797.445,1829.8,"Wouldn't a necessary element of your case to be pleaded and proved be that the plaintiffs' grievances be redressed if the action you sought to have taken by the court were taken, that is, that if funding were cut off, the police departments which you claim were discriminating would change their discriminatory policies?"
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,1829.8,1831.302,"Well, let me respond to that."
1981.80-1074,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1892.073,1893.775,Did you plead it in your complaint?
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,1893.775,1897.594,"Yes, with regard to injury, economic injury, on--"
1981.80-1074,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1897.594,1903.664,With regard to the substantial probability that the departments would change their policy?
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,1903.664,1908.052,"--It is generally in the complaint, yes."
1981.80-1074,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1981.348,1989.385,"Well, that is fine as to New Orleans, but you are asking for relief against a great number of--"
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,1989.385,2003.259,"Well, as this Court held only last week in Watt v. Energy Action unanimously per Justice O'Connor, only one plaintiff need have standing in order to maintain the action that we maintain."
1981.80-1074,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2035.58,2057.143,"--Well, I would agree with you that you can't say that they won't, but the fact that one police department has responded to the fund cutoff certainly doesn't prove that every police department that would be involved in this case would react the same way."
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2057.143,2065.383,"I certainly think we should have an opportunity on discovery to prove that, as Judge Tam held in his separate opinion in the court of appeals."
1981.80-1074,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2065.383,2067.485,"If you pleaded it, certainly."
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2067.485,2078.276,"Let's point out that before this complaint was filed, LEAA petitioners, these government officials never, never initiated fund termination proceedings."
1981.80-1074,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2124.522,2130.242,Even if LEAA was supplying only one half percent of their budget?
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2130.242,2138.914,The assistance here is considered quite substantial by the grantee police departments.
1981.80-1074,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2150.655,2156.642,"Well, but certainly it isn't the same in every case, is it?"
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2165.498,2175.886,"It is a grant in aid program, and of course one of the conditions of this grant in aid program is that the grantee comply with LEAA regulations and with the non discrimination requirement."
1981.80-1074,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2175.886,2178.688,"Well, what rights of your clients are you claiming?"
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2178.688,2180.424,We are claiming--
1981.80-1074,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.424,2183.509,Not to be discriminated against by the LEAA officials?
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2183.509,2184.242,"--Oh, absolutely."
1981.80-1074,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.702,2201.971,The equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment?
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2201.971,2202.921,"Component of the Fifth Amendment, yes."
1981.80-1074,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.921,2205.89,So it is a constitutional Bivens sort of thing you are asserting?
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2205.89,2206.992,"Yes, it is, absolutely."
1981.80-1074,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2206.992,2214.095,Are you also claiming that you have a right under the statute?
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2214.095,2223.151,"Yes, we are, but that is an issue which was not presented or has not been presented by the government in its cert petition and it is not at issue in this case."
1981.80-1074,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.151,2233.892,"Did the government claim that you had no... that in the circumstances of this case, there shouldn't be an implied constitutional cause of action?"
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2233.892,2240.929,"That issue has never been raised prior to the supplemental brief in the court of appeals, the first time."
1981.80-1074,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.929,2242.431,"Yes, before judgment there?"
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2242.431,2243.981,"Before judgment, yes."
1981.80-1074,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2243.981,2247.833,But it wasn't adverted to by the court of appeals?
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2247.833,2248.619,"It was not, no."
1981.80-1074,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2259.574,2271.684,"Well, I know they don't, but didn't the Congress at one point make more detailed provisions for administrative review and cutoff?"
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2271.684,2273.75,In 1976.
1981.80-1074,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2273.75,2275.919,Because it was dissatisfied with what had been happening?
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2275.919,2276.286,Yes.
1981.80-1074,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2279.888,2280.54,"Yes, yes."
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2280.54,2291.346,There was tremendous frustration in Congress with the absolute refusal by petitioners to enforce the mandate that Congress had imposed on officials--
1981.80-1074,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2291.346,2299.701,"And so they provided a more... they put more obligations, more details, procedures?"
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2299.701,2312.059,"--As one Member of Congress stated, even if LEAA continues to do nothing, we at least have added additional triggers that will initiate and require the fund cutoff that Congress had imposed in 1973."
1981.80-1074,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2312.059,2313.711,Let me try this hypothetical on you.
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2347.965,2349.317,There may be a claim.
1981.80-1074,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2355.987,2362.808,"Well, no matter how good it is, is it good enough to sustain... to survive summary judgment?"
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2362.808,2370.414,"On those allegations, I am not sure, but where race and sex have been alleged, Mr. Chief Justice, I think the court--"
1981.80-1074,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2370.414,2372.297,"Well, what is the difference that you see here?"
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2377.067,2381.871,"--But the difference is the nature of the invidious discrimination, the race and sex discrimination."
1981.80-1074,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2381.871,2387.775,"But it is denial of equal protection, isn't it, if they are sending it all south?"
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2391.327,2395.062,But certainly subject to a different standard of review under this Court's decisions.
1981.80-1074,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2395.062,2401.149,"But you are not claiming that the government officials invidiously discriminated, are you?"
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2411.823,2444.144,"We are claiming that they exceeded their statutory powers, the statutory powers set out in Section 518(c), which make the initiation of fund termination procedures non discretionary, and that by their refusal to cut off funds or have any civil rights enforcement program coupled with their affirmative, continuous funding of police departments that they knew to be discriminatory, yes, these petitioners have invidiously discriminated against the respondents in this case."
1981.80-1074,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2446.477,2448.96,"Mr. Larson, could I ask you a question?"
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2466.105,2469.141,"I know that legislative history fairly well, Justice Blackmun."
1981.80-1074,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2472.626,2475.011,"No, the earlier."
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2485.019,2491.689,"No, I can't recall what it says right now."
1981.80-1074,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2563.9,2567.368,This would apply to some men who have been out of government for quite a while.
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2567.368,2570.922,"--They are not in government any more, but as this Court has--"
1981.80-1074,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2570.922,2573.306,But they are still liable to the $100 million?
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2573.306,2585.515,"--As this Court has repeatedly pointed out, awards of punitive damages pose a very strong deterrent effect to unconstitutional action by government officials, and we believe particularly--"
1981.80-1074,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2585.515,2586.215,So you don't care.
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2590.033,2590.783,"--Yes, it is."
1981.80-1074,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2590.783,2591.55,Thank you.
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2591.55,2592.916,They violated the Constitution.
1981.80-1074,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2592.916,2593.65,I just wanted your position.
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2593.65,2598.304,"They did so wilfully and maliciously in our view, and we are entitled to--"
1981.80-1074,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2598.304,2602.489,You said that in one phrase at one place in the complaint.
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2603.139,2609.559,--I think when you read the entire complaint... I don't think we have to say wilful and malicious in every paragraph.
1981.80-1074,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2615.111,2615.377,You said it once.
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2615.377,2617.396,"Well, we did say it at least twice."
1981.80-1074,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2617.396,2620.179,"Well, twice."
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2622.998,2624.7,We don't have to say it in every paragraph.
1981.80-1074,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2630.787,2633.656,"Don't lecture me on the rules of pleading, please."
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2642.361,2655.252,"--Because of our two different claims on standing, we believe that we are entitled to survive a motion to dismiss as the court of appeals held below on either theory of standing."
1981.80-1074,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2808.752,2824.312,"The LEAA determines there has been a non compliance, and you say thereupon there was triggered the duty to institute proceedings to terminate?"
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2824.312,2825.078,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1981.80-1074,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2825.078,2830.666,"And you asked them to do that, and they say no, or they don't act, period."
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2830.666,2834.868,"Well, after we filed the motion for preliminary injunction with regard to Philadelphia, they did so."
1981.80-1074,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.868,2845.207,"Yes, but I am just wondering, is there judicial review of this action?"
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2849.059,2845.207,"No, there is not."
1981.80-1074,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2849.894,2857.314,"I know there is no particular provision for it, but wouldn't there be judicial review of it in the district court on an arbitrary and capricious standard?"
1981.80-1074,1,22659,e_richard_larson,,2857.314,2859.433,"No, not for an individual claimant."
1981.80-1074,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3074.39,3075.69,Very well.
1981.80-1074,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3078.642,3081.878,"Just a few things, Mr Chief Justice."
1981.80-1074,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3099.106,3100.541,In the district court?
1981.80-1074,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3100.541,3102.041,They brought it in the district court.
1981.80-1074,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.211,3113.715,How do you get into court in such a case?
1981.80-1074,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3113.715,3116.517,The Administrative Procedure Act was the cause of action.
1981.80-1074,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3116.517,3118.519,"But it doesn't give jurisdiction, does it?"
1981.80-1074,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3118.519,3121.821,"No, jurisdiction would be under 28 USC 1331."
1981.80-1074,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3247.969,3248.788,"Thank you, gentlemen."
