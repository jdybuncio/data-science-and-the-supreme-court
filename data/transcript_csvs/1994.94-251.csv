1994.94-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.266,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-251, the United States v. Juan Paul Robertson."
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,10.498,15.281,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,123.863,126.795,I think it's we rather than you who brought the case here.
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,126.795,130.085,"Well, I stand corrected, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-251,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,260.682,269.496,"Mr. Estrada, in your view, is there any business enterprise in America that wouldn't be covered by RICO?"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,270.658,283.485,"--As a factual matter, Justice O'Connor, I cannot think of any business in the country that could not be covered by RICO, given that what is at issue is the full constitutional authority of Congress."
1994.94-251,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,312.806,321.242,How do you distinguish the situation here from the situation which was argued recently here in the Lopez case?
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,321.242,330.047,"Well, this case is significantly different from Lopez."
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.733,390.255,"Well, this case, I mean, Lopez involved a... this case involves a commercial enterprise--"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,390.255,391.226,"Well, that's right."
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.226,391.717,--doesn't it?
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,393.968,394.9,"Well, the--"
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,394.9,396.93,Lopez didn't involve a commercial enterprise at all.
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,398.453,401.364,"--Well, that is true, Justice Scalia."
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,406.978,411.499,Whether it's commerce doesn't make any difference for purposes of the Commerce Clause?
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,411.499,416.863,"--It does make a difference for purposes of the Commerce Clause, Justice Scalia."
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,429.712,435.144,The Necessary and Proper Clause expands the Commerce Clause to cover things that the Commerce Clause wouldn't otherwise cover?
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,435.144,435.915,"--In effect, yes--"
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,435.915,436.895,That's wonderful.
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,436.895,438.667,"--Justice Scalia, but--"
1994.94-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,438.667,444.932,When was the last time since McCulloch v. Maryland that we held to that effect?
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,444.932,458.74,"--Oh, Mr. Justice Rehnquist... I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice, I think my reading of Wickard v. Filburn would be to that effect."
1994.94-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,458.74,462.884,That case would you say relied on the Necessary and Proper Clause?
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,462.884,465.135,That is my recollection.
1994.94-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,487.899,493.082,I don't think Gibbons v. Ogden relied on the Necessary and Proper Clause the way McCulloch did.
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,496.705,526.214,"--That's right, although in later cases in the 1940's this Court expressed the view that... the broad view that Mr. Chief Justice Marshall had expounded in the Ogden case was in fact merely an exposition, even though he didn't himself say so, of the power of Congress because of the combination of the Necessary and Proper Clause--"
1994.94-251,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,526.214,534.081,"In the Darby case, which was the Fair Labor Standards Act, and in the Perez case, which was loan-sharking--"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,534.081,534.76,--Mm-hmm.
1994.94-251,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,534.76,542.306,"--I don't think we used the Necessary and Proper Clause, although I'll refresh my recollection on that to make sure."
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,542.306,553.673,"My understanding, Justice Kennedy, is that there are cases in the 1940's, and I'm fairly sure of it, because understand that we have read them recently, xx just can't cite you one."
1994.94-251,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,556.854,561.687,"But you're not relying on Necessary and Proper here, are you, Mr. Estrada?"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,561.687,570.934,"Well, in effect... I will answer that question in two steps, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-251,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,583.062,593.968,Doesn't our recent decision in the Allied Bruce case have some relevance to this problem of what affects commerce?
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,593.968,637.977,"Yes, I... but the only reason that it is necessary to point to the Necessary and Proper Clause, Justice Ginsburg, is that the Commerce Clause in itself, as Justice Scalia pointed out, authorizes Congress to regulate only commerce, and the so-called affectation doctrine that allows Congress to deal with other matters that are not in themselves commerce, but they have an effect on commerce, is usually justified by reference to the Necessary and Proper Clause even though the cases talk about it as the commerce power."
1994.94-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,655.2,657.301,"Well, you say the power is justified."
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,659.492,677.463,By... this Court's cases have made reference in explaining why Congress has been held to have authority to reach matters that are not in themselves commerce to the Necessary and Proper Clause.
1994.94-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,677.463,681.096,These are the cases that you can't remember from the thirties and forties?
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,681.096,742.837,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but in fact, and the Court has explained on occasion, that even though the cases speak of Congress' power to reach anything that affects commerce, some of the more cases... some of the Court's cases have been more specific, and have pointed out that Congress under the Commerce Clause can reach only commerce in itself, but that under the Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress can then reach other things that are not in themselves commerce, but that affect commerce, and this Court's cases dealing with whether something affects commerce and saying that Congress has power to reach those matters are usually... are logically traceable to reasoning based ultimately on the Necessary and Proper Clause."
1994.94-251,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,856.951,864.677,"Now, does the Sherman Antitrust Act have a lesser scope of coverage?"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,864.677,865.366,No.
1994.94-251,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,875.013,878.214,"But the language in each is somewhat different, is it not?"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,878.214,879.115,--That is right.
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,919.582,921.962,Do I have to agree with that to agree with the Government in this case?
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,924.283,926.607,"Yes, I do know, Justice Scalia."
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,947.07,950.083,"The Sherman Act doesn't use ""affecting interstate commerce"" at all, does it?"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,950.083,951.002,"--No, it does not."
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.764,953.744,It's language is
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,955.887,961.419,"--That's right, and I know the view that you expressed in Summit Health."
1994.94-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1020.418,1027.032,"Mr. Estrada, your opponent relies, in part at least, on Gulf Oil v. Copp Paving."
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1029.974,1069.089,"That case stated that when Congress engages, or defines a class of activities, the Court's role in effect is significantly different, but from the examples that the Court cited in that footnote 12, especially the Perez case, it is evident that what the Court was getting at is that when Congress itself does what it did in the Perez case, that no further proof of interstate commerce at all is called for in any given case."
1994.94-251,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1100.761,1108.826,"In this case, Mr. Estrada, was there an argument before the jury that interstate commerce was not affected?"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1108.826,1109.346,No.
1994.94-251,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1109.346,1112.819,And was there any objection to the instruction that the court gave?
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1112.819,1113.318,No.
1994.94-251,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1151.282,1156.367,"So the Ninth Circuit's view was that this case should not have been submitted to the jury as a matter of law, I take it?"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1156.367,1157.018,That's right.
1994.94-251,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1180.753,1196.232,"Would it have been improper for the trial court to tell the jury, if you find that there were trips between Arizona and Alaska, and if you find that any of the gold over a 3-year period was sold in interstate commerce, then I instruct you as a matter of law that interstate commerce was involved?"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1196.993,1197.293,Yes.
1994.94-251,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1197.293,1197.514,--have been--
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1197.514,1197.964,"Yes, because--"
1994.94-251,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1197.964,1198.635,--an appropriate instruction?
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1198.635,1198.886,--Yes.
1994.94-251,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1216.538,1219.929,"Mr. Estrada, would the following argument be sound?"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1286.112,1288.964,"I don't think so, Justice Souter."
1994.94-251,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1305.724,1310.408,"So that whenever you see it, it's basically a signal for the shorthand, whatever we can do we're doing?"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1310.408,1321.755,"--Yes, and I would give as an example to you the Scarborough case, which dealt with coming into possession of a firearm in commerce, or in affecting commerce."
1994.94-251,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1352.336,1380.183,"Well, that argument in effect I guess is... and I'm not saying it's an illegitimate argument, but I guess that argument in effect is that wherever Congress uses the term, ""affecting commerce"", by using the broadest, most umbrella kind of term, it therefore is including any of the kind of more restrictive tests, like involving the instrumentalities, or involving goods that have moved, and so on."
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1380.183,1384.657,"--That is exactly our argument, Justice Souter, and I think that that's--"
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1384.657,1392.391,"No matter how the rest of the sentence reads, so long as the word ""affecting"" is in it, that's it, it's sort of a... it does everything."
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1392.391,1395.293,"--Well, yes, and I understand that--"
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1395.293,1395.854,Yes.
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1395.854,1403.598,"--Yes, and I understand that that may not be the best way to write the statute, but if the Court's cases--"
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1403.598,1405.38,"Not the best way to read it either, I don't think."
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1405.38,1421.249,"--Well, I would respectfully disagree, Justice Scalia, because once phrases have acquired the status of terms of art, and Congress has been told that it can go to the very limit by using them, they--"
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1421.249,1436.851,"How would it have expressed the thought that a normal, English-speaking person would express by saying, any enterprise the activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce?"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1455.083,1455.624,--You could say--
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1455.624,1464.987,"How would I express the thought that I would normally express by saying, any enterprise, the activities of which affect interstate commerce?"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1464.987,1466.86,"--Well, you could say--"
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1466.86,1468.129,We cannot say it any more in English?
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1468.129,1476.317,"--Well, if that is what one means, one could say, the activities of which considered in isolation affect interstate commerce."
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1500.971,1510.048,"And you really think that that's what our cases now, that whenever Congress uses the word ""affecting"" the rest of the sentence doesn't matter?"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1510.048,1532.795,"--Well, I think that it matters in the sense that the activities of the enterprise of course have to affect commerce, but one of the tests that may make that true under this Court's cases, and especially the NLRB cases, is that they may affect commerce because, considered with other like activities throughout the country, the effect on commerce is substantial."
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1532.795,1544.692,"If that's what we've said, maybe we should unsay it, because it certainly is a trap for the unwary legislator who thinks that he's speaking English, and it turns out that if he uses the word ""affecting"" all sorts of unreal things happen."
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1544.692,1559.294,"But it isn't, because one of the canons of this Court's cases is that Congress is presumed to know what this Court's cases say and, in effect, if you had a case that told Congress that--"
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1559.294,1562.424,Because our cases are presumed to say reasonable things.
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1562.424,1563.926,"--Well, but even--"
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1563.926,1565.326,And maybe we should adhere to that presumption.
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1565.326,1588.032,"--Justice Scalia, if you had a case that told Congress that it could reach to the full limits of the Commerce Clause by affixing to the statute the score of ""Suwannee River"", and Congress did that, it should be taken to have reached to the limits of the Commerce Clause, and that's basically all that we're arguing here."
1994.94-251,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1588.032,1605.424,"Of course, what we've come with in your answers to me and to Justice Scalia are a kind of three variants, one of which would make it expressly clear that we were talking about an enterprise whose activities, when aggregated with others, affected."
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1640.186,1662.92,"I have said it to Justice Scalia before, Justice Souter, and it didn't do me much good at the time, but yes, if that were necessary to ascertain the meaning of Congress, our view is that the use of the term of art itself makes it clear."
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1662.92,1672.086,"Of course, the Government's view is so expansive, it really doesn't even matter if you use ""affecting"" does it, because it's not used in the Sherman Act, and you take the same ""it covers everything"" view of the Sherman Act, right?"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1672.086,1673.718,There are several--
1994.94-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.718,1677.459,"So if you use ""affecting"", or, alternatively, do not use ""affecting"", it covers everything."
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1678.18,1686.076,"--If you use ""affecting"" or ""obstructing"", or several of the other words that this Court has identified--"
1994.94-251,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1686.076,1693.652,"Well, is that really true that the Government's position is that if two pizza parlors in downtown Anchorage fix their prices, the Sherman Act applies?"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1693.652,1698.774,"--Yes, it is, and I see that my time is running low--"
1994.94-251,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1698.774,1700.436,"If you didn't accept that, would it be--"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1706.571,1707.041,--Yes.
1994.94-251,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1707.041,1707.468,"I mean, is it possible?"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1708.65,1723.361,"Yes, because as Justice Scalia pointed out, it is possible to make good arguments, as he did in Summit Health, that the Sherman Act, because of its different language, doesn't go so far, that would not really be there for RICO, which has much more expansive language."
1994.94-251,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1723.361,1744.836,"--You mean, one could look to see whether or not Congress intended each individual farmer, the class of which affects the price of wheat, also to fall within the statute, and sometimes the answer would be yes, and sometimes no, depending on what the statute's about?"
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1744.836,1745.703,We would... no.
1994.94-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1761.527,1761.865,"Very well, Mr. Estrada."
1994.94-251,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1761.865,1762.155,--Thank you.
1994.94-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1762.155,1763.487,"Mr. Warren, we'll hear from you."
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,1763.487,1770.521,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-251,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1827.799,1831.451,Is it open for you to argue this when you did not object to the instruction?
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,1842.169,1855.368,"Justice Kennedy, that instruction was applied to section 1956, which was one of the racketeering acts which was a part of count 6, which was the general RICO count."
1994.94-251,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1881.695,1891.54,"--Mr. Warren, you use the word, has to have a substantial effect, so does it turn on the success of the mine?"
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,1895.864,1910.343,"The RICO statute talks about, and the statute that Mr. Robertson, the respondent, was prosecuted under, talks about actual effects."
1994.94-251,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1915.896,1924.592,"So if Mr. Robinson's dream had come true, then he would be covered, but it's just because his mine was not successful that he's not."
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,1925.193,1936.029,"That is my position, because I believe that the clear language of the statute talks about effects of the enterprise on interstate commerce and not potential effects."
1994.94-251,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1936.029,1939.162,--Now--
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,1962.907,1971.913,I believe that Congress does have the power in different ways to regulate gold mines such as the one that existed in this case.
1994.94-251,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1971.913,1974.194,Even ones that aren't successful?
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,1974.194,1992.326,"Even ones that are not successful under Congress' different powers that Congress has, but it's my position that RICO statute, which refers to the gold mine as the enterprise, does not cover the gold mine in this particular case."
1994.94-251,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.326,1996.459,"Not the different powers that Congress has, the commerce power."
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2002.103,2013.35,"I believe that it would have that power if it wanted to, but I do not believe that the RICO statute in this instance reached this gold mine."
1994.94-251,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2013.35,2021.816,"So if you invest and strike it rich, you're covered by RICO, but if you invest and it turns out to be a bust, you're not covered?"
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2021.816,2026.479,That may be the possible consequence of the statute the way it is written.
1994.94-251,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2026.479,2036.295,"I suppose that a lemonade stand that doesn't go anywhere doesn't affect interstate commerce, and if it turns into McDonald's, it does."
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2036.295,2046.643,"Well, under the Government's theory, I believe that the lemonade stand would affect interstate commerce, because any activity has some effect on interstate commerce."
1994.94-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2061.212,2064.844,Mr. Warren what do you have to say about the Russell case?
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2064.844,2083.005,"--The Russell case is... the Russell case looked at title VIII of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, and uses language which is different than the RICO statute."
1994.94-251,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2180.989,2206.437,"If Congress has the power to regulate the output of gold mines, or gold mines, even local mines, because like wheat they affect, what reason is there in this statute to believe that Congress would not have wanted to bring within the statute every single enterprise that is a member of this class?"
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2227.652,2238.487,"I agree, Justice Breyer, Congress may have wanted to bring every enterprise under its jurisdiction, but I would submit that is beyond the commerce power of Congress."
1994.94-251,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2238.487,2254.299,"Is this now beyond the power of commerce... Congress to say, this gold... in other words, you're saying now, Congress doesn't have the constitutional power to penalize investment in this kind of gold mind, this kind of investment?"
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2254.299,2259.654,That is my position with the approach that Congress used in this particular case.
1994.94-251,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2261.705,2264.247,"Well, I just asked you that same question."
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2272.842,2314.128,"--With all respect, Justice O'Connor, I believe that if Congress had defined a class of gold mines that it wished to regulate, then the individual mines within that class could be aggregated to establish a substantial effect on interstate commerce, but when Congress uses the generic term, ""enterprise"", which covers virtually every activity within the United States, it's a class that is so broad that it is tantamount to trying to exercise the commerce power itself over every activity."
1994.94-251,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2326.236,2331.219,"Well, it can, but why does it follow from that that Congress may not do it otherwise?"
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2339.955,2351.816,"If Congress did not make the subclass classification, then effectively it would be regulating every enterprise from the lemonade stand to General Motors."
1994.94-251,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2351.816,2353.474,"Well, I mean, that doesn't follow."
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2380.303,2396.352,"Well, the statute itself, in addition the two... the class which would be enterprises which have elicit funds invested in them, has words of limitation, which--"
1994.94-251,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2396.352,2398.485,That's a different argument.
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2429.545,2435.53,"--I would agree with that position, that it's not a textual question."
1994.94-251,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2435.53,2437.27,Okay.
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2452.059,2469.922,"Well, I believe as a matter of logic, if nothing else, that if Congress can define a class as including all enterprises in the United States, then effectively the commerce power has no limitation, and as even the Government concedes--"
1994.94-251,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2469.922,2475.605,"Well, it has no limitation beyond the substantially affecting commerce limitation, and Congress would say, that's absolutely right."
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2476.887,2500.552,"--Well, I think the Government's position is that Congress could legislate over all enterprises in the United States, and then could use those, could aggregate those and declare, or ask the court to interpret that aggregation as having the substantial effect on commerce, and therefore there would be no distinction between interstate and intrastate commerce."
1994.94-251,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2504.365,2506.096,"I thought that was your position, too."
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2515.723,2517.994,"I'm making two arguments, Justice Scalia."
1994.94-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2531.791,2540.667,"But your constitutional argument is based on the assumption they define everything that go into the class, but how does that respond to the argument that here the only class is gold mines?"
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2540.667,2550.384,"Well, gold mines are not defined either by Congress in the statute or in the legislative history."
1994.94-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2572.669,2576.002,"No, but may I go back to Russell for a second?"
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2585.647,2586.819,"--Right, the... and--"
1994.94-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2586.819,2601.689,"So that if this statute had read... instead of, any enterprise which is engaged in or the activities of which affect interstate commerce, if it had said, any enterprise which is engaged in activities which affect interstate commerce, then you would agree you would lose."
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2601.689,2602.34,--Yes.
1994.94-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.34,2603.059,Yes.
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2603.059,2620.56,"I disagree with the position of the Government that the words, ""affect interstate commerce"" have a general meaning which we can look at and take into every statute."
1994.94-251,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2646.68,2657.375,To what extent do you rely on the Ninth Circuit point about the distance of Alaska?
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2663.249,2664.939,"I agree with you, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2734.566,2738.867,--How about hiring employees to come to Alaska from somewhere else?
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2738.867,2750.046,"Well, that is, I would argue first, Chief Justice Rehnquist, is not technically an activity of the mine."
1994.94-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2751.436,2756.609,You don't think finding people to run the operation is an activity of the mine?
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2756.609,2768.657,"--Well, to the extent that it is an activity, and can be viewed as an activity, I would argue that it did not constitute any kind of substantial effect in this case."
1994.94-251,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2792.283,2794.055,"Mr. Warren, what's your best case?"
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2809.577,2815.508,"I believe the analogy to the Sherman Act, some of the Sherman Act cases."
1994.94-251,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2815.508,2817.671,"It doesn't involve the word, ""affecting""."
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2825.035,2841.597,"Well, I don't know that I agree that the Sherman Act doesn't have anything to do with RICO, because the Sherman Act does talk about the... about effects on interstate commerce, or at least the Court's interpretation of the Sherman Act in various cases talks about that."
1994.94-251,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2841.597,2866.622,"--Restraint of trade between the States is what you're talking about, and the Court said, you know, that that seems to focus on the individual activity, or at least we used to say that, but you don't have a single case in which ""affecting"" has been interpreted by this Court as you urge us to interpret it here."
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2866.622,2882.332,"""Affecting"" has been interpreted by this Court in class of activities cases, and the Court has indicated that when there is a class, there must be a substantial effect on interstate commerce."
1994.94-251,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2908.199,2918.765,"Mr. Warren, in connection with employees, perhaps the Alaska distance doesn't make a distinction that cuts against you."
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2946.614,2948.895,Looking--
1994.94-251,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2948.895,2951.246,"--than the distance between, say, New York and New Jersey?"
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,2951.246,2963.116,"--Looking at any particular activity, there might be a heightened effect if there are a number of employees coming from one State to another."
1994.94-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3017.87,3020.151,May I ask another question?
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,3059.528,3066.401,There could be some concern about the Federal-State balance.
1994.94-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3072.365,3087.436,"No, but the threshold inquiry has to be... there's no doubt about the threshold of, you're regulating the proceeds of activities that are clearly subject to the power of Congress to regulate, the organized crimes... you know, getting the money in the first place."
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,3087.436,3087.857,Yes.
1994.94-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3087.857,3089.048,"And then we're talking about, what can they do with it."
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,3089.048,3089.569,Yes.
1994.94-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3089.569,3099.874,"And basically a full power answer would say, they can't do anything with i, we want to get it all, and you say that... why wouldn't that be the more normal reading of the statute?"
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,3099.874,3119.626,"Well, even if it were the more normal reading of the statute, and I don't know the answer to your question, Justice Stevens, but there may be certain types of activities that Congress wants to reach, and it wants to use its full powers to reach those activities, but the commerce power just does not allow it to reach those activities."
1994.94-251,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3119.626,3143.672,"Or I guess you could say the same reason we think, or used to think that the Sherman Act doesn't cover small businesses that don't substantially, individually substantially affect interstate commerce, that the Federal Government left it to State Valentine acts to do that job with respect to smaller enterprises."
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,3143.672,3145.535,That would--
1994.94-251,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3145.535,3147.776,Or the National Labor Relations Act.
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,3159.243,3161.514,--I would agree with that.
1994.94-251,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3233.161,3237.254,"They also took out $30,000, didn't they?"
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,3237.254,3237.903,I'm sorry?
1994.94-251,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3237.903,3240.056,Didn't they take out some nuggets or something?
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,3240.056,3242.758,"There was approximately $30,000--"
1994.94-251,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3242.758,3247.13,So 15 percent of the output was taken out of State?
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,3247.13,3251.995,"--That's correct, but that... that was not an activity of the mine."
1994.94-251,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3286.457,3297.824,"Mr. Warren, the Ninth Circuit was obviously concerned about the sweep of this provision, and there was an issue left over."
1994.94-251,1,26331,glenn_s_warren,,3304.148,3327.182,"Well, this count, the RICO count brings the... brings Mr. Robertson's sentence within the Sentencing Guidelines, and without the RICO count, then all other counts that he was convicted on would not be within the Sentencing Guidelines, because they occurred prior to November 1, 1987."
1994.94-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3420.653,3422.486,"Thank you, Mr. Warren."
1994.94-251,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3424.766,3426.756,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-251,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3474.219,3475.571,Very well.
