1972.71-5685,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.517,"We’ll hear arguments first in 71-5685, Daisy Johnson against New York State Education Department."
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,17.203,20.81,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-5685,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,177.784,180.335,"Now, what’s the situation today?"
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,180.335,192.167,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, in subsequent to the granting of the certiorari in this case, the school district did in fact approve a school budget and a tax for the purchase of textbooks."
1972.71-5685,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,192.167,196.344,"So that all these students’ grades one to six are now receiving books, are they?"
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,196.344,199.241,All students in the elementary school are now receiving books.
1972.71-5685,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,233.611,235.051,Very well.
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,235.051,240.121,The petitioners in this case are parents of children in the elementary school grades.
1972.71-5685,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,264.515,272.525,Isn’t there something in the record however that part of their payments are for educational purposes?
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,272.525,285.189,"Yes, the -- with respect to that question, New York State in 1971 reduced the level of benefits for public assistance from 100% of need to 90% of need."
1972.71-5685,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,307.214,313.928,Well then what you’re saying is that the educational increment is used for general support?
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,313.928,326.163,"Yes sir, the education increment is used for other items aside from textbooks will be used for purchase of sneakers for gymnasium classes, will be used for purchase of gym suits."
1972.71-5685,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,329.948,336.092,"What I hear in your argument that is the fact, that this isn’t an educational increment at all despites its being so-called?"
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,336.092,338.742,That’s correct.
1972.71-5685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,338.742,342.909,Does the record indicate the type of use that you have just spoken on Mr. Nathanson?
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,342.909,344.273,With respect to how the funds are used?
1972.71-5685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,344.273,346.633,Yes.
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,346.633,354.389,"No, there isn’t, but this question was raised before the Court in the Rosado case with respect to the adequacy of the grant."
1972.71-5685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,370.281,372.139,But that’s not in the record here?
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,372.139,375.071,"No, sir."
1972.71-5685,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,423.176,425.052,Let me ask you one question.
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,436.646,449.399,"Yes Justice Blackmun, subsequent in the term five weeks after the commencement of the school term and after the district court dismissed the complaint for legal insufficiency."
1972.71-5685,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,458.394,461.348,May I ask the source of their receipt.
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,461.348,486.537,"There was an arrangement entered into between counsel for the local school board and myself whereby the sum of $30 was deposited by me to be held in escrow pending the resolution of the controversy, and the local school board agreed to provide textbook to only the named plaintiff’s children without prejudice to maintaining the class action."
1972.71-5685,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,519.996,526.2,"Those years ago, nobody got free textbooks?"
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,526.2,537.559,"That’s true, in New York State, textbooks -- I come from the city, the New York City, textbooks have always been provided free, have always been thought of as a fundamental basic part of the learning process."
1972.71-5685,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,537.559,544.103,"This may be in your day, but for an old-timer, not in my day."
1972.71-5685,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,544.103,555.689,How long since the Constitution of New York provided that all children must be given a free education as a state constitutional plan?
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,555.689,556.761,I'm sorry Mr. Justice.
1972.71-5685,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,556.761,560.928,How long has the provision for a compulsory state education been in the New York Constitution?
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,560.928,564.669,It goes after more than a hundred years sir.
1972.71-5685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,672.373,675.777,"Well, the statute doesn’t create that classification."
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,680.171,688.718,"Yes, but the impact of this textbook rental fee is in fact to deprive those children of equal education opportunity."
1972.71-5685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,695.378,702.017,How do you distinguish your case from the general doctrine laid down in Dandridge against Williams?
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,702.017,708.197,I think that this case satisfies the traditional test of Dandridge for the following reasons.
1972.71-5685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,757.015,760.194,You’re talking about the classification.
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,766.169,767.51,"No, no."
1972.71-5685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,767.51,772.286,"That’s -- so, just what is the classification that you’re talking about?"
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,777.34,786.215,The fact that New York State gives -- denies and it gives books to those parents who are able to -- to children of parents who were able to afford textbooks.
1972.71-5685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,786.215,787.569,"Well, it sells them."
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,787.569,789.119,It rents them.
1972.71-5685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,789.119,791.312,"Rents them, it doesn’t give them."
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,791.312,797.287,But the impact upon those who don’t have a rental fee is to be denied equal education opportunity.
1972.71-5685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,797.287,802.758,"Well, the classification though really is almost non-existent as I would see it."
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,822.381,830.293,I think the classification falls within those line of cases marked by Griffin.
1972.71-5685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,864.527,872.85,Then you say basically that the rational of Griffin should be carried over from the field of criminal law and to this situation?
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,872.85,879.582,"Yes, I don’t think the Griffin rational has been limited by this Court to only criminal law."
1972.71-5685,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,905.989,923.018,"Mr. Nathanson, may I ask if this a case in which the three-judge court should properly have been convened and the Court of Appeals said, it was not, but if it was then, are the merits before us at all?"
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,923.018,929.338,"Your Honor, the third cause of action did seek declaratory relief."
1972.71-5685,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,938.65,941.857,But I thought these cases were litigated before Judge Travia?
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,941.857,942.092,That’s correct.
1972.71-5685,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,942.092,947.579,"And before the Court of Appeals on the issue whether or not a three-judge court should’ve been convened, was it not?"
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,947.579,948.979,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-5685,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,948.979,955.087,"And Judge Travia said, there was not a substantial federal question and the majority -- the Court of Appeals agree, isn’t that so?"
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,955.087,956.258,That’s correct.
1972.71-5685,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,956.258,970.926,"Well, if Judge Travia and the majority of the Court of Appeals were wrong then, shouldn’t the disposition here be that they were wrong and send this back for the convening of the three-judge court to determine the merits?"
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,974.121,977.992,"Well, this Court could properly send the matter back for the three-judge court --"
1972.71-5685,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,977.992,985.656,"But don’t we have to if it shouldn’t been a three-judge court case in the first instance, we have no jurisdiction to it."
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,985.656,1002.63,"Except that the Court of Appeals, I think noted that because of the third cause of action which sought declaratory relief that it wasn’t essential to convene a three-judge court if this Court should determine that jurisdiction lied and the belief was appropriate."
1972.71-5685,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1008.967,1012.277,That would have been for a single judge?
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1012.277,1017.841,That would have been for single judge.
1972.71-5685,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1017.841,1025.58,"But we only reach the merits if we find that it’s -- it was properly decided on the three-judge court issue, isn’t that correct?"
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1025.58,1028.336,That’s correct.
1972.71-5685,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1116.315,1121.312,What’s the figure on the total cost for one year’s textbooks again?
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1122.436,1124.21,Actually there are two parts of the cost.
1972.71-5685,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1125.749,1126.537,Yes.
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1126.537,1141.275,"Textbook fees were $7.50 per child and addition to the textbook fee there was book -- a material fee, a fee for supplies and other related items and that was -- that total some $15."
1972.71-5685,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1161.017,1167.343,You ask them and said that some of the school districts in the State of New York do provide free textbooks?
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1167.343,1168.922,"Yes, Mr. Justice Powell --"
1972.71-5685,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1168.922,1171.697,Do they do that as a matter of state law or [Voice Overlap]?
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1171.697,1176.53,"Yes, the state law distinguishes between some school districts on the basis it applies."
1972.71-5685,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1194.019,1209.108,"(Inaudible) case, do you claim that that is a classification that violates the Equal Protection Clause namely a classification based on the size of cities within the State of New York?"
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1209.108,1212.107,We’re not pressing such claims in this case.
1972.71-5685,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1231.891,1232.637,All right.
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1265.672,1274.274,"Again, we’re not making that claim here, but I would say that with respect to transportation the same argument can be made."
1972.71-5685,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1295.266,1297.582,Free lunches?
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1297.582,1305.883,"Free lunches are basically handled under federal legislation, I don’t think I anticipate that that as a problem."
1972.71-5685,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1305.883,1316.112,"Mr. Nathanson, free glasses for the myopic child who is nearsighted and can’t see without."
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1316.112,1339.698,"Well, the problem with the handicap child are real problem and I would say that if the glasses are essential for the child to participate in the educational program and if glasses are in fact provided to other children by the school district than the same rational would apply."
1972.71-5685,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1350.287,1355.251,"Well, but the wealthy -- the child of wealthy parents would have glasses supplied."
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1372.801,1378.404,"Well, that problem is being addressed too by the social services law."
1972.71-5685,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1378.404,1380.064,"Well, suppose it isn’t?"
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1380.064,1385.581,I don’t think that that would necessarily carry forth.
1972.71-5685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1385.581,1400.284,"You’re arguing about the term (Inaudible) it’s the school board itself which rents the textbook, wouldn’t your position be the same if the school board said, here’s a list of books you have to have."
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1406.362,1414.055,If the textbooks were required and New York states the textbooks – the textbooks that these children used are part of required course of study.
1972.71-5685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1424.966,1432.469,It doesn’t turn on the fact that the running agency happen to be the State here or the school board.
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1432.469,1436.231,"I think, well, we have state action because it is the school board involved --"
1972.71-5685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1436.231,1440.205,"But the state action is the requirement, isn’t it that books be used for the court?"
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1440.205,1449.162,"If the State were required that these books be used and the children had no way to obtain these books because they lack the fee, I think the same rational would apply."
1972.71-5685,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1544.383,1549.023,But do I have to get to the psychological thing which I just did and get an equal education?
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1550.805,1551.925,That’s correct Justice Marshall.
1972.71-5685,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1551.925,1558.873,Why do worry about psychological and he doesn’t mind that two times to two is four because he don’t have a book.
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1558.873,1569.762,That’s correct he also learns that wealth creates favorite treatments in the public school which a poor lesson to both rich and poor child in the classroom.
1972.71-5685,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1699.088,1705.821,"Mr. Nathanson, I just re-read these opinions Judge Travia on the Court of Appeals."
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1758.809,1780.428,I had based my statement of footnote 5 in the Court of Appeals’ opinion and which the Court indicated under the circumstances of [Voice Overlap].
1972.71-5685,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1780.428,1788.295,"Well, it is clear that declaratory relief would be sufficient in the event that complaint have been meritorious?"
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1788.295,1796.215,I interpreted that to mean that declaratory could’ve been appropriate even if the Court found that there was a substantial claim would not have to convene it.
1972.71-5685,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1796.215,1807.535,"Well, I gather you do agree that the special question for us is whether or not the motion for three-judge court should’ve been granted?"
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1807.535,1808.8,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-5685,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1808.8,1817.041,"Well, but in order to decide that, we have to consider the merits of your constitutional claim, don’t we?"
1972.71-5685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1842.367,1846.253,"Mr. Nathanson, can you enlighten me."
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1864.851,1865.695,No.
1972.71-5685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1865.695,1868.588,I didn’t think so.
1972.71-5685,0,19720,carl_jay_nathanson,,1868.588,1870.112,Thank you.
1972.71-5685,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1870.112,1874.749,Thank you Mr. Nathanson.
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,1876.97,1877.946,Mr. Chief Justice --
1972.71-5685,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1877.946,1880.61,"Are you going to address that question, are you Mr. Lewittes?"
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,1880.61,1882.002,"Yes, I would."
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2000.229,2004.725,"But you do agree that constitutional rights are personal to the individual, don’t you?"
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2004.725,2007.591,"Yes, they are."
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2165.339,2170.771,How about those who are not poor people who are not on welfare?
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2170.771,2173.483,Those poor people are not in the class.
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2175.726,2177.442,I’m just asking you.
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2178.755,2187.067,I assume they obviously they are not recipients of welfare and therefore would not be getting this $7.50 and this $36.
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2187.067,2189.005,They would not be getting both.
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2189.005,2190.93,"Yes, technically yes."
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2190.93,2195.233,"But you are not tying into welfare along with this statute when was passed, are you?"
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2195.233,2227.005,"Well, I think that we could conclude, could we not that the State Legislature when it passed this law which was passed in 1965 may have very well taken into light the Welfare of the Social Service Law and in so doing felt that it, it would cover the educational cause, but then it would not the welfare statute would not cover the educational cause when you got to the higher grades because of the heavier cost of textbooks, therefore the difference between 701 and 703."
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2227.005,2230.578,Because it could have been done by just giving them the book.
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2230.578,2233.214,"Well, you see it’s quite clear is it not --"
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2233.214,2234.318,Am I correct?
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2234.318,2245.21,"Yes, yes, but it’s quite clear, is it not that the State of New York really never has been in business of loaning textbook or selling textbook."
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2247.764,2250.578,How many States have this statute?
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2250.578,2266.099,"Now, we have a companion and there are at least 15 to 20 States that have this if I’m not mistaken."
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2267.513,2272.484,Do you think the child can be educated without books?
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2272.484,2288.055,"Well, Justice Marshall there are theories and education today as they tell me that children maybe educated without books as a matter of facts some of theories claim that these textbooks are not at all helpful that they are doing a way with --"
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2288.055,2290.504,What study was that?
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2290.504,2291.426,I believe it is mentioned --
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2291.426,2297.155,"Are there also studies that say if a child doesn’t know how to read by junior college, forget about it?"
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2297.155,2297.947,"Well, I think this --"
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2297.947,2299.811,Am I right on that?
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2299.811,2304.992,"Well, yes, but they do not say that it is because of textbooks that he knows how to read."
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2304.992,2308.951,"Well, why do you give -- why do you allow for other people to buy them?"
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2308.951,2309.721,"Well, I’m saying --"
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2309.721,2311.537,"Well, why do you require them?"
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2313.64,2318.173,"I think that the State of New York, statutes does not require the textbooks."
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2318.173,2323.072,That no state board of education requires certain textbooks?
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2323.072,2325.235,"They have an approved list of textbooks, yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2325.235,2326.45,"Well, what’s that for?"
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2326.45,2342.91,"Well, I am not saying, I think the question was asked to me is whether or not its essential -- the textbooks be use in educational my answer was that I don’t think it’s necessarily true that I concede that because there are theories in education circles today."
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2344.904,2346.989,What do you use in place of textbook?
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2346.989,2349.332,"Well, I’m not that familiar with these theories."
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2355.932,2357.598,Are they relying on them?
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2357.598,2358.024,Pardon?
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2358.024,2359.175,Are you relying on them?
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2359.175,2367.926,"No, I’m just trying to answer your question when you asked me I believe whether or not one can be educated without textbooks and I’m answering that there are theories that yes."
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2380.52,2388.897,"Well, you know you go way back that before you had school like President Lincoln, at least he had books."
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2388.897,2390.824,"Well, I think at this modern age today --"
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2390.824,2396.412,"Well, I just know -- I want to show me somebody that educated and passed the examination without books."
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2396.412,2400.232,"Well, I can say there were the visual aids and the new developments and education that make possible."
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2400.232,2404.443,"Well, do you have visual aids in these schools in this county?"
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2404.443,2407.28,"I think they probably do have visual aid in this county, but I don’t think that --"
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2407.28,2409.165,Probably.
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2416.57,2420.216,"Well, the thing that is certain is that the kids do have books."
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2426.065,2428.304,And could that be change next year?
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2428.304,2438.668,"Well, it may be change next year, but let me say this Justice Marshall, if I may, that it has been determined that books are useable for five years."
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2440.32,2443.159,Could you change five years?
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2443.159,2446.566,"Yes, it could, but I think that history of school district is a matter of fact."
1972.71-5685,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2578.466,2583.224,How long have you had school books in New York textbook?
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2583.224,2587.459,"Well, I frankly Justice Marshall cannot answer that."
1972.71-5685,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2672.172,2684.942,"Mr. Lewittes, I understood Mr. Nathanson in response to a question from Justice Brennan to say that the Second Circuit here at least relied on an alternative theory for not convening a three-judge court."
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2712.156,2715.886,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-5685,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2715.886,2726.418,"In other words the probability of granting or not granting in an injunction is part of the evaluation that the single judge must make in the first instance, is it not?"
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2726.418,2727.27,"Yes, it is."
1972.71-5685,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2727.27,2734.265,"Well, that’s no different I gather than the assessment that you have been suggesting had to be made to determine whether should’ve been a three-judge court?"
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2734.265,2734.973,Exactly.
1972.71-5685,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2734.973,2737.316,"So, we don’t escape it by that footnote?"
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2737.316,2738.935,"No, no, no."
1972.71-5685,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2738.935,2743.716,"Mr. Lewittes, as I read the Second Circuit’s footnote."
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2775.539,2789.343,"I think that’s what they said in the footnote with regard to that Astro Cinema Corporation, but I think the reading of the decision here in the Second Circuit shows clearly that they use the traditional test as to whether or not a substantial federal [Voice Overlap]."
1972.71-5685,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2789.343,2792.406,"Certainly, that’s the way Judge Kaufman dissented it was --"
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2792.406,2793.956,Exactly.
1972.71-5685,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2793.956,2797.927,"Now, this we granted a cert. last February."
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2797.927,2798.487,I believe sir.
1972.71-5685,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2798.487,2812.314,"According to your brief on May the 3rd of this year the school district reversed its policy and is now furnishing free school books to everyone, is that right?"
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2812.314,2815.955,That is correct.
1972.71-5685,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2815.955,2818.443,And do you urge that on that ground this is really moot?
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2818.443,2832.117,"We have, but we do urge that and I’ve also added the significant fact of that because these books are useable for five years that even it’s not in the realm of clear probability that we’re going to have this problem --"
1972.71-5685,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2832.117,2837.279,Is that the answer to Mr. Nathanson’s suggestion that these budget elections are annual affairs?
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2837.279,2837.5,Yes.
1972.71-5685,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2837.5,2841.564,What you’re saying is a book should have been provided have a five-year life?
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2841.564,2844.475,"Yes, certainly that it won’t become obsolete within one year."
1972.71-5685,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2844.475,2851.734,"So that at least for the next five years, children grades one to six are going to have textbooks in the school district?"
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2851.734,2852.682,That’s correct.
1972.71-5685,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2852.682,2854.299,The one on page 103 is --
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2854.299,2855.308,Pay --
1972.71-5685,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2855.308,2856.653,-- five years?
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2856.653,2862.414,"They pay one rental for fee per year, but the rental fee is only paid in case an austerity budget is voted."
1972.71-5685,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2862.414,2867.207,"Well, I see and here that was not voted, it was later election, isn’t that it?"
1972.71-5685,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2867.207,2871.031,So that violates technically capable of repetition.
1972.71-5685,1,31468,joel_lewittes,,2876.215,2883.528,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1972.71-5685,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2884.16,2885.211,Thank you.
