1988.87-1245,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.045,"We'll hear argument now in Number 87-1245, Texas Monthly versus Bob Bullock."
1988.87-1245,0,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,9.716,14.902,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,1598.014,1605.479,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1672.561,1676.013,What about the message of the Arkansas case?
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,1679.122,1690.117,"The Arkansas case, Your Honor, the way Texas views the Arkansas case is that in that particular case, you had a different tax structure than what you have in Texas."
1988.87-1245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1690.117,1693.335,"Well, but it was a free... a freedom of the press case?"
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,1693.335,1697.77,"It did involve the issue of First Amendment right, free press, yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-1245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1697.77,1706.142,"And here some publications are, some parts of the press are taxed and some aren't, in this case."
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,1706.142,1711.67,Texas taxes all parts of the press except for religious periodicals.
1988.87-1245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1711.67,1713.56,"So, some are taxed and some aren't--"
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,1713.56,1717.105,The state does not--
1988.87-1245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1717.105,1718.121,--based on content.
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,1718.121,1739.941,"--The way the state reads Arkansas Writers' Project is that to have a First Amendment violation, there must be a tax that singles out the press as a whole and targets the press for that tax, or it must target a small group within the press."
1988.87-1245,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1765.805,1766.804,I'm not sure that I understand that.
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,1774.427,1775.363,--Yes.
1988.87-1245,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.363,1785.157,"And, therefore, the public harmed by the exemption is not just the rest of the press, but rather the entire body politic."
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,1785.157,1786.017,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-1245,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1833.779,1841.68,"Texas Monthly would not get its money back under that, is that right?"
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,1844.304,1858.173,"Not at that point in time, Your Honor, until a decision was made as to whether religious periodicals become subject to the tax because under the current tax structure, all sales of tangible personal property are taxable."
1988.87-1245,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1884.662,1896.892,"Ms. Burke, what if I think it's unconstitutional for the Texas courts to say after the fact, after the years have passed, we are retroactively going to subject religious periodicals to taxes?"
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,1911.918,1913.918,"It's an unusual procedure, Your Honor."
1988.87-1245,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.705,1936.627,"Well, that doesn't harm anybody, though, to do that."
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,1950.855,1958.477,"Of course, Your Honor, there would be a limitations time period running against the state on necessities taxes."
1988.87-1245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1962.037,1968.254,Is this Appellant the only entity that has filed a protest on this theory?
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,1968.254,1969.536,"No, Your Honor."
1988.87-1245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1974.252,1979.718,"And has the statute run as to all others, because, I take it, this statute has been repealed, the one that we're looking at?"
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,1979.718,1986.637,"The statute was repealed in 1987, effective October 1, 1987."
1988.87-1245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1986.637,1988.543,Has the time run on any further protests?
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,1988.543,1990.558,"No, Your Honor."
1988.87-1245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1993.073,1994.9,"Four-year, a four-year statute?"
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,1994.9,1995.227,"Yes, sir."
1988.87-1245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1997.867,2002.99,"So, if we told this appellant that it could get its money back, then any number of others could file?"
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,2002.99,2004.943,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1988.87-1245,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2060.078,2062.67,"Ms. Burke, let me interrupt you just a moment."
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,2080.053,2089.69,"--No, Your Honor, there is nothing in the record and I do not have that kind of evidence since the state has not been taxing religious organizations."
1988.87-1245,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2089.69,2097.328,Do you have any figures in the record or that you know of what the gross revenue from the state sales tax is in any given year?
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,2097.328,2102.465,"Your Honor, it is the largest revenue-raising tax in the state of Texas."
1988.87-1245,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2208.033,2217.294,"Ms. Burke, may I ask you on the status point, the first prong, what about an organization of atheists who published a magazine promulgating their views about religion?"
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,2218.98,2224.462,"I believe it might, Your Honor."
1988.87-1245,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.535,2240.801,The statute said religious faith.
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,2246.174,2252.765,"Yes, it is, Your Honor, but it is a belief, even though it's anti-religion."
1988.87-1245,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2257.856,2261.573,You would interpret religious faith to include anti-religious faith?
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,2261.573,2262.681,"Yes, in a sense."
1988.87-1245,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2262.681,2265.164,"That's stretching it about as far as you can, isn't it?"
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,2265.164,2272.147,"Yes, but the state has tried to accommodate religion to the extent that it can, and I believe I'm correct on that."
1988.87-1245,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2272.147,2275.505,How in the world does that accommodate religion?
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,2280.909,2294.467,How do you... accommodation is by allowing the organization to be free from having to support the state.
1988.87-1245,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2302.51,2305.368,Wouldn't you have to name religion and atheism?
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,2311.959,2314.411,"No, unless--"
1988.87-1245,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2314.411,2315.442,And that was deliberate.
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,2315.442,2321.079,--the state considers atheism to be a form of faith.
1988.87-1245,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2321.079,2323.642,And the distinction was deliberately made by the state.
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,2323.642,2336.761,The state legislature did make a deliberate enactment to exempt religious-type periodicals being distributed by a religious faith.
1988.87-1245,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2336.761,2345.351,"Ms. Burke, you don't take the position that this accommodation is required, do you, by the free exercise clause?"
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,2345.351,2352.661,"Your Honor, as I understand the free exercise clause, it does mandate that accommodation be required."
1988.87-1245,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2354.692,2360.298,"So, you take the position that Texas may not impose a general sales tax on religious publications?"
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,2360.298,2360.673,"No, Your Honor."
1988.87-1245,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2363.485,2364.329,"Well, that's what I'm asking."
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,2364.329,2364.907,--to impose the tax.
1988.87-1245,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2367.859,2374.216,"Can the state impose its sales tax on the sale of candles in a Catholic church, too?"
1988.87-1245,1,26572,harriet_d_burke,,2374.216,2375.558,"Yes, Your Honor, it could."
1988.87-1245,2,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3038.508,3042.241,Two points.
