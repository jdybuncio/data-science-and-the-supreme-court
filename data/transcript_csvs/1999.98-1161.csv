1999.98-1161,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.959,"We'll hear argument next in Number 98-1161, City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., doing business as Kandyland."
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,43.659,44.11,Karle.
1999.98-1161,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,44.11,44.631,Karle?
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,44.631,45.252,Karle.
1999.98-1161,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,45.252,47.064,"Karle, okay."
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,47.064,50.467,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1161,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,77.353,80.147,"Maybe you should lower the...  I think the trouble is, it's too high."
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,83.627,85.249,Okay.
1999.98-1161,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,85.249,90.533,"Now try it and speak up, if you..."
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,90.533,99.379,Our ordinance was challenged.
1999.98-1161,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,148.061,159.518,"On content neutrality, the ordinance at issue in Barnes, as I recall, prohibited public nudity in general."
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,159.518,160.6,That's correct.
1999.98-1161,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,160.6,173.818,"Now, in this Erie ordinance, the preamble to the ordinance notes that it was enacted for the purpose of limiting a recent increase in nude live entertainment."
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,173.818,174.789,That's correct.
1999.98-1161,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,174.789,179.722,Does that distinguish this Erie ordinance from Barnes?
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,179.722,182.556,Justice O'Connor...
1999.98-1161,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,182.556,190.73,"seems to have been addressed to a specific problem, making it perhaps not content-neutral."
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,190.73,204.068,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, our position is, reference to content does not make the ordinance content-specific, or content-based."
1999.98-1161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,229.477,235.33,"Before we get too much into the merits of this case, there's a contention that the case may be moot."
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,237.14,238.041,I...
1999.98-1161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,238.041,243.184,"Is the...  is this business still in operation, Pap's?"
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,243.184,255.453,"As I understand it, the location where it operated initially in 1994 no longer exists."
1999.98-1161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,255.453,257.382,But he's in business somewhere else?
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,261.916,267.801,"I...  in an affidavit presented by the respondent, he claims to be out of business."
1999.98-1161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,267.801,269.964,"Well, do you claim he's not out of business?"
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,269.964,280.058,"I filed a response...  they still keep their corporation in an active status, so..."
1999.98-1161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,280.058,281.961,Is that enough?
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,282.492,285.003,It's enough that he could get back into business...
1999.98-1161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,285.003,288.135,"Well, anybody could get back into business, but then there's no such thing as mootness."
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,293.781,295.782,We've also...
1999.98-1161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,295.782,296.433,He sold the place.
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,305.429,311.343,That was one reason we asserted in our petition in response to mootness.
1999.98-1161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.343,311.954,What else?
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,311.954,317.169,We also cited a number of reasons.
1999.98-1161,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,320.25,335.959,What about the line of cases that says voluntary cessation doesn't moot a case?
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,335.959,339.703,We cited those in our response to...
1999.98-1161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,339.703,348.178,"Unfortunately, those cases involve voluntary cessation by the defendant."
1999.98-1161,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,348.178,348.409,Right.
1999.98-1161,0,25568,gregory_a_karle,,348.409,349.13,That's correct.
1999.98-1161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,349.13,351.713,Not voluntary cessation by the plaintiff.
1999.98-1161,1,33573,john_h_weston,,1692.698,1708.439,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1161,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1741.181,1750.858,"Well, Mr. Weston, you talk about motivation, but if the ordinance on its face applies across the board, does motivation really make any difference?"
1999.98-1161,1,33573,john_h_weston,,1750.858,1752.939,"Yes, it does, Your Honor, for a number..."
1999.98-1161,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1752.939,1754.691,What's the authority for that?
1999.98-1161,1,33573,john_h_weston,,1754.691,1775.404,"Well, in some sense Barnes itself is authority for that, Mr. Chief Justice, because if the only issue that was relevant in this kind of analysis was what is the literal language of the legislation, Barnes would have been a very brief series of opinions in connection with the evaluation of the constitutionality of that legislation."
1999.98-1161,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1798.399,1830.581,"All right, except the...  Pennsylvania's highest court has said that at least one purpose of this ordinance was to prevent secondary effects of an unfortunate kind, sex crimes and that kind of thing, and I guess we accept that as a purpose of this statute, to curtail the secondary effects created by live, nude entertainment."
1999.98-1161,1,33573,john_h_weston,,1830.581,1836.416,"I beg your pardon, Justice O'Connor, I've heard you but I'm not quite sure I understand the..."
1999.98-1161,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1836.416,1854.615,"Well, I think that the Pennsylvania supreme court did go further and say that a purpose of the enactment of this ordinance was to prevent unfortunate secondary effects such as an increase in sex crimes, am I right?"
1999.98-1161,1,33573,john_h_weston,,1854.615,1861.391,It certainly stated what was in the preamble of the ordinance.
1999.98-1161,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1916.98,1929.396,"Well, we held in City of Renton v. Washington, whatever it was, that the legislature didn't have to make a study of individual situations."
1999.98-1161,1,33573,john_h_weston,,1932.639,1958.226,"Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice, and keeping that in mind, we are not suggesting that Erie was required to do its own studies, but the point is that Erie had no evidence, unlike Renton, which interestingly, as the Chief Justice points out, didn't do its own studies, but simply relied on studies that had been done by neighboring Seattle some years before, Erie not only didn't do its own studies, but did not rely on any studies."
1999.98-1161,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1968.024,1970.385,"Well, maybe they read the City of Renton opinion."
1999.98-1161,1,33573,john_h_weston,,1970.385,1974.928,"Well, perhaps they did, but if they did, then they were obligated to at least..."
1999.98-1161,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1974.928,1976.279,I don't think so.
1999.98-1161,1,33573,john_h_weston,,1982.251,1985.104,"Oh, but that's not what I'm saying, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.98-1161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2013.693,2014.435,"Well, but that..."
1999.98-1161,1,33573,john_h_weston,,2014.435,2016.195,and followed it and it was an influence of that...
1999.98-1161,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2016.195,2027.693,"That was probably what the City of Renton did, but eventually if enough cities do that, can't it be simply treated as datum that these kind of things do bring bad secondary effects?"
1999.98-1161,1,33573,john_h_weston,,2027.693,2057.202,"Well, I suppose it depends on what the state of the evidence is over what period of time and so forth, and what particular businesses, but this Court, not terribly long ago in Turner II, made it very clear that in consideration with the must-carry provisions in Congress that in order to evaluate content neutrality it was necessary for there to be substantial evidence in the record before Congress which Congress considered in connection with..."
1999.98-1161,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2057.202,2059.773,"But again, that was an enactment for the first time."
1999.98-1161,1,33573,john_h_weston,,2063.956,2065.088,"Well, I suppose...  excuse me."
1999.98-1161,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2065.088,2069.703,In this case the question is whether or not these kinds of established...  create secondary effects.
1999.98-1161,1,33573,john_h_weston,,2069.703,2070.232,Well...
1999.98-1161,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2070.232,2078.007,"And there having been some determination on that, including the Supreme Court opinions, can't cities rely on that?"
1999.98-1161,1,33573,john_h_weston,,2078.007,2116.093,"I don't think so, Justice Kennedy, particularly because the potential for pretextual enforcement and pretextual legislation is simply too great, and in connection with legislation which has the potential and the reality of restricting vast quantities of protected expression in order to minimize that pretextual burden, it is...  the pretextual potential...  it's not a very great burden from a First Amendment potential to require an enacting legislature simply to articulate the legitimate concerns that it has, what is motivating it, and the basis on which it is passing..."
1999.98-1161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2116.093,2130.324,"Mr. Weston, would the City of Erie have had to do that if, instead of saying there shall be no totally nude dancing, it said, there shall be no totally nude dancing establishments within a certain distance from each other?"
1999.98-1161,1,33573,john_h_weston,,2130.324,2142.573,"Well, in that sense, Justice Ginsburg, it would have been operating in more familiar territory in the sense of adopting some sort of adult zoning legislation which, interestingly, Erie of course had in existence."
1999.98-1161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.573,2146.265,"Mr. Weston, I gather you now think this case is moot?"
1999.98-1161,1,33573,john_h_weston,,2146.265,2152.23,Your Honor...
1999.98-1161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.23,2153.371,Is that a hard question?
1999.98-1161,1,33573,john_h_weston,,2153.371,2156.905,"It's a difficult analysis, Justice Scalia."
1999.98-1161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2156.905,2159.015,"Well, I didn't get this notion from nowhere."
1999.98-1161,2,25568,gregory_a_karle,,3498.345,3502.828,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1161,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3554.925,3558.849,But would the State statute cover walking down the street in the nude?
1999.98-1161,2,25568,gregory_a_karle,,3558.849,3579.642,"It would cover walking down the street in the nude if...  a person commits a misdemeanor in the second degree if the person for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire of himself or any person, other than his spouse..."
1999.98-1161,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3579.642,3589.256,"So that in Pennsylvania it is perfectly...  every place except Erie, it's perfectly all right for a citizen to walk down the street in the nude if he just wants to get a lot of sunshine."
1999.98-1161,2,25568,gregory_a_karle,,3589.256,3590.418,"Well, no..."
1999.98-1161,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3595.842,3601.134,"No, he doesn't have...  his intent is to sunbathe as much as possible."
1999.98-1161,2,25568,gregory_a_karle,,3603.037,3605.828,Gratifying sexual desire is the crime.
1999.98-1161,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3605.828,3610.69,"So that in Pennsylvania, for the purpose I described, you may walk around nude."
1999.98-1161,2,25568,gregory_a_karle,,3610.69,3613.133,"Under our ordinance, not, because..."
1999.98-1161,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3613.133,3615.004,"Not in downtown Erie, but in the rest of the State?"
1999.98-1161,2,25568,gregory_a_karle,,3615.004,3617.866,"I can't speak to Upper Macungie township, or..."
1999.98-1161,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3617.866,3619.876,"No, no, no, but as a matter of State law it's perfectly okay."
1999.98-1161,2,25568,gregory_a_karle,,3619.876,3620.257,Yes.
1999.98-1161,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3620.257,3622.558,That's a pretty good answer to his argument.
1999.98-1161,2,25568,gregory_a_karle,,3622.558,3630.065,"But at any rate, Justice Stevens, it requires an intent element."
1999.98-1161,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3630.065,3643.475,"Mr. Karle, the Pennsylvania supreme court did, in its list of 14 facts that it considered important, say the play Equus, which featured frontal nudity, did appear in the city of Erie."
1999.98-1161,2,25568,gregory_a_karle,,3652.08,3654.451,I'm unfamiliar with that provision.
1999.98-1161,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3654.451,3658.104,It's on page 27a of the petition for writ of certiorari.
1999.98-1161,2,25568,gregory_a_karle,,3662.558,3666.341,That's the trial court's...
1999.98-1161,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3666.341,3668.061,"Oh, the trial court decision."
1999.98-1161,2,25568,gregory_a_karle,,3668.061,3668.332,Yes.
1999.98-1161,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3669.123,3672.826,"Did...  I don't recall, then, did the Pennsylvania supreme court mention that?"
1999.98-1161,2,25568,gregory_a_karle,,3672.826,3673.677,"No, they didn't..."
1999.98-1161,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3673.677,3674.167,They didn't.
1999.98-1161,2,25568,gregory_a_karle,,3674.167,3675.189,I don't believe.
1999.98-1161,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3675.189,3676.26,"Thank you, Mr. Karle."
1999.98-1161,2,25568,gregory_a_karle,,3676.26,3676.451,Thank you.
1999.98-1161,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3676.451,3677.55,The case is submitted.
