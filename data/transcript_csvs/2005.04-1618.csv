2005.04-1618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.636,"We'll hear argument next in No. 04-1618, Northern Insurance Company of New York v. Chatham County, Georgia."
2005.04-1618,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,8.814,11.668,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,93.989,98.198,Can a county be an arm of the State for some things?
2005.04-1618,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,98.198,106.512,I am not aware of any county that has been organized so as to meet the requirements that this Court set forth in Hess and other cases for an arm of the State.
2005.04-1618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,130.455,133.56,I assume it's... I assume it's sort of a... a case by case inquiry.
2005.04-1618,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,137.258,141.046,"--That is... that is a possibility, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,204.877,214.124,Is... is the failure to extend immunity to counties and municipal entities in a State just a historical relic?
2005.04-1618,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,224.777,247.542,"Well, I think as a... as a fundamental feature of the Federal system and... and the plan of the Convention, that the States came together as sovereigns to form a new country, and under this Court's cases, the immunity that they retain is called residual because it is recognized that insofar as they did not relinquish it to the National Government, they kept it."
2005.04-1618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,254.773,257.545,It's just a... it's just a close textual reading of the Eleventh Amendment.
2005.04-1618,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,258.345,258.971,Well--
2005.04-1618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,258.971,259.704,It says a State.
2005.04-1618,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,260.733,279.465,"--That might be the end of the case, in fairness, Mr. Chief Justice, if the Eleventh Amendment were the source of the sovereign immunity that this Court has recognized, but we know from cases like Alden v. Maine that the Eleventh Amendment is merely an example of the structural immunity that is implicit in the structure of the Constitution."
2005.04-1618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,279.465,285.935,"So it's... it's a matter of respecting the dignity of the States because they participated in the Convention, the plan of Convention?"
2005.04-1618,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,285.935,290.318,And because they came to the Convention as sovereigns.
2005.04-1618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,291.396,302.314,"Well... I... I guess, in... in going beyond the Eleventh Amendment, we were appealing to an understanding of sovereignty that existed at the time of the framing."
2005.04-1618,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,302.314,303.492,--Exactly right.
2005.04-1618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,303.492,309.118,"And at the time of the framing, counties in England did not enjoy the... the sovereign immunity of the king, did they?"
2005.04-1618,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,309.118,317.098,I do not believe that counties anywhere at the time of the founding enjoyed the sovereign immunity that was... that has been recognized by this Court's cases.
2005.04-1618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,330.473,341.791,"So it's a historical relic based on the dignity of the State, or the king in one case, and the corresponding lack of dignity of the entities on the other?"
2005.04-1618,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,341.791,351.878,"Well, it is... it is what the history was and what the plan of the Convention was, and it's also a recognition, even functionally, that we're talking about sovereign immunity."
2005.04-1618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,429.415,431.526,Would you... would you say thoughtful rather than inflexible?
2005.04-1618,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,432.853,437.218,"--I will settle for thoughtful, but I'm hoping for inflexible."
2005.04-1618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,515.172,528.696,Do you... do you agree that... that it's possible that an entity can have sovereign immunity in admiralty where... where the same entity would... would not have it elsewhere?
2005.04-1618,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,528.696,529.373,No--
2005.04-1618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,529.373,532.145,I find that discussion quite perplexing.
2005.04-1618,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,532.145,545.751,"--I do not believe that is possible, and with respect to the argument to that effect that is being advanced by respondent, a close reading of the cases being cited will disclose that they're not, in fact, unique to admiralty."
2005.04-1618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,549.189,552.139,"They're talking about immunity in most of the cases, not necessarily--"
2005.04-1618,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,552.139,553.122,--Sovereign immunity.
2005.04-1618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,553.122,554.316,--not necessarily sovereign immunity.
2005.04-1618,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,554.316,555.077,That's right.
2005.04-1618,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,571.788,576.07,But... but there is a textual basis for drawing a distinction between admiralty and law and equity.
2005.04-1618,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,579.519,582.207,"That is right, Justice Stevens."
2005.04-1618,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,640.668,643.272,Alden tells us what the understanding of the Founders was.
2005.04-1618,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,648.732,665.777,"That is... that is true, though with respect to Chisholm and the issue in this case, Justice... Justice Stevens, it is very instructive that both sides of the argument in the Chisholm case understood that the issue was whether States may get sovereign immunity."
2005.04-1618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,717.112,718.373,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.04-1618,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,728.614,734.501,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1618,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,879.314,887.034,You don't doubt that a county could have sovereign immunity if it qualified as an arm of the State in a particular instance.
2005.04-1618,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,887.034,889.305,"That's absolutely correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1618,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,940.034,942.14,Hans... Hans is residual sovereign immunity.
2005.04-1618,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,942.14,945.261,"That's absolutely right, Justice Scalia, and every case that--"
2005.04-1618,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.261,947.182,Some... some of our brethren don't... don't agree with it.
2005.04-1618,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,951.048,952.081,--Well--
2005.04-1618,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.081,953.902,"If you're going to have a residue, Hans is it I suppose."
2005.04-1618,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,953.902,955.746,"--That's true, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1618,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,985.715,994.307,"Your... your friend in the... in the red brief, though, reviews a lot of old cases, suggesting at the time of the founding, that counties were not subject to suit."
2005.04-1618,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,994.307,1000.943,"--Well, I don't think the cases that respondent cites do, in fact, stand for that proposition."
2005.04-1618,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1035.627,1036.472,Nor could charities.
2005.04-1618,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1040.005,1041.932,"That's absolutely right, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.898,1080.408,May I ask you this?
2005.04-1618,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1093.521,1097.37,"That in and of itself, Justice Stevens, would not."
2005.04-1618,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.103,1266.636,"The question presented is... is only sovereign immunity, isn't it?"
2005.04-1618,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1273.356,1273.856,That's right.
2005.04-1618,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1282.93,1285.285,"Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb."
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1290.661,1293.266,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1618,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1327.961,1329.389,Who pays judgments?
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1332.577,1345.517,"Who pays judgments against the county is initially probably the county, but under Georgia law, the department of DOT... Department of Transportation has a fund in which they can contribute towards that."
2005.04-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1376.596,1377.113,Mr. Hart--
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1377.113,1379.202,And I think the dignity interest... excuse me.
2005.04-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1379.202,1379.802,--Mr.--
2005.04-1618,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1379.802,1389.193,"I thought that was one of the main indicia of whether an entity had been set up as an arm of the State, that is, the State would be directly liable."
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1389.193,1398.601,"Well, I think the Hess case says that... that it... that it's one of the default issues, and then you go to the dignity interest and the funding interest."
2005.04-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1411.626,1415.658,"--Well, core... core government functions isn't... isn't the test either."
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1416.191,1416.752,--I understand that.
2005.04-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1416.752,1424.638,"--you know, the Federal Government and I think some States gave... gave railroads the power to condemn land."
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1429.931,1431.869,"No, sir, I wouldn't argue that."
2005.04-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1431.869,1439.089,"So the mere fact that... that your county is exercising some, quote, core government functions, that... that doesn't... doesn't get you there."
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1439.089,1446.571,"Well, I think you look at the... the history, you look at the dignity of the State, and you look at the functional realities of State management."
2005.04-1618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1455.051,1464.459,"That was... in many of those cases cited in your brief, it was because the duties they were performing they were performing pro bono publico."
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1464.459,1465.303,Sure.
2005.04-1618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1465.303,1470.252,"And the doctrine extended immunity to them on that basis, not... not as sovereigns."
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1470.252,1479.511,"Well, it extended... it extended to them as part of an overall sovereignty... sovereign immunity picture."
2005.04-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1479.511,1481.766,It wasn't sovereign immunity.
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1490.757,1505.458,"I still think if you go back and look at these core functions and if you... if you define that as something that's being delegated by the State where the State says we want you to have sovereign immunity, then that's something that should be respected as part of the dignity of the State."
2005.04-1618,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1517.627,1522.419,"What... what other sorts of torts would this apply to, as applied to Chatham County?"
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1523.097,1523.813,Torts.
2005.04-1618,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1523.813,1531.994,"--were sued, you know... if Chatham County were sued for something done by a law enforcement officer, would your theory apply?"
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1531.994,1541.67,"I think the... I think... no, sir, I don't think under... like a 1983 action or a Fourteenth Amendment exception under section 5, I don't think the immunity would reach that far."
2005.04-1618,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1562.063,1569.627,"Well, has the Eleventh Circuit or did the old Fifth Circuit ever apply this doctrine in any area outside of admiralty?"
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1569.627,1571.404,--Not that I am aware of.
2005.04-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1571.404,1576.348,What are you relying on in the Georgia constitution?
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1587.35,1587.86,"Yes, sir."
2005.04-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1608.688,1616.585,"There can be no... no... well, I assume you have a... a tort... tort claims act that waives sovereign immunity in some circumstances."
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1616.585,1616.902,"Yes, sir."
2005.04-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1616.902,1620.023,"But apart from that, you can't sue counties in tort."
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1620.023,1627.837,"You can... generally in the... in... the county... as a State law claim, no, unless there's a waiver."
2005.04-1618,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1637.674,1643.466,To what... what other area would this apply?
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1651.114,1666.231,"We would contend that the core sovereign function has to truly be a core sovereign function and it has to be supported by some type of history, some type of... of State dignity there and... and some reality--"
2005.04-1618,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1666.231,1667.908,And education would not fall--
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1667.908,1669.252,--And we would not put education in that class.
2005.04-1618,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1686.059,1688.169,--How about the sanitation department?
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1688.169,1708.73,"That would get sort of iffy there from the standpoint that public health, quarantines, those type of services for disease were handled by the State and were handled in a... in a manner that you might be able to define it as a core function, but that would probably be a stretch."
2005.04-1618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1713.44,1717.905,"Well, I'm not sure that operating bridges at the time of the framing was a core sovereign function."
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1717.905,1720.66,"Well, it--"
2005.04-1618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1720.66,1723.181,There are an awful lot of private bridges.
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1723.181,1725.369,"--Yes, sir."
2005.04-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1747.291,1749.135,"Well, that's bridge immunity, not sovereign immunity."
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1751.823,1753.344,"Well, we're... we're focusing that--"
2005.04-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1753.344,1756.032,--it doesn't come... it doesn't come within the Federal Constitution.
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1756.032,1762.241,"--Well, neither does Federal sovereign immunity come textually within the Constitution."
2005.04-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1762.241,1763.085,"Well, no, I'm not talking about textually."
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1767.034,1794.748,"The answer to that question is that if you look at the... the function of... of State government and you look at what they define as being important... and in this case, Georgia has defined that as one of the functions under its constitution and under its statutes... then there's a dignity interest there that ought to be respected insofar as outside that realm."
2005.04-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1797.019,1798.363,May I ask this?
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1802.895,1804.156,"--Yes, sir, I believe that."
2005.04-1618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1825.744,1833.058,But the... the court of appeals has said that you weren't asserting that you were an arm of the State.
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,1833.058,1848.093,"Well, we were asserting that we were... we were immune under residual sovereign immunity and we conceded for... that the county has not generally been recognized under the Eleventh Amendment as being sovereign... as sovereign... having sovereign immunity."
2005.04-1618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2042.218,2057.585,"All that establishes is simply that if the State were operating this bridge and if the State were on the hook for any judgments and if the State had control over the people who were making the decisions, that there might be an issue of State sovereign immunity."
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,2057.585,2058.179,"Yes, sir."
2005.04-1618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2058.179,2060.107,The whole problem is that it's the county that's doing all that.
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,2060.107,2066.827,"We understand that, but we're acting on behalf of the State and acting as the State there and--"
2005.04-1618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2066.827,2069.264,"Well, the State doesn't pay the damages."
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,2069.264,2070.031,--The State--
2005.04-1618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2070.031,2071.025,The State doesn't tell you how to do it.
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,2071.025,2079.518,"--The State has the potential to pay damages there through... through the DOT, the Department of Transportation, funds."
2005.04-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2079.518,2079.984,If it wishes.
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,2079.984,2080.484,If it wishes.
2005.04-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.467,2101.989,The State can pay my damages if it wishes.
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,2109.375,2120.544,"Well, we take the position that the funding issue and the control issue ought to be less... outside of the Eleventh Amendment analysis, arm of the State ought to be something that matters less."
2005.04-1618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2169.012,2170.939,But that's a different question.
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,2179.254,2181.026,"--Well, the... the--"
2005.04-1618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2181.026,2186.058,It's the claim on the treasury of the judgment that raises the sovereign immunity issues.
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,2186.058,2194.466,"--Insofar as this case goes, there is the potential for payment by the State, and... and that's about all we can say there."
2005.04-1618,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2288.205,2297.529,What about the South Carolina Supreme Court's opinion in the Hines case which seems to run counter to your argument?
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,2297.529,2298.046,"Yes, ma'am."
2005.04-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2341.538,2343.882,"Mr. Hart, may I ask this question?"
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,2352.374,2353.407,"No, sir, it was not."
2005.04-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2353.407,2354.051,It was submitted.
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,2354.051,2355.145,Just submitted.
2005.04-1618,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2357.323,2364.043,"The... the Eleventh Circuit had a prior decision, didn't they?"
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,2364.043,2364.637,--Yes.
2005.04-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2391.29,2392.384,--That was an old Fifth Circuit case--
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,2392.384,2393.1,Yes.
2005.04-1618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2445.051,2452.949,"It's not unusual that counties maintain and run bridges in your State, is it?"
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,2453.732,2454.376,"Yes, sir, that's--"
2005.04-1618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2454.376,2455.637,--That's the normal--
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,2455.637,2461.846,"--I don't know if I'd go so far as normal, but for larger communities, yes, sir."
2005.04-1618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2461.846,2468.65,--Then... then how do we know it's a core dignity function of the State if they're... the normal rule is somebody else does it?
2005.04-1618,2,39561,r_jonathan_hart,,2468.65,2480.569,"Well, it's a function that historically in the Constitution was recognized would be a function on behalf of the State with the counties."
2005.04-1618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2616.107,2617.067,"Thank you, Mr. Hart."
2005.04-1618,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2620.849,2625.547,"Mr. Chief Justice, just a few points."
2005.04-1618,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2766.343,2773.575,You're... are you suggesting that the... the State would enjoy sovereign immunity in proprietary activities?
2005.04-1618,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2773.575,2786.254,"I am suggesting that if you named the State on the wrong side of the caption on the V in Federal court, it does enjoy sovereign immunity, irrespective of what your cause of action is."
2005.04-1618,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2787.432,2795.246,"But I would have thought, particularly when we're talking about the arm of the State doctrine, that the... the nature of the activity is one of the key questions we look at."
2005.04-1618,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2795.246,2796.34,I think--
2005.04-1618,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2796.34,2797.617,Maintaining bridges is one thing.
2005.04-1618,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2802.977,2821.793,"--I think it's... it's sort of inherent in all the cases that have been ruled upon, Mr. Chief Justice, that what tends to be delegated are those that are the normal functions of government, but I don't think this Court has ever held that it is the function of sovereign immunity doctrine to tell the States what are the appropriate functions of government."
2005.04-1618,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2825.397,2834.473,I always thought the governmental proprietary distinction really came up in State law cases involving municipal liability.
2005.04-1618,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2836.317,2843.381,"It did early on, and that was... that was one of the issues that was put forth in the Workman case, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1618,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2852.228,2853.122,"Thank you, counsel."
