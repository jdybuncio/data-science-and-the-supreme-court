1987.86-939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,73.878,"Mr. Minear, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,73.878,77.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,237.636,251.497,"Mr. Minear, have the two agencies, Interior and the Army, always agreed consistently on the proper interpretation of the Flood Control Act?"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,251.497,253.718,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that they have."
1987.86-939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.247,274.041,There was some suggestion certainly by the Respondents that they have not always agreed that the Army had maintained at one time that the Secretary of the Interior could not market water from Army reservoirs independently.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,274.041,290.221,"--The Army General Counsel, at the time that this proposal was first made, indicated that the statute appeared somewhat ambiguous but, nevertheless, agreed to cooperate with the Interior Department's proposal, deferring to the Interior Department's expertise in supplying industrial water."
1987.86-939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,290.221,296.303,"Well, has there been some uncertainty of the position of the two agencies in the past?"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,308.952,323.202,"I think at the highest levels of the Army, with the Secretary of the Army and the General Counsel of the Army, who are in a position to make these determinations under the Flood Control Act, there has been substantial agreement between the two agencies throughout this program."
1987.86-939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,339.373,343.176,"Since I have you interrupted, let me ask you one other thing."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,350.059,351.652,That is correct.
1987.86-939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,351.652,359.186,"Now, unused irrigation storage water can be marketed by Interior."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,359.186,361.717,"Yes, that is correct, also."
1987.86-939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,361.717,363.43,"Now, can it be the same water?"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,371.704,372.736,Not necessarily.
1987.86-939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,372.736,373.805,Could it be?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,375.127,378.18,Usually not.
1987.86-939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,387.165,388.104,Why not?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,388.104,390.955,Because it is being put to a use by the Interior Department.
1987.86-939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,395.04,405.415,Am I mistaken then in thinking that the Corps has changed its position so it now believes that it could have marketed the water in this case as surplus water?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,405.415,419.435,"I believe the Army's present position, which is presently being formulated at this point, it is still under evolution, would be that it would not be able to market the ETSI water, and the reason is this: let me go back, first, to 1974."
1987.86-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.933,478.464,And supply it why?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,479.684,484.148,They have decided to treat that type of water as surplus.
1987.86-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,484.148,486.299,"Well, that's nice, but what does surplus water mean?"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,487.47,491.232,"Traditionally, that's how the Army defined it."
1987.86-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,494.474,495.205,What else could it possibly mean?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,495.205,504.541,"Well, in this case, take the example here where the water, in fact, the water is being used to produce hydro-power, and that is the only purpose that this water can serve at all."
1987.86-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,518.85,522.623,"Well, that's very desirable, but does that transform it into surplus water?"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,523.621,524.463,It depends.
1987.86-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,535.691,552.933,"Well, it was addressing one aspect of problems of water that is not being used and making that water usable, but only one type of water that wasn't being used; that is, surplus water, which means spill-over water, that is not being reserved for irrigation, is not being reserved for any other use."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,552.933,554.504,"Well, Your Honor, I think, in any event,--"
1987.86-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,554.504,565.34,"You know, that's meeting one aspect of that problem, but to say you meet one aspect of the problem is not to say you intend to meet all aspects, including water reserved for irrigation that is not being used."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,568.031,569.403,"--No, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,579.291,589.566,"But the meaning of surplus water is quite relevant to the entire case, whether it... because it pertains not just to the Army's position but to what the two agencies can do."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,589.566,595.61,"And I think what the two agencies have reached a reconciled position to, based on their two definitions, that, in fact,--"
1987.86-939,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,595.61,598.832,You represent both agencies.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,598.832,599.603,--That is correct.
1987.86-939,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,599.603,600.363,"Mr. Minear,--"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,603.635,605.778,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,605.778,609.679,I share Justice O'Connor's historical concerns.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,639.358,643.121,I think that Judge Bright is partially correct.
1987.86-939,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,643.121,644.541,Partially correct.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,644.541,650.355,The Army simply cannot market all of the water that's available in this reservoir as surplus water.
1987.86-939,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,681.756,688.222,"Of course, it's a strange thing that the 8th Circuit panel divided upper basin against lower basin judges, too."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,688.222,689.311,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,689.311,697.038,"Well, wasn't this... this reservoir was designed to have... and built to include irrigation water?"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,697.038,698.597,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,698.597,700.42,Quite a lot of it.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,700.42,702.503,"Yes, it was designed so."
1987.86-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.503,709.276,And the Secretary of Interior has found that that water... none of that water or at least all of that water is not needed for irrigation.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,709.276,710.157,Not at the present.
1987.86-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,710.878,723.186,"And, so, there the water sits unused for irrigation anyway, and your claim is, I take it, that the Secretary of Interior has the power to use that water for some other purpose."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,723.186,725.016,To make that water available to states.
1987.86-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,725.016,727.017,"So, it's unused irrigation water."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,727.017,727.668,Yes.
1987.86-939,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,727.668,729.27,For a coal slurry in Wyoming.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,729.27,730.51,"Yes, that is right."
1987.86-939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,730.51,747.841,"Mr. Minear, getting back just for a moment to this business of the relationship between the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Interior, certainly if the Secretary of the Army had joined in signing this contract, there wouldn't be any lawsuit at all, would there?"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,747.841,749.263,"Oh, I'm not so sure about that at all."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,768.314,771.576,"Well, it certainly would have answered the theory of the Court of Appeals decision,--"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,771.576,772.127,Yes.
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,772.127,776.401,--which was that it's a joint responsibility rather than a single responsibility.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,776.401,777.601,"But, in fact, they did cooperate here."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,779.113,779.584,"But they didn't sign it, did they?"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,779.584,780.242,No.
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,780.773,784.876,This lawsuit would be over if the Secretary of the Army had signed this contract.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,784.876,787.398,"--I respectfully disagree with you, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,787.398,790.731,"Certainly, the Court of Appeals decision wouldn't have been written the way it was."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,790.731,792.06,Perhaps it would have been written differently.
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,792.06,792.531,Perhaps.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,801.767,803.72,"Your Honor, I don't think that that is correct."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,817.188,824.373,"Do you think that the case would have been the same if the Army had endorsed the contracts, we ratify and approve everything that's being done here?"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,824.373,826.414,"Oh, I think there still would--"
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,826.414,827.443,And then the states would make the same claim?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,827.443,829.586,--It's likely that there still would have been a lawsuit in this case.
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,829.586,831.066,"Well, some other ground, certainly."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,839.752,844.437,"But, Your Honor, it was not necessary for the Secretary of the Army to sign these papers."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,844.437,850.421,"Well, whether it was necessary or not, they could have avoided a lawsuit and a lot of judicial time if they had signed the contract."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,850.421,850.781,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,857.437,860.759,Is there any legal significance to their having been consulted and approved?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,860.759,863.48,--I think that there is legal significance because the--
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,863.48,866.602,"Then, the Secretary of the Interior does not have the authority to act independently."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,866.602,879.902,"--Well, in terms of acting independently, I think it's important to get this point straight, and that is, that under the Pick-Sloan Plan, the Army and Interior constantly consult on all of these matters because what one does affects the other."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,886.275,895.321,"What if, after the consultation, the Army says I've heard everything you've consulted me about, but I just think you're all wrong, I'd like to use this water for down stream purposes?"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,895.321,897.812,"Then, that can be resolved within the Executive Branch."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,897.812,900.456,"Then, the Secretary of Interior could not act independently?"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,900.456,901.365,That is right.
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,903.348,906.567,The Secretary of the Interior can act independently unless the Army objects?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,906.567,907.528,--That is right.
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.528,909.829,Strange law.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,916.184,917.356,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,917.947,922.499,He has no authority under the provision under which the contract purported to be executed.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,922.499,924.209,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,924.209,933.986,Nor is it clear that he had any authority nor is it clear that he even asserts to have any such authority under the surplus water provision of the Act which he is in control of.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,933.986,936.367,"Every one of those points is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,936.367,939.57,"So, there's no possible basis on which he could conscientiously have signed the contract."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,939.57,940.832,"I agree completely, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,940.832,941.834,The most he could do--
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,945.243,946.525,"Yes, that is correct."
1987.86-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,946.525,957.301,"Even if the Army decided that it had authority to execute a contract like this on its own, it would be pursuant to a completely different set of rules."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,957.301,958.343,"That is correct, also."
1987.86-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,958.343,961.655,"Which is of fundamental importance, I would think."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,961.655,962.136,"Yes, that is right."
1987.86-939,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,962.136,965.258,The Army doesn't assert anything here because the Army is not here.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,965.258,968.471,"Your Honor, the Army did sign our brief, but this is primarily--"
1987.86-939,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,968.471,969.209,Is the Army here?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,969.209,970.1,--Pardon?
1987.86-939,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,970.1,971.102,Is the Army here?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,971.102,972.131,"In what respect, Your Honor?"
1987.86-939,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,974.564,975.704,Do you represent the Army?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,975.704,976.596,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,976.596,977.685,And the Interior?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,977.685,978.566,"That is right, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,978.566,981.227,"Well, which side should I take?"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,981.227,984.79,You should take the side of the United States.
1987.86-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1247.912,1249.732,Wasn't even ambiguous.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1252.414,1258.388,"--But the Court of Appeals relied on Section 6 and Section 8, which, as I've indicated, really have no relevance here."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1283.365,1288.267,Can I ask one other question before you get any farther into your deference argument?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1288.267,1288.738,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1288.738,1291.19,What is the status of the contract right now?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1295.463,1299.747,"The contract, in essence, has been simply held up."
1987.86-939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1311.175,1313.175,But I thought ETSI had cancelled.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1313.175,1313.796,No.
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1323.833,1327.395,Is it a matter of indifference to the Secretary of Interior what use the water is put to?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1331.397,1333.32,"Yes, we do care what they do with the water."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1333.32,1335.29,But you don't know what they're going to do with the water?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1335.29,1338.722,"Well, the water, they can only apply the water in accordance with a state permit."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1344.246,1347.408,"They were going to use it in some kind of coal slurry, weren't they?"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1347.408,1347.879,Yes.
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1347.879,1352.021,"And that purpose was approved, but you don't know what they really will do with it now?"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1352.021,1362.248,"No, we don't, Your Honor, but if it went outside of the terms of the contract, the understanding of the contract, I'm sure that the Secretary would object."
1987.86-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1364.869,1366.309,What are the terms?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1368.462,1370.453,"It is for industrial purposes, I believe."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1378.099,1384.334,That's a matter entirely within the authority of the Secretary of Interior to approve of the purpose or disapprove?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1384.334,1386.965,"Yes, and, of course, there would be consultation with the Army once again about this."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1386.965,1390.117,Is there an obligation to consult with the Army now?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1390.117,1398.165,"We believe that there is an obligation for the two agencies to consult in the activities that take place at the Pick-Sloan reservoirs, given the nature of their hybrid facilities."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1421.729,1423.33,If I may ask one other question.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1436.8,1441.592,"--That dispute would be resolved within the Executive Branch, mostly likely would not be answered by the courts."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1446.066,1450.246,That could be resolved in the Executive Branch if this one can't be?
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1450.246,1450.947,Pardon?
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1450.947,1456.011,I'm not sure why that dispute is resolvable within the Executive Branch any more than this one is.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1456.011,1466.747,"Well, it is because both of those agencies ultimately are answerable to the President, and, in fact, when this project was originally formulated, it's clear that President Roosevelt was very active in determining the hybrid nature of these facilities."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1471.542,1482.748,"And you're telling me that in this case, you wouldn't have solved the dispute by resolving that dispute and having the President of the United States tell them both, I think this water should be used for that purpose, I'd like you both to sign this contract?"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1483.85,1490.673,"Well, again, I think as Justice Scalia mentioned earlier, the contract was executed under the reclamation laws, after consultation with the Army."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.384,1498.399,"Well, another whereas clause, by virtue of authority given by that statute and by the authority given by Section 6 to the Army, we sell you this water."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1498.399,1499.579,"--Yes, but Section 6 wasn't mentioned."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1501.612,1502.082,I know it wasn't mentioned.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1502.082,1504.824,--what statutes these waters are being applied because they might have different repercussions.
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1504.824,1510.758,I was puzzled as to what disputes are resolvable within the Executive Branch and why you have to come to us about them.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1510.758,1519.565,"I think that the disputes between agencies are resolvable within the Executive Branch, but this is not a dispute really between agencies; this is a dispute between the upper and lower basin states over the use of this water."
1987.86-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1519.565,1533.302,"Yes, but Justice Stevens obviously would be correct if it were clear and if you acknowledged that the Army had authority, if it had jurisdiction over this water, to dispose of it, but that isn't clear."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1533.302,1535.552,"Yes, that's right, it is not clear."
1987.86-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1535.552,1542.238,"And that not being clear, the only way to do it with assurance of lawfulness was through Interior."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1542.238,1543.33,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1543.33,1548.532,"Yes, but it's perfectly clear that one or the other or both had the authority to dispose of this water, is it not?"
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1548.532,1550.093,I'm sorry?
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.093,1558.671,Either the Army or the Secretary or both clearly had the authority by virtue of a combination of Section 6 of one Act and Section 9.
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1558.671,1560.851,Our position is that Interior clearly has a--
1987.86-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1560.851,1573.707,"I understand that's your position, but nobody could contest the power to sell this water if they both agreed and invoked both statutes, that we won't try to define the water as either surplus or irrigation, because whatever it is, we want to dispose of it for this purpose."
1987.86-939,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1573.707,1580.233,"--In terms of contesting, I'm quite confident that we would still have a lawsuit here today, Your Honor, even if Army had signed that contract."
1987.86-939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1582.473,1586.366,"Very well, Mr. Minear."
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1588.197,1595.433,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1634.358,1636.981,Would you help me with the problem I've had with your adversary?
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1647.485,1651.208,There would be two issues if the Secretary of the Army had joined in the contract.
1987.86-939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1660.906,1674.835,"In other words, would you take the position that if you win this lawsuit, the Secretary of the Interior can't dispose of this water, then they said, well, we will now classify it as surplus water rather than that, you'd say they can't, and would you also say they couldn't sell it then either?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1674.835,1679.178,"Then, the issue would be the reasonableness of Army's interpretation of Section 6."
1987.86-939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1681.75,1683.009,"So, the answer is you would be opposed to that sale, too?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1683.009,1690.585,"--No, I'm not saying that, Your Honor, but I am saying that Section 6 does impose substantive protections of other uses."
1987.86-939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1690.585,1692.446,"Well, let me ask you another... put it a different way."
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1707.546,1708.387,No.
1987.86-939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1735.304,1736.264,"Well, I'm trying to get your position."
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1736.264,1737.035,Yes.
1987.86-939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1737.035,1757.709,"What would you... would you have any objection to a contract that was signed by both the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Interior and sought its authority in both statutes, said we don't want to worry about which... whether to classify it as surplus or extra irrigation water, we just want to dispose of this water for this purpose, would you say they had no power to do that?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1757.709,1760.471,"No, I would not say they had no power."
1987.86-939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1766.153,1767.836,They didn't do anything except what they've done here.
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1785.218,1789.088,--If they did not adequately protect other uses.
1987.86-939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1789.088,1794.333,"Well, they gave precisely the same protection that this contract gives."
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1831.708,1832.719,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1832.719,1843.656,"And under this contract, the consideration to down stream users was not given because Interior was considering only irrigation and there wasn't any irrigation, isn't that right?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1843.656,1844.337,That is correct.
1987.86-939,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1844.337,1845.095,Okay.
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1845.095,1856.253,"Interior takes the position that the Reclamation Projects Act requires that it not only... that it need consider only the effect on irrigation and not even just the effect on irrigation, but only its own irrigation units."
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.855,1868.701,But they can only... they only purport to reach that part of a reservoir's capacity that has been set aside for irrigation.
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1868.701,1873.685,There is no specific block of water set aside for irrigation.
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.868,1884.541,"I know, but if the lake hadn't been built to irrigate also, it wouldn't have been built the way it was."
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1884.541,1885.373,That is correct.
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1887.092,1890.966,It was built to have a specific amount of irrigation water capacity.
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1890.966,1893.587,There is no defined specific amount.
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1899.161,1900.262,May I'm wrong.
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1911.539,1913.48,"--Well, I don't believe--"
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.48,1914.201,Is that right or wrong?
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1914.201,1916.072,--that they've ever shown a specific amount for the irrigation.
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1945.303,1945.67,Let me ask you.
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1948.702,1950.064,"Yes, there is water."
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1950.064,1955.128,"And if there was a need for it, Interior could go ahead and sell it for that purpose?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1955.128,1955.849,Yes.
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1956.47,1957.669,Without anybody's consent?
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1960.24,1970.066,"--Under Section 8, for them to develop any irrigation works to utilize the water, congressional authorization would be required."
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1970.066,1971.478,"Well, yes, but not Army's?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1971.478,1988.7,"For them to construct the work, there is an advanced determination requirement by Army, but the Section 8 has been construed to indicate that reclamation law and Interior would have irrigation purposes."
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1988.7,1989.09,They have control.
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,1996.724,1999.216,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.636,2015.357,"Right, exactly."
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2015.357,2027.095,"So, Interior... water could be provided for irrigation, but nothing in the Act or in the Pick-Sloan Plan gives Interior jurisdiction over the block of storage or for the use of that water for industrial purposes."
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.095,2036.87,"Well, so, you're saying... you're really saying, which is not what the Court of Appeals said, that Interior would never have any power to sell any water for industrial purposes?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2036.87,2038.272,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2040.463,2041.164,You just said that.
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2041.164,2042.476,--I don't believe so.
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.982,2084.462,"So, if they had irrigation works here, they needed water for irrigation and they developed whatever works were necessary and were using the water for irrigation but they said, well, there's a lot of other water that could be used for irrigation, could they sell that for industrial purposes?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2084.462,2090.004,--Only if it was incidental to the irrigation function.
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.004,2094.889,"Well, that's a completely different rationale than the Court of Appeals, which may be quite right."
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2094.889,2103.435,"Well, I... perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question or misstating it because I believe the Court of Appeals specifically talked about--"
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2103.435,2113.77,"What you're saying is, as I understand it, that the Interior has got no power whatsoever to sell unused irrigation water for industrial purposes."
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2113.77,2119.555,--Directly from an Army reservoir in the absence of a work authorized by Congress.
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2119.555,2120.826,"Exactly, exactly."
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2143.701,2151.368,"The question would arise if Interior had a congressionally-authorized irrigation work, as to what incidental functions it could carry out through that work, but directly from the reservoir,--"
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2151.368,2156.89,"But you certainly wouldn't say that this kind of a project would be incidental to any kind of irrigation, would you?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2156.89,2158.642,--It's very unlikely.
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.642,2163.974,"So, you do have quite a different approach, and it may be quite right."
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2163.974,2174.232,The significant difference between Section 6 and the reclamation law is that Section 6 does protect other uses of the water.
1987.86-939,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2353.968,2361.813,"Ms. Osenbaugh, when you say under Army control, you don't mean day-to-day management; you mean under Army jurisdiction under the statute?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2361.813,2367.64,"--I mean, Army has jurisdiction over the entire reservoir that this water is contained in."
1987.86-939,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2373.902,2384.249,"But what are the consequences of that control that you're referring to, so far as Interior's right to dispense water for... to use surplus?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2384.249,2393.465,"Well, Section 8 establishes the terms under which Interior utilizes Army reservoirs for an irrigation purpose."
1987.86-939,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2553.959,2571.32,"It says in the Pick Plan, the Pick Plan, I believe, utilization, utilization of storage reserved for irrigation in all multi-purpose reservoirs should be in accordance with regulations prescribed by Interior."
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2594.787,2596.377,--Because Congress did not.
1987.86-939,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2608.866,2613.909,"But 6 and 8 don't just apply to this dam; they apply to everything, right?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2613.909,2614.71,Right.
1987.86-939,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2614.71,2622.414,"But this Pick Plan only applies to this one facility and for this one facility, Congress did approve in the statute the Pick Plan."
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2633.47,2634.722,"Well, all right."
1987.86-939,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2672.025,2673.737,I agree.
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2685.856,2697.362,"Well, Army's litigation position in this Court is only... is a very guarded statement that Interior's position is acceptable so long as it does not interfere with Army's duties."
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2697.362,2701.046,The Solicitor General submits.
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2701.046,2705.159,"Well, I'm referring to the statements in the Solicitor General's brief."
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2705.159,2708.171,"Well, isn't the Solicitor General representing the Army here?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2708.171,2710.712,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2710.712,2714.676,"So, do you question his statement of what the Army's position is?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2714.676,2715.435,No.
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2721.808,2724.209,"Well, I still don't understand--"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2724.209,2725.501,--give us Army's interpretation.
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2725.501,2737.289,"--why if this water is so much under the control of the Army, how would Interior ever go about, without getting Army's consent, to utilizing this water for irrigation?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2737.289,2741.781,They would follow the procedure in Section 8.
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2758.383,2759.455,That isn't what I asked you.
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2766.047,2772.973,"--Well, I think that Section 8 does provide the procedure."
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2778.736,2779.177,That may be.
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2782.209,2789.293,--It requires coordination with Army because Section 8 begins with the requirement of the--
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2789.293,2797.999,"So, you're telling me that Interior cannot without Army's coordination use the water for irrigation purposes."
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2797.999,2800.551,--I think that Section 8 establishes the procedure.
1987.86-939,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2800.992,2822.156,"Well, the SG says we look to Section 9(a), not 8, that 8 is something else, and that Interior can proceed under Section 9(a) by administering reclamation aspects of the program, isn't that right?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2822.156,2829.96,"--Yes, and it is clear that the Pick-Sloan Plans did contemplate an irrigation purpose."
1987.86-939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2878.36,2883.866,"May I just ask another stupid question, probably?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2890.85,2913.984,"It is our position that the Secretary of the Army makes the determination as to whether it is surplus water and the Secretary of the Army has, and the Army General counsel's opinion indicates, that they have determined that they can define the term ""surplus water"" to make water available for industrial use from the reservoirs."
1987.86-939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2913.984,2915.946,"So, the answer is yes?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2915.946,2916.387,Yes.
1987.86-939,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2932.016,2937.91,Where does it go if the Interior lets the contract as opposed to the Army?
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2947.116,2961.755,"On appeal, the contention has been made by the Secretary of the Interior that it should be paid into the reclamation fund and that Section 6 provides for deposit in the Treasury as miscellaneous--"
1987.86-939,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2961.755,2962.687,Right.
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,2968.22,2971.833,--It's... no.
1987.86-939,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3083.956,3085.846,"Well, maybe not to Interior."
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,3111.445,3111.832,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3122.822,3132.917,"Well, the theory always is that there is some real jurisdiction, but the initial decision as to what that real jurisdiction is is for Interior and Army, not Interior alone."
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,3151.11,3152.001,No.
1987.86-939,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3170.651,3174.425,We give no deference on pure questions of law.
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,3174.425,3189.785,"If Congress has spoken and it's ascertainable by principles of statutory construction and Congress did not in the statute delegation discretion to the agency on that, then, no, I don't believe this Court should give deference."
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3281.384,3285.588,Would you like us to affirm or would you like us to embrace all the reasoning of the Court of Appeals?
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,3285.588,3289.98,"--I believe that the decision of the Court of Appeals is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3289.98,3293.452,"And the reason for it, that this is just not a reclamation project?"
1987.86-939,1,22908,elizabeth_m_osenbaugh,,3293.452,3306.072,"I think clearly they have not established the threshold requirement for their contention that reclamation law applies, which is that it must be a reclamation development to be undertaken by the Secretary of the Interior under the Pick-Sloan Plans."
1987.86-939,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3311.275,3312.926,"Thank you, Ms. Osenbaugh."
1987.86-939,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3315.997,3316.838,"Thank you, Your Honor."
