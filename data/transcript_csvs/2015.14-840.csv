2015.14-840,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.66,"We'll hear argument next in Case 14-840, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. The Electric Power Supply Association and the consolidated case. General Verrilli."
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,11.66,45.34,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Power Act expressly authorizes FERC to regulate the process that sets wholesale rates for electricity, and that is exactly what FERC's wholesale demand response rules do. Demand response is a resource that is bid into the wholesale auction, and the wholesale market operators that run those auctions rely on the bids to balance wholesale supply and demand, to set wholesale rates, and they particularly rely on those bids in periods of peak demand to avoid price spikes and to avoid blackouts and brownouts."
2015.14-840,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,45.34,62.125,"If there were a student in Economics I, it seems to me that he would conclude and his professor would conclude that wholesale affects retail, retail affects wholesale, they're interlinked, which means you win the case, except that the statute makes a distinction."
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,72.43,85.565,"So I -- I have several answers to that, Justice Kennedy. First, we completely agree that what -- any action that FERC takes at the wholesale level in some sense is going to affect the retail market."
2015.14-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,140.54,170.365,"I find that a pretty fuzzy line, ""very direct effect."" It seems to me that there is a distinction between affecting retail rates, which, as Justice Kennedy has pointed out, always happens, and using -- using effect upon retail rates as a means of regulating wholesale rates."
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,222.82,227.105,"So -- I think three points to be made in response to that argument, Justice Scalia."
2015.14-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,306.89,317.11,"Well, yes, ultimately, but the question is whether that is achieved by the means of directly managing retail rates."
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,320.7,321.18,Those --
2015.14-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,321.18,341.795,"-- had sufficient funds available that it could pay people to not purchase electricity during peak hours? It just said, you know, we'll give you so much per day not to use more than X amount of electricity during peak hours."
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,344.38,354.14,I think that would be a harder case than this one because all of the conduct that FERC regulates here occurs in the wholesale market. All of it.
2015.14-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,358.7,371.92,It -- it's the difference between turning over money to these retail purchasers and simply depriving retail purchasers of a benefit that they could otherwise obtain in the wholesale market.
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,371.92,392.04,"I -- I think this is a more straightforward case, because all of the conduct that FERC regulates occurs in the wholesale market, all of the actors are regulated in their role in the wholesale market, and FERC's purpose in this situation is to achieve lower wholesale rates and to allow and to prevent -- allow wholesale operators to prevent blackouts and brownouts in their --"
2015.14-840,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,392.04,396.205,But it's still based on direct price regulation of the retail rate.
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,434.625,464.65,"And I guess there's an additional point to be made in response to that, Your Honor, is that -- the -- here, of course, what FERC is doing is saying, here are the rules by which the wholesale market is going to operate, and if you come into the wholesale market these are the rules that will apply to you. But ultimately it remains up to the States because FERC takes State law as it finds it here, whether citizens of the State can go into the wholesale market."
2015.14-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.485,483.71,"That -- that's interesting. If FERC has this power, how can it strip itself of this power by saying, we will not do this if the States don't want us to do it?"
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,483.71,488.68,"Well, I think FERC certainly has that authority in the course of deciding what's a just and reasonable practice."
2015.14-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,506.15,512.645,"That's quite different. That's quite different from saying we're going to exercise it unless you, the States, veto it."
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,519.52,524.18,"Well, it seems to me, Your Honor, that that's not an argument that goes to FERC's jurisdiction."
2015.14-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.15,551.58,"Well, I think it's goes to whether FERC really thinks that it's meddling in -- in retail rates."
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,551.58,552.04,"No, your Honor --"
2015.14-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.04,553.75,That's what it goes to in my mind.
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,564.63,569.065,"I appreciate that, that Your Honor dissented in New York against FERC on a ground very much like that."
2015.14-840,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,620.83,626.755,Is it fair to say that FERC is luring retail customers into the wholesale market? And if that --
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,626.755,630.02,"Yes, well, my friend -- my friend has used that term, but I think --"
2015.14-840,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,630.02,639.02,"And if that -- and if -- if -- well, if that were true, would that not be a serious problem for the government?"
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,639.02,641.31,It's wrong as a matter of history.
2015.14-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.255,689.27,"One of the briefs, by the way, says that you had no authority to deregulate it. You know, we had a case involving the Federal Communications Commission which wanted to dispense the filing of tariffs on the part of everybody, I think, except AT&T."
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,700.67,702.73,"So I'm very familiar with that case, Your Honor."
2015.14-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,702.73,703.29,"Yes, I'm sure you are."
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,703.29,706.32,And this case is completely different.
2015.14-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.75,711.8,"I mean, I like deregulated markets."
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,715.5,715.59,Sure.
2015.14-840,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,756.03,757.82,"If we're -- if we're -- obviously, that's true."
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,767.89,774.205,I think -- I think a limiting principle that has worked quite well in the D.C. Circuit now is that the effects have to be direct.
2015.14-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,838.79,840.97,That isn't the -- that isn't the central conduct here.
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,864.06,878.615,"No, the -- what the conduct -- that -- that is -- it is an indirect effect of the conduct that FERC regulates by market participants, the wholesale market operators and the -- and the participants in the wholesale auction."
2015.14-840,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,892.67,913.97,"General, I believe that there is -- I understood the retailers are not telling the -- the selling generators, I'm not going to use it. It is the people buying from the wholesalers, which are a different entity from the retailers, who are doing it."
2015.14-840,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,913.97,916.21,"That -- that -- that's correct, Justice Sotomayor."
2015.14-840,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,937.535,946.62,"Thank you, General. Mr. Phillips."
2015.14-840,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,946.62,956.35,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Kennedy, I think I'd like to start with the first question you asked, which is what -- what do we learn essentially from Economics 101."
2015.14-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1059.69,1060.27,Excuse me.
2015.14-840,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1077.83,1103.63,"I don't know that it would directly affect the wholesale rate in nearly as exquisite a fashion as the regulation in this case, because again, you're talking about the exact same transactions going on in affecting supply and demand. Nothing can affect the wholesale rates that way. If I make an effort to manipulate the retail rates, maybe eventually it will affect the wholesale rates, but it will do it in ways that are very indirect as we explained in our reply brief."
2015.14-840,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1118.33,1135.81,"You have jumped forward too -- too quickly, really, to the second question, did FERC comply with its obligation to explain the -- the reason for its change, but it does seem to me that -- that they come close together. FERC's argument is essentially circular."
2015.14-840,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1143.67,1147.74,"Well, I mean -- I don't know that we define the market."
2015.14-840,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1149.33,1152.28,"I mean, there are two parts to this argument: One is jurisdiction; the other is whether --"
2015.14-840,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1152.28,1152.37,Right.
2015.14-840,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1208.87,1209.52,The problem is --
2015.14-840,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1209.52,1210.75,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2015.14-840,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1210.75,1245.05,"-- that what FERC is doing basically leaves the States with the pure formality of setting the rate that is going to be directly affected by what FERC is doing. In my hypothetical, if you remember, I mean, they get to say how much the hamburger costs once you get in the store, but FERC can respond to it directly by setting the price to encourage you not to enter the store. If $5 -- we'll give you $5 not to enter, and a burger is $3 if it's -- the State gets to say, no, no, we want it to be $2, and then FERC just says, all right, we'll give you $6 not to enter."
2015.14-840,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1245.05,1245.53,Right.
2015.14-840,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1259.22,1259.83,It may not be --
2015.14-840,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1259.83,1261.93,-- the wholesale rates in a way that would not --
2015.14-840,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1261.93,1264.805,"It may not be the intention, but it's the mechanism."
2015.14-840,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1264.805,1265.935,Right.
2015.14-840,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1267.18,1269.665,"So you say, oh, well, we didn't mean this, but we're doing it."
2015.14-840,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1269.665,1306.29,"Well, I -- you know, ONEOK sort of says what you intend, what you -- what your intent is and what's directed at actually controls in some ways this area, but we're talking about a situation of concurrent jurisdiction between the State and the Federal government in this particular context. And so the fact that there are going to be effects on the retail rates doesn't deprive FERC, which ultimately is the supreme authority here, as long as it operates within the sphere of adopting -- of dealing with a practice, regulating a practice that will in fact affect the wholesale rates."
2015.14-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1394.86,1401.22,Why -- why aren't all the companies in agreement with you? Why are there some -- some private companies on the other side?
2015.14-840,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1401.22,1414.325,"Well, most of the private companies on the other side generate electricity and would prefer not to manipulate the supply side because they're -- they're -- I mean, manipulate the demand side because they like to have all of the supply side going to as far as you can take it."
2015.14-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1414.325,1417.33,But they're not all generators I don't think.
2015.14-840,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1417.33,1420.38,"They're pretty -- I mean, there's a substantial number of them."
2015.14-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1424.075,1426.89,Maybe your colleague can answer it.
2015.14-840,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1426.89,1445.44,"I'll let him count up his amicus briefs, if he wishes. And -- and the last thing I guess I would say is -- is I agree with General Verrilli's point, that if at -- at all -- if all else fails, this is clearly a question -- these are both questions that are -- in which the Commission deserves deference."
2015.14-840,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1471.735,1475.98,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Clement."
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1475.98,1512.9,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I don't usually start in this Court by telling you who I represent, but I think I better do it here, which is I represent not just EPSA, which is a group of power generators, but a number of other -- other organizations. So the vast majority of the people that I represent are load-serving entities who are not exclusively on the supply side, they're actually the regulated public utilities that actually could provide demand response in a wholesale, meaningful level by working, as they have since long before FERC got in this business, to work with retail customers and their State regulators to provide for reduced retail demand at peak time."
2015.14-840,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1537.54,1538.18,Where is that --
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1538.18,1538.68,-- from the general --
2015.14-840,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1538.68,1546.04,Where is that in -- written anywhere that that was their goal? That's how you've characterized that goal.
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1561.14,1564.09,I don't think it's just a characterization battle ultimately.
2015.14-840,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1572.44,1573.745,But in the retail market.
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1573.745,1574.65,What? I'm sorry?
2015.14-840,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1574.65,1577.905,They're -- they're generators selling to intermediaries.
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1581.955,1583.89,"That's not correct, Justice Sotomayor."
2015.14-840,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1594.46,1595.47,That is true.
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1596.1,1598.1,-- directly on the wholesale exchange.
2015.14-840,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1598.1,1599.095,That is true.
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1733.48,1741.54,And I certainly wouldn't be here suggesting that anything that happens in the wholesale market that affects retail price is somehow verboten to FERC.
2015.14-840,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1761.18,1778.1,"It didn't affect -- it didn't try -- what it said was, we have a group of people who will put customers together, and those customers will, in fact, cut demand at 4:00 p.m. on August 4th."
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1783.73,1784.15,But --
2015.14-840,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1784.15,1789.43,"And -- and what is the difference here -- and that's what you want to get at, so I'm letting you do it --"
2015.14-840,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1789.43,1791.855,-- the difference here and what I just said? Everything.
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1791.855,1820.74,"The difference here is that the customers they're targeting are retail customers, and the very fact -- and this is where I really wanted to go, which is, I think the Solicitor General goes a long way to conceding that this really is going at retail, the retail market and the retail level of demand matters, and he will concede that we're changing -- they're changing the effective price of retail electricity. The only -- the saving grace for them is, ah, but we're limiting ourselves to the wholesale market, and we're the wholesale regulator."
2015.14-840,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1908.85,1935.125,"So what's the horror here of concurrent jurisdiction? You seem to posit that this is horrible, but if, in fact, it's lowering prices, Wal-Mart sees it as a lowering of prices, I -- hard to think of why States would say no, but some of them have. But I'm not sure what the problem is with concurrent jurisdiction."
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1935.125,1941.26,"Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure, ultimately, that my burden is to show that this is horrible as opposed to ultravirus."
2015.14-840,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1962.51,1964.44,But they all -- each of them affect each other.
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1964.44,1992.875,"But here's the problem -- yeah, normally they stay away from each other and each other's customers. Another thing that is a complete anomaly that FERC has created here that, as far as I'm aware, exists nowhere else in the energy world, is you actually have the Federal government and the Federal regulators and the State regulators bidding against each other for the same customers to reduce their same retail demand. And the other side has made a very big deal that none of the States raised a jurisdictional objection before FERC itself."
2015.14-840,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2096.94,2097.2,If you're --
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2097.2,2098.68,-- you're going to have to take a lousier rate.
2015.14-840,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2098.68,2112.695,"I guess if you're -- if you're right, then I guess the FERC could not direct the grid approvals in a way that would, in fact, prevent certain retail customers from buying electricity at certain times."
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2166.94,2170.4,"Well, Your Honor, there is a lot in that question, but let me just respond --"
2015.14-840,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2170.4,2175.245,"No, all there were meant to be was three examples, and I don't know how good they are, but they come to mind."
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2175.245,2179.89,"Well, with all due respect, a couple of them aren't that great because -- (Laughter.)"
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2179.89,2202.91,"-- because you seem to suggest that if you can't do this, well, then FERC can't essentially tell generation resources that we don't want any more coal generation; we only want natural gas. And, of course, they can't do that because the Federal Power Act reserved the plenary authority of regeneration to the States. You also suggested if they can't do that, then they can't allow Wal-Mart to helpfully walk into the wholesale market and buy at retail."
2015.14-840,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2202.91,2207.36,"I was grasping your point, which I hadn't grasped previously."
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2236.57,2247.32,"Well, here -- here's a way of of trying to harmonize that, which is I think that the line that the Federal Power Act divides -- draws is between retail sales and wholesale sales."
2015.14-840,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2403.6,2405.75,And they're not regulating the rate of sales.
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2405.75,2407.16,They're not regulating the rate of sales.
2015.14-840,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2418.52,2421.57,They have to be reasonable in what they do under Chevron.
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2430.18,2430.56,Well --
2015.14-840,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2430.56,2434.45,And -- and I -- and we're not electricity regulators; they are.
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2445.04,2477.23,"And what is unreasonable is that, before you get to a Chevron question, certainly before you get to an arbitrary and capricious question, you have to have jurisdiction for FERC to do this. And the basic division of authority in 201(b) of the Federal Power Act is that the Federal government gets sales for resales and the States get all other sales. And I think it's important to recognize that you really have to wrestle upfront with the 201(b) question because the other side loves to talk about 205 and 206 in the practices affecting language."
2015.14-840,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2499.26,2499.67,Mr. Clement --
2015.14-840,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2499.67,2517.38,"And at some point I want you just to assume that there is jurisdiction, but to discuss your point that section -- that Rule 745, particularly, was arbitrary and capricious, I assume, because adequate reasons or no reasons were given? Or maybe there's some other point."
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2519.905,2522.37,"I -- I -- I will definitely do that, Your Honor."
2015.14-840,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2525.23,2527.4,"Do you mind, Justice Kennedy, if I --"
2015.14-840,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2527.4,2527.73,"No, of course."
2015.14-840,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2527.73,2536.02,"Yes? I mean, I take it that the -- the implications of your argument is that FERC can't do anything with respect to demand response; is that right?"
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2536.02,2537.53,"No, that's not right."
2015.14-840,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2674.06,2681.82,"And so this sort of practice, though -- so I'll just narrow the question -- where it's retail actors who are bidding into a wholesale market."
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2681.82,2682.155,Right.
2015.14-840,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2682.155,2684.855,"I take it that there, there would be a regulatory gap."
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2689.51,2692.46,I -- there is not a -- a regulatory gap.
2015.14-840,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2738.92,2742.37,Maybe you can turn to the question Justice Kennedy asked you to address.
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2742.37,2766.35,"I -- I -- I would be delighted to. If I could say one last thing about jurisdiction, which is simply I -- I do think, though, that the premise of the other side's argument is that the sky will fall if you don't have this precise type of retail customer on wholesale market demand response. And there, I think, it's worth taking a look at the Southern company's brief, because they operate in a part of the country that doesn't have an RTO or an ISO."
2015.14-840,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2766.35,2784.01,"It -- it is an odd result, given this Energy Policy Act which made it so clear that Congress liked demand response that it wanted FERC to lower barriers to demand response, to then say, well, FERC has no jurisdiction to do exactly what the policy that Congress articulated is."
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2784.01,2829.5,"But the problem with that way of looking at it, Justice Kagan, with all due respect, is I think it looks only at 1252(f), which is the one reference to what FERC's supposed to do, and it ignores 1252(e) where Congress recognized that the States are the primary actors here. And the point I was making about the Southern company brief is operating in an area without ISOs, without RTOs, so without FERC, they actually have a greater level of demand response than other parts of the country that have the Federal rule. So to bring us to the arbitrary and capriciousness question, I think, Justice Kennedy, the way I think about it is that we have both procedural objections and substantive objections. The procedural objections are essentially that there are all sorts of objections to using LMP as the price to provide compensation. That wasn't just my clients."
2015.14-840,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2872.95,2878.44,"Well, wait a minute. That's the classic choice that we give agencies."
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2893.395,2894.365,"Well, I think --"
2015.14-840,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2894.365,2896.405,That's been entrusted to the agency.
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2896.405,2897.31,Surely it has.
2015.14-840,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2912.07,2930.395,"Would you tell me which one? I mean, I looked through everything that the dissenter said, and there is at least one or two or three paragraphs in the FEC's report on this that directly explains why they chose a different route."
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2930.395,2932.09,"Well, there is certainly --"
2015.14-840,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2932.09,2942.57,The -- the court below didn't give us one comment by the dissenter that wasn't addressed by something said in the report.
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2942.57,2967.25,"Well, I can give you an example, Justice Sotomayor, if it will help, which is that Chairman Mueller in his dissent -- Commissioner Mueller in his dissent actually used a hypothetical that is very similar to the hypothetical discussed in our brief and the SG's brief about a factory and how if -- if you have full LMP, a factory will essentially reduce its production at time periods where it's economically inefficient for them to do so."
2015.14-840,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2967.25,2970.16,"And they -- and they recognized that, and what did they say?"
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2970.16,2971.11,They -- they had no --
2015.14-840,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2971.11,2975.695,Only when it's economically feasible will we pay this price.
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2975.695,2983.29,"Well, the way I read the -- the way I read the record, Your Honor, is that there was no response to that hypothetical, just as there was no response in the SG's --"
2015.14-840,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2983.29,2990.36,"The response was where it doesn't work we won't use it, which I didn't find a very satisfactory response."
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2991.88,2997.45,"I'm not even sure they -- they said that much, but I don't think they really grappled with it. And to whatever extent they --"
2015.14-840,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2997.45,3027.215,"I thought that the response was what Justice Sotomayor, and the way -- I wouldn't characterize it that way, but it's called the ""net benefits test."" And the net benefits test means this is not a one size fits all. And then in the order, at paragraph 17, 18, page 67, they go through a bunch of methodologies, and they say -- I mean, they say, we're picking this one. And the reason that they pick this one, I guess, is they think it's -- if you try a G thing, that also is a problem administratively. Okay."
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3032.38,3032.63,Sure.
2015.14-840,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3067.0,3069.67,"I'll read -- Cicchetti writes about that in the brief, doesn't he?"
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3069.67,3069.9,Yes.
2015.14-840,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3070.1,3072.07,And so I think that's the best brief to read on that.
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3072.07,3072.64,Yes.
2015.14-840,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3072.64,3073.38,Right? Okay.
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3073.38,3091.15,And -- and what I would say beyond that about the net benefits test is here's another way in which the -- the compensation formula is what I would call substantively arbitrary and capricious. The whole formula is built on the idea that there is an -- an equivalence between less demand and more actual supply of energy.
2015.14-840,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3118.67,3126.605,"Is one way to think about that is that the -- FERC's argument is circular? It says, well, the market will take care of this, but we define the market."
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3126.605,3127.35,Yes.
2015.14-840,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3257.965,3266.845,"I thought -- you don't have -- I mean, I thought that he -- frankly the net benefits test was meant to dealt with -- deal with this problem. I will read Kahn's testimony, I promise."
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3269.695,3278.38,"Please read -- please read Dr. Hogan as well, because I really do think he has the better of this argument. Now, you would say, generally, well, couple of expert economists just let FERC decide."
2015.14-840,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3283.515,3293.795,"But I -- I take it you're asking us not to make the judgment as to which was right and which was wrong, but that -- but that FERC did not address it by giving specific-enough reasons."
2015.14-840,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3293.795,3294.3,Yes.
2015.14-840,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3306.2,3309.015,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, General."
2015.14-840,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3309.015,3328.565,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice: Starting on the jurisdictional issue with text, my friend pointed to Section 824(b), which you can find at 1a of the appendix to our brief. What it says is not that FERC shall have jurisdiction over sales of electricity at wholesale."
2015.14-840,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3604.52,0.0,"Thank you, General. The case is submitted."
