2018.17-1042,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.135,6.22,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1042, BNSF Railway Company versus Loos. Ms. Blatt."
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,6.22,7.755,Justice Breyer's --
2018.17-1042,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,7.755,8.82,He'll be back.
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,8.82,9.6,Okay.
2018.17-1042,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,9.6,12.05,"Thank you, though. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,12.05,29.24,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For three reasons, payment by an employer to an employee for lost wages under FELA is compensation under Section 3231(e)(1) of the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, or RRTA."
2018.17-1042,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,29.24,41.28,"Ms. Blatt, before you launch into that, can you tell us why the railroad cares? I mean, if he doesn't -- if it's not -- he's not subject to the tax, neither is the employer."
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,45.78,46.09,Sure.
2018.17-1042,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,87.665,89.52,But there's no personal --
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,89.52,90.09,Sure.
2018.17-1042,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,90.25,110.665,"There's no personal interest in the sense of, if we say that it's not, then the railroad doesn't withhold and pay the state. Did you in this case? You wanted a credit against the award, but did you, in fact, pay anything, any federal taxes beforehand?"
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,110.665,111.12,Yes.
2018.17-1042,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,216.055,223.53,"Your opposing counsel argues that Nierotko is discredited, that that case didn't follow the text; we shouldn't follow that methodology here."
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,224.71,225.4,Sure.
2018.17-1042,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,276.3,277.365,That's their argument.
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,277.365,280.945,I think that's their argument and I think it's certainly wrong.
2018.17-1042,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,306.145,312.39,"Well, counsel, when I think of wages for services performed -- and maybe it's too simplistic -- but I --"
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,312.39,314.1,I doubt it. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1042,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,314.1,315.065,We'll see.
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,342.365,342.91,Okay.
2018.17-1042,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,345.195,346.15,Go ahead.
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,346.15,346.57,Okay.
2018.17-1042,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,360.34,365.465,"Well, but, see, that's not services rendered, is it? It's payment for a judgment of a court."
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,365.465,365.98,Right.
2018.17-1042,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,393.21,405.78,"I -- I get that there's a tough line-drawing problem here, and I have some questions for the other side on that, but if you just in isolation deal with the FELA judgment compared with, say, sick and vacation time."
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,405.78,406.375,Sure.
2018.17-1042,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,406.375,406.73,What about --
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,406.73,412.5,"I think maybe you're going to fault versus a no fault scheme, and nothing in the statute says there has to be fault or no fault."
2018.17-1042,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,430.92,431.29,Can --
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,431.29,432.01,-- you had injury.
2018.17-1042,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,443.0,453.94,"As a practical matter, going back to a part of Justice Gorsuch's question, in most state law verdicts, there is just a payment."
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,483.25,483.65,Of course.
2018.17-1042,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,483.82,487.54,-- does his argument have more purchase in those situations?
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,487.54,510.085,"No, because, under the Railroad Retirement Act in Section 231h(2) -- this has been around since 1946 -- there's a presumption that a personal injury award, the entire amount, is treated for lost time. And let me just point you to the JA on 78a, the Railroad Retirement Board gives you sort of the -- the current -- the way they treat this."
2018.17-1042,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,632.18,638.405,"If -- if you're right about that theory, why wouldn't the pain and suffering component also count?"
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,638.405,645.63,"Well, because the pain and suffering is not payment for services rendered in the same way a lost wage award is."
2018.17-1042,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,645.63,656.81,"Well, if I understood your theory, it was something like it happened while he was on the job, and, therefore, what follows is -- is -- is -- can be understood as services rendered."
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,656.81,657.05,No.
2018.17-1042,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,657.05,659.29,And the pain and suffering as well.
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,663.255,663.62,Sure.
2018.17-1042,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,715.80500005,725.29,The court -- court of appeals relied heavily on the fact that Congress in '75 and '83 took out the reference to payment for time lost.
2018.17-1042,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,725.29,726.21,Sure.
2018.17-1042,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,902.205,924.85,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kovner."
2018.17-1042,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,924.85,964.625,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As Respondent now concedes, the Eighth Circuit misconstrued the RRTA when it held that compensation includes only payments for hours when the employee is an active server to the employer, a holding that would exclude sick leave, vacation pay, and severance. There are three main sources that each establish that, instead, compensation includes employer payments for hours when an employee is absent from active service, including time lost. Starting with text, the RRTA contains limited exclusions for worker's compensation benefits and for certain types of sickness and disability benefits."
2018.17-1042,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1047.49,1048.81,That's where I get stuck too.
2018.17-1042,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1052.92,1056.17,"The other one is Nierotko, which also involves essentially a judgment."
2018.17-1042,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1056.17,1081.97,"Could you tell me what -- what we should make of the fact that the IRS doesn't appear -- you might correct me -- since 1980 at least, to bring enforcement actions to assess penalties or back-taxes to a railroad employee who has -- who did not withhold a portion of the FELA judgment?"
2018.17-1042,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1081.97,1085.23,"So we don't think that's exactly correct, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.17-1042,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1097.22,1100.28,"You said it, but you haven't appeared to do much about it."
2018.17-1042,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1100.28,1101.74,So I don't think that's the case.
2018.17-1042,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1146.57,1158.285,The -- the -- the railroad pays -- pays the full tax but charges the -- the railroad worker for his or her share? Is that how it works?
2018.17-1042,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1158.285,1159.26,That's right.
2018.17-1042,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1167.5,1173.135,"I would be curious, your answer to Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan's questions earlier."
2018.17-1042,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1193.65,1193.87,Yeah.
2018.17-1042,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1300.115,1321.195,"Ms. Kovner, one of the things that strikes me as a little bit odd about an award like this fitting into the ""services rendered"" language is that, unlike most kinds of compensation that you can think of, you could get this if you were injured your first hour on the job without having worked at all, without having rendered any services at all."
2018.17-1042,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1321.195,1321.495,Yeah.
2018.17-1042,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1321.495,1322.58,So what about that?
2018.17-1042,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1322.58,1325.98,"Well, I think there are a number of forms of compensation that operate like that."
2018.17-1042,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1388.275,1391.285,But you actually don't think there's ambiguity?
2018.17-1042,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1391.285,1391.74,We don't.
2018.17-1042,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1397.05,1410.94,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick."
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1410.94,1445.22,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At issue in this case is whether the Court construes the statute as it's currently written or whether you construe it the way the other side would like it to read. Our position is that the plain language controls and that the statute now in effect does not contain all the words and extra provisions that get you to a place where ""services rendered"" means not services rendered, which is the core of the other side's position. ""Services rendered"" has a very plain meaning."
2018.17-1042,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1459.01,1466.515,"Well, but he had provide serve -- provided services, and that is what entitled him to the payments that he received."
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1466.515,1468.495,"Incorrect, Mr. Chief Justice."
2018.17-1042,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1474.65,1481.435,"Well, it's not just somebody off the street who couldn't work. It was an employee who couldn't work, and he was an employee because he had rendered services."
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1481.435,1481.88,Right.
2018.17-1042,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1573.33,1574.21,But a lot of these --
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1574.21,1574.93,-- any differently.
2018.17-1042,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1574.93,1587.595,"-- a lot of these kind of arguments were made in Nierotko, and the Court rejected those in the -- admittedly, in the context of the Social Security Act, but why not follow the same interpretation here?"
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1587.595,1592.5,"Well, what the Court in Nierotko did was it construed the benefits statute."
2018.17-1042,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1603.91,1612.08,The Cleveland Indians was about the allocation time period. It wasn't about the main holding of Nierotko in terms of how it departed from Nierotko.
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1612.625,1613.06,Right.
2018.17-1042,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1616.95,1617.19,True.
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1632.22,1641.465,"Because this Court, to my knowledge, has not ever said that you construe taxing statutes by looking at benefits statutes."
2018.17-1042,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1666.61,1671.205,"Mr. Frederick, your argument would go for the railroad as well as the employee, right?"
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1671.205,1671.74,Yes.
2018.17-1042,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1671.74,1680.795,"So this -- this railroad paid a tax that it wasn't required to pay, could it seek a refund?"
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1680.795,1681.90500005,Yes.
2018.17-1042,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1701.04,1703.52,I was -- I was going to ask you if you'd volunteer.
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1703.52,1704.04,And -- yes.
2018.17-1042,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1727.965,1731.305,"No, I follow all of that."
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1752.49000005,1778.35,"Worker's compensation has always been treated differently in the sense that insure -- the employee and the employer contributes to an insurance fund. It's no fault insurance. And for that reason, it is more, I think, appropriately deemed to be an additional payment that is for services rendered, in the same way that sick pay accumulates over time in -- in the appropriate circumstances."
2018.17-1042,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.09,1881.625,"Well, you put an awful lot of weight on that, but I can easily imagine an employer explaining how we work in this company."
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1949.425,1996.06,"Well, if I don't get them all in this response, Justice Breyer, please feel free to interrupt me. But, on the history point, the other side, notwithstanding our challenge, cannot give you one instance, not one, where the IRS issued a deficiency notice because there had been a failure to pay RRTA taxes for an FELA judgment. If you look at the Federal Judicial Center's website, there have been something like 71,000 FELA suits filed just since 1970. Now, surely, if this had been the way the taxing service had been construing this statute, there would be at least $1 deposited from the Treasury as a result of an FELA judgment and a deficiency notice for a failure to do that. This is all a new argument."
2018.17-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2016.25,2018.02,I'm sorry. Explain that to me.
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2018.02,2018.45,Sure.
2018.17-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2018.45,2019.96,What -- what are they going to do?
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2019.96,2033.135,"What they -- when there's a settlement negotiation, Justice Sotomayor, the question is will you -- will we pay you now for your range of damages or will you run the risk of going to court."
2018.17-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2052.95,2058.055,"I'm sorry. There's a settlement under a FELA action, X amount of money."
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2061.12,2062.22,"No, it doesn't, actually."
2018.17-1042,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2222.89,2225.86,Why -- why do you think the language was taken out?
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2225.86,2244.04,"I think it -- there -- it's actually a good question, Justice Ginsburg. The intimation in the railroad's brief here is that the railroad thought it would be easier to administer without having that language. But there is no -- there are no statements of or legislative history that would suggest exactly why."
2018.17-1042,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2302.81,2305.75,"Well, it's because the time allocation was changed."
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2305.75,2312.3,"Well, you're talking about -- you're -- I think you're making reference, Your Honor, to the paid versus earned --"
2018.17-1042,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2312.3,2312.805,Yes.
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2312.805,2313.42,-- distinction?
2018.17-1042,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2313.42,2313.645,Yes.
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2313.645,2323.075,"But that -- whether the timing thing had happened as a change didn't affect what was being taxed, which was services rendered."
2018.17-1042,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2324.02,2334.4,"I understand that. But it changed -- you didn't need the language anymore, is -- is the argument, right? The ""time lost"" language anymore -- because the -- the allocation had changed?"
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2334.4,2334.49,Well --
2018.17-1042,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2334.49,2335.53,At least that's the argument.
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2335.53,2357.31,"-- their argument goes beyond that, Justice Kavanaugh, and that's when they are saying that the words ""including time lost"" somehow make ""services rendered"" mean not services rendered because time lost is somehow an example or an illustration of the concept of services rendered. As a matter of plain English, that makes absolutely no sense."
2018.17-1042,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2439.15,2453.02,"I thought a key move in the Eighth Circuit decision was interpreting Nierotko, and then it said we recently determined that that definition can't be imported into the RRTA because the FICA tax is payment for employment, which is defined broadly."
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2466.825,2472.265,"Well, again, it goes to the difference between benefits and taxes and the asymmetry there."
2018.17-1042,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2472.95,2474.235,That's not what they were relying on.
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2474.235,2499.015,"Well, no, but what they were -- what -- I think that what -- they were actually relying on the fact that there is an asymmetry between benefits and taxation. And if you take that asymmetry -- let's -- let's just play this out a little bit. If you're a rail worker and you work for four years and 11 months, you paid your RRTA taxes, you do not qualify for benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act because you haven't hit the first five-year threshold."
2018.17-1042,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2725.82,2732.575,You're speculating that juries are aware of railroad retirement benefits and taxation.
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2747.64,2789.98,"The point, Justice Ginsburg, and -- and this is where I think looking again at this Court's decision in Norfolk and Western versus Liepelt is instructive, because, there, if the -- if this is fair game, then why wouldn't it be possible for the worker's lawyer to say, now this -- one part of it's going to be subject to tax, and ask for an instruction that the jury give the after-tax amount that would equate to the lost earnings portion of the judgment. And therein lies the rub, Justice Ginsburg, because, if the lawyers are going to be debating about how the jury is instructed, it surely is fair game for the jury to understand exactly what the law is."
2018.17-1042,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2790.55,2802.16,And has any jury ever been instructed -- has any railroad attorney asked for a jury instruction about railroad retirement tax?
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2802.16,2805.15,"No, because it's never been taxed before."
2018.17-1042,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2837.355,2853.23,"Well, because it wasn't a -- look, the way I'm thinking about it, and perhaps you'll tell me my -- that I'm wrong, but very -- very simply, Congress has loads of statutes spending money."
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2894.17000005,2904.08,"Justice Breyer, let me answer your question in this way: We're not here saying that Mr. Loos is entitled to benefits that he hasn't paid for."
2018.17-1042,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2905.08,2906.06,"No, I understand that."
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2924.62,2925.15,I think that --
2018.17-1042,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2925.15,2925.87,In your view.
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2925.87,2927.07,"In my view, the reason --"
2018.17-1042,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2927.07,2936.13,"We've been quiet about it, by the way, nobody saying a word, but -- and it being nearly years and years and years of the other thing, and then they suddenly changed it, and in your view, why?"
2018.17-1042,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2936.13,2963.22,"I think the reason is that it had very little practical effect because taxes were not being generated on these awards, and there was no real question about the benefits that were -- that were accruing. In most instances, the only time when the benefits side actually matters for these awards is when you can allocate dollars for a few months in order to get beyond the 20-year threshold or the 30-year threshold."
2018.17-1042,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3093.44,3098.535,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Ms. Blatt."
2018.17-1042,3,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3098.535,3124.81,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Ginsburg, on your jury instruction point, I -- I don't think there's anything in the history of American jurisprudence that you get an instruction under FICA that you get to tell the jury to gross-up. So I just don't know where in law they think you'd be even entitled to that instruction. Second, Justice Kavanaugh, in terms of the Nierotko, Quality Stores was a -- was the FICA side."
2018.17-1042,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3130.36,3141.27,"Well, what do we do -- you say that there's no basis for a jury instruction to gross-up, but it -- it sounds like there's for a long time been a jury instruction requiring the jury to -- to net-down."
2018.17-1042,3,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3141.27,3143.37,"Right, and --"
2018.17-1042,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3143.37,3145.61,Isn't what's good for the goose good for the gander on this?
2018.17-1042,3,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3145.61,3146.78,"Sure, if someone wants to argue it."
2018.17-1042,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3172.1,3194.235,"What -- what do you say to Mr. Frederick's point that the reason why the railroad's so interested in this is to increase its leverage in settlement negotiations, where the parties can allocate awards, and -- and here you're arguing pretty strenuously that they shouldn't be able to -- to -- to -- to be -- to take into cognizance the tax issue on -- in -- in a jury judgment?"
2018.17-1042,3,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3194.235,3194.68,Right.
2018.17-1042,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3335.015,3336.19,"Thank you, Ms. Blatt."
