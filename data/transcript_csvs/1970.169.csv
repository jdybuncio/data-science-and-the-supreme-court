1970.169,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,69.369,"We'll hear arguments next in Number 169, Radich against New York."
1970.169,0,39323,richard_g_green,,69.722,74.2,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.169,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,184.385,189.071,Is there a representation of that in the appendix anywhere?
1970.169,0,39323,richard_g_green,,189.071,190.05,It's not in the appendix.
1970.169,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,193.675,195.811,"Only the original, so it hasn't been reproduced?"
1970.169,0,39323,richard_g_green,,195.811,196.645,"No, it has not sir."
1970.169,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,196.645,198.437,We have some many reproductions of it I think --
1970.169,0,39323,richard_g_green,,198.437,199.694,I'm sorry.
1970.169,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,204.044,205.387,The originals have been lodged with the --
1970.169,0,39323,richard_g_green,,205.387,206.343,That's right sir.
1970.169,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,206.343,208.0,Alright.
1970.169,0,39323,richard_g_green,,208.0,223.386,"The -- one of the sculptures as I've mentioned could've been seen from the street, this was the noose figure, the figure in what appeared to be human body hanging from a noose if anyone looked up to the second floor window."
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1644.655,1645.225,Mr. Chief Justice --
1970.169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1645.225,1646.223,Mr. Juviler?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1646.223,1649.283,-- and may it please the Court.
1970.169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1766.642,1789.055,"Could I ask, was it essential or unavoidable for the trial court to hold that while these charges in the language of the statute namely mutilation or defilement or the casting contempt on this, he came down only on casting contempt?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1789.055,1789.275,I would --
1970.169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.275,1791.171,Was this also a mutilation?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1791.171,1798.169,The defendant was charged with mutilation -- with the general language of the subdivision (d) of the penal law.
1970.169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1813.254,1820.255,"And so your answer is yes, so this is the only part of the statute this particular defendant could've been convicted?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1820.255,1821.971,Yes.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1821.971,1824.59,What was the defendant's act?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1824.59,1832.487,"The act was the display of a physically altered actual flag, and the permission --"
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1832.487,1833.948,"Having them in his gallery, right?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1833.948,1835.245,Yes and the --
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1835.245,1836.209,And displaying them to the public?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1836.209,1843.883,The causing of this display and the permitting this display to continue including the day on which the summons was issued.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1843.883,1845.38,You say that's an act?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1845.38,1850.029,An act as opposed to words.
1970.169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1867.989,1879.207,"Well suppose an artist made the statue of an American flag burning, would that be covered too?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1879.207,1889.914,"That would be an easier case I think to defend, and there is a case like that on its way to this Court from New York where a person in public burned the flag."
1970.169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1892.153,1893.862,He made a statue of it?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1893.862,1906.907,"Yes, but the way we analyze this problem of its freedom of expression, there's a continuum between conduct, pure conduct and pure speech words."
1970.169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1907.224,1914.714,Suppose he makes the statue of burning Uncle Sam?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1914.714,1921.134,There would be no statute as -- that I know of that would prevent that other some law dealing with fire regulations.
1970.169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1921.134,1928.919,"Suppose this man kept this statue in his -- the one involved here in this moment, does statute covers it?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1928.919,1930.119,"No, this law deals only --"
1970.169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1930.119,1935.172,"Suppose he sold it to somebody, would the statute cover?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1935.172,1939.239,Not unless this act occurred in public -- there was some public act.
1970.169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1940.235,1950.431,"Well, suppose he gave it to him on the street corner, would the statute apply, in broad daylight?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1950.431,1952.045,I doubt -- I don't know.
1970.169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1966.359,1968.036,Then this has to be public then?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1968.036,1970.849,"Yes, this has to be public."
1970.169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1980.862,1982.279,One other thing.
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1991.744,2000.288,"I think that historically, the impetus was the misuse of the flag in some political campaigns and commercial advertising after the Civil War."
1970.169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2000.288,2002.297,"But it's not the state flag, isn't it?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2002.297,2002.842,Yes.
1970.169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2002.842,2006.971,But the states are protected and Congress didn't get around till the (Inaudible)
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2006.971,2008.355,"Yes, the --"
1970.169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2008.355,2009.97,Any reason for that?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2009.97,2011.974,"Historically, I don't know what the reason is."
1970.169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2556.336,2576.088,"Well, are you implying by that Mr. Juviler that if he didn't have in the window, but had it only in his studio for sale, so that it would be observed only by people who sought out the studio, there would be no criminal act?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2576.088,2580.402,It would be much harder to defend such a prosecution.
1970.169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2682.143,2690.118,"Well, in the defining of the statute, is there any difference to whether it's an official flag or a homemade flag?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2690.118,2694.9,"I'm -- by homemade, I mean something that is not of cloth banner but --"
1970.169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2694.9,2701.811,But is there any difference between the 5 and 10-cents store American flag and a silver/gold tip?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2701.811,2707.905,"No, no difference, but what we have in this particular case is an actual American flag."
1970.169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2709.014,2713.331,"But supposing the 48 stars flag, would that be alright?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2713.331,2720.577,"Yes, that would violate the statute as it did in the Street case -- as it could have done in the Street case."
1970.169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2720.577,2723.918,"Well, how about a 13 star?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2727.044,2728.681,Yes.
1970.169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2754.38,2762.119,"What's your position perhaps you've already stated it, on contempt to by speech, by words rather than by act?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2763.083,2764.297,The statute --
1970.169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2764.297,2766.234,-- surely covers that?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2766.234,2776.347,"-- as written, it covers that, but in essence, that part of a statute has been written off as a result of this Court's decision in the Street case."
1970.169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2776.347,2776.883,And --
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2776.883,2779.872,And the Court of Appeals so held in this case.
1970.169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2779.872,2793.577,"And so if you deliver the same message by an act, namely if you cast contempt by an act, you say the statute is valid if you do it by an act rather than by words?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2793.577,2794.835,Yes.
1970.169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2806.756,2816.514,Then what is the state -- what more interest does a state have in proscribing the message delivered by an act than the message delivered by words?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2816.514,2826.639,"It's probably the -- it might well be the same interest, but in the one sense dealing with words, that interest has been deemed to be subordinate to the First Amendment."
1970.169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2828.052,2830.053,"Well, why is that though?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2839.404,2851.367,"Yes, that is the second major public interest, if that's what Your Honor is referring to, the interest in preserving order and preventing a breach of the peace."
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2876.403,2900.515,"Mr. Juviler, am I wrong in my understanding that the cases on which you rely distinguishing verbal communication from communication by act, all involve, all involve cases where the act itself, the conduct, could be made, could constitutionally be made illegal for some other reason?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2955.898,2957.128,Yes.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2957.583,2970.681,What interest does the state have to prevent the exhibition of something as contrasted to prevent the verbal expression of something in this case?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2970.681,2979.274,The two interests are the interest in preserving this national symbol when the display involves particularly the actual flag.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2992.392,2993.48,"Well, what is the difference?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3005.995,3008.118,"In terms of the fighting act, fighting word?"
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3008.118,3014.589,In terms of either one of those purported justifications?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3014.589,3019.55,"Well, the court has -- perhaps you're right that the court has taken a tougher position."
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3019.55,3021.262,What get -- just give me a case where --
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3021.262,3028.311,In the Street case for example when the majority of this Court felt that the conviction of Street may have rested on his utterances.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3028.311,3029.697,"Yes, on his expression."
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3029.697,3030.03,Yes.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3030.03,3032.547,Rather than his mutilation --
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3032.547,3032.661,Burning.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3032.661,3035.532,-- mutilation or defacement or destruction of a flag.
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3035.532,3035.773,Yes.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3035.773,3040.71,"And in this case, there is no conviction for mutilating, defacing or destroying a flag?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3040.71,3041.159,No.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3041.159,3043.253,But merely for casting contempt upon it?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3043.253,3043.745,Yes.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3061.94,3063.19,That's the only act as I understand your --
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3063.19,3073.877,"Yes, a display can be conduct if the statute that deals with display is addressed to the non-speech elements of that conduct."
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3073.967,3076.471,"Well, what is the non-speech element here?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3076.471,3079.688,"The use of the actual flag, a physical object."
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3086.768,3087.729,Caldwell or Cabell --
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3087.729,3090.187,"In this -- well, that's one."
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3099.322,3100.262,"Oh, hung up the dirty laundry."
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3100.262,3101.159,Some dirty laundry.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3101.159,3102.967,Yes.
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3102.967,3112.074,"Now, the Chief Judge Full, then Judge Full writing for the Court of Appeals found that there was a conduct element even though this was merely a display --"
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3112.074,3115.761,"Common law nuisance, but that, there was no such finding here, was there?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3115.761,3117.602,"Yes, indeed there was."
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3117.602,3117.895,What was the --
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3117.895,3135.429,"By the majority, I would say the majority of the Court of Appeals and by the legislature itself made a finding that a public display of a physical flag that cast contempt on the flag is a nuisance in that sense."
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3142.419,3142.854,"Well, that will be --"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3142.854,3144.528,That made -- that can be regulated.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3144.528,3166.781,"The words of the statute in issue here as I understand it are those words that make it an offense to anyone -- for anyone who shall publicly cast contempt on a flag by act, considering not displaying, nothing about a nuisance."
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3166.781,3170.909,"Well, we have -- the statute has been applied in this case to a display."
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3183.877,3200.523,"My only -- I just wondered if you had any case where -- in which a distinction was made between verbal communication and communication by conduct, where the conduct was not conduct of a kind, it could be proscribed?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3200.523,3201.062,No.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3206.927,3208.339,Simply because of what it communicates.
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3208.339,3208.844,Yes.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3209.173,3209.754,Is that what you're saying?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3209.754,3220.225,"Not because of what it communicates in terms of views, but because it uses the flag, just as though one were to use the walls of this building for writhing a peace symbol --"
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3220.225,3227.199,"This defendant, this man is been convicted simply exhibited this -- the sculpture, right?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3227.199,3228.234,Yes.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3228.234,3229.365,And that was his conduct?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3229.365,3230.43,Right.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3230.43,3232.854,That's the only act to use the --
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3232.854,3232.927,That's correct.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3232.927,3234.479,-- statutory word that you rely on?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3234.479,3235.026,That's correct.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3235.026,3236.888,"His exhibition of the sculpture, correct?"
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3236.888,3242.531,He was not prosecuted for his beliefs for his verbal utterances.
1970.169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3242.531,3244.517,Nor for defacing a flag nor for mutilating a flag?
1970.169,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,3244.517,3244.647,"No, no."
1970.169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3244.647,3267.316,Do you rely to any extent or put it this way how much do you rely on the provocative nature of this act that might lead a group of soldiers home on leave to pick up some stones and throw it through the windows if they could throw that far?
