1975.74-1270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,41.158,We will hear arguments next in Train against Colorado Public Interest Group.
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,43.876,46.852,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,439.472,441.332,Rather radioactive?
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,441.332,448.111,There are other ways of producing radioactive material and I am a not scientific expert enough to know what is more or less radioactive.
1975.74-1270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,978.437,981.158,Of course those two are not necessary completely inconsistent.
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,991.927,1009.69,They are not absolutely inconsistent but I think it is inconceivable that if Congress on the one hand writes a statute and then directs and the report that they are only doing with materials that are not regulated AEC that they would want the EPA to regulate that material too.
1975.74-1270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1368.139,1372.394,Was it the same Congress that has passed the Water Act or was it the following?
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1372.394,1377.409,"It was the following Congress, Mr. Justice."
1975.74-1270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1381.153,1382.735,Mr. Randolph before you go on--
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1382.735,1384.477,Yes Mr. Justice Powell?
1975.74-1270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1384.477,1391.793,"Water Control Act does not create any separate on your commission, as I understand that there is an administrator though, is it not?"
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1391.793,1399.346,The duties of administering the Order Act were given to the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
1975.74-1270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1399.346,1404.39,"So, there is no separate staff created by the Water Control Act?"
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1404.39,1405.76,"So far as I am aware, no."
1975.74-1270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1405.76,1406.597,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1406.597,1413.479,"There may be separate commissions for advice on, for example, sewer problems and --"
1975.74-1270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1413.479,1422.142,So only administrative interpretation of the 1974 Act has been by the AEC or it is now called--
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1422.142,1422.704,EPA.
1975.74-1270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1422.704,1424.029,EPA?
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1424.029,1436.693,"I might say that as we said in the footnote in our briefs that the views I am expressing to this Court, are the views that are expressed in our brief are concurred in by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Energy and Research Development administration."
1975.74-1270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1453.125,1463.814,The way we have here disavowed by the EPA who is the administrator which is a party here?
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1463.814,1467.5,"Yes, the administrator and the agency itself are the only parties --"
1975.74-1270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1467.5,1478.345,"The only parties but you say the success of the AEC, the NRC takes a quite consistent position that it does have jurisdiction?"
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1478.345,1479.202,Oh! That is right.
1975.74-1270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1481.502,1483.392,They have in any event?
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1483.392,1490.979,"They have I think in Section 209, two of the Atomic Energy Act, Congress said, you are prohibited from giving up any regulatory authority --"
1975.74-1270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1490.979,1493.901,But their jurisdiction is exclusive?
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1493.901,1532.19,"Their jurisdiction had been considered exclusive until the Court of Appeals decided this case below and in fact, as the Court has probably aware, again Mr. Justice Rehnquist, there is a possibility of explaining this but in the Northern States Power case, that was decided by the Eighth Circuit and decided in discussed in the brief, the Court of Appeals there held that the Federal Law, the Atomic Energy Act preempted the States so that one of the reasons was that it was necessary and indeed a legislative history of Atomic Energy Act indicated clearly that it was important for one agency to have exclusive control over this dangerous material."
1975.74-1270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1537.355,1546.27,Are they members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission appointed for a term of years or they removed well by the president?
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1546.27,1549.658,I do not know.
1975.74-1270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1549.658,1565.597,"It seems that might be of some importance because a response to the argument you just made is that there is one president and presumably if he thinks that two are getting out of coordination, he can coordinate them by removing one or telling one what to do."
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1567.665,1570.123,I know we can remove the EPA administrator.
1975.74-1270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1570.123,1575.526,"Yes, but the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has fixed terms."
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1581.976,1582.855,I suppose it is right.
1975.74-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1674.675,1690.814,"(Inaudible) It will all be whatever this new agency success for the Atomic Energy Commission were to say, no you cannot introduce this, and EPA were to say yes, you can."
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1695.565,1696.387,Absolutely.
1975.74-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1777.751,1781.573,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1781.573,1782.597,Yes.
1975.74-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1783.271,1789.231,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1789.231,1799.448,It is sort of like the Clear Air Act System where the EPA set the ambient quality and then air quality and then --
1975.74-1270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1799.448,1806.71,"The EPA there states do not have the right for specific source, limitations except their own?"
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1806.71,1809.615,"Well, the states do regulate the discharge--"
1975.74-1270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1809.615,1818.889,I know but at least one authority can decide on what is the specific source that may contribute to the pollution of the air.
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1840.119,1840.752,That is right.
1975.74-1270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.752,1844.459,No one else --
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1844.459,1856.448,"Well, no, May it please the court, the EPA General Standards apply to the release of radioactive material from the sources that are governed by the NRC."
1975.74-1270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1861.394,1866.767,Does the EPA set specific standards for release from a specific plan?
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1866.767,1876.141,"No, that was a question that arose in the administration Mr. Justice White."
1975.74-1270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1876.141,1877.165,The Water Act?
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1877.165,1878.938,That is right.
1975.74-1270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.801,1906.601,The EPA says there can only be a hundred in the water.
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1914.952,1915.985,"Total, cumulative, right?"
1975.74-1270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1915.985,1934.917,"Suppose though that there are other sources contributing to the radioactive pollution of radioactive materials of the kind, for example, that you -- so far as I am aware there can be no other sources because this is exclusively -- do you say that there are other kinds of radioactive materials that are not over which the AEC does not have?"
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1934.917,1937.627,Radioactive isotopes which is used mainly in hospitals and I think--
1975.74-1270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.627,1939.305,But what about in mines?
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1939.305,1942.2,The EPA regulates the mining?
1975.74-1270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.2,1951.939,So you say that the only sources for radioactive materials would be within the exclusive jurisdiction of AEC?
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1951.939,1959.074,From man produced radioactive materials other than radioactive isotopes produced by accelerators.
1975.74-1270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1971.792,1985.03,"So, you are saying that the EPA may say that these ten sources can only contribute a hundred. But they cannot say that this is one of the ten sources may only contribute ten?"
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1985.03,1986.38,"No, that is right."
1975.74-1270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1986.38,1989.364,Is that what the fight is all about?
1975.74-1270,0,38517,randolph,,1989.364,1992.788,Who controls the specific discharge limits from an individual plant?
1975.74-1270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2004.548,2014.617,Mr. Mastbaum?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,2014.617,2018.375,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2516.242,2521.426,What do you mean when you say it was specifically rejected by the Conference Committee?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,2521.426,2529.282,Mr. Justice the Petitioners have cited a portion of the House Report.
1975.74-1270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2563.213,2567.305,But it is a little strong to say that they specifically rejected it.
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,2585.919,2609.902,"In light of the microscopic scrutiny that Senator Muskie emphasized the Conference Bill received, it can only be assumed that the fact that the Conference Bill and the Conference port contains no statement which would indicate an intent to exclude radioactive materials regulated under the Atomic Energy Act as a very expressed and very strong rejection."
1975.74-1270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2609.902,2617.703,"Well, when you say it can only be assumed, I think you concede some of what I am asking you."
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2617.703,2621.767,"The Conference Bill did not change the words of radioactive materials, did it?"
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,2621.767,2622.621,"No, it did not."
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2622.621,2628.411,And that is what the argument is here as to what those words mean?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,2628.411,2630.157,"That is precisely, thus--"
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2630.157,2635.124,The exceptions that were in the House Report were the exceptions to the radioactive materials?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,2635.124,2635.95,That is right.
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2636.647,2648.057,So that the Conference Report or the Conference Action did not report to widen or limit whatever the words radioactive materials might have been.
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,2648.057,2664.086,"That is precisely right, however, in light of the fact that the conference specifically considered the scope of the term and in light of Senator Muskie's statement that the Conference that tried to writing to us, clearly as possible the intent of Congress."
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2664.086,2675.212,"But what about the statements on the House Floor after the Conference Report, did Mr. Anderson not make the statement as to what conference did?"
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,2675.212,2676.833,"That is correct, however–-"
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2676.833,2684.551,Did he not say that the original understanding as to the meaning or say the scope of radioactive materials had not been changed?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,2684.551,2686.339,Let me address it specifically.
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2690.152,2693.231,Let us talk about the House.
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,2698.7,2702.884,I think it is necessary for me in order to explain that to move over to the Senate.
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2784.337,2789.141,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,2789.141,2801.325,"If I could just – In the treaty signed on Federal Environment Law, Mr. Zener analyzed such discrepancies in connection with Section 13 and 14 of the Water Act as follows."
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2825.857,2828.31,As to one who is on the senate?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,2828.31,2835.974,"Well, if ones in the Senate are dubious, then I would rely on the Conference Report which clearly indicates that there is no exception."
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2835.974,2843.871,(Inaudible) that could change the meaning of radioactive materials as it came to that?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,2845.124,2851.901,But while the conferees considered the extent of the exclusions and the scope of the definition.
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2851.901,2856.734,As with respect to radioactive materials?
1975.74-1270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2856.734,2870.909,"The Conference Report does not help you, I do not think in so far as establishing your position?"
1975.74-1270,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2870.909,2875.523,"Mr. Mastbaum, may I ask you this question."
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,2888.091,2895.196,"No, I do not, what will occur will be that the EPA will have the sole authority to set effluent limitations."
1975.74-1270,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2920.85,2927.356,And the NRC Authority that it is exercised for 20 years will be taken away from it?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,2927.356,2929.209,"No, that is not true."
1975.74-1270,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2936.712,2945.412,But that authority that had existed would be limited by the new Act.
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,2984.218,2987.103,"Well, I do not concede that there was silence in Congress."
1975.74-1270,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2987.103,2990.65,I know you rely on the language in the statute itself but--
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,2990.65,2998.847,"Well, I also rely on language that one can find in the legislative history."
1975.74-1270,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3037.301,3048.426,But did not the Atomic Energy Act vest have the exclusive control in the commission of Atomic Energy?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3048.426,3053.042,At that time it was adapted 20 years early than the Water Pollution Control Act.
1975.74-1270,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3053.042,3070.095,But you are saying the 1974 Act subtracted a certain portion of that exclusive control lies thereby silent so far as specific discussion of it was concerned in a Congressional Legislative history?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3070.095,3072.143,"Well, I do not concede silence."
1975.74-1270,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3072.143,3073.588,Right.
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3073.588,3077.252,You have not appointed anything very specific so far.
1975.74-1270,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3077.252,3084.029,"Well, except the language in the Act which I concede gives you quite an arguable position?"
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3084.029,3098.26,"Well, if the exception, it must be remembered that what the government is seeking to exclude from the Water Act is a very significant form of pollution."
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3118.885,3121.347,In your plain language?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3121.347,3121.739,Yes.
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3122.552,3135.826,Their plain language argument might have certain amount of substance if there had not been the Atomic Energy Act at all?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3135.826,3137.007,I have--
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3137.007,3153.242,"But do you not think that when you have two Congressional statutes and one of them -- and they seem to be clashing or they seem to be inconsistent, isn't there some ground for making room for both of them?"
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3153.242,3157.283,"The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, I think would take presence."
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3158.211,3159.954,Why do you say that?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3181.37,3191.264,The Water Acts specifically states any agency's authority which is inconsistent with the Water Act must yield to the Water Act 1371.
1975.74-1270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3234.649,3244.587,"With the Section of the Senate Bill that the Senate Report was addressing to there, was that carried over verbatim into the final bill?"
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3244.587,3250.575,"If it was a verbatim, it is very closed, it dealt with new sources of pollution that the EPA should regulate."
1975.74-1270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3274.46,3281.278,But you criticized the reliance on the House Committee report because you say the Conference Committee did not go the same way.
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3296.437,3308.463,"Section 306, the one I have been referring to is the same as a comparable provision of the Senate Bill and the House Amendment so therefore, they apparently do accept the Senate version."
1975.74-1270,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3308.463,3317.003,Do you say that the Energy Commission has no jurisdiction over how much pollutions are put in the water?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3317.003,3340.493,"Well, I would say that what would happen if this Court affirms the Tenth Circuit would be that the Environmental Protection Agency would set effluent limitations for radioactive materials, then the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or ERDA would ensure that facilities subject to their licensing authority would meet those limitations--"
1975.74-1270,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3340.493,3344.537,So they would have no independent authority at all anymore.
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3344.537,3347.835,They would have the authority to regulate those facilities but they would not have the authority--
1975.74-1270,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3347.835,3352.908,There will be no authority to regulating the pollution?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3352.908,3357.104,"Yes, they could regulate the pollution but they could not establish the limits."
1975.74-1270,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3357.104,3362.281,So now you got Congress deliberately setting up two complete intimations.
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3362.281,3362.404,I do not think--
1975.74-1270,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3362.404,3364.534,Do you think Congress meant to do that?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3364.534,3367.636,I do not think that we have two competing agencies here.
1975.74-1270,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3369.913,3372.527,"You either have two, one is superior?"
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3372.527,3373.759,"Well, I think the missions and functions of this--"
1975.74-1270,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3373.759,3379.981,"What I want to know what is your position, is the EPA superior?"
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3379.981,3384.828,"With respect to matters related to environmental pollution, the EPA is superior."
1975.74-1270,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3384.828,3387.909,And that right has been taken away from the commission?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3387.909,3391.29,That is correct with respect to Water Pollution?
1975.74-1270,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3391.29,3410.753,"Is there any evidence in the record, any testimony in support of the view that the Atomic Energy Commission had failed adequately to protect the public interest in the discharge of radioactive materials into waters of our country?"
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3410.753,3420.216,We do not claim that there was any problem with respect to that but the Water Act establishes a new regulatory scheme with specific effluent limitations.
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3449.728,3458.535,"Mr. Mastbaum, what do you understand by the statement in the government’s brief as to what it concedes the EPA would still be able to do even if the government wins?"
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3495.071,3503.778,I think the point that you make is very important because the government concedes that EPA has responsibility to set general or ambient environmental standards for radiation.
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3504.878,3513.607,"When they say it from major categories of sources, would not power plants, would not the facilities managed by the AEC be a major category?"
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3513.607,3514.501,"Well, that is true."
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3525.842,3545.04,"So you are just making effective argument but assume that the AEC after the general standards were set by the EPA, honestly carried out its task and limited the radiation and kept the radiation release within the limits of the EPA."
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3548.253,3550.984,"Well, I am not persuaded that they would do that."
1975.74-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3550.984,3553.954,"So, your argument is that they will not do it?"
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3559.287,3565.162,My argument is that the Water Act clearly and unequivocally includes all radioactive materials.
1975.74-1270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3578.708,3590.073,Will the states come in by the back door if not the front of the EPA as given the authority that you contend because of the provisions of the Water Bill.
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3590.073,3600.906,The question of whether or not the states would be preempted from regulating radioactive materials pursuant to the Water Act has never a reason at this time--
1975.74-1270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3600.906,3606.193,I did not mean by preemption but I meant by participation in the EPA process.
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3606.193,3608.177,The role of the states would be one.
1975.74-1270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3624.747,3629.21,But that would be a result somewhat contrary to the (Inaudible) case would it not be?
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3631.425,3633.718,"No, it would not."
1975.74-1270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3653.41,3664.044,"Well, it is admittedly not direct but the states would have a role in regulating that they would not have if your contention were rejected."
1975.74-1270,1,21210,david_c_mastbaum,,3664.044,3674.885,They would have a very limited role pursuant to a Federal Regulatory Scheme.
1975.74-1270,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3675.444,3676.857,Thank you Mr. Mastbaum.
