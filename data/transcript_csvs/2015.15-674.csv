2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.935,"We will hear argument today in Case No. 15-674, United States v. Texas, et al. General Verrilli."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,7.935,21.81,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Secretary of Homeland Security has decided to defer removal of the class of aliens who are parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs, have lived in the country continuously since 2010, and have not committed crimes."
2015.15-674,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,47.95,71.55,"Couldn't the government simply, as was suggested in one of the briefs, have given these children -- parents of citizens or LPRs, given them identity cards that say ""low priority,"" and would there be any difference between that and what this DAPA Guidance does?"
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,71.55,74.21,"That is -- that's a very important point, Justice Ginsburg."
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,96.125,101.61,"General, maybe it would make logical progression if you began with your standing argument first."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,101.61,101.945,Yes.
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,161.17,180.43,"Well, but if -- if they change that policy to avoid the injury that they allege, in other words, if they did not confer -- offer driver's licenses to those who are lawfully present because of your policy, avoided that injury, you would sue them, wouldn't you?"
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,180.43,181.99,I'm not sure at all that we would sue them.
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,183.69,183.96,"No, no."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,195.75,200.465,"Chief Justice, the key word in your question is ""hypothesize."" And that's the point, it seems to me."
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,202.9,210.715,"No, because they have what seems to me a perfectly legitimate policy, is they want driver's license to be available to people who are lawfully present here."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,226.26,229.635,The current policy is not as Your Honor describes it.
2015.15-674,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,266.05,277.66,"But suppose -- suppose the State of Texas said this policy that the government has announced is invalid; it violates separation of powers; therefore, we will not issue licenses to this class of persons?"
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,277.66,278.93,"Well, I think the point --"
2015.15-674,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,278.93,282.45,It seems to me that the Federal government could say this is not for you to say.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,282.45,283.395,That's correct.
2015.15-674,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,287.62,294.385,"But that's the whole point of this suit, isn't it? They don't want to give driver's licenses to the beneficiaries of DAPA."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,294.385,295.3,"Well, I think --"
2015.15-674,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,295.3,301.3,"And unless you can tell us that there is some way that they could achieve that, then I don't see how there is not injury in fact."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,301.3,304.08,"I disagree with that, Justice Alito, but --"
2015.15-674,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,304.08,305.72,You disagree with which part of it?
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,305.72,308.07,I think all of it. (Laughter.)
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,308.07,311.44,Texas law and policy now does not express that judgment.
2015.15-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,315.76,319.545,"General, when you say that, I'm looking at their law."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,343.51,347.17,"Yes, Justice Sotomayor. That's one thing I'm saying that's quite important, but it even goes beyond that."
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,347.28,348.63,"Oh, but they want to do that."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,352.92,365.61,"No, but I guess, Mr. Chief Justice, what I'm trying to get across is that the policy, as it's written down and which, it seems to me, has to be taken as the authoritative statement of the Texas policy, is not just that they want to give licenses to people who are lawfully present."
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,373.52,373.76,Okay.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,378.51,378.67,No.
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,379.15,384.515,"Their argument is, we're going to give driver's license to people subject to deferred action."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,416.06,429.65,"The fundamental problem, Mr. Chief Justice, is -- with that theory -- is that it requires this Court essentially to issue an advisory opinion about whether this new law of theirs would, in fact, be preempted."
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,440.16,444.955,"So you're saying they would not have injury because they can do this, and you might lose the suit."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,444.955,446.18,That's correct.
2015.15-674,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,448.04,451.43,"I mean, General, I don't understand why you wouldn't lose the suit."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,465.22,468.55,"Justice Kagan, I'd like to be able to agree with you about that."
2015.15-674,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,487.67,491.945,You're saying they have inflicted this injury on themselves because they have options.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,513.51,515.4,"So, it would --"
2015.15-674,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,515.4,520.49,"I think the Chief Justice asked you that question before, and you didn't get a chance to answer it."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,521.68,523.91,It would depend on what they did and why they did it.
2015.15-674,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,528.89,535.84,"I mean, if you're saying to -- you're saying to us they lack standing because they have an option, but we're not going to tell you now whether it's a lawful option."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,538.0,540.78,"We might -- depending on what they, we might well think it's unlawful."
2015.15-674,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,546.8,549.87,But there's Article III standing for declaratory relief all the time.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,556.08,583.715,"And I think that gets to the point -- that gets to the point, Justice Kennedy. If right now, tomorrow, today instead of suing us they had come into court and said we want a declaratory judgment, we are thinking about -- in light of this change in Federal law, we're thinking about changing our State law to a different law, and we want a declaratory judgment that if we do so, it won't be preempted, I think you would throw that case out in a nanosecond as hypothetical, and that is this case. That is precisely the situation we are in right now."
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,588.8,598.41,"Do we really, or is it enough -- is it enough that they would have to be put through litigation in order to escape the policy? You say, well, they can just not do this."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,603.14,612.96,"I don't think that could be enough, Mr. Chief Justice, because you could have said that in Pennsylvania v. New Jersey or in any number of cases, that they may have to incur some cost with respect to --"
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,612.96,626.77,"Well, how is that different? If I -- if I own, say, a parcel of land and it's subject to some government regulatory program that I think is a taking under -- under existing law, why isn't the answer, well, you should go buy some other land that's not subject to it."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,638.94,647.51,"It's a difference between -- in your -- in your proposed hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, that's a direct action against the land owner by the government."
2015.15-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,671.91,695.115,"Mr. General, in the normal course of things, let's assume that Texas decides tomorrow to change its law, and it says, now, contrary to what the -- its law says right at this moment that it's not going to give licenses to immigrants with deferred action."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,700.315,701.065,Precisely.
2015.15-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,701.065,706.935,"And make either an equal protection or any number of preemption argument, whatever."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,710.925,711.645,Of course.
2015.15-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,711.645,719.35,"And it could raise legitimately full standing to raise any defense in law, correct?"
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,719.35,719.94,Yes.
2015.15-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,719.94,722.85,It could then say that DAPA is illegal --
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,722.85,723.32,Yes.
2015.15-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,723.32,726.015,-- correct? So there is a cause.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,730.88,734.75,"And -- and I think that points out -- I mean, it really goes to what the Court said in Raines v. Byrd."
2015.15-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,750.23,756.785,Your argument is -- do I have this right? Imagine a Federal statute.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,839.395,867.6,"The -- I have to -- I have to caveat my answer, because I think if the second law is an immigration law that says we're going to make an immigration policy judgment that's going to result in additional people being in the State, then I don't think they would have standing. But the fundamental point, I think, of importance here is that the premise that the first -- of the first law that they are required to give driver's licences is not present here."
2015.15-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,867.6,869.71,I have no doubt it isn't present here.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,874.58,885.99,"And I tried to answer that and tell you why I think the premise is different. I did try to answer you and then tell you why I think the premise is different. But I -- but I do think -- and I think this is -- you know, there's a sort of a shoe-on-the-other-foot issue here."
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,916.01,923.55,Is the injury here any more indirect and speculative than the injury in Massachusetts against EPA?
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,923.55,923.9,Yes.
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,981.295,983.27,Maybe I could ask you to switch.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,983.27,984.675,I was just going to ask whether I could.
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1016.54,1019.87,"Before you get to that, could I ask you a question about the scope of your argument?"
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1019.87,1020.14,Sure.
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1020.14,1032.32,"Under your argument, could the President grant deferred removal to every unlawful -- unlawfully present alien in the United States right now?"
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1032.32,1033.235,Definitely not.
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1033.235,1033.76,Why not?
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1033.76,1050.82,"Here are the limits. Because the deferred action has -- over time, there have been built up a set of administrative limits, which I'll talk about, some administrative policy limits, and then there's substantive statutory limits. The administrative policy limits are these: Deferred action has always been for the lowest priorities for removal."
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1051.54,1051.79,I'm sorry.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1054.3,1054.69,Correct.
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1055.48,1065.2,"So that somehow binds the Executive branch now, the fact that -- I mean, this hasn't been approved by the Executive branch prior to this point, either, and yet it's a fairly significant departure."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1065.2,1071.82,"Let me -- let me -- I don't -- I wouldn't agree with that premise, Mr. Chief Justice, but let me walk through it. So it's -- you've got to be the lowest priority."
2015.15-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1100.24,1103.73,"But the Chief is going more fundamentally, General."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1123.63,1125.29,A couple -- a couple of things about that.
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1141.68,1142.16,Okay.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1144.07,1145.75,Not aliens detained at the border.
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1145.75,1146.0,Okay.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1147.28,1161.81,"Seems to me it would follow from that, that people who are recently arrived -- recently made it into the country, if they aren't detained at the border, we couldn't give deferred action to them either, because seems to me that would undermine the policy judgment of trying to maximize --"
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1161.81,1161.91,Okay.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1164.52,1172.465,And then -- and then there are specific statutory provisions that cover some categories of aliens like people with asylum.
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1181.87,1182.5,I'm sorry.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1195.265,1195.52,No.
2015.15-674,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1212.92,1228.63,"But if the President did what the Chief Justice hypothesized, suppose the President said, you know, there was a time when we had open borders in the United States, and I think that's the right policy, so we're just not going to remove anybody."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1229.96,1234.02,"Well, obviously, we're doing more or less the opposite now in terms of what we're doing --"
2015.15-674,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1234.02,1234.53,I understand.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1238.275,1239.58,"Yeah, I -- yes."
2015.15-674,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1254.7,1257.245,"Well, it's four million people from where we are now."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1257.245,1258.33,"Well, you know, that's a big number."
2015.15-674,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1259.34,1264.365,"And that's -- and that's the whole point, is that you've talked about discretion here."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1273.365,1273.91,So --
2015.15-674,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1273.91,1283.015,All of the cases -- the briefs go on for pages to the effect that the President has admitted a certain number of people and then Congress approves it.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1291.65,1293.16,I don't -- I don't think it's upside down.
2015.15-674,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1298.825,1318.035,"General Verrilli, how much -- please, how much of a factor is the reality that we have 11.3 million undocumented aliens in the country, and Congress, the Legislature, has provided funds for removing about four million."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1321.87,1322.38,Right.
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1323.56,1346.23,"You started out telling us that the enforcement priorities were not at issue; that -- that the problem was the benefits that flow from that, the work authorization, the earned income tax credit, the Social Security benefits, the Medicare benefits. So as I understand it -- and I think this is the point you made -- the other side is not disputing the fact that you have authority to exercise discretion."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1346.23,1346.6,Correct.
2015.15-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1352.965,1362.32,"Mr. General, before you go on, I -- just to make sure we have -- we're on the same page, you only deport 400,000, not four million."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1362.32,1363.36,It's not four million. Forgive me.
2015.15-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1363.36,1363.82,So we have --
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1363.82,1363.91,-- yes.
2015.15-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1365.74,1373.62,"So we have -- we have basically 10 million, nine hundred thousand people that cannot be deported because there's not enough resources, correct?"
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1373.62,1374.03,That's correct.
2015.15-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1374.03,1376.265,So they are here whether we want them or not.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1376.265,1387.63,"And the key point is that we have always had a policy that says when you have -- when your presence is going to be officially tolerated, you're not here, you're violating the immigration laws by being here."
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1405.37,1409.43,I have to ask you about two pages in your reply brief.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1431.515,1435.91,"I actually had no trouble writing it, Mr. Chief Justice. (Laughter.)"
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1435.91,1442.62,"The reason I had no problem writing it is because that phrase, ""lawful presence,"" has caused a terrible amount of confusion in this case; I realize it."
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1467.395,1470.69,Lawfully present does not mean you're legally present in the United States.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1470.69,1470.79,Right.
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1471.19,1472.75,"I'm sorry, that -- just so I get that right."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1472.75,1473.08,Yes.
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1473.08,1475.75,Lawfully present does not mean you're legally present.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1475.75,1476.39,Correct.
2015.15-674,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1476.39,1484.22,But they are -- the DAPA beneficiaries are -- may lawfully work in the United States; isn't that correct?
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1484.22,1485.06,That's right.
2015.15-674,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1485.06,1491.17,And how is it possible to lawfully work in the United States without lawfully being in the United States?
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1491.17,1496.97,"There are millions of people, millions of people other than the DAPA recipients about whom this is true right now."
2015.15-674,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1502.17,1503.82,I'm just talking about the English language.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1505.31,1505.92,"Well, let me --"
2015.15-674,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1505.92,1510.37,How can you -- how can it be lawful to work here but not lawful to be here?
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1510.37,1527.23,"It's -- let me just go through the reality here, and -- and I'll give you some sense of just how disruptive a ruling would be to accept their theory on -- on who can lawfully work in the United States. Right now, since 2008, one category of people who can get work authorization are people applying for adjustment of status."
2015.15-674,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1550.26,1552.54,"But those are statutory categories, are they not?"
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1552.54,1553.555,"No, no."
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1569.16,1574.945,"In those other -- in those other categories, did you say that those people were lawfully present in the United States?"
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1574.945,1575.37,No.
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1575.58,1576.8,But you said that here.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1576.8,1582.655,But the -- but the key point is that their argument about why we can't give work authorization is a statutory argument.
2015.15-674,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1620.52,1621.16,General -- please.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1621.8,1623.44,The third point is the consequences point.
2015.15-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1638.12,1641.25,Do they have a way of attacking that 1986 --
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1641.25,1642.12,"Yes, they could --"

2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1642.75,1643.25,Absolutely.
2015.15-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1645.27,1648.21,And that would be under Section 553(c)?
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1648.21,1648.37,Right.
2015.15-674,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1649.15,1649.83,Did they do that here?
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1649.83,1651.37,"No, they did not do that here."
2015.15-674,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1651.54,1652.11,Could --
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1652.11,1653.15,"I'm sorry, Justice Kagan."
2015.15-674,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1653.15,1657.61,Could you have done the exact same thing without using that phrase in the DAPA documents?
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1657.61,1658.51,"Yeah, absolutely."
2015.15-674,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1678.94,1680.69,You were asked about an APA action.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1691.5,1692.31,I don't --

2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1692.7,1694.82,"You know, forgive me, Justice Kennedy."
2015.15-674,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1699.929,1705.46,They would have -- they would have standing to object if the rulemaking hearing came out the wrong way.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1705.46,1711.89,"Oh, I think if we're -- if we're talking about whether there's a -- a notice-and-comment issue here, I -- you've decided that they have standing."
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1718.28,1719.01,"General, when he announced --"
2015.15-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1719.01,1721.54,"But they don't have standing in the Court, necessarily."
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1723.325,1723.64,"Yeah, no --"
2015.15-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1723.64,1724.27,-- to bring actions in --
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1724.27,1732.13,"Sorry, I wasn't clear, Justice Breyer. If this Court decides -- if this Court gets to the notice-and-comment issue here, this Court will have decided that they have Article III standing."
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1733.4,1749.49,"When he announced -- when he announced -- the President announced DACA, the predecessor provision, he said that if you broadened it -- this is a quote, ""Then, essentially, I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally."" What was he talking about?"
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1749.49,1752.02,So -- so I think two -- there's two possible things.
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1771.325,1773.32,Or say -- or say they were lawfully present.
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1773.32,1783.48,"And -- and well, but -- but as I said, I -- you know, I really think that -- And then -- and then second, the other thing is, you know, maybe he thought he couldn't extend it at that time to DAPA."
2015.15-674,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1810.0,1812.45,There's -- there's no challenge to DAPA in it?
2015.15-674,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1812.45,1818.07,"No, right, which, as a legal matter is no different. If I might reserve the balance of my time. Thank you."
2015.15-674,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1818.07,1828.81,"Thank you, General. Mr. Saenz."
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,1828.81,1873.09,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Jane Does, three Texas mothers of U.S. citizen children, seek the opportunity to apply for discretionary, temporary and revocable relief from the daily fear that they will be separated from their families and detained or removed from their homes under the current nonuniform and frequently arbitrary Federal immigration enforcement system, which fails to provide any reliable opportunity to be identified as low priority. Their own State of Texas, through this suit, has blocked the Guidance that would secure the Jane Does an opportunity to step forward, register and apply and obtain a timely decision with respect to deferred action."
2015.15-674,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1895.98,1908.17,Do you think it would be illegal if Texas adopted a policy saying everyone lawfully present in Texas except people subject to DAPA get a driver's license?
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,1908.17,1916.88,"I think it would be, in candor, subject to a challenge that would revolve around the circumstances and the reasoning behind that new legislation."
2015.15-674,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1939.34,1948.01,"How about if they just said -- let's take it out of DAPA -- if they just said, you know something? There's too many deferred action people."
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,1960.945,1964.13,"In that circumstance, I think it, too, would be subject to challenge."

2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,1997.55,1998.46,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2015.15-674,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2014.46,2021.665,Do I take it from the way you are phrasing this that you actually think that the equal protection concerns would be more serious than the preemption concerns?
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2021.665,2025.15,I think it depends on the circumstances of how Texas is to make its decision.

Is there any other reason that's in this record, such as -- we could imagine other reasons."
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2094.995,2096.24,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2096.24,2096.66,What?
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2096.66,2098.99,"Governor Abbot has indicated that, in the record --"
2015.15-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2098.99,2099.75,In the record here.
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2099.75,2105.125,"Yes, it's in the record here, I believe, Your Honor, that, in fact, this is a political dispute."
2015.15-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2114.6,2116.745,You're talking about in general.
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2132.4,2132.83,"Your Honor, they --"
2015.15-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2132.83,2135.615,One way is it costs them money.
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2135.615,2136.0,Yes.
2015.15-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2136.0,2137.81,Are there other ways?
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2137.81,2138.65,"No, Your Honor."
2015.15-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2140.98,2142.26,That's the answer.
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2142.26,2156.25,"And, in fact, it shows that they believe they would face additional expenses, though there's not really enough to conclude that it would change the State's previous determination, taking into account those costs from every subsidized license --"
2015.15-674,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2156.25,2160.28,Isn't -- isn't losing money the classic case for standing?
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2160.28,2171.3,"It's a classic case for a private individual, Your Honor, but here, we're talking about a State that has made a decision, as States often do, to spend money by subsidizing licenses because it's balanced other considerations, including --"
2015.15-674,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2171.3,2176.035,We said in Massachusetts against EPA that we have a special solicitude for the claims of the States.
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2176.035,2176.37,Yes.
2015.15-674,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2203.59,2228.625,"If an employer took the position that the employer was not going to hire a DAPA beneficiary because the employer believes that they are not -- that they are not lawfully authorized to work, would prefer someone else over them, could that person sue on any theory of discrimination, for example, under Section 1981?"
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2228.625,2230.0,"They could, Your Honor."
2015.15-674,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2240.73,2243.29,"If that's true then, DAPA gives them a legal right."
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2248.28,2254.3,"I think it's important to note, Your Honor, that work authorization is a separate determination from deferred action itself."
2015.15-674,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2258.88,2263.32,"But work authorization, in your view, gives them a legal right they did not have before."
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2263.32,2266.59,"It gives them the right to work with authorization, certainly."
2015.15-674,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2277.2,2281.46,When you -- when you answered the question about -- you said there might be a 1981 suit.
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2285.17,2285.83,That's correct.
2015.15-674,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2285.83,2286.91,You're saying it's a question.
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2291.84,2295.85,"It's far from clear, I think. The precedent is not clear enough to determine the outcome of that case."
2015.15-674,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2295.85,2298.175,What is -- but what is your position on that?
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2298.175,2302.35,Our position would be that it is something to be litigated.
2015.15-674,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2310.775,2313.19,But you believe they do have the right?
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2313.19,2323.8,"They do have work authorization, and that certainly means that they ought not be subject to unreasonable discriminatory bases for denying their work."
2015.15-674,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2345.48,2379.495,"In the Whiting case a few terms ago, the Court upheld an Arizona statute that imposed pretty severe civil penalties on an employer who employed individuals who were not authorized to work. So if an employer in Arizona hires DAPA beneficiaries and the State attempts to impose those civil penalties on that employer, I assume that you believe that DAPA would provide a legal defense to that?"
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2379.495,2405.12,"I believe there would be a defense, but before that, because the Whiting case involved a requirement to use either by system under the verified system, those who were work authorized, whether through deferred action or otherwise, should come back as authorized workers. So I think the State of Arizona, which premised its statute in part to receive this Court's blessing of that statute on relying on Federal decision makers, would not be in a position to engage in what you've described."
2015.15-674,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2405.12,2412.24,"Well, prior to DAPA, if the employer had employed these individuals, the employer would be subject to those penalties, would it not?"
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2412.24,2413.46,That is correct.
2015.15-674,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2413.46,2415.28,"And after DAPA, it would not be."
2015.15-674,1,62696,thomas_a_saenz,,2415.28,2420.27,Work authorization is an authorization to work that is separate from the deferred-action determination.
2015.15-674,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2434.74,2442.625,"Thank you, Mr. Saenz. General Keller."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2442.625,2450.805,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: DAPA is an unprecedented unlawful assertion of executive power."
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2454.45,2473.67,"How can you say that? I mean, we have the Fairness Act that happened in 1990. It granted basically the same thing, deferred action and work authorization, to 1.5 million people out of 4 million."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2502.31,2506.35,"Well, the Family Fairness Program, first of all, was done pursuant to statutory authority."
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2517.72,2519.81,"Well, that's because Congress decided to step in."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2536.73,2538.65,"But -- but, Justice Sotomayor, I think that's backwards."
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2550.055,2575.785,"You know, you keep saying that, ""deep economic significance."" Those nearly 11 million unauthorized aliens are here in the shadows. They are affecting the economy whether we want to or not. The answer is, if Congress really wanted not to have an economic impact, it would -- it would allot the amount of money necessary to deport them, but it hasn't."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2575.785,2586.92,"But what Congress did in 1986 with work authorization, and 1996 with benefits, is it restricted work and benefits as an alternative mechanism to enforce immigration law."
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2602.53,2614.635,"Except that the -- the work authorization ability of the Attorney General to do has been clearly stated since 1986, and Congress hasn't taken that away."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2623.095,2630.415,"But in 1986, Congress passed a comprehensive framework for combatting the employment of unauthorized aliens."
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2636.46,2645.43,And -- and the regulation permitting the Attorney General to give work authorization to deferred-action individuals has stood since that time.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2645.43,2669.3,"But when that regulation was passed in 1987, the Executive said that the number covered by that regulation was so small as, quote, ""to be not worth recording statistically,"" unquote, and, quote, ""the impact on the labor market is minimal,"" unquote. So regardless of what Congress may have acquiesced to afterwards, that regulation has always been known as being for a small class of individuals for deferred action."
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2669.3,2671.01,But it's been applied to a large class.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2691.495,2691.86,No.
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2706.375,2707.07,Exactly.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2707.07,2721.21,"But here, with deferred action, when they've only -- the Executive has only been granting 500 to 1000 deferred action permits a year, there's no way Congress would have acquiesced to granting four million permits than in a program like this --"
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2721.21,2741.15,"Well, it has -- it has acquiesced to larger numbers of Salvadorians, Guatemalans, Hondurans, Haitians, Chinese, the TNU visa applications, those numbers have been much larger than the limited numbers you're quoting right now."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2741.15,2759.48,"And those programs would have been under temporary protective status; humanitarian parole, deferred enforced departure, which is justified -- and has been, at least, under the President's Article II power, and there's no suggestion that -- here DAPA is unprecedented because this is a extra statutory deferred action program that is not bridging lawful status."
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2763.33,2778.71,"General, could I take you back a few steps? General Verrilli said a couple of times that you've essentially conceded the legality of DAPA taking out the work authorization and the Social Security benefits; is that correct?"
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2778.71,2779.375,No.
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2799.75,2801.12,Let me make sure I understand that.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2817.53,2824.705,"While that would be a harder, tougher case, I do believe that they could do it class based if they were simply forbearing from removal."
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2824.705,2827.38,So that's what I asked originally.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2839.795,2848.79,"In this case, given that they are removing 400,000 people a year, we admit that they could do forbearance from removal."
2015.15-674,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2852.265,2885.045,"Can I -- can I ask you specifically? You have a statement in your brief, and that's -- it says that the Executive could give cards, identification cards to all these people saying ""low priority."" Are you adhering to that? Is -- is that what -- what you mean? These people you're objecting to work authorizations, Social Security, but the government, not one by one, but to give everyone who fits into this category a card that says low priority?"
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2885.045,2888.535,"The government, as part of its enforcement discretion, could do that."
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2896.59,2930.105,"General, are you -- are you just referring to that single phrase in the DAPA memorandum? Is that what you're referring to? Because General Verrilli, of course, says you could strike that phrase today if you wanted to; that that phrase really has no legal consequence whatsoever; that all this document does is do exactly what you said, which is to grant forbearance, to tell people we are -- you are not our enforcement priority, we are not going to deport you until we say otherwise, which we can tomorrow too."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,2930.105,2937.95,That lawful presence phrase is key because that's the first time in a deferred-action program the Executive has taken that position.
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2981.36,2990.415,"I guess -- I really did want to know, just take out the work authorization, take out the Social Security, and take out that phrase."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3008.195,3012.58,"And Justice Kagan, they can do that, and they can do that under the unchallenged prioritization memo."
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3017.11,3019.615,I think that's just a label. Can they do that?
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3019.615,3022.65,"It is a label, but it's a label that Congress created --"
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3022.65,3027.95,"Well, my hypothetical is -- I mean, you're suggesting that the label has some legal consequence."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3038.04,3039.37,If that's all they were doing yes.
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3040.56,3046.54,Even though it's many millions of people they could do that? And they can do it all at once.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3046.54,3049.41,"Yes, as long as they're not abdicating."
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3053.325,3053.55,Okay.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3067.64,3070.615,"And the granting of lawful presence, because that is what's going to --"
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3070.615,3075.78,Well -- and that's just a label that General Verrilli says they could strike out in a moment.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3075.78,3077.475,"Well, that's -- that's their position, but that's wrong."
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3078.62,3080.235,"Well, it's their memorandum."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3080.235,3082.025,It is their memorandum. (Laughter.)
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3082.025,3082.68,And it's --
2015.15-674,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3082.68,3084.38,But isn't it a statutory term?
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3084.38,3085.01,It is --
2015.15-674,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3085.01,3088.83,"Does the term ""lawful presence"" appear in statutes enacted by Congress?"
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3088.83,3089.3,It does.
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3107.06,3113.58,"But then it seems to me, General Keller, that your -- that what you should be attacking is not DAPA."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3133.01,3136.44,"But Justice Kagan, I think it is DAPA itself that we're challenging."
2015.15-674,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3141.39,3145.765,Where does it say that in DAPA? We have the DAPA directive.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3151.03,3155.79,The DAPA directive does not mention Social Security.
2015.15-674,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3202.66,3210.81,You tie the driver's license to work authorization? Let's say somebody is in this deferred status but isn't working.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3214.735,3224.35,"Under Texas law -- and this is our Texas statute -- if someone is authorized to be in the United States, they're eligible for a driver's license."
2015.15-674,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3224.35,3227.21,And it -- it sounds like they don't have to have any work authorization.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3227.21,3227.5,That's correct.
2015.15-674,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3246.155,3252.48,"Well, the government also says you don't have to do that, or maybe you don't have to do that and maybe -- maybe or not they won't sue you."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3255.455,3260.225,"Well, I -- I think, as Your Honor had suggested before, that we are in a catch-22 here."
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3273.365,3274.46,I'm sorry.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3287.81,3290.37,You -- you would go to a Department of Motor Vehicles.
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3308.7,3308.85,All right.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3356.245,3372.9,"Well, first of all, under the Federal REAL ID Act, if our State's driver's license recipients want to be able to use that license to get through airport securities, TSA security, there has to be integrity in the license for the Federal government. And so we have to check whether an alien is actually --"
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3372.9,3373.09,Fine.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3430.395,3430.66,Yeah.
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3445.32,3447.82,But you do that in the speed you do it in.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3462.795,3465.5,"Well, and here, we have a factfinding that we would incur these costs."
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3470.1,3472.415,This is a jurisdictional standing question.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3472.415,3474.2,It is a jurisdictional standing question.
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3474.2,3482.67,Do we just accept at face value something that might -- might not be true?
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3482.67,3483.5,But we have --
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3483.5,3488.475,"Can we give you standing just on the basis of you saying, I'm going to do this when it makes no sense?"
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3488.475,3491.36,We have a factfinding here. They have not alleged it's clear error.
2015.15-674,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3498.86,3499.74,Justice Breyer.
2015.15-674,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3499.74,3505.115,"I would like to ask a question. The only thing I found here is about money, really."
2015.15-674,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3552.47,3554.46,"-- unless, luckily, they're overruled."
2015.15-674,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3559.79,3566.92,"The one I'm thinking of is Frothingham v. Mellon, Massachusetts v. Mellon."
2015.15-674,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3593.32,3607.485,"But the point is they lost, because, says the Court, we can't let you just sue on the basis that you, as a taxpayer, will have to spend more money."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3690.785,3695.325,"First, we're raising financial harms from our own State's fisc."
2015.15-674,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3707.67,3745.375,"Well, sovereign harms, you realize, would follow a fortiori, because if a State cannot sue and its citizens cannot sue to stop the Feds from giving somebody a benefit on the ground that it will cost the State or the individuals more money, surely they cannot sue just by announcing it requires a change in law in general, or because it requires -- hurts our sovereign interest, for then every case of political disagreement where States disagree would come before the Court."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3745.375,3759.66,"Well, but I think a lot of those cases would be taken care of through causation requirements, injury-in-fact requirements, and the zone of interest test, for instance, the adjusted gross income example and the veterans benefits example that the other side has brought up."
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3788.0,3788.49,"Well, but that --"
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3788.49,3789.41,-- you have Article III cases --
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3789.41,3793.99,-- that really pits the States against every Federal agency.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3865.15,3877.89,"I don't think States would be protected by laws governing which banks are too big to fail, but States absolutely are protected by immigration laws saying who is lawfully present within our borders. And I think -- so that would be -- we did that under the zone of interest test."
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3878.41,3892.28,We already said in Arizona v. Whiting that you can't tell the Federal government who to say is legally or not legally present here.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3896.375,3897.05,And that's precisely --
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3897.05,3901.145,You're not in the zone of interest of this -- of this -- of the immigration law.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3901.145,3903.73,"Oh, we absolutely are, and that's precisely why I a.m. standing here."
2015.15-674,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3917.97,3926.2,"But the State can't remove anyone, and we still go back to the basic problem: 11.3 million people."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3960.04,3967.42,"And -- and DAPA itself purports to grant not only work authorization, but also transform lawful conduct into lawful conduct."
2015.15-674,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3967.42,3969.02,We've already gone through that.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3981.945,3984.07,But it's not just an unfortunate slip.
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3994.94,4011.31,"But then why aren't you challenging the regulations? I mean, I understand what you're saying that DAPA in some sense triggers the regulations, but only because the regulations say what they say, that your real challenge is not to DAPA, which is the nonenforcement part of this."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4021.0,4027.34,"Well, insofar as you'd conceive of our case of challenging those regulations, it would be challenging them as applied to DAPA, but when Congress --"
2015.15-674,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4027.34,4033.055,"The problem is that you haven't exhausted administratively, and we always require you to do that."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4046.35,4048.21,Well -- but this is -- we are challenging DAPA.
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4049.875,4051.48,Can I -- please.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4052.265,4070.84,"And when we bring forth that suit, which only occurred as of November 20, 2014, just because we're challenging DAPA's granting of deferred action doesn't mean in the four narrow categories that Congress has passed statutes allowing deferred action -- for VAWA self-petitioners, T- and U-visa applicants, and widows and widowers -- that somehow we'd have to also be challenging --"
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4070.84,4081.765,"Do you think this? Suppose that instead of doing DAPA, DHS had decided to go one by one by one and it just -- you know, it sent a notice to each person."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4091.869,4095.08,"Insofar as they were granting lawful presence, no."
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4101.03,4105.69,"I guess -- I'm not sure I understood the first part of that because let's just, like, take out the labels."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4123.64,4125.705,I don't think there's statutory authorization.
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4130.09,4142.3,"See, that's interesting because I thought -- and as you said, there's not statutory authorization with respect to that, and I thought your entire argument is that they can't do this, except for statutory authorization."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4145.205,4147.37,"Well, Justice Kagan, we have multiple arguments."
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4158.74,4162.47,And how about this? How about DHS doesn't do it one by one.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4181.91,4188.07,"If there was no previous lawful status or an eminent lawful status, there's no way Congress has acquiesced to that. And if I can back up --"
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4188.07,4188.69,So wait a minute.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4217.73,4218.745,Congress could.
2015.15-674,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4224.06,4227.045,So this has nothing to do with the scope of this policy.
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4246.115,4248.07,"Mr. Chief Justice, my time is up."
2015.15-674,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4248.07,4250.395,"Please, you may answer the question."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4250.395,4290.955,"When we're talking about the scope of the program as opposed to bridging lawful status, the scope goes to, is this a question of deep economic significance? It also goes to when the 1987 work authorization was justified, the Executive was telling everyone through the administrative process that this was for a minuscule number of people, and it wouldn't affect the labor market. And this also brings to light that here, the Executive didn't even use notice-and-comment in promulgating this sweeping -- their theory is that they can grant deferred action where there's not going to be lawful status, that no court can review it, and they didn't even use notice-and-comment procedure. That is unprecedented, is a sweeping assertion as Justice Jackson said in Youngstown."
2015.15-674,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4295.055,4295.84,"Thank you, General."
2015.15-674,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,4295.84,4301.985,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2015.15-674,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4301.985,4308.08,Ms. Murphy.
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4308.08,4331.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Three years ago the Executive asked Congress to enact legislation that would have given it the power to authorize most of the people that are living in this country unlawfully to stay, work, and receive benefits, and Congress declined.

2015.15-674,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4331.16,4331.54,Excuse me.
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4336.705,4338.81,It was not a pathway to citizenship.
2015.15-674,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4351.5,4352.225,That's correct.
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4357.935,4364.725,"It is a legal status because under the agency's own regulations, it is a status that has consequences."
2015.15-674,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4413.64,4418.825,"So why don't we just cross -- why don't we just cross out ""lawfully present,"" as the SG has suggested?"
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4418.825,4437.12,"You can't cross it out and achieve what DAPA is supposed to achieve, because what really matters in DAPA is that it is allowing the grant of deferred-action status.

2015.15-674,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4463.98,4482.48,"But you would agree with the clause that says low priority, that -- that -- nothing about work authorization, nothing about Social Security, if you are low priority, which means we'll probably never get to you because Congress hasn't given us the money to remove you."
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4482.48,4489.855,"Well, we would not necessarily concede that you could actually grant people cards that say we're not going to enforce the law as to you."
2015.15-674,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4532.8,4533.42,"Well, we'll hear in a second --"
2015.15-674,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4533.42,4548.47,"Why wouldn't the appropriate way for Texas to proceed have been to challenge the regulation under the APA -- I think it's Section 553 -- and then if there were concern about notice-and-comment taking too long, asking for a preliminary injunction?"
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4548.47,4561.12,"I -- I don't think that's the way that it actually makes sense for this to proceed, because there's nothing inherently problematic about a regulation that ties deferred-action status to work authorization. Congress has passed multiple statutes --"
2015.15-674,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4561.12,4574.975,"Well, but the point -- the point of the suit, I guess -- I'm not going to tell people how to design their suit -- the point of the suit would be the -- the areas of discretion have been so vastly changed that the regulation now -- now has been -- has been superseded."
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4574.975,4578.6,And I don't mean to suggest that that's not a way you could challenge.
2015.15-674,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4598.63,4616.77,"Then you disagree with General Keller, because I think he did say -- came up a few times, it's in his brief -- you could give an ID card to these people saying low priority -- the whole category of people, give them that."
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4621.39,4649.42,"What I would say is we would have concerns if this case were challenging just the Enforcement Priorities Memorandum, and we would have the same concerns if you had that and invited people in and gave them an enforcement priority card. That's not what this case is challenging. So ultimately, whether the House has concerns about the Enforcement Priorities Memorandum is really beside the point here, because what this case is challenging is the DAPA memorandum that goes beyond the mere enforcement discretion --"
2015.15-674,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4649.42,4651.92,So can we -- can we take it -- break it down?
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4651.92,4652.98,Sure.
2015.15-674,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4652.98,4670.24,Are you arguing that the Executive does not have the power to defer -- to defer action of removal against this class of aliens?
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4670.24,4673.705,"It all depends by what you mean by ""defer action."""
2015.15-674,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4673.705,4676.04,"I just said deferred action, but they're not --"
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4676.04,4691.555,"Well, I can't answer the question unless I understand whether you're talking about mere forbearance or putting them into deferred-action status. We don't believe the Executive has the power to put this class of individuals into deferred-action status."
2015.15-674,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4728.67,4733.49,"Can I -- can I ask you this, then? Because you're an amicus; you're not a party."
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4797.085,4800.98,I'm not sure I completely -- I'm sorry.
2015.15-674,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4800.98,4804.63,"If I a.m. not clear, I will not repeat it, but you can forget it."
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4804.63,4804.87,"No, no."
2015.15-674,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4873.97,4891.695,"So your position is that in 1989, when George H. W. Bush granted deferred enforced departure for Chinese residents after the Tiananmen Square situation, that he acted illegally?"
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4891.695,4892.32,No.
2015.15-674,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4900.24,4902.55,But there was no statutory authority for him to do that.
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4902.55,4908.45,It is a power that the Executive has always grounded in Article II foreign affairs power.
2015.15-674,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4923.8,4925.4,That came after this.
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4925.4,4926.13,Right.
2015.15-674,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4927.82,4930.055,"At the time, there was no statutory authority."
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4930.055,4942.49,Whatever was happening before 1990 doesn't tell you very much about what Congress has acquiesced in when Congress passed a statute in 1990 that said these are the circumstances under which you can grant --
2015.15-674,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4942.49,4945.935,I -- I appreciate that. And that may be what Congress does here.
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,4993.1,4994.18,No.
2015.15-674,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5002.67,5013.81,"Except that the statute says that the -- those people, deferred action, can be granted under the statute --"
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,5013.81,5014.595,Yes.
2015.15-674,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5014.595,5016.35,-- or by the Attorney General.
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,5016.35,5017.39,I'm not --
2015.15-674,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5017.39,5021.29,The ones if -- you're striking out by the Attorney General?
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,5021.29,5025.395,"I was talking about different statutes, not 1324a(h)(3)"
2015.15-674,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5043.41,5046.345,"Ms. Murphy, suppose something is not statutorily authorized."
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,5062.195,5078.275,"I think it would -- it would ultimately in that instance start to become a question of scope and a point at which you have a policy that is inconsistent with the use of deferred action status. Because in the past, I mean, there have been this kind of ad hoc de minimis, case-by-case use of deferred action status."
2015.15-674,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5078.275,5078.46,Okay.
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,5104.155,5104.665,No.
2015.15-674,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5109.41,5113.31,"But this is very significant, right? No past practice like it? I mean --"
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,5113.31,5114.1,There's not any past practice.
2015.15-674,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5114.1,5115.385,What was that family --
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,5115.385,5116.86,That was not a --
2015.15-674,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5116.86,5118.295,-- policy -- fairness?
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,5118.295,5119.66,-- voluntary departure.
2015.15-674,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5134.42,5152.085,"So, but this is important. Because you're -- you're basically saying that DHS, going forward, any administration cannot have any kind of policy, even if it's limited, much more limited than this kind of policy is that allows undocumented aliens to work."
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,5152.085,5159.31,"Congress has passed a statute that says if you are living in this country without legal authority, you cannot work."
2015.15-674,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5163.35,5163.74,That's --
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,5163.74,5164.61,You may disagree with --
2015.15-674,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5164.61,5165.1,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,5171.015,5175.0,"Not at all, Your Honor, because the past practices, there are none."
2015.15-674,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5184.48,5193.345,"Is that true of all other deferred actions mentioned in the Appendix, the one that the Congressional Research Service did?"
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,5193.345,5193.975,Yes.
2015.15-674,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5197.36,5199.2,"I mean, they are different."
2015.15-674,3,22816,erin_e_murphy,,5199.2,5205.08,There's really -- there's only about four deferred action programs that were class-based.
2015.15-674,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5212.215,5215.92,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, General Verrilli."
2015.15-674,4,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5215.92,5223.325,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First, on standing, I would note that they have no answer to our redressability point."
2015.15-674,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5295.15,5297.505,"Well, I was asking about Section 1981."
2015.15-674,4,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5297.505,5305.78,"Well, but I think that if you have a -- you'd have a hard time making that claim given that Congress has made that kind of a judgment. Now, with respect to another point Your Honor made --"
2015.15-674,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5305.78,5309.68,So your position is that -- that there could not be a suit under 1981.
2015.15-674,4,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5309.68,5327.065,"What I'm saying is that Congress made a judgment there that -- that bears very directly on it. But now, with respect to another point that Your Honor raised about specific statutory references to lawful presence, my friends on the other side made a huge deal about this, in particular 8 C.F.R. 1.3, which I think they cite seven or eight times. I urge you to go to look at it."
2015.15-674,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5376.02,5396.765,"Well, if you -- if the phrase ""lawful presence"" were stricken from the Guidance, would you take the position that DAPA beneficiaries are not lawfully present for purposes of -- under certain statutes that use that phrase for the re-entry bar, for eligibility for Federal benefits?"
2015.15-674,4,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5396.765,5399.24,It's -- the only Federal benefit is Social Security.
2015.15-674,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5399.24,5402.52,"Well, would you say they were lawfully present for those two statutory purposes?"
2015.15-674,4,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5402.52,5402.58,No.
2015.15-674,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5488.58,5493.02,People who have asylum don't have a pathway to citizenship.
2015.15-674,4,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5493.02,5494.39,Exactly.
2015.15-674,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5503.06,5505.215,How -- how many people are we talking about with those?
2015.15-674,4,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5505.215,5506.19,Millions.
2015.15-674,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5507.695,5510.05,The asylum applications?
2015.15-674,4,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5510.05,5519.2,"No, but the adjustment of status, 4.5 million since 2008, and cancellation removal, 325,000 since 2008."
