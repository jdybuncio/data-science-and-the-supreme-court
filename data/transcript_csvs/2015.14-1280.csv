2015.14-1280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.355,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-1280, Heffernan v. City of Paterson, New Jersey. Mr. Frost."
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,8.355,19.03,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Public employees have a right not to be demoted on patronage grounds."
2015.14-1280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,38.96,44.3,How would you define the right at issue in this case?
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,44.3,46.82,The -- the issue here is --
2015.14-1280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,46.82,51.565,How would you define the right that your client wishes this Court to vindicate?
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,51.565,68.23,"I'm defining the right in that pursuant to Elrod and its progeny, that there -- it is not necessary to have any affirmative acts, that by virtue of being a public employee, he has the right not to engage in political association."
2015.14-1280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,68.23,71.08,"Well, that's just a restatement of -- of Elrod."
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,86.935,90.339,"That would be a fair statement, Justice Kennedy."
2015.14-1280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,90.339,115.85,"Because -- look, do we -- it sounds to me from the way you began your argument that we take this case on the assumption that, if he had picked up the sign, that if he had been supporting the candidate for chief of police who was challenging the incumbent, if he had been engaged in the activity, that would be protected."
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,123.93,127.215,"No, you do not have to accept that proposition."
2015.14-1280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,142.755,152.825,"Well, but the -- the First Amendment talks about abridging freedom of speech, and I thought the case came to us on the proposition that he wasn't engaging in speech at all."
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,171.315,178.52,"In this case, Mr. Chief Justice, the case comes to us with respect to association."
2015.14-1280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,187.2,191.605,He wasn't associating with anybody any more -- any more than he was speaking.
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,193.13,194.22,Justice Scalia --
2015.14-1280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,194.22,200.47,"He was associate -- associating with his mother, I suppose, in picking up the sign for her."
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,221.84,224.61,Elrod would stand for that proposition.
2015.14-1280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,224.61,224.76,Elrod --
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,224.76,225.735,Elrod --
2015.14-1280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,225.735,236.185,"Elrod says you have a First Amendment right to favor a political party or not favor a political party, and you cannot be fired for doing so. That's not what happened here."
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,236.185,238.42,But he was not favoring a political party.
2015.14-1280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,238.42,238.98,Exactly.
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,267.64,278.65,"There's a constitutional right, Justice Scalia, to be able to be free from patronage decisions and to be discharged or demoted on patronage grounds."
2015.14-1280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,279.21,282.815,Where do we say that? We never said that.
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,305.76,310.19,"He doesn't need to speak, and he doesn't need to take a position."
2015.14-1280,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,334.66,337.075,"I mean, I don't understand -- I don't understand your answer."
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,358.245,369.87,"In -- in Waters this Court looked at the motive of the employer, the motive of government."
2015.14-1280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,419.63,424.225,"Well, let me just -- to clarify what I -- how I thought the case was presented."
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,456.545,456.73,It --
2015.14-1280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,456.73,466.555,"It was simply a mistake of fact. And then -- now, can the person who wasn't even there, can he bring a First Amendment challenge to his dismissal?"
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,466.555,468.895,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2015.14-1280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,468.895,469.39,Okay.
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,469.39,471.29,And the point that I was making --
2015.14-1280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,471.29,489.94,And then again -- but it's still not clear to me: What is the right that he's asserting? And -- and I'll back up while you're thinking about that. Is -- can a local government say that all our employees must be neutral in campaigns and must not take part in campaigns?
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,489.94,490.5,Well --
2015.14-1280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,490.5,494.155,"They can vote, but they can't take part in campaigns? Like the Hatch Act?"
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,494.155,497.0,"Well, there are Hatch Acts. There was no provision here."
2015.14-1280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,497.0,499.795,Can the government insist on neutrality?
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,499.795,512.06,I think the government can have a policy after balancing the interests between that of the employer and that of the position.
2015.14-1280,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,512.06,513.02,Is that an issue --
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,513.02,513.6,I was not saying --
2015.14-1280,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,513.6,526.895,Is that an issue -- is that an issue in this case? Is there any allegation that there was such a policy of neutrality that no employee could engage in political activity?
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,526.895,527.18,Okay.
2015.14-1280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,532.71,533.06,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,535.285,545.0,There -- there was a policy that Chief Wittig said that existed with respect to members of his staff only.
2015.14-1280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,585.84,598.94,"Is there a remedy for your client, apart from this action under the First Amendment? Does he have civil service protections of any kind or -- or -- I don't know -- collective bargaining?"
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,598.94,599.71,Your Honor --
2015.14-1280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,599.71,608.34,"Let's just say: What would happen if the boss comes in and says, you know, for the -- you didn't turn off the lights last night."
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,614.085,616.6,"Well, that's not a constitutional violation for --"
2015.14-1280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,616.6,616.98,"No, no."
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,625.46,628.07,"Mr. Chief Justice, there are -- there were no other remedies."
2015.14-1280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,628.07,628.35,Okay.
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,628.35,635.62,There is a -- State of New Jersey has a State Civil Rights Act which mimics 1983.
2015.14-1280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,652.54,655.08,What is the New Jersey Act? That's a strange act.
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,661.73,663.14,"No, it -- it mimics --"
2015.14-1280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.14,663.97,I can't imagine that.
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,668.279,680.2,"With respect to the New Jersey statute, it's just identical to a 1983 cause of action, so it doesn't give you any additional rights. Officer Heffernan --"
2015.14-1280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.2,685.505,How does it read? You have to violate the Federal constitution to get relief under New Jersey law?
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,685.505,687.455,Do you have to?
2015.14-1280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,687.455,687.85,Yeah.
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,691.884,697.765,He proceeded in Federal court. He has every right to proceed in Federal court for a First Amendment violation.
2015.14-1280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,697.765,700.05,What does the New Jersey law say? You brought it up.
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,701.615,706.92,"New Jersey law, the statute just mimics a 1983 cause of action."
2015.14-1280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.92,714.56,So it says -- it says if you violate -- you can't fire a State employee in violation of the Federal constitution.
2015.14-1280,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,718.3,721.56,"You don't have the text of it, do you?"
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,721.56,722.55,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1280,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,722.55,726.115,"The text of the New Jersey law, so we can know what we're talking about."
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,726.115,726.52,Sure.
2015.14-1280,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,735.535,745.855,"Well, Mr. Grabowski's brief says New Jersey law provides a statutory right of action for an attempt to violate an individual's civil rights. Is he wrong?"
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,745.855,748.0,An attempt to violate?
2015.14-1280,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,748.0,748.765,Yeah.
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,748.765,757.25,"It -- it is included in there, but -- but that doesn't give you an exclusive right. You can't diminish his First Amendment rights."
2015.14-1280,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,757.25,757.38,No.
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,771.625,774.85,He could have a remedy under State law.
2015.14-1280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,779.65,780.05,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,789.58,790.7,The civil rights --
2015.14-1280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,790.7,797.12,"-- is the state of the law attempting to violate civil rights? What right, if we say there isn't the First Amendment?"
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,797.12,798.525,The right not to associate.
2015.14-1280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,798.525,800.475,"Well, if we say it doesn't exist."
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,802.14,804.54,"If what doesn't exist, Justice Sotomayor?"
2015.14-1280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,804.54,807.16,"Just that, the right you're claiming."
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,807.16,811.82,He has every right to bring this claim in Federal court as --
2015.14-1280,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,811.82,814.87,He may have broader substantive rights under New Jersey law.
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,827.145,832.94,"There are New Jersey laws. But -- but just because -- again, it doesn't abrogate your First Amendment rights."
2015.14-1280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,835.58,835.885,Just --
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,835.885,840.6,-- engaged -- there could have been a violation of any type of New Jersey statute.
2015.14-1280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1026.35,1033.635,All of those things would be true if the mayor gave a speech saying I am going to fire anybody who's not a Republican.
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,1042.475,1044.19,Because of the speech itself?
2015.14-1280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1044.19,1044.91,"Yeah, just the speech."
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,1053.335,1053.85,Justice Scalia --
2015.14-1280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1053.85,1055.41,Does anybody have a cause of action for that?
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,1055.41,1058.025,"There would be no claim, because no action was taken."
2015.14-1280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1063.24,1063.48,Exactly.
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,1081.144,1094.4,"Justice Scalia, what carries water is the fact that in this instance, Heffernan was demoted on the employer's mistaken perception that he was engaged in activity, and you don't need to engage in that activity."
2015.14-1280,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1094.4,1101.85,Would you -- would you say that he was demoted because he gave the appearance of exercising his First Amendment rights?
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,1101.85,1102.885,Yes.
2015.14-1280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1135.38,1135.61,You may.
2015.14-1280,0,62645,mark_frost,,1135.61,1147.549,-- if there are no other questions? Thank you.
2015.14-1280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1147.549,1149.325,Ms. Anders.
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1149.325,1164.33,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start with Justice Kennedy's question about how we define the right here. We think that Petitioner has a First Amendment right not to have adverse action taken against him by his employer for the unconstitutional purpose of suppressing disfavored political beliefs."
2015.14-1280,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1165.5,1167.66,And what's your best case for that proposition?
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1167.66,1174.235,"Well, we think that there are -- there are two aspects of this -- this Court's case law I think that support that, and then I'd like to get back to your concern about probing of beliefs."
2015.14-1280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1198.03,1203.37,"And those cases, Ms. Anders -- I missed what you said those cases were."
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1203.37,1208.18,That was Branti 445 U.S. at 517.
2015.14-1280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1211.65,1217.32,"You say in all of those cases, no First Amendment right was being exercised, right?"
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1217.32,1218.04,No.
2015.14-1280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1218.04,1219.145,Is that your point?
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1219.145,1227.34,"Well, I think actually in the Rutan case there were -- there were three plaintiffs, and it wasn't clear, actually, whether they had engaged in any affirmative exercise of their First Amendment --"
2015.14-1280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1227.34,1228.09,Was it clear that they hadn't?
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1228.09,1229.91,So what the court said was that they had --
2015.14-1280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1229.91,1231.275,Was it clear that they hadn't?
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1231.275,1244.57,"It was not clear whether they had or hadn't, and the court didn't inquire into that. So what had happened there was that the -- the plaintiffs had been -- had adverse action taken against them because they had lacked the support of the correct Republican party officials."
2015.14-1280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1265.03,1265.17,Yeah.
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1312.87,1354.705,"Well, I think in the employment context, I think there's no question that the plaintiff was directly injured by the unconstitutional condition. But to respond directly to your point, I think -- I don't think there's a serious concern here that there will be a meritless -- a flood of meritless lawsuits or anything like that, and that's primarily for two reasons. I take your point that -- that, you know, this will expand the universe of -- of litigation somewhat, but we already know in the statutory context, the courts have recognized suits based on a mistaken perception, and -- and in that context we haven't seen any flood of meritless lawsuits. And with respect to Elrod claims specifically, I think it's always been fairly easy for plaintiffs to allege that a particular affiliation of belief, I was in the Republican party --"
2015.14-1280,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1354.705,1358.86,How do you know we haven't seen a flood of meritless lawsuits in that context?
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1358.86,1361.55,"Well, we -- we haven't in the statutory context."
2015.14-1280,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1361.55,1363.38,"Yeah, the one that you were just referring to."
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1363.38,1366.11,"Well, we looked at this, it -- it doesn't come up very much."
2015.14-1280,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1370.48,1378.41,You're looking at the reported decisions rather than -- you haven't done any survey to see how many complaints have been filed in -- in this type of case?
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1378.41,1378.65,No.
2015.14-1280,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1406.845,1412.34,So are you saying there's a right to be secure from government oversight of your beliefs?
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1412.34,1418.305,"Well, I think the Court recognized in O'Hare that that is a particular concern in the affiliation context."
2015.14-1280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1425.05,1426.54,"I mean, that's a good idea, maybe."
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1433.38,1438.39,"Well, I think the right -- the right in question is the right not to be subject to a test of political affiliation --"
2015.14-1280,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1438.39,1458.465,"Is -- is that because you're concerned with a chill, or is there some other right that is -- is somehow affected that's a First Amendment right of the individual? You turn around and you say the government cannot act for an unconstitutional purpose, but we usually ask how is the defendant hurt? What is his right? That's still a little unclear to me."
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1458.465,1470.73,We think the defendant has been hurt in the constitutional sense because the way that the court has defined the right in question is the right not to be subject to a test of political affiliation when it's not a reasonable job requirement. And I do think what the Court said in --
2015.14-1280,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1470.73,1471.93,I think -- please.
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1471.93,1488.375,"What the Court said in O'Hare, essentially, was that -- not necessarily talking about a separate right not to be subject to probing of beliefs, but I think the Court was suggesting that we shouldn't have First Amendment tests, if we can help it, that lead the Court to have to probe into a plaintiff's beliefs. And that is exactly what will happen."
2015.14-1280,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1488.375,1494.29,I don't know why the right isn't the right to be free from arbitrary employment action based on a mistake.
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1509.0,1529.485,"I think with, at least with respect to some job actions, there -- there would be such a right under New Jersey law, and that's -- I'm not sure whether it would apply here, but I think the gravamen of -- of plaintiff's complaint here is not that he was fired for an inaccurate reason; it's that he was -- he was demoted because -- for an improper purpose, the perception that he was engaging in protected First Amendment activity."
2015.14-1280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1529.93,1536.94,"You've brought up in your brief, I think, that -- that the employer might have had a contract-type policy."
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1545.76,1551.35,"Well, I think -- I think if you rule for the Petitioner here, there would be a remand anyway because the Court hasn't --"
2015.14-1280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1551.35,1556.77,Is it based on the facts up till now to think that there was such a policy?
2015.14-1280,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1556.77,1559.72,"Well, so there -- there is, I think, a factual dispute about this."
2015.14-1280,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1671.01,1676.83,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1676.83,1687.295,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The doctrinal fight in the briefing is over whether the plaintiff in a case like this has to assert a constitutional right."
2015.14-1280,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1722.89,1729.11,"Can you explain, Mr. Goldstein, what sense it would make to say there are two people, the example Mr. Frost gave."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1764.62,1775.19,"I'm sorry. I have to focus on, really, the precise wording of your hypothetical, but I think you may actually have something slightly different in mind, because you identify this, the second employee, one who is politically neutral."
2015.14-1280,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1820.46,1827.9,"So just to make sure I understand what you're saying, suppose there's somebody who comes into office, and it's a Democrat."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1857.345,1862.93,"If that was actually the policy, then technically, the answer to your question is yes under the First Amendment."
2015.14-1280,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1875.66,1883.385,So you -- you encourage the person to be politically active and then fire him or her because they're politically active the wrong way? (Laughter.)
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1883.385,1883.65,"No, sir."
2015.14-1280,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1883.65,1886.86,"Suppose the employee says, you know, I don't like the evening news."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1891.995,1892.905,Right.
2015.14-1280,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1892.905,1897.095,He -- he -- he cannot be fired? What is his right?
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1897.095,1907.75,"My point, Justice Kennedy, is that he may have a State law right; he does have a collective bargaining agreement right, but he doesn't have a First Amendment right, because he's not engaging in First Amendment-protected activity. I do --"
2015.14-1280,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1907.75,1908.13,"See, I --"
2015.14-1280,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1908.13,1910.14,The -- the government has -- excuse me.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1910.14,1910.64,Sorry.
2015.14-1280,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1910.64,1914.92,The -- the -- the government has a right to compel him to declare one way or the other?
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1914.92,1917.75,"No -- Justice Kennedy, and that -- that brings us back to your question."
2015.14-1280,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1971.78,1976.775,"See, I had always thought that the -- the idea behind those cases is a different one."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2008.755,2010.205,And we just disagree.
2015.14-1280,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2037.125,2043.77,So does that mean that the government can compel speech of a person if the person really just doesn't care one way or the other?
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2043.77,2044.02,No.
2015.14-1280,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2098.965,2109.455,"Mr. Goldstein, let's take a Title VII case, and the employer fires a woman because he thinks she's pregnant."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2124.26,2126.15,"Justice Ginsburg, the courts are divided."
2015.14-1280,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2135.535,2138.775,Those -- those statutes focus on the employer.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2142.09,2142.29,Right.
2015.14-1280,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.29,2143.16,-- of sex.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2143.16,2143.47,Right.
2015.14-1280,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2143.47,2150.755,And that employer was doing that. The First Amendment does not focus on the government; it focuses on the citizen.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2155.08,2155.42,So --
2015.14-1280,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2155.42,2157.19,That's the difference between the two cases.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2157.19,2164.34,"Well, it will not surprise you that I agree, Justice Scalia. The -- Justice Kagan, if -- if we could just take this outside the public employment context."
2015.14-1280,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2227.63,2231.06,What is -- what is the other law here? What -- what relief does he have?
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2231.06,2234.42,He has two forms of relief. The first is the collective bargaining agreement.
2015.14-1280,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2261.72,2268.64,"Well, do -- do you agree that the Petitioner is entitled to relief under that provision of the collective bargaining agreement?"
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2268.64,2272.775,"If -- if he -- his allegations of the facts are correct, yes."
2015.14-1280,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2272.775,2290.45,"In your hypothetical about stopping the person from crossing the street, or, they think, entering the parade, the individual is -- has no right to insist that the government doesn't make a First Amendment judgment about his activities?"
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2290.45,2292.3,That's correct. Justice Kennedy --
2015.14-1280,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2292.3,2310.01,"In -- in other words, the -- the -- the individual in the -- in -- in -- in -- the citizen of the United States, have no right, have -- have -- have no -- have no injury, have no interest in making sure the government doesn't evaluate everything they do from a political standpoint?"
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2310.01,2311.725,"I think they have an interest, Justice Kennedy."
2015.14-1280,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2396.9,2407.02,We know that you can't -- let's assume in this particular position you can't be fired because you're a Republican or a Democrat and that's what they -- that's what -- what they do.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2419.625,2421.15,"Justice Kennedy, that's right."
2015.14-1280,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2435.72,2437.7,"Here, they thought and they acted."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2437.7,2438.445,Okay.
2015.14-1280,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2440.07,2441.6,It's not just something.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2441.6,2441.965,Oh.
2015.14-1280,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2441.965,2451.07,It's -- the government is taking action against a person because the government thinks that that person is exercising First Amendment rights.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2451.07,2451.39,Just --
2015.14-1280,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2451.39,2458.54,And I thought -- and unlike Justice Scalia -- that the thrust of the First Amendment is operating on government.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2467.945,2476.315,"Well, essentially all of the rights, individual rights in the Constitution, other than the antislavery provision, requires State action. They all talk about what the government can't do."
2015.14-1280,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2477.09,2478.58,"Yes, so here, the government acted."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2491.86,2497.41,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me just say that I don't think it's -- it's contested after the Petitioner's reply brief."
2015.14-1280,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2560.26,2562.09,I guess I'm not sure how that works.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2575.73,2577.86,"Justice Kagan, that's, of course, not what I'm saying."
2015.14-1280,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2621.2,2627.31,But you're saying -- and -- and I think you said this straight out -- you're saying I can come into an office -- I'm a Democrat.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2652.14,2662.25,"That will -- two things. First, I think it is practically impossible because you would have to somehow magically pluck out the people who are politically apathetic from those that are politically neutral."
2015.14-1280,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2667.63,2675.34,You want this Court to hold that the government of the United States has a right to ascribe to a citizen views that he or she does not hold.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2675.34,2679.19,"Justice Kennedy, I think that that is not a First Amendment violation."
2015.14-1280,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2684.24,2690.565,"See, I had always thought that the First Amendment running through all our cases is an extremely strong strand."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2718.9,2721.23,"Justice Kagan, I think you are right."
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2742.24,2757.005,Can I just approach the same thing from a different perspective? Suppose can Congress pass a law or a legislature pass a law that attempts to abridge the freedom of speech.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2761.87,2763.15,What would the attempt --
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2763.15,2766.35,"Well, let's say there doesn't have to be a thousand examples."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2766.35,2766.755,The Court --
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2766.755,2768.66,You say that's the law.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2776.09,2776.8,No.
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2776.8,2777.16,Okay.
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2779.78,2783.6,-- but I just -- substitute any one that you want for that.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2799.905,2800.465,Right.
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2800.465,2802.975,"And therefore, it had no impact."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2819.02,2820.95,"Justice Breyer, the reason that we allow --"
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2820.95,2835.615,"Well, I just want to know, is it yes or no? Does it -- in your opinion, does it attempt to -- a clear attempt to violate the First Amendment in a statute? It has general application. Does it violate the First Amendment? Does it abridge the freedom of speech?"
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2835.615,2838.59,"If it's only going to be an attempt and it's not going to succeed, no."
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2841.4,2842.55,It is unconstitutional.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2842.55,2842.95,That's right.
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2844.1,2846.19,It will have a lot of bad effects.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2848.87,2852.76,"If it's defined, Justice Breyer, as not going to succeed, if the statute doesn't say --"
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2852.76,2855.0,"No, no, by chance it happens not to succeed."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2855.0,2856.04,"Oh, no, Justice Breyer."
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2856.76,2858.03,It's my hypothetical. (Laughter.)
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2858.03,2858.825,I know.
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2874.55,2875.14,Of course.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2894.31,2894.61,It doesn't.
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2894.61,2895.3,It does not.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2895.3,2896.14,And here would be an example.
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2896.14,2898.04,And he fails -- if it fails --
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2898.04,2901.415,"If I could just finish, Justice Breyer, just so -- I really do want to help."
2015.14-1280,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2915.865,2922.655,"Or -- or you could say that the law is passed by Congress but vetoed by the President, is there a violation of the Constitution?"
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2922.655,2923.455,There would not be.
2015.14-1280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2928.06,2934.65,We're off on a tangent because there's no injury in this situation when a law doesn't go into effect.
2015.14-1280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2944.49,2950.55,"I don't know, Mr. Goldstein, that I understand either."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2975.68,2980.83,"More than a policy, it will actually have adverse consequences for someone trying to exercise their constitutional rights."
2015.14-1280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2980.83,2983.275,"Well, someone, they have come along and not promoted people."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2983.275,2983.91,Yeah.
2015.14-1280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2983.91,2989.84,All right? So you have to have someone come in and say I'm not a Democrat?
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2989.84,2990.59,Justice --
2015.14-1280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2990.59,2991.17,I'm not a --
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2991.17,2991.45,Sorry.
2015.14-1280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2991.45,2995.985,-- Republican? Or you need someone to tell you what they are?
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2995.985,2996.31,No.
2015.14-1280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3008.66,3032.51,"So why isn't it simple to say, I'm not hiring you, or, I'm demoting you because you politically associated? And doesn't that chill the person from even walking by a campaign? Doesn't it chill others who do want to associate marginally?"
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3032.51,3032.71,No.
2015.14-1280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3033.06,3036.61,"I'm assuming there's no policy in place, that there's not --"
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3036.61,3037.11,Justice --
2015.14-1280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3037.11,3040.105,"There's nothing to prevent this otherwise, like the Hatch Act."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3040.105,3070.21,"I think it's a really important point on the question of chilling because Elrod and Branti and the rules that also -- and O'Hare, which is a one-off case, do say that you can't do this for political purposes if the person is actually exercising a constitutional right. So that we all agree that if the plaintiff here was a supporter of Spagnola, or even of the mayor, or had decided to remain politically neutral, this is a bizarre case that comes to you on the assumption that he is completely politically apathetic."
2015.14-1280,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3070.21,3071.765,It -- it is bizarre.
2015.14-1280,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3078.41,3080.74,-- made a statement to that effect.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3081.865,3082.7,"No, but I -- I --"
2015.14-1280,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3082.7,3084.09,It doesn't solve every problem.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3084.09,3084.34,No.
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3139.705,3145.8,But that is a First Amendment problem for the reason that lots of other people will have their speech chilled.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3163.11,3164.92,It's not true of the Constitution.
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3164.92,3165.65,Why not?
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3165.65,3165.8,Well --
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3165.8,3185.76,"That is to say I would think that a statute that has a chilling effect on the speech of millions of people but is directly aimed at A, B, and C, if because of some fluke A, B, and C are not themselves injured, nonetheless everybody else is, and it would violent the First Amendment."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3185.76,3186.05,Under --
2015.14-1280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3186.05,3188.85,"That, I think, is what you have here, which is why I raised my point."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3188.85,3189.13,Great.
2015.14-1280,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3210.31,3225.02,Do you know of any case in which we have relied on chilling effects where what was at issue was a one-off like this one as opposed to a -- a general policy which had a chilling effect? I don't know of any case.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3225.02,3234.77,"To the contrary, I can tell you that in -- in both Waters and Garcetti v. Ceballos, the Court said, look, we recognize the rule that's being proposed to us."
2015.14-1280,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3277.69,3278.88,And the -- (Laughter.)
2015.14-1280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3278.88,3284.47,And the question in this case seems to me to be highly artificial.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3287.2,3287.39,I agree.
2015.14-1280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3287.39,3331.53,"How often will it be the case that an employee will be unable to allege any expression or any association that is protected by the -- the First Amendment? It seems to me quite rare. And it may be that this case comes to us the way it does because the plaintiff was dealing with two things, one was the First Amendment, and the other -- I mean one was the issue that's -- the question of his motivation, and the other was this alleged policy prohibiting any kind of political activity. Even in the -- the person who is just apathetic, is there not a -- a First Amendment right to be -- say, I don't -- I don't like politics, I don't want anything to do with politics, I'm not going to register, I'm not going to vote?"
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3331.53,3332.49,All right.
2015.14-1280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3372.29,3372.74,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3377.31,3377.59,Well --
2015.14-1280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3377.59,3384.94,"I mean, you just can't say, I'm involved in this and the employer fired me because of that."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3384.94,3385.55,"Well, Justice Sotomayor --"
2015.14-1280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3385.55,3389.195,To show some connection between the firing and --
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3389.195,3389.635,Right.
2015.14-1280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3389.635,3390.67,-- the political belief.
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3390.67,3393.74,I would just take you back to my hypothetical of getting rid of the sign.
2015.14-1280,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3410.65,3410.75,Well --
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3410.75,3412.34,But the downside risk is significant.
2015.14-1280,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3412.34,3427.93,"Mr. Goldstein, I mean, if somebody had come in to me before today's argument and just said, does the First Amendment prevent the government from punishing a person because that person does not share the government's views, I would have said, why, yes, of course the First Amendment protects that."
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3461.895,3466.82,It -- it may be that I have not persuaded you in this case. (Laughter.)
2015.14-1280,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3466.82,3473.03,"The -- the -- I will say, Justice Kagan, what you ask is, can the government do it? The government cannot because there are lots of other protections."
2015.14-1280,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3485.735,3492.075,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frost, you have a minute left."
2015.14-1280,3,62645,mark_frost,,3492.075,3510.155,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. A couple points that I want to make with respect to declaring one as a neutral. If Heffernan was engaged in political activity and said, I'm supporting Spagnola, of course he would be protected by the First Amendment."
2015.14-1280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3524.925,3527.36,I'm -- I'm so totally confused.
2015.14-1280,3,62645,mark_frost,,3550.68,3552.785,"That's correct, Justice Sotomayor."
2015.14-1280,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3594.59,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
