1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,51.005,57.298,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1255.952,1256.972,"Mr. McAllister, the --"
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1256.972,1258.292,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1962.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1258.292,1264.509,-- Court of Appeals' opinion was based squarely on the arguably subject (Voice Overlap) --
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1264.509,1265.403,"Yes, that is correct."
1962.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1265.403,1266.649,-- put to Garmon.
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1266.649,1267.064,Well --
1962.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1267.064,1286.341,And I understand the distinction that the Solicitor General have made in which you've repeated and adopted between statutory jurisdiction and such as is here is involved and the matters that are within the expertise of the navy board such as it was involved in Garmon and perhaps --
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1286.341,1286.628,Yes.
1962.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1286.628,1289.171,-- in the last year's MEBA case.
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1289.171,1289.573,Right.
1962.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1289.573,1297.922,"But assuming that that is an invalid distinction, assuming that's invalid."
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1314.027,1343.187,I perhaps should've said Mr. Justice Stewart that a -- in the early -- in May when this matter began the union filed a charge with the Regional Office of the Labor Board in New York charging us with having violated Section 8 (a) (5) of the Act for having failed to bargain with the -- what they called the -- to the chosen representatives of the crew.
1962.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1383.143,1383.723,That's what the (Voice Overlap) --
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1383.723,1384.125,Yes.
1962.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1384.125,1386.518,"-- in the Court of Appeals, so I gather."
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1386.518,1387.504,That's what the dissent --
1962.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1387.504,1388.012,Yes.
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1388.012,1388.401,Yes.
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1393.769,1394.37,(Inaudible)
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1394.37,1396.17,"Yes, Mr. Justice White."
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1396.17,1415.457,"(Inaudible) it's necessarily to follow -- necessarily follows from the fact that the Labor Act may not apply to these foreign-flag ships to attempt with the representation of election, something like that."
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1432.291,1434.151,I think it does.
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1437.286,1445.837,"It's wholly on the ground that here in this case it is -- just because of the question of coverage that isn't preempted, is that right?"
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1445.837,1449.861,"No, I think that it goes -- again goes deeper than that."
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.146,1493.08,"Well, do you mean the piggy-back case, isn't -- wasn't upheld with the Railway Labor Act applied in some aspects with the -- that the Taft-Hartley Act applies to the union activities of boycotting?"
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1493.08,1495.445,"That is correct, Mr. Justice."
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1510.708,1516.152,But nevertheless the employer couldn't be forced to do anything into the Taft-Hartley Act in this case.
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1516.374,1517.061,True but --
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1517.061,1521.788,But the union could be prevented from doing something under the Taft-Hartley Act.
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1521.788,1523.708,"True, but I think the --"
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1523.708,1527.364,"Similarly, its conduct would've been protected under the Taft-Hartley Act."
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1527.364,1528.707,"Well, that makes --"
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1528.707,1531.245,That's better if it hadn't been an unfair labor practice.
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1531.245,1532.002,Yes.
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1551.116,1562.898,So you would say that the foreign-flag ships -- the owners of the -- came in (Inaudible) -- should not be able to file a complaint before the National Labor Relations Board.
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1562.898,1563.938,Correct.
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1574.37,1578.641,Or to sue for damages for a boycott under the Act.
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1578.641,1580.017,That they could not.
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1588.831,1589.275,"Well, what was on the --"
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1589.275,1590.229,-- because --
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1590.229,1602.181,"-- you perhaps said that I -- I've forgotten, what was on the picketing of the -- were there signs, the picket carry signs, what was on them?"
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1602.181,1604.669,The picket signs are in the --
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1604.669,1605.431,Are they in the record?
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1605.431,1606.872,"Are in the record, Mr. Justice."
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1606.872,1608.005,(Inaudible)
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1608.005,1616.295,I've gotten -- I think they've just simply said they had no dispute with anybody else except the crew of the Nassau and the crew of the Victoria.
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1622.904,1624.917,"Points alright, (Inaudible)"
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1624.917,1626.636,Very well.
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.302,1688.865,"There's no question though, the entire -- they intended to -- Congress intended the Act to be applicable to the union."
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1688.865,1688.994,The what?
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1688.994,1696.16,-- there's no question that Congress intended the Act to be applicable to union such as picketing here.
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1696.16,1699.532,"But not -- not I would say, Mr. Justice when the union --"
1962.33,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1699.532,1706.124,The -- but didn't intend it to be applicable at the suit of a foreign flag.
1962.33,0,17867,breck_p_mcallister,,1706.124,1706.454,No.
1962.33,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1856.749,1859.364,Mr. Ostrin.
1962.33,1,27764,h_howard_ostrin,,1859.364,1867.793,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1947.591,1955.303,The final paragraph in that opinion (Inaudible) -- it'll be more helpful to your -- the point you're now making but (Inaudible)
1962.33,1,27764,h_howard_ostrin,,1955.303,1969.976,"Mr. Cox, in his brief to this Court at page 13 stated, “The flag in registry of a vessel are not always decisive”."
1962.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2544.514,2546.029,Who owns them?
1962.33,1,27764,h_howard_ostrin,,2546.029,2550.745,"They are owned by Italian nationals, Mr. Justice Black."
1962.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2559.516,2562.885,"Actually technically it's -- they're owned by Liberian corporation, are they not?"
1962.33,1,27764,h_howard_ostrin,,2562.885,2565.3,Technically by a Liberian corporation.
1962.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2565.3,2565.41,But you --
1962.33,1,27764,h_howard_ostrin,,2565.41,2571.803,"Never have been to Liberian waters -- in Liberian waters, never been to Liberian."
1962.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2571.803,2577.155,How you -- how do you distinguish your case then from Benz?
1962.33,1,27764,h_howard_ostrin,,2577.155,2578.056,Whoa!
1962.33,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2609.979,2614.615,"Well, if that's true every foreign ship coming through this country go temporarily here?"
1962.33,1,27764,h_howard_ostrin,,2614.615,2629.497,"Well, I can't accept that, Mr. Justice Douglas because concededly even our American owned vessels are here temporarily but that doesn't preclude the NLRB from asserting jurisdiction over them."
1962.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2662.244,2670.064,"Well, do you not have to say that the opinion went further than it should with this language if you say to distinguish it."
1962.33,1,27764,h_howard_ostrin,,2689.939,2694.557,"I think so, Mr. Justice Black for this reason."
1962.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2711.211,2712.478,I mean by this language.
1962.33,1,27764,h_howard_ostrin,,2712.478,2713.227,Yes.
1962.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2778.371,2782.343,"Well, assuming that's true, how do you get around in effect?"
1962.33,1,27764,h_howard_ostrin,,2787.184,2788.096,Yes.

1962.33,1,27764,h_howard_ostrin,,2801.667,2806.631,"The distinction is I think is a relatively simple one, Mr. Justice Black."
1962.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2861.413,2861.638,But you could say --
1962.33,1,27764,h_howard_ostrin,,2861.638,2862.212,(Inaudible)
1962.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2862.212,2864.086,Excuse me.
1962.33,1,27764,h_howard_ostrin,,2877.842,2878.918,I couldn't say that.
1962.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2919.943,2923.338,"A great deal of this is done I'm sure over the Queen Mary too, wouldn't it, (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.33,1,27764,h_howard_ostrin,,2923.338,2938.748,"Well, except -- except there is this -- and I think it's a real distinction that on the case of the Queen Mary, the vessel is -- first of all, is engaged in the commerce of the flag nation."
1962.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3198.954,3203.566,I thought that is very much the same as the closing part of Section 12 --
1962.33,1,27764,h_howard_ostrin,,3203.566,3203.753,Very much to same.
1962.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3203.753,3204.8,-- of the Treaty.

1962.33,1,27764,h_howard_ostrin,,3219.61,3226.155,"Well, I submit that they must have been thinking of our local and existing laws."
