1966.336,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,24.632,"Number 336, the Toilet Goods Association Incorporated et al. Petitioners versus John W. Gardner, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and number 438, John W. Gardner, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare versus the Toilet Goods Association."
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,26.685,30.099,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1966.336,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,503.065,504.346,Do not urge what?
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,504.346,517.024,We do not go on to discuss or urge the merits beyond the jurisdictional point because we think the only issue that was properly before the Court of Appeals on the interlocutory appeal was the question of pre-maturity of rights.
1966.336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,517.024,525.502,"I notice the parties took pretrial discovery, they took about a year for pretrial discovery."
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,532.872,542.023,"Oh, I know but the District Judge I think was concerned over with the intent of the people who are behind the legislation."
1966.336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,551.758,556.807,"Additive legislative history as I read the briefs that they interviewed people who were there at the legislative hearing, committee hearings."
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,556.807,563.611,"Well, the District Judge, yes the District Judge thought that was a relevant way of determining what the statute meant."
1966.336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,775.236,785.235,"I thought their point was that you have jurisdiction to list or not list or control or have anything to say about their finished product as such, as such."
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,785.235,806.143,"Well, we think, we submit that and I don't think they really disputed is that we have jurisdiction or the Food and Drug Administration has jurisdiction to control a finished product although not as such if it had no color ingredients, but does have jurisdiction to control it as a terminal use of a coloring ingredient."
1966.336,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,834.493,836.273,"Diluent, diluent, how do you pronounce it."
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,836.273,838.864,"The diluents, we think that's true with the diluents too."
1966.336,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,909.104,919.324,I beg your pardon not that they were contending that the commissioner says I am going to list and certify the video inseparably.
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,919.324,928.076,The commissioner Mr. Justice Fortas I don't has ever said that and from what I am understand the need Food and Drug Administration takes no such position.
1966.336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1050.115,1055.592,"Do you think this case then is quite different from one we just heard, Abbott?"
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1055.592,1059.42,"We think it's more premature, you can put that way."
1966.336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1059.42,1073.173,"Because I understood you in the Abbott case, you said there was really no question about the complete lack of ambiguity that the polarity and certainty of the meaning of the regulation there involved."
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1088.177,1088.529,That's right.
1966.336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1091.028,1092.45,Or at least they are arguing about the need.
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1092.45,1093.608,"Right, well the way they distinguish--"
1966.336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1093.608,1095.919,In Abbott there was no argument at all about the meaning.
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1095.919,1104.116,I think the way to distinguish the two is that in Abbott Labs you know exactly what the plaintiffs will have to do to comply with the regulation.
1966.336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1104.116,1104.433,Yeah.
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1104.433,1110.819,"In this case we submit it's very likely, they will have to do nothing more than they would have to do anyway to comply with."
1966.336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1110.819,1118.462,"Well, of course they disagree with you but in that respect this case is different, and then you do disagree as to the meaning of the regulations, is that true?"
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1118.462,1121.851,I don't know whether you could put that it to the meaning of the regulation I think it's more
1966.336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1121.851,1122.734,Or the impact.
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1122.734,1123.971,The impact of the regulation.
1966.336,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1199.17,1218.399,"Mr. Lewin if an individual manufacturer for appropriate procedure challenged this in a particular case as you argue is contemplated by statute, would it be possible for him to argue that the regulation is confiscatory."
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1218.399,1223.971,"I think he could, I don't at present concede in what way --"
1966.336,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1223.971,1264.03,"Well then now in this case, (Inaudible) in paragraph 47 on their complaint as I see it, they're arguing they are making a kind of a substantive due process argument that this regulation is confiscatory from an industry wide basis, which does sound to me like some of the substantive due process, but on the industry wide basis, in other words, the industry as a whole says we're entitled to be considered as a whole and considering us as a whole this regulation is confiscatory."
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1264.03,1268.556,"Well, I think paragraph 47 goes to the fee requirement again."
1966.336,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1270.84,1271.801,For the fee requirement?
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1271.801,1273.16,Yes to the fee requirement.
1966.336,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1280.472,1284.083,Well it goes back to the separate listing for it.
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1326.553,1330.502,I think there are really two answers to that Mr. Justice Fortas.
1966.336,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1425.909,1429.07,Well did they support this lawsuit.
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1429.07,1429.416,Pardon me?
1966.336,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1429.416,1436.374,"Assuming that what you're saying were true, would that have a right to an injunction?"
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1436.374,1437.803,I think --
1966.336,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1437.803,1442.778,"Could this, would they have standing to maintain this -- would this be an appropriate suit."
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1442.778,1447.07,Oh I think there would be much more basis for permitting that kind of a suit.
1966.336,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1472.9,1493.198,"Well, why can't then that be litigated at a later time, if this can't be, why couldn't they refuse to list and go ahead and market the product and have action brought against them at one sort or another and then contend in defense of their listing that the payment of the fee is confiscatory?"
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1493.198,1496.065,Well that would be true with that individual fee be Mr. Justice Fortas.
1966.336,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1506.617,1510.424,If you are willing to concede that I have difficulty with the rest of your argument.
1966.336,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1510.424,1514.719,"Well I'm not prepared to concede it, but I'm saying that's a different, it seems that's that a difference case."
1966.336,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1556.424,1557.411,Mr. Ross.
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,1557.411,1562.431,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1966.336,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1638.918,1641.142,"Expect in degree there, what's the difference?"
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,1647.613,1653.277,"Well, it's a question of degree, but a very substantial degree."
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1926.703,1972.454,"Mr. Ross suppose if Food and Drug administration discovered, found and discovered that a particular and common ingredient used in cosmetics cause cancer or induced cancer giving a wild example and let's suppose then under 361(a) after appropriate proceedings, and adopted a regulation saying that cosmetic shall be deemed to be adulterated if they include such and such an ingredient it or if the label doesn't say so and so."
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,1993.728,1996.603,I'm not sure Your Honor I hope then -- I would say--
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1996.603,1997.891,That's the key question--
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,1997.891,2007.879,"No I, I don't believe it is because if you are dealing with the question of the propriety of listing the color."
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2007.879,2009.785,"No I'm not, I'm not dealing with that."
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2018.938,2019.131,Maybe I don't understand.
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2019.131,2020.99,It's a jurisdiction here --
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2020.99,2028.445,If I understand your question correctly you are saying that if FDA wants to determine that a particular color ingredient--
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2028.445,2030.528,"Not color ingredient, just an ingredient."
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2030.528,2031.431,Oh! Any ingredient?
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2031.431,2033.144,Any ingredient.
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2033.144,2036.865,"I don't know of any provision, they would have to--"
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2036.865,2039.619,3621(a).
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2039.619,2048.853,"They could -- if they were adulterated, then the product could be ceased after sale, there is a post marketing power after sale."
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2053.617,2086.659,"I understand that but suppose the secretary adopted, promulgated a regulation and they said that these cosmetics shall not contain this ingredient or shall not contain this ingredient unless there is a warning on the label that's under 361, and I just, I want to know whether industry or company, if it thought that that was confiscatory, might very well be in practical effect, could bring an injunction proceeding."
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2086.659,2095.134,I would think that that would be a classic case where the expertise of the agency would be involved and any court --
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2095.134,2101.067,Then district court here say that expert testimony would be helpful?
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2101.067,2115.588,"Well it did and principally in connection with the legislative history, they wanted to have the testimony as to what type of technical problem was involved in particularly testimony from those who help to shape the legislative history."
1966.336,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2226.201,2231.801,By contrast with the Abbott case the government is not asking us to adjudicate the merits--
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2231.801,2233.141,No they are not they are asking–-
1966.336,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2233.141,2234.747,They're asking us not to--
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2234.747,2243.051,That's correct what they are saying is that the District Court was wrong in denying my motion for summary judgment which was opposed by the government and they say the district court --
1966.336,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2243.051,2244.124,But the for the court --
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2244.124,2267.678,"The court could now determine these as questions of law without the necessity of any further evidence and as I point out in the brief where in fact someone filed objections before the administrative agency and to a different regulation and urged as a ground for objection, that there was no authority in the statute."
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2387.897,2394.755,"Was that, was that the trust of pre-trial to find out purpose of regulations."
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2394.755,2408.917,"Well, the trust was multiple, we were seeking to list as much of a background as we could, statements that were made by Food and Drug officials as to what was intended to be covered."
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2408.917,2415.671,"You mean, you put Food and Drug people on the stand and examine them as to what they intended by these regulations."
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2415.671,2416.71,That's correct yes sir.
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2416.71,2422.714,Now can you do that when you go to a Court of Appeals to review an administrative regulation?
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2422.714,2424.633,I doubt it now but the court --
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2424.633,2429.659,"I mean, this is something new that's been added in administrative law?"
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2429.659,2434.072,Well it was new to me but the court said to do it so I did it.
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2434.072,2437.792,"Why was that -- the court felt that it needed some light, is that right?"
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2437.792,2451.699,Court felt that my guess is and I'm only speculating on what was in the judicial mind that this was a very substantial issue and District Courts are very often reluctant to decide broad issues on summary judgment.
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2451.699,2452.181,Well it may be--
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2452.181,2456.271,But with government opposing summary judgment they felt they ought to have a trial.
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2456.271,2486.496,"It suggested in my mind, I may be wrong Mr. Ross that Judge felt the absence of what you get when you have a specific case before you, after there has been an attempt to enforce a regulation and in that way you get an idea of the meaning attached to it by the administrative agency and absence of that, the court said that you probably just go around and poke in to the administrative mind whatever that would be."
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2486.496,2508.079,"Well, this is what he wanted, he was doubtful about it, many times in conference in chambers he indicated that perhaps he was wrong and he was charting a new cost that wasn't sound, but anyway, it was his idea that there ought to be this kind of probing before he would determine this issue, but he was very firm in his mind, that the issue was one of statutory construction."
1966.336,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2606.334,2615.946,"Did your challenge here involved a challenge to the power of the commission to (Inaudible) for a license, is that a --"
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2615.946,2618.735,"No sir, I don't think that's the essence of our complaint."
1966.336,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2618.735,2619.969,Is that a part of it?
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2619.969,2636.557,"That is the part of that in the sense that not only do we wish to show the excess of statutory authority and the immediate application of the regulations, but also to complete the picture that they are burdensome, they have an impact on us and would cause us a irreparable harm."
1966.336,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2636.557,2639.15,What is the $600 license for?
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2639.15,2652.252,"$2600 for each cosmetic that you must get this license for before you can sell it, requires a petition and each petition must be accompanied by a filing fee of $2600."
1966.336,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2652.252,2653.326,Filing fee.
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2653.326,2653.94,What?
1966.336,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2653.94,2655.176,Did you say a filing fee?
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2655.176,2657.368,A filing fee yes.
1966.336,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2657.368,2659.876,Is that just beginning of the charges.
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2659.876,2662.113,"Well, that's the essence of the charge."
1966.336,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2683.607,2685.338,Before you get your license?
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2685.338,2687.897,Before you get your license to sell the cosmetics.
1966.336,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2687.897,2688.954,Testing of--
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2688.954,2691.313,Testing the cosmetic to be.
1966.336,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2691.313,2692.207,$8 million.
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2692.207,2693.075,I beg your pardon.
1966.336,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2693.075,2695.806,Testing involving cost of $ 8 million?
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2695.806,2702.645,Over eight million yes sir because the testing would have to be performed for thousands of products.
1966.336,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2741.755,2747.608,Is the purpose of agency to put a prohibitive cost on the spreading --?
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2747.608,2754.241,No I think the purpose was to take -- they feel they would like to have this power to license cosmetics when Congress did not give it to them.
1966.336,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2754.241,2759.174,"But do they have to charge something, is that much in order to get the power -- the license."
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2759.174,2764.399,"They say that's what, that's the fee that's involved in obtaining the listing."
1966.336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2764.399,2766.119,Is that a fee or a deposit?
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2766.119,2771.725,They call deposit but I never heard of anyone getting deposit back and if got --
1966.336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2771.725,2773.429,What's the deposit for?
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2773.429,2783.377,The deposit is to cover the cost of the agencies testing it reviewing the application and it is a reasonable deposit as it applies to the dye because --
1966.336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2783.377,2784.496,(Inaudible)
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2784.496,2786.993,As applies to the dye or the color ingredient.
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2786.993,2790.139,The Congress provided for the fee or is this --
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2790.139,2793.659,No the fee was established by the agency.
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2793.659,2795.783,Was it authorized by the Congress?
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2795.783,2803.365,"I think the statute would authorize a fee, we don't object to the fee as applied to the color ingredient we thinks it's a --"
1966.336,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2803.365,2806.868,Does this $8 million involve the color ingredient?
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2806.868,2814.774,$8 million dollars is the minimum cost of testing the products of one company that makes 2700 cosmetics.
1966.336,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2814.774,2816.683,"But who tests that, pays that cost?"
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2816.683,2819.657,The Company pays that cost.
1966.336,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2819.657,2822.085,It makes 2700 kinds of cosmetic?
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2822.085,2823.358,That's right.
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2833.854,2841.675,"I suppose the cost to companies, that much money it must cost the government a lot of money to make it test too isn't it?"
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,2841.675,2866.289,"No because the government – it depends on what we are talking about, if we are talking about the testing of the dyes and color -- all the statute contemplates then, then there are only a handful of those colors and the burden of testing them isn't too great although the FDA said it will take 20 years it is a substantial burden but one which the industry can assume."
1966.336,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3006.024,3007.991,Would it be more dangerous?
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,3007.991,3009.008,I beg your pardon.
1966.336,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3009.008,3013.974,Would it be more dangerous either from the number of additive issues for any other cause?
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,3013.974,3021.223,"on the contrary it's far less dangerous because for most cosmetics, there is no ingestion at all."
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3101.885,3125.695,"Well, is it possible that there are some products in which you can test the color additives standing by itself, another products or species or varieties or how do you I don't know what the proper word is, in which you'll have to test the whole product in order to find out what the effect of the color additive is."
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,3140.684,3155.098,"No, no, the hearing started because this court in Fleming v. Florida Citrus Exchange decided that if I a color in a tremendous quantity might be harmful it couldn't be used even though it is --"
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3155.098,3168.416,"I know, but the whole background of this is belief in some quarters or the publicity or propaganda whatever you wanted to say, to the effect that some cosmetics have been harmful."
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,3168.416,3170.278,No I don't believe so Your Honor the cosmetics--
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3170.278,3171.738,There have been any such--
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,3171.738,3172.314,There have been--
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3172.314,3174.604,Have been any such belief?
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,3174.604,3188.478,"There was such a case with respect to a type of cosmetic, which was more than a cosmetic that was the anti-wrinkle cosmetic which had to qualify as a drug and that came under the drug regulations rather than the cosmetic regulations."
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3188.478,3198.336,Then you are saying to me that the Food and Drug Administration has not in any time contented that cosmetics might be -- certain cosmetics might be harmful.
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,3198.336,3206.814,"I wouldn't say that I don't know if they have ever taken such a position, it is conceivable that there maybe some ingredient in a cosmetic which is harmful."
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3217.967,3232.597,"Let's get to my precise question, is it possible and perhaps you've already answered it, that there in, that in some instances you can test the color additives standing alone."
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,3243.016,3246.072,It is possible there maybe cases of the latter pattern.
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3246.072,3258.308,"Yes, and so that you might have a very different situation depending upon the facts of the particular case and the characteristics of the particular product."
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,3258.308,3268.744,"Right and Congress does authorize under the statute that in determining whether you will clearly call a additive, you can determine its intended use."
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3268.744,3283.664,"Right now what you are trying to do here is to get a procedure, device a procedure by which an injunction being -- ask court for an injunction on the basis of a generalization?"
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,3283.664,3284.208,Oh! No sir.
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3284.208,3301.028,And the other possibility is that you might guess – you have to wait until a particular situation is presented to the courts in the context of a particular administrative action.
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,3301.028,3301.715,I don't believe so.
1966.336,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3348.738,3351.805,But here we are dealing with cosmetics and not bicycles.
1966.336,1,23019,edward_j_ross,,3351.805,3368.598,"That's correct I was arguing by analogy, but at the same time we are dealing with an ingredient of a cosmetic and not with the cosmetic itself, which we say is not subject to pre-marketing clearance, it's subject only to post-marketing jurisdiction."
1966.336,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3371.693,3374.595,Mr. Lewin.
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3374.595,3383.412,I'd just take the few minutes remaining to clarify possibly this question of course which has come up again.
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3426.344,3429.354,You mean one petition cover many cosmetic products?
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3429.354,3446.975,"Oh, it can cover, it can cover a whole range of lipsticks for example, the Food and Drug Administration will list -- let's say on the basis of a common base that the 20 or 30 lipsticks have a whole sequence of different colors that the company may provide or may supply."
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3446.975,3475.422,"What is your explanation so on for the government saying well there maybe 20 different lipsticks which has, each of which has only one color ingredient, one color additive in each of them and yet we are not going to just list the color additive as safe for use and we are going to require every lipstick that has this color additive units be separately certified or separately listed then what does it imply?"
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3475.422,3487.136,"The Food and Drug Administration has found Mr. Justice White that the coloring ingredient in and of itself maybe harmless, but when it's combined with some of the diluents that appear in the cosmetic, the product is harmful."
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3487.136,3492.194,"Why not, why not list the diluents and the additives?"
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3492.194,3495.154,"Well, it's the combination of the two that may cause the harm they interact chemically--"
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3495.154,3501.972,"I know but you don't list diluents that are harmful and that with certain additives, we won't clear them --"
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3501.972,3504.755,"Well, that precisely that's exactly -- that's all the power that the Food and Drug Administration --"
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3504.755,3513.023,"I know but why do you have to have two goals at it, both the color additives the diluents and the lipstick."
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3513.023,3520.586,"Well, we don't it doesn't have to be separately listed that's exactly our point, they can all be -- they will all appear in the one paragraph--"
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3520.586,3542.03,"Once you get a case which presents the question of whether if one additive is safe to be used with this diluents, once you've decided that why do you have to have every other product in the world that's got those two products to be separately listed -- once you have made the decision, why do you have to do it over and over and over again."
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3542.03,3546.053,"Oh, well, because presumably the other products in the world that are being combined with that are being combined--"
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3546.053,3547.919,Presumably but there's no --
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3547.919,3557.736,"No, no realistically that they are different from this product because there is a third diluent that's in, there is another -- that's what distinguishes them from this and that we don't know what the coloring ingredient—"
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3557.736,3565.588,But your regulation will cover the situation where this other lipstick has only those same two products?
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3565.588,3567.505,No then it will not have to separately listed.
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3567.505,3569.218,"Well, why is that exemption?"
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3569.218,3584.82,"Well, the being statute specifically provides Mr. Justice White that the Secretary or the Commissioner has authorized to list color ingredients generally if he feels that really if it combined with any other product they will cause no harm."
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3584.82,3589.361,"But you haven't, you said -- you say you wanted to get it to final product."
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3589.361,3592.646,"If there is a possibility that it will cause harm yes, and I think the Commissioner --"
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3592.646,3601.019,Does it make any difference to you if this one company makes product A and it got one color additive and one diluent --
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3601.019,3601.649,Yes.
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3601.649,3617.87,"They file that one, you listed $2600 and then it wants to sell product C under another name for another company, pack it for another company whatever you call it and you say they have to have that listed too although."
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3617.87,3618.46,"No, no."
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3618.46,3619.019,Why not?
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3619.019,3631.275,"Because the listing will say color ingredient A when added to diluent A is safe and no matter who produces it, we don't care who the manufacturer is no matter who produces he will be permitted under the statute --"
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3631.275,3646.263,"Well, then why is this your answer to the claim of 2700 separate listing for the same -- they wouldn't even have to list in one petition or in 100 petitions, all of these products."
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3646.263,3662.068,"If they are all identical definitely, but all that we are saying if they if one had one diluent and the other one has two and the third one has three, they do have to list those which differ to the extent they differ and even the $2600 cost if there is nothing, if there is nothing --"
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3662.068,3677.608,"I want to make sure, you are saying that if this situation took place just possibly, the secretary would say not that this product is safe, I mean this particular brand is safe, what would he say?"
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3677.608,3689.703,"He would say that the combination of base, a base made up of certain chemicals with a certain ingredients is permissible, he wouldn't, he would list it that way, he does it with his brand name."
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3689.703,3692.035,Then he -- he puts our an order like that.
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3692.035,3692.768,Yeah.
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3692.768,3694.346,Or whatever he does.
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3694.346,3697.173,"He is listed in a Federal register, in the Federal regulation."
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3697.173,3705.575,"Then the next company decides, well I've got the same product, I am just going to sell it no listing."
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3705.575,3709.253,"If it's chemically identical it's listed, you can sell it."
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3709.253,3718.404,"So this regulation really doesn't mean what it says does it, that everybody, you have to list every, every --"
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3718.404,3724.652,"Every finished product to the extent that it differs not to the extent that it's label is different, not to the extent that its put up on a different brand."
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3724.652,3727.168,Is that what the regulation says?
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3727.168,3729.227,"Yes, Well I think the regulations just speaks --"
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3729.227,3731.844,"Because then you really don't have to list every cosmetic, do you?"
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3731.844,3734.475,"Well not every brand, no I don't think anybody has ever suggested that you have got to --"
1966.336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3734.475,3741.961,"Whether its brand or not, you say you don't have anything that the secretary is already passed on, you don't need to list it, you don't need to --."
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3741.961,3761.699,"If it's chemically identical you don't have to list it again, the perfect illustration is cellophane which we cite in our brief, the regulation which covers a variety of cellophane product, it never mentions certainly particular brand, it just covers them in one paragraph with a wide variety of chemical, different chemical products."
1966.336,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3761.699,3764.042,"The food additive, that's a food additive."
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3764.042,3768.024,Well and we think the same thing could apply to a cosmetic additive.
1966.336,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3768.024,3771.579,"Yeah with the cellophane question it doesn't, it never comes under the cosmetic products."
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3771.579,3780.197,"Oh, no, no, but it's just that the very same technique could be used by the commissioner or will be used by the commissioner in the food field and that the food additive problem of course is quite different."
1966.336,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3780.197,3781.076,"Quite different, yes."
1966.336,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3781.076,3806.097,"Yes, because but the usual things that are combined with coloring ingredients of food are generally totally harmless or at least that standard while obviously in cosmetics there are, of the kinds of the chemicals are being combined or not the kind of things you can swallow and you just don't know, the commission doesn't know until it is testing what, how they interact with the coloring ingredients."
