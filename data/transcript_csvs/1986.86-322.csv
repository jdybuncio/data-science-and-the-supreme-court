1986.86-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,27.067,"We will hear arguments next in two consolidated cases, No. 86-322, Crawford Fitting Company against Gibbons; and No. 86-328, Champion International Corporation against International Woodworkers of America."
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,57.437,61.705,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,253.18,256.449,xxx statute?
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,256.449,273.827,"--No, I think that the court of appeals said that the Alyeska case did not permit them to grant fees which did not... which were not in the statute, Your Honor."
1986.86-322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,306.732,312.785,"Well, you could come to that conclusion whether or not you think it has anything to do with Alyeska."
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,316.439,317.006,That's correct.
1986.86-322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.006,319.324,--whether you think Alyeska covers these things or not.
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,319.324,319.991,That's correct.
1986.86-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,414.603,417.472,"Well, that was pretty much dicta in Farmer, was it not?"
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,417.472,437.301,"--I would suggest that... Justice Rehnquist... that it was not dicta, that it was the heart of the case that, as Judge Posner says, dicta is to be determined by the fact of whether you can remove the language and have the opinion make sense."
1986.86-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,439.318,442.872,"Well, was that language necessary to the holding in Farmer?"
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,442.872,443.889,--Absolutely.
1986.86-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,446.157,450.776,"Yes, but what was it used for, to deny or grant fees?"
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,450.776,455.097,"--The opinion, in my opinion, Your Honor, Justice--"
1986.86-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,455.097,457.28,"Well, you can just answer that question, can't you?"
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,457.28,465.453,--It was used to demonstrate that the lower court had the discretion to decide; they affirmed.
1986.86-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,465.453,474.741,"Well, my question now: Did it... did it result in denying fees or granting them?"
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,474.741,481.164,They denied fees in excess of 100 miles; that's correct.
1986.86-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,481.164,488.834,So the district court had... didn't... wasn't required the grant the maximum fees.
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,488.834,490.103,"That's correct, Justice White."
1986.86-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,493.472,498.19,That's a long ways from saying you can grant more than the statute says you can.
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,498.19,511.016,--I don't think... I think the Farmer case says very clearly that the trial court has that discretion to consider whether or not.
1986.86-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,638.382,641.484,"You say it's an entirely different animal, Mr. Mansour."
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,648.138,654.042,"--That distorts the historic view of an expert, Your Honor, Justice."
1986.86-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,681.609,688.196,"Well, the ones who become advocates may be more successful at winning their cases than one who maintains strict neutrality."
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,688.196,703.689,"But is that not up to the discretion of the court to determine whether or not that expert was helpful to the court, rather than to one party or the other, in determining whether to award fees."
1986.86-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,703.689,709.677,And you say that's the standard by which the district court ought to decide whether or not to award fees to a particular expert?
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,709.677,710.878,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,710.878,719.984,"Well, how do you escape the limitation on witness fees' to $30 a day, in 1821?"
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,722.686,723.652,Yes.
1986.86-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,734.094,735.544,Where does it get it?
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,735.544,739.196,From 54(d).
1986.86-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,739.196,750.087,"Well, 54(d) says, unless... unless a statute otherwise requires, doesn't it?"
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,753.571,773.802,"Justice Black says this: While this rule could bed far more definite as to what, quote, costs shall be allowed, the words, quote, unless the court otherwise directs, quite plainly vests some power in the court to allow, quote, some costs."
1986.86-322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,777.487,780.873,"Well, that part of it is certainly dicta."
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,783.491,784.26,Perhaps.
1986.86-322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.26,787.462,"Yes, but to disallow doesn't necessarily mean to allow."
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,787.462,787.912,Perhaps--
1986.86-322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,787.912,796.734,"I mean, it could be, and this is the argument, that the rule sets forth what cost will be awarded automatically when the court says nothing at all."
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,805.256,809.792,"--Justice Scalia, that's the argument proposed by the proponent."
1986.86-322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,809.792,810.125,Right.
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,810.125,812.977,That does not fit the case... the Farmer case.
1986.86-322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,816.398,817.298,But that's what happened in Farmer.
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,820.016,822.968,--That was the result of Farmer.
1986.86-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,852.404,863.027,"Well, 54(d) says, except where express... except when express provision therefore is made either in a statute of the United States or in these rules."
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,863.027,864.129,"That's correct, Justice White."
1986.86-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,864.129,870.366,"Well, here's 1821, says, $30 a day for witnesses."
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,870.366,883.174,"However, unless the court otherwise directs, Justice Black says, therein lies the ability for the court to direct other costs."
1986.86-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,883.174,886.625,"Well, they didn't direct other costs in Farmer."
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,886.625,888.077,That's correct.
1986.86-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,888.077,892.779,"Well, if that's a holding, I don't know what a dictum is."
1986.86-322,0,22744,ernest_p_mansour,,892.779,896.164,I'll reserve the balance of my time.
1986.86-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,896.164,898.033,"Thank you, Mr. Mansour."
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,901.068,904.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,992.745,994.347,"Before you get to that, counsel--"
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,994.347,994.864,Yes.
1986.86-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,994.864,998.216,--how does Title VII get into this case?
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1017.795,1020.112,I think that's a good point.
1986.86-322,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1120.795,1124.999,"You concede, I take it, that you're not entitled to attorneys' fees because of Christianburg."
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1124.999,1125.399,"--Yes, sir."
1986.86-322,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1125.399,1127.951,You say expert witness fees come under a different category?
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1127.951,1128.917,"Yes, sir, we do."
1986.86-322,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1182.318,1190.941,"Well, do we have to decide that question in this case of yours, do you suppose?"
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1190.941,1196.678,The question of whether a Title VII defendant would be exposed to a different standard?
1986.86-322,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1196.678,1197.295,Right.
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1197.295,1201.732,I don't think that you'd have to decide it in this case.
1986.86-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1259.251,1262.805,"But why is that different from, say, the only eyewitness to the case."
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1266.691,1270.126,"Well, that's a different ""can't decide the case"", I submit to you."
1986.86-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1284.486,1287.921,That's just because that happened to be the issue of fact in the case.
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1287.921,1291.807,"Well, yes, yes, that's true."
1986.86-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1301.18,1309.184,"But would the rule be any different than, say, the only witness in the case lived in South America, and you had to fly him up here to testify to what he saw three years ago?"
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1313.571,1313.955,"No, I wouldn't."
1986.86-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.955,1315.538,Why not?
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1315.538,1339.02,"Well, I would say that... I would say that, to the extent that Farmer, and coming back to some of these questions, I think if there is any ambiguity in Farmer, it would go along those lines, whether we're just talking about certain types of nonstatutory, non-attorneys' fees costs, or are you going to limit yourself to things like expert costs, third party... third party costs."
1986.86-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1339.02,1343.924,"Well, all I'm asking is, your argument it seems to me doesn't necessarily apply just to expert witness fees."
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1343.924,1344.34,"No, it doesn't."
1986.86-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1344.34,1346.392,It applies to anything you really need to win your lawsuit.
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1346.392,1346.976,"No, it doesn't."
1986.86-322,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1360.719,1366.456,Certainly ones that were totally unknown to me in practice I must say.
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1366.456,1367.556,Right.
1986.86-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1368.856,1370.242,How about extraordinary travel expenses account?
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1381.632,1382.632,"--No, they would not."
1986.86-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1399.861,1401.796,Don't the lawyers help the court?
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1401.796,1410.569,"They do, but in an entirely different sense, and they have an entirely different duty, we submit, to the court than a witness or an expert witness."
1986.86-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1511.934,1517.588,"Now, you're arguing in 322, 86-322?"
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1518.171,1522.039,"Champion case, yes, sir."
1986.86-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1522.039,1523.873,"--Oh, the Champion, all right."
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1523.873,1526.375,"Yes, sir."
1986.86-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1570.687,1571.639,You talk about inherent traditional power.
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1576.358,1577.21,--Very rarely.
1986.86-322,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1665.933,1669.802,"But deposition costs are authorized by statute, are they not?"
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1669.802,1670.569,"Yes, they are."
1986.86-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1689.466,1708.927,"Referring to your deposition cost, isn't it possible to read Farmer as saying that the discretion that was awarded to the trial judge was to deny excessive deposition costs, such as daily transcript and things like that; that that's the scope of the discretion is, within the area of allowable costs, sometimes are excessive, and there's discretion to cut back."
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1708.927,1710.046,"Well, I'll go back."
1986.86-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1716.283,1718.616,And clearly they do have discretion to do that?
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1718.616,1721.118,--There's no question that they have discretion to deny them.
1986.86-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1730.71,1733.426,Whether they have discretion to allow costs not authorized by statute?
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1733.426,1733.812,--To allow them.
1986.86-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1737.114,1738.947,"Well, why were we?"
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1738.947,1741.316,Because that's the fundamental question--
1986.86-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1741.316,1745.033,We denied fees.
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1745.033,1748.421,--You affirmed the denial of them.
1986.86-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1748.421,1749.304,Exactly.
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1749.304,1750.487,And added--
1986.86-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1750.487,1755.741,We didn't allow any costs that weren't authorized by statute.
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1755.741,1757.041,"--No, you didn't."
1986.86-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1758.093,1761.829,"Well, what do you mean we're focusing on allowing costs, then?"
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1761.829,1763.514,"--No, I don't think you focused on allowing costs."
1986.86-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1767.349,1775.739,"Yes, and as Justice Stevens says, to deny costs even though they might have been allowable within the statute."
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1775.739,1779.191,"--That was the fact of Farmer, that's true."
1986.86-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1797.068,1802.889,So it was broader... the language was broader than the holding?
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1802.889,1803.639,--Yes.
1986.86-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.389,1808.057,Dictum or not?
1986.86-322,1,33403,jeffrey_a_walker,,1808.057,1817.996,--But I don't believe that you can excise that language from the Farmer opinion itself.
1986.86-322,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.996,1819.163,"Thank you, Mr. Walker."
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,1826.269,1830.47,"I represent J.T. Gibbons, Inc., Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1986.86-322,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1867.429,1869.179,Which is not involved in your case at all?
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,1869.179,1870.813,Which is not involved in my case at all.
1986.86-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1872.413,1875.765,xxx issue is contrary to yours?
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,1875.765,1879.903,"--Actually, he agrees with mine with regard to the general discretion."
1986.86-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1888.092,1888.692,All right.
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,1888.692,1897.615,"And my position is that where Congress has spoken and given a statutory authorization, the courts certainly may follow that authorization."
1986.86-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2008.269,2011.823,Unless... unless the court appoints them.
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2011.823,2012.923,Unless the court appoints them.
1986.86-322,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2042.842,2046.377,"How many of those say they may, and how many of them say they must, do you know?"
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2046.377,2052.281,I believe they predominantly say they may; some of them say they shall.
1986.86-322,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2055.815,2059.268,"Because to the extent they say they must, they don't help your case very much."
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2063.52,2068.29,"--In the sense... in the sense, if that was Congress wishing to take away the discretion to deny that it's recognized in Farmer?"
1986.86-322,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2068.29,2080.014,"--That's right, because if they say they must, it doesn't indicate any disbelief on Congress' part that the court couldn't have done it without the statute."
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2084.835,2085.818,I wouldn't so read them.
1986.86-322,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2359.964,2366.435,Do you assert that prevailing plaintiffs are entitled to attorneys' fees under the antitrust statute?
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2366.435,2367.201,Attorneys fees or--
1986.86-322,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2367.201,2368.97,"No, I'm sorry, expert witness fees."
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2368.97,2370.787,--That is not at issue in our case.
1986.86-322,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2370.787,2375.141,"No, but what's your view on it, in view of your construction of the law?"
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2375.141,2386.432,"In view of my construction of the law, the lower courts have been consistent in holding that a prevailing plaintiff is not so entitled."
1986.86-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2407.262,2417.034,xxx that means... that means saying that 1821 doesn't mean what it says.
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2417.034,2420.486,--Congress can by additional statute provide for additional attorney fees.
1986.86-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.486,2421.605,"Well, of course it can."
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2421.605,2423.488,"I mean, excuse me, additional expert witness fees."
1986.86-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2423.488,2423.955,Yes.
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2424.89,2426.74,"If Congress does not, then they are not awardable."
1986.86-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2436.031,2437.914,"No, it certainly hasn't."
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2437.914,2438.983,Then we are in agreement.
1986.86-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2442.101,2443.018,Even to plaintiffs?
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2443.018,2446.07,Even to plaintiffs.
1986.86-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2545.436,2553.923,Why would those exceptions allow the awarding of costs that Congress hasn't provided for?
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2553.923,2561.178,"The court stated that in developing its congressional schemes, Congress had understood those three to exist."
1986.86-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2561.178,2571.284,"You mean, the witness fees, $30 a day in 1821, except when one of these three conditions exist?"
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2571.284,2573.05,"Well, I can do no better than--"
1986.86-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.05,2576.902,Weren't we just talking about attorneys fees in Alyeska?
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2576.902,2579.854,Is there a difference between attorneys fees and witness fees?
1986.86-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2592.495,2595.03,"Well, we don't have to deal with that here, do we?"
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2595.03,2595.98,--Attorneys fees?
1986.86-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2595.98,2602.95,"No, we don't have to deal with whether one of these exceptions would actually allow--"
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2602.95,2603.469,No.
1986.86-322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2603.469,2604.152,--expert witness fees.
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2604.152,2608.171,"No, none of these exceptions is met here."
1986.86-322,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2724.581,2727.314,"Before you sit down, Mr. Block, may I just ask you one question?"
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2729.7,2730.402,"Yes, it was."
1986.86-322,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2730.402,2731.268,Did you try it?
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2731.268,2732.152,I did not try it.
1986.86-322,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2732.152,2733.77,Did Seattle counsel try it?
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2733.77,2734.137,No.
1986.86-322,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2737.572,2740.674,"And your opponent was a Cleveland lawyer, is that correct?"
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2740.674,2741.208,That's correct.
1986.86-322,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2741.208,2743.626,"None of them were members of the bar down there, I guess?"
1986.86-322,2,43856,william_h_block,,2743.626,2745.245,"They associated local counsel, Your Honor."
1986.86-322,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2745.245,2748.447,I see.
1986.86-322,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2748.447,2751.232,"Thank you, Mr. Block."

1986.86-322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2797.178,2798.297,Are you arguing for--
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,2802.164,2803.448,"--No, sir, I'm not."
1986.86-322,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2832.184,2834.553,"But you're arguing for affirmance here, are you not?"
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,2834.553,2855.466,"I'm arguing for affirmance, but I'm arguing for reversal of the direction the court majority below, and the en banc majority, extends its opinion by saying, in the exercise of our supervisory power, we direct all district courts to follow this rule that nobody gets expert witness fees."
1986.86-322,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2862.787,2867.191,Who else could object to that... who else could object to that direction?
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,2870.809,2872.845,"--well, we certainly were a party, Your Honor."
1986.86-322,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2875.813,2876.697,You have to be more than a party.
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,2879.582,2881.7,"--All right, well, we are directly harmed in that our--"
1986.86-322,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2881.7,2883.351,--Not in this case.
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,2883.351,2885.652,--Not in this case; that is correct.
1986.86-322,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2885.652,2888.104,I really don't see how the issue gets here.
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,2891.572,2892.758,Beg your pardon?
1986.86-322,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2892.758,2897.126,"If you want this kind of relief, you should have cross-petitioned."
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,2897.126,2910.803,"It is my understanding of the rule about cross-petitioning that if the judgment, the bottom line judgment is affirmed, and we are not asking for more or less than the affirmed decision."

1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,2947.393,2949.011,"I didn't appeal, Your Honor."
1986.86-322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2974.043,2979.88,"So you're saying as a respondent, I'm just suggesting that the judgment be affirmed on another ground?"
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,2979.88,2982.816,"Yes, sir."
1986.86-322,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3068.022,3069.505,"Well, there's another choice."
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3080.73,3082.365,"That's true, Your Honor."
1986.86-322,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3087.05,3089.601,And there the expert could be paid by the client.
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3089.601,3092.203,--It's a possibility.
1986.86-322,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3094.489,3097.607,"Well, we see some pretty big numbers once in awhile."

1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3108.749,3110.265,"I'm not going to argue that, Your Honor."
1986.86-322,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3122.39,3127.626,"In this connection, Mr. Youngdahl, would you buy Judge Rubin's approach in dissent?"
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3127.626,3128.626,"Yes, totally."
1986.86-322,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3156.563,3162.55,Are you talking about attorneys fees provision in Title VII or in 1988?
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3162.55,3163.5,"Both, Your Honor."
1986.86-322,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3170.905,3173.089,With respect to the attorneys' fees provision?
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3173.089,3175.024,"--Yes, sir, it was patterned exactly after it."
1986.86-322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3209.114,3218.803,But you say that... you say that approaching it that way these defendants aren't... weren't entitled to expert witness fees because they weren't entitled to attorneys' fees.
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3218.803,3220.403,"That's right, because of Christianburg."
1986.86-322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3222.238,3224.221,Which is a different ground for affirmance--
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3224.221,3224.79,--Precisely.
1986.86-322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3224.79,3226.09,--than your colleague here is arguing?
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3226.09,3227.457,"Precisely, Your Honor."

1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3267.767,3268.3,Pardon?
1986.86-322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3268.3,3270.402,This is a piece of statutory construction.
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3270.402,3271.636,Yes.
1986.86-322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3271.636,3273.888,This isn't just supervisory power.
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3280.025,3281.959,"What they say there, the last sentence--"
1986.86-322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3281.959,3294.851,"Well, I know, they direct all their district courts to, but that's just surplussage, They could have put a period after their first sentence, and all the district courts would have had to comply."
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3294.851,3295.719,"--Well, do it anyway."
1986.86-322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3295.719,3301.355,"So it's a piece of statutory construction, and it's really a question of, did they construe the statute correctly."
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3301.355,3301.79,"Well, that's true."
1986.86-322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3332.726,3343.534,"Well, that's a strange way of... strange way of saying that; 1988 doesn't say that."
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3343.534,3346.069,"--No, but for a very good reason, Your Honor."
1986.86-322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3348.036,3358.977,Where does something say it that would overturn or would suggest that 1821 doesn't govern?
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3358.977,3371.517,"--Your Honor, 1821 and the statutes and Rule 54 particularly say that other than when provided for by Congress in other matters."
1986.86-322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.517,3372.719,Like 1821.
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3372.719,3378.421,"Okay, so we're saying it was provided for in other matters by 1988."
1986.86-322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3385.86,3387.479,Where do you get that?
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3387.479,3389.195,From the legislative history.
1986.86-322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3435.393,3442.713,"So expert, attorneys fees are expert witness fees, or expert witness fees are attorneys fees; is that--"
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3442.713,3445.249,Yes.
1986.86-322,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3454.271,3460.091,"--I thought your argument was that they were the costs as between solicitor and client; that they were part of cost, not part of fees."
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3461.474,3463.876,"Well, I don't know whether it makes a whole lot of difference whether they're called costs or fees."
1986.86-322,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3486.092,3487.526,But it is important to me in trying to understand the statute.
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3494.432,3495.064,"Yes, Your honor."
1986.86-322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3498.383,3502.918,But attorneys' fees in turn are part of cost; is that it?
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3502.918,3504.753,"--I don't know, Your Honor."
1986.86-322,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3530.805,3534.89,"So you would include in that, too, then, just to make it clear, extraordinary travel expenses."
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3542.245,3542.878,--Sure.
1986.86-322,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3578.751,3583.739,"Well, once again, whatever is in, is in only for the plaintiff."
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3587.441,3589.726,"Well, I think that's a little overstatement, Your Honor."
1986.86-322,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3599.499,3600.399,"--Yes, the traditional--"
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3600.399,3600.867,--That is correct.
1986.86-322,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3600.867,3602.051,"--Sure, sure."
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3615.675,3617.691,It makes a difference because right now--
1986.86-322,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3617.691,3618.71,You got a bad dictum down there.
1986.86-322,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,3618.71,3619.693,--because nobody is getting representation.
1986.86-322,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3624.245,3626.897,Because they're following a dictum that's no good.
