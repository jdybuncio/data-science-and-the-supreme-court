1982.81-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,We will hear arguments next in Associated General Contractors against California State Council.
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,72.196,79.583,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.81-334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,450.542,453.228,Is the complaint in any of the printed materials?
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,453.228,454.161,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1982.81-334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,454.994,455.68,Pardon?
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,455.68,456.413,It is in the record.
1982.81-334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,460.315,464.452,But is it in the printed materials?
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,464.452,465.052,Oh.
1982.81-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,469.671,472.289,"It is in the appendix to the petition for certiorari, is it?"
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,472.289,472.805,--That is correct.
1982.81-334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,475.307,476.343,All right.
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,476.343,485.365,The second matter in which we believe the Ninth Circuit has inaccurately characterized the complaint is in asserting that the complaint claims a boycott.
1982.81-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,511.08,514.984,"From which part of the complaint were you reading, Counsel?"
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,514.984,521.371,"The part I was reading from, Your Honor, is paragraph 24, and particularly subparagraphs (3), (4), and (5)."
1982.81-334,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1043.576,1049.58,"Mr. Watson, somewhere in your dissertation are you going to comment on Blue Shield against McCready?"
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,1049.58,1050.849,"I am just coming to that, Your Honor."
1982.81-334,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1126.614,1128.682,"Now, you have not covered this argument in the supplemental brief?"
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,1128.682,1129.516,"--Yes, I have."
1982.81-334,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1149.013,1149.763,Let me go back to my question.
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,1151.132,1151.865,"--Yes, I have."
1982.81-334,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1151.865,1152.932,Covering McCready?
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,1152.932,1153.548,"Yes, I have."
1982.81-334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1159.988,1164.272,That does not necessarily mean we will get it.
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,1172.045,1175.163,My apologies to the Court.
1982.81-334,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1175.163,1175.847,It is not your fault.
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,1176.713,1183.084,If I may just backtrack for a moment.
1982.81-334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1314.635,1320.689,"Mr. Watson, your reasoning along this line may be quite persuasive."
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,1336.317,1339.269,I think Your Honor is correct in the ordinary situation.
1982.81-334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1367.253,1382.096,"If we do get to the standing issue, which I take it is what the present part of your argument is addressed to, do we not have some difficulty simply speculating as to what evidence on proximate cause introduced personally to the complaint if it went to trial would prove?"
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,1382.096,1389.285,"Well, I think in this case the chain is so long and attenuated, that it would be difficult for me to concede that."
1982.81-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1457.446,1459.163,"Mr. Watson, may I ask you a question."
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,1467.202,1467.819,Yes.
1982.81-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1467.819,1487.533,"Now, in your argument on the antitrust violation, are you relying primarily on the fact that the pleading is not sufficiently specific because it just says coerce, or are you contending that if all of the members of the association did, in fact, agree that none of them would do business with a nonunion contractor, that that agreement would not violate the antitrust laws?"
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,1487.533,1491.151,"Well, the latter point is not alleged in the complaint but--"
1982.81-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.151,1492.301,"Well, that is what I am asking you."
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,1499.674,1503.876,--I am specifically not contending that the problem is that the pleading is not specific enough.
1982.81-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1505.828,1507.411,"--Well, let me rephrase my question."
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,1521.254,1523.039,--None of them would do business with nonunion?
1982.81-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1524.056,1524.656,With union.
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,1526.074,1526.408,--With union.
1982.81-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1526.408,1526.924,Yes.
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,1526.924,1531.026,"No, I think it would not, under the doctrines that I have enunciated."
1982.81-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1538.632,1545.136,"But even if the complainant excluded the words ""boycott"" in so many words, you would still say that is not the kind of boycott which the Sherman Act is--"
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,1545.136,1546.572,--That is exactly right.
1982.81-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1569.985,1572.77,--What would be the steps to bring it before the Labor Board?
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,1572.77,1590.85,"Well, there are several different kinds, depending on which of the allegations in the complaint one is focusing on The so-called double-breasted businesses are frequently attacked by the union as a refusal to bargain under Section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act."
1982.81-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1590.85,1601.039,"In other words, they might single out one employer and go after him on a refusal to bargain because of the agreement he had made that was postulated by Justice Stevens?"
1982.81-334,0,33487,james_p_watson,,1601.039,1601.739,That is right.
1982.81-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1649.972,1655.674,Mr. Van Bourg.
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,1655.674,1657.859,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.81-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1674.284,1675.336,I am not sure... if I may interrupt you--
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,1675.336,1675.82,--Surely.
1982.81-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1675.82,1692.03,"--would you agree with your friend that if a hypothetical situation developed by Justice Stevens were posed, that one employer could be proceeded against in the Labor Board?"
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,1692.03,1694.065,"No very readily, Your Honor."
1982.81-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1696.5,1697.95,I am not talking about the difficulty of proof.
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,1699.969,1725.536,"--As an 8(a)(5), as an 8(a)(5), assuming that the contractor has entered into a collective bargaining relationship with the union and then seeks to avoid the collective bargaining relationship by developing a sham entity or a double-breast, as we refer to it, and that we file a charge under Section 8(a)(5) to allege, in essence, an attempt to run away from an agreement, a runaway shop."
1982.81-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2044.674,2046.86,Do you feel this is kind of a rehearing of the Connell case?
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2046.86,2047.676,Absolutely not.
1982.81-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2165.27,2179.947,"But wouldn't these people be entitled to assume, at least for purposes of putting together a policy, that generally your bids from union contractors are going to be higher than your bids from nonunion contractors, and therefore it is not a nondiscriminate exclusion?"
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2179.947,2180.78,I do not think so.
1982.81-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2463.979,2474.537,"Mr. Van Bourg, suppose I agree with you that a union may be a plaintiff in the sense that it has standing."
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2487.528,2489.13,"--All right, now we get to the standing issue--"
1982.81-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2489.13,2489.597,Yes.
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2489.597,2491.499,--which I really feel is the crux of the case.
1982.81-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2491.499,2492.032,Yes.
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2492.032,2497.985,"Having overcome, if I can, for purposes of argument, the antitrust portion--"
1982.81-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2497.985,2498.519,Yes.
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2498.519,2500.521,--the antitrust context of the matter.
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2647.784,2650.153,May I ask about the one link in the chain?
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2656.139,2658.756,I think employees might have standing.
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2686.826,2700.252,"No; but is it not true that, just focusing on one union employer for the moment, is it not true that the impact on the union is less direct than the impact on the employees who pay the union dues?"
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2700.252,2705.37,"I am not so sure that I could say that it is less, less direct."
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2722.082,2723.166,"Well, I would say both."
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2723.166,2723.951,He would have lower wages.
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2723.951,2725.784,"Or no wages at all, possibly."
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2725.784,2726.684,Or no wages at all.
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2735.057,2736.592,That is right.
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2736.592,2739.21,The union has its own damages and institution.
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2741.912,2745.797,But the union could not be damaged unless its members were first damaged.
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2745.797,2754.137,--I would say that if we again take a look at the text of the Clayton Act and deal with the absolutely--
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2754.137,2754.637,"Well, I understand they are covered literally."
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2755.453,2756.12,--That is right.
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.255,2761.541,And so are the employees and so are the customers and the suppliers.
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2761.541,2763.993,"--Well, but what about the contract, Your Honor?"
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2824.647,2826.414,I must confess I am puzzled.
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2828.349,2829.099,--Yes.
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.599,2831.118,I thought it was an agent for its members.
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2831.118,2833.57,--As the collective bargaining agent for the employees--
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2833.57,2834.786,Oh.
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2834.786,2838.788,"--the grievance is owned by the union, not by the worker."
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2838.788,2840.14,Owned?
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2840.69,2841.773,That means--
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2841.773,2844.142,"Do you mean that if there is a dollar recovery, the union can pocket it?"
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2844.142,2844.575,"--No, no."
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2850.879,2854.431,And the union has ability to ask--
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2854.431,2855.114,The Westinghouse case--
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2855.114,2856.283,--for good faith in representing the worker.
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2856.283,2857.05,--That's correct.
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2858.05,2859.068,It does not own the claim.
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2861.235,2864.036,"--Well, let me put it in another context."
1982.81-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2910.75,2916.754,"You don't need the owning of the grievance to win your lawsuit, do you?"
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2916.754,2917.088,No.
1982.81-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2917.088,2924.594,"Because I just wondered, when you get back pay, the union doesn't get it; the worker gets it."
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2924.594,2935.152,"The worker gets it, vindicating the collect... although the worker gets it in his pocket, it vindicates the collective bargaining agreement for all the other workers."
1982.81-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2935.152,2939.454,"Well, you can't spend that, but you can spend the money that's in your pocket."
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2941.305,2943.839,"I agree, Your Honor, but I was answering the question."
1982.81-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3110.279,3129.174,Is it your... is it the thrust of the complaint the way you construe it... and this is your own complaint... that the object of the alleged conspiracy was really not so much to... against the union contractors but against the union?
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,3129.174,3136.597,That's how I must interpret the complaint because that's how the Ninth Circuit interpreted the complaint.
1982.81-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3172.703,3175.138,"But you didn't, for example, suffer any competitive injury."
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,3179.993,3183.725,I would say that McCready is right on point.
1982.81-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3198.375,3200.22,Well McCready--
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,3200.22,3202.61,Certainly no competitive interest.
1982.81-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3225.021,3229.942,I'm not so sure your parallel to Canal is as precise as you would make it.
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,3252.809,3255.059,"Your Honor, I stated precisely that."
1982.81-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3277.704,3286.371,"But you used Connell talking about your union having to respond in damages under the antitrust laws, and of course, Connell doesn't say that in so many words."
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,3295.727,3318.624,"Well, Your Honor, in all due respect I think Connell says that what Local 100 did in that case, notwithstanding it being cognizable by Section 8(b)(4), Section 10(L), and Section 303 of Taft-Hartley was also cognizable by the antitrust laws and was remanded back to the United States District Court for further findings."
1982.81-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3318.624,3321.623,But to determine whether there was preemption or not.
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,3321.623,3323.514,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3371.182,3375.881,"Let me ask one more question, if I may, about the specific conspiracy that you've alleged in--"
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,3375.881,3376.333,Yes--
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3376.333,3377.382,--Your complaint.
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,3381.676,3382.456,--Yes.
1982.81-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3382.456,3389.721,"And you do not allege, as I read the complaint, that the members of the association have refused to do business with union subcontractors."
1982.81-334,1,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,3398.905,3414.459,"Your Honor, we have alleged that they have entered into a conspiracy with owners, with general contractors, with their own membership, because remember, the AGC, and we allege in the complaint, has both union and an open shop division."
