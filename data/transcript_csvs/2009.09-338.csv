2009.09-338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.468,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-338, Renico v. Lett."
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,6.82,12.141,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.09-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,78.333,78.733,Excuse me.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,98.746,106.816,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, the first note was the note regarding our raised voices disturbing other proceedings."
2009.09-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,108.232,108.532,Excuse me.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,111.533,120.473,"--Well, the Michigan Supreme Court refers to that as early on in the second day of deliberations."
2009.09-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,129.312,130.931,Did anybody hear the voices?
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,130.931,134.716,"--The record doesn't disclose, doesn't disclose that."
2009.09-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,134.716,148.743,"Could you tell me what facts found by the lower courts or the trial courts show that the Court acted, quote, and this is from our earlier Perez case, the very first in this area,"
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,158.979,160.414,Well--
2009.09-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,160.414,162.533,--show that activity?
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,162.533,174.341,"--Justice Sotomayor, the first point I would make is that, of course, this is on habeas review, and so the -- the Michigan Supreme Court made factual findings here that would be due deference."
2009.09-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,174.341,179.293,What is the factual finding that you think we have to give deference to?
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,192.45,199.472,"Well, the factual finding by the Michigan Supreme Court that -- that there appeared to be acrimonious deliberations."
2009.09-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,202.507,215.815,"But I'm not sure how that finding supports the finding, or a finding, that the Court was acting deliberately, responsibly, and not precipitously."
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,215.815,244.084,"Going back to this Court's opinion in Perez, considering sound judgment, discretion, considering all the circumstances, here we have to look at the totality of the circumstances in that it was a relatively short trial, that we have a note that could be reasonably interpreted as acrimonious deliberations, the second note that could be reasonably construed as a deadlock."
2009.09-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,277.804,281.606,Because the foreperson at first hesitated.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,305.802,310.44,I don't necessarily believe it was a reluctant no.
2009.09-338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.44,311.906,She might have been sneezing.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,314.975,317.009,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,317.009,319.795,And that's another factor in this.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,339.023,340.709,"Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.09-338,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,364.371,366.138,May I ask you another question about what happened?
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,390.523,391.573,"Correct, Your Honor."
2009.09-338,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,391.573,394.225,So when did he leave?
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,400.993,401.761,Correct.
2009.09-338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,407.579,413.649,"Can you tell me, along the line of -- the same line of questioning, I understand about AEDPA."
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,445.101,450.922,"It may be good practice, but the question becomes whether it's constitutionally required."
2009.09-338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,450.922,456.809,I'm asking -- I'm asking if it's good practice as a general practice.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,456.809,457.409,"I would say -- well, in this Court--"
2009.09-338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,457.409,461.111,"Because -- because that will bear, ultimately, on a constitutional issue."
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,474.537,482.543,"--Well, I believe that discussion with counsel is a factor in -- in the consideration."
2009.09-338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,487.928,494.434,"What if, in fact, there isn't -- what if both Counsel say, no, you should not declare a mistrial?"
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,497.034,498.903,Absolutely.
2009.09-338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,499.986,500.769,That's not a very big fact.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,500.769,512.06,"Well, it's important in the coercion context, because certainly the trial court has an independent obligation to ensure a just judgment."
2009.09-338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,512.06,518.197,That independent obligation is not reinforced by getting counsel's views just as a matter of good practice?
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,518.197,519.732,It may be.
2009.09-338,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,533.89,534.842,"Well, certainly it's good practice."
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,544.864,546.164,--Correct.
2009.09-338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,551.716,556.269,Was there an objection here by counsel for the defendant?
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,556.269,556.735,No.
2009.09-338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,565.856,568.458,"Well, there was a ruling by the court: I hereby declare a mistrial."
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,575.445,575.995,Correct.
2009.09-338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,575.995,579.08,So it would be rather awkward for the counsel at that point.
2009.09-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,579.08,592.99,"There was no -- there was no pause, you agree, between the foreperson's report and the court then said immediately afterward: The jury is dismissed."
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,596.525,605.563,"Well, it -- it would be difficult for counsel to object at that point, but I still think counsel could have made a record immediately at that point."
2009.09-338,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,605.563,607.013,Why would it have been difficult?
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,619.321,627.76,"Well, that is possible and that as seen in the Webb case as well, where the trial court -- this is a circuit court--"
2009.09-338,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.76,633.229,What do you make of the fact that in subsequent proceedings the prosecutor acknowledged that the judge made a mistake?
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,633.229,646.971,"--In Michigan confessions of error are controlled by court rule as a procedural matter, and the appellate courts have the ability to accept statements that could be qualified as a confession of error or not."
2009.09-338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,662.064,669.067,There are thousands and thousands of mistrials every year and hung juries are not all that unusual.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,738.711,748.999,"Well, the difficult part in answering Your Honor's question is that this Court has indicated that there is no mechanical formula or test."
2009.09-338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,748.999,749.449,Correct.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,777.15,779.852,"I don't believe it is, Your Honor."
2009.09-338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,779.852,780.352,I know you don't believe it.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,792.076,797.897,"I reach that conclusion by looking at this Court's other language, for instance--"
2009.09-338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,797.897,799.749,I don't want you to look at this Court.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,815.442,816.309,--I have not--
2009.09-338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,816.309,818.075,--where they said it wasn't an abuse of discretion.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,819.594,826.665,"--I have not found a case on these facts with a note indicating acrimonious deliberations, that is correct."
2009.09-338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,826.665,828.2,There is no note indicating.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,867.586,874.757,But the reference there about don't say what you're going to say is likely a reference to don't give the breakdown of your verdict.
2009.09-338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,874.757,878.626,"Mr. McGormley, is it your burden to answer that question?"
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,894.321,896.071,It is Petitioner's burden.
2009.09-338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,896.071,910.18,"It is Petitioner's burden to show that there are cases like this, where I guess to show that uniformly in cases like this, there is no discharge of the jury."
2009.09-338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,916.134,919.786,Exactly but I'm drawing some conclusions from your silence.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,921.738,925.34,"I haven't found a case on these facts, but that's consistent--"
2009.09-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,925.34,933.213,"Have you found any case where a judge has declared a mistrial without conferring with counsel, where the declaration was upheld?"
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,933.213,953.526,"--Actually, there's one out of the Sixth Circuit, Klein v. Leis, from this very circuit, in which the individual -- it was not a deadlocked jury case, but the individual had some sort of stun or control belt on the defendant and he lifted it up, and the trial court--"
2009.09-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,953.526,967.017,"Well you can't read from that one, because in that one it was -- the mistrial was held, not because of a jury deadlock, but because of improper prejudicial actions during the trial."
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,967.017,967.702,--But that's--
2009.09-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,967.702,968.902,Those are different questions.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,968.902,971.738,--But it's still a manifest necessity determination.
2009.09-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,980.844,983.477,"Could you -- yes, but that doesn't mean none."
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1021.117,1038.678,"Well, to best answer Your Honor's question, I would point out again that in Arizona this Court mentioned that examples being of abuse of discretion or actions that cannot be condoned are when the trial court acts irrationally, irresponsibly, or for pretextual reasons."
2009.09-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1074.265,1081.502,"Why isn't that this one, meaning the jury doesn't say, we are deadlocked, hopelessly deadlocked, we cannot reach a verdict."
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1098.48,1107.069,"--Well, again, as I -- as I mentioned, it's a reasonable view of the first note that it is indicative of acrimony."
2009.09-338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1113.223,1114.989,"But again, that's -- that's not your burden."
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1146.172,1147.607,That is correct.
2009.09-338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1147.607,1152.159,"And that has to be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, correct?"
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1152.159,1152.793,That's correct.
2009.09-338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1152.793,1154.928,Why didn't you answer that to those questions.
2009.09-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1154.928,1161.332,But what is the status of the -- the Allen charge in Michigan?
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1169.105,1174.009,"Well, a -- Michigan has adopted the ABA standard."
2009.09-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1193.07,1197.422,"And that wasn't requested, either?"
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1197.422,1201.409,"Well, that was not -- that was not done here."
2009.09-338,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1248.354,1259.329,"May I ask you as a matter of Michigan practice, could the trial judge have interrogated the other jurors beyond the foreman and asked them what they thought about whether there was a deadlock?"
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1259.329,1264.298,"--I believe that is permissible, though not constitutionally required."
2009.09-338,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1264.298,1267.25,Is there any reason -- do you suppose there is any reason why he didn't do that?
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1267.25,1269.452,I believe--
2009.09-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1269.452,1271.302,She.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1271.302,1271.768,"--she, the trial judge--"
2009.09-338,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1271.768,1277.122,"He took the view of the foreman, an answer to one question, and that was it; is that right?"
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1277.122,1279.891,--The--
2009.09-338,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1279.891,1289.83,"His conclusion that there was a deadlock was based on one question and one answer of one of the jurors, and that was the whole record supporting his decision; is that right?"
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1289.83,1291.115,"--Respectfully, no, Your Honor."
2009.09-338,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1297.185,1298.852,"Well, what other circumstance is relevant?"
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1305.189,1311.862,"--Well -- oh, I believe it does, because this Court has indicated in Arizona that -- that acrimony is a concern."
2009.09-338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1329.472,1335.375,"Mr. McGormley, what evidence was there to the effect that the jury was not deadlocked?"
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1335.375,1336.658,None.
2009.09-338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1336.658,1343.195,"Which is presumably what the other side has to prove by clear and convincing evidence, if -- if we accept the factual finding of the State court."
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1343.195,1344.231,Correct.
2009.09-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1385.439,1394.378,"Mr. McGormley, do we have any indication how long this trial judge was on the bench when this trial came up?"
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1394.378,1399.013,How long in terms of serving on the bench?
2009.09-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1399.013,1399.297,Yes.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1399.297,1410.571,My recollection is that this was an experienced trial judge who then went to either civil arena from recorder's court or retired.
2009.09-338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1415.875,1433.003,"Acrimony, I recognize we have talked about it in Arizona, but it -- I mean, it could be that the jurors had all agreed on the murder count and they were just quarrelling over whether they should add the firearms count, or the other way around."
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1433.003,1438.388,"Well, it -- it -- it gets back to that fundamental--"
2009.09-338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1438.388,1444.209,In which case they would be much closer than -- than your comment about acrimony might indicate.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1444.209,1462.522,"--Well, it gets back to the fundamental principle that the trial court should be able to take -- now, this is on the second, but the initial layer of deference -- that the trial court should be able to take the foreperson at her word when she says that the jury is deadlocked, the jury is deadlocked, especially -- especially in light of these--"
2009.09-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1462.522,1475.263,"You can't say, can you, that every time the jury records that it can't reach a verdict or it hasn't reached a unanimous verdict, that that's a legal deadlock requiring a mistrial, can you?"
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1475.263,1476.263,--I do not assert that.
2009.09-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1476.263,1485.186,"So obviously the word ""deadlock"", and as I read the judge's questions, he defined it merely as a disagreement as to the verdict."
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1504.932,1519.108,"Well, I guess I don't quite see the difference, because if the jury is in -- I -- I think hopelessly deadlocked is probably a higher standard than -- than genuinely deadlocked--"
2009.09-338,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1519.108,1521.958,That isn't what the judge said just before she got the response.
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1525.076,1526.543,--Right.
2009.09-338,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1528.278,1530.195,"And the foreperson said: No, judge."
2009.09-338,0,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,1530.195,1532.914,"It's a bifurcated question, correct."
2009.09-338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1606.092,1607.159,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,1615.913,1619.133,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1668.178,1670.214,What -- what would be gained from that?
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,1675.915,1692.793,"Well, at the very least, it evidences that the trial judge at least considered that there were -- that there competing interests and -- and debated whether to -- to dismiss the jury, which is an extraordinarily drastic remedy."
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1703.832,1710.086,Do people usually -- in your experience is there usually a clear breakdown between prosecution and defense on a question like this?
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,1721.31,1726.697,--My -- my experience -- there is a range of things that are going on.
2009.09-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1738.153,1752.163,"Ms. -- Ms. McCowan, you are -- you are arguing the case as -- as though the -- the only question for us is whether it was an abuse of discretion by the district judge -- by the trial judge here."
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,1797.84,1808.815,"Well, first, I am not sure that I understand -- I -- I disagree with the -- with the premise that -- that there was a factual finding by the trial court that the jury was in fact deadlocked."
2009.09-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.837,1818.537,"Well, what was the basis for that declaration of mistrial?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,1818.537,1825.027,"--Well, presumably on these facts it would be that -- that -- her estimation that the jury was deadlocked."
2009.09-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.027,1825.027,Right.
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,1825.027,1827.593,But there is no actual specific ruling.
2009.09-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1840.703,1849.475,The Michigan Supreme Court's determination is simply a determination of the same fact: There was a manifest necessity because the jury was deadlocked.
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,1849.475,1850.592,"--Well, my--"
2009.09-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.592,1857.312,"I mean, that factfinding is implicit not -- not only in what the trial court did, but also in the Michigan Supreme Court's decision."
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,1857.312,1869.722,"--My understanding of manifest necessity is that that was a legal determination by the Michigan Supreme Court, that there was -- according to this Court's precedent, there was manifest necessity."
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1869.722,1875.626,"If the jury is hopelessly deadlocked, is there a situation where that would not constitute manifest necessity?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,1875.626,1881.197,"Typically, a genuinely and hopelessly deadlocked jury does constitute--"
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1881.197,1885.332,"So it does get back to the factual determination of deadlock, correct?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,1885.332,1888.95,"--Generally, yes -- yes, I believe so."
2009.09-338,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1889.55,1912.299,"The Michigan Supreme Court cited four factors in support of its decision: the length of the deliberations in relation to the complexity of the case, the heated discussions among the jurors, the fact most importantly that the foreperson said that the jury would not be able to reach a unanimous verdict, and the fact that there was no objection by defense counsel."
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,1922.172,1924.874,"--No, there are no specific requirements."
2009.09-338,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1924.874,1937.2,"And is there -- could you give us a long list of -- of lower court cases holding that in a case where those four factors are present, a trial judge may not grant a mistrial?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,1937.2,1938.15,"Well, no."
2009.09-338,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1944.47,1953.576,"The question is when those four factors are present, why are they not sufficient to establish that the judge was exercising sound discretion?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,1966.716,1970.185,"--Well, I -- I under -- I think I understand the question."
2009.09-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1988.73,1997.003,"So can -- what -- what is -- looking at -- can you take the converse of the question I asked your colleague on the other side, if you can remember it?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2002.055,2002.971,Right.
2009.09-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2002.971,2006.34,What is wonderful about this case is there is no disagreement about the facts.
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2065.893,2067.277,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2009.09-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2067.677,2069.929,How could it be that there are no cases?
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2073.464,2074.797,"--Indeed, there--"
2009.09-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2074.797,2076.933,How can it be that there are no cases?
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2080.801,2094.609,"--Well, I -- I -- I did undertake tremendous research, as did my staff, and I did not find -- I mean, a short answer is I did not find anything that looks even remotely as bad as this."
2009.09-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2095.092,2096.494,"Oh, that's good."
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2117.824,2124.211,"--Well, I guess the short answer is that -- that there was nothing exactly on point."
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2131.584,2137.738,"So the -- so the proposition that what happened here is an abuse of discretion cannot be said to be clearly established, right?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2137.738,2141.356,"Well, I don't think that it has to be established at -- at a granular level."
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2150.877,2154.413,You don't have anything like this case that says this would be an abuse of discretion?
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2154.413,2171.256,"--Well, I -- I do believe that this case looks something like -- Jorn, which is a plurality opinion from this Court, where the trial judge acted without warning, acted sua sponte, no warnings to the parties whatsoever, and immediately declared a mistrial; was acting irrationally, irresponsibly--"
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2171.256,2175.743,So the fact that it's a plurality opinion means that it was not clearly established by the decisions of this Court.
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2175.743,2194.954,"--But in Arizona v. Washington this Court quoted Jorn for the proposition that when the trial judge acts irrationally and irresponsibly and precipitously, that their action -- that their ruling will not be upheld; and instead, sound discretion requires that the trial judge act carefully and deliberately."
2009.09-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2194.954,2205.076,"But our -- but our cases have required much -- much more than that, much more than referring to a generalized standard that our opinions have set forth."
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2258.027,2280.226,"Well, I do understand -- well, I guess the best answer that I have for that is that, why there are no cases, is maybe because -- I mean, I don't know, but what I -- what I came up with or theorized is that I think that for the most part trial courts understand that this is a tremendous obligation that they must exercise sound discretion."
2009.09-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2284.445,2285.13,That may be.
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2286.247,2286.247,And there's nothing--
2009.09-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2286.247,2289.365,"--which says it's a terrible statute, but there it is."
2009.09-338,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2304.889,2313.544,"I thought your -- your position was that everybody agrees on what the law is: If there is a deadlock, a new trial is appropriate."
2009.09-338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2332.608,2336.727,"Well, is it quite correct to say the legal issue is whether there's a deadlock?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2343.264,2344.5,"--Precisely, Your Honor."
2009.09-338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2344.5,2354.038,"And the argument is that there was not a manifest necessity shown, even though there was disagreement about whether there was a deadlock, because all deadlocks are not exactly alike."
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2354.038,2354.871,Precisely.
2009.09-338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2354.871,2358.823,"Some people think one -- there is one holdout, that means it's a deadlock."
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2365.024,2366.893,I agree.
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2366.893,2382.319,"I thought you answered an earlier question that I asked -- maybe I'm -- maybe it was something I asked your friend, although I doubt it, since it would help him -- that the issue did come down to the factual determination of deadlock, because if there is deadlock then there is manifest necessity."
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2382.319,2383.336,I'm sorry.
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2391.941,2392.108,Right.
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2395.877,2401.713,"--Well, no, I believe that the case ultimately comes down to -- I am sorry if I misspoke before."
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2415.704,2421.275,With the layers -- with the two layers of deference worked into your formulation.
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2436.868,2459.65,"Well, my understanding of 2254 is that it does take into consideration the contours of the underlying constitutional violation, and it still is our position that if the -- if the trial judge was not exercising sound discretion, that it -- that it can't be objectively unreasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court to have found that, that that is necessarily contemplated by 2254."
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2459.65,2474.16,"Doesn't our law clearly establish the fact that the prosecution bears the burden of showing there's manifest necessity, and if there is an absence of evidence supporting that burden, hasn't been -- hasn't been -- why isn't that the answer to the case?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2474.16,2475.76,"Well, that certainly sounds fair."
2009.09-338,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2489.733,2490.519,"Well, why is that -- why is that so?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2502.66,2514.984,"--I think, yes, practically -- practically speaking, I think he probably would have been reluctant to jump up and -- I mean, this is a Friday afternoon and the judge has essentially released them for the day--"
2009.09-338,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2514.984,2516.817,What does he have to lose at that point?
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2539.933,2550.74,"--Well, I think just as a practical matter, having the jury hear that the defense does not want the jury to leave, the potential for prejudice would be tremendous."
2009.09-338,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2555.392,2557.144,Are you really saying that?
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2577.808,2583.962,"--Well, I -- I'm not sure how we -- we would know on these facts that the jury was 11-to1 for acquittal."
2009.09-338,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2583.962,2586.628,"Well, I'm not suggesting that they were or they weren't."
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2600.971,2603.839,I certainly would hope so as well.
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2620.849,2622.551,What -- what -- I'm sorry.
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2623.434,2623.867,--No.
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2623.867,2624.301,Okay.
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2633.359,2643.047,"Well, I don't think that the Michigan Supreme Court even made a specific finding that the jury had become -- had completely devolved at that point and they were no longer -- I think that--"
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2643.047,2646.182,"No, you don't dispute the fact that a note came out saying, Are we being too loud?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2646.182,2646.432,--Not at all.
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2646.432,2650.201,"Well, what would that indicate other than that there was some degree of acrimony?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2650.201,2664.811,"I think it just also indicates they maybe they just don't want anybody to hear them and they want to make sure that they are not being overheard, and that, you know, they have some privacy in their deliberations and freedom to, you know, engage in a -- in a free debate, as loud as they want to be."
2009.09-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2678.303,2686.576,"Well, maybe that's right and maybe it's wrong, but the State courts thought that it was evidence of acrimony, which it could be."
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2698.717,2708.423,"--I'm not sure -- I mean, maybe I am just not understanding the Michigan Supreme Court opinion, but I don't know that they actually made a finding that that was, in fact, evidence of acrimony."
2009.09-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2722.83,2723.663,Don't waste your time.
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2723.88,2724.53,I'm sorry.
2009.09-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2724.53,2725.546,Don't waste your argument time.
2009.09-338,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2726.215,2741.375,"Counsel, there is no case in our jurisprudence with identical or nearly identical facts, so this is not under the 24 -- of 2254(d)(1)."
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2754.699,2764.055,I think Arizona v. Washington clearly establishes the law that the trial judge must exercise sound discretion in finding a manifest necessity.
2009.09-338,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2776.715,2783.635,"And in that case, one of the specific factors was that he consulted with -- the judge consulted with counsel before making the ruling?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2783.635,2786.653,"In this case, that he -- that the trial judge failed?"
2009.09-338,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2786.653,2787.419,In -- in Arizona.
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2787.419,2788.203,"Oh, right."
2009.09-338,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2803.429,2817.105,That's a little shaky as precedent for -- that -- that was a case that said: The trial judge did right and no double jeopardy for a new trial.
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2833.698,2853.511,"But I thought that this Court did say that in any mistrial declaration, the trial judge is obligated to still exercise sound discretion, and a review in court must satisfy itself that, in accordance with Perez, that the judge did in fact exercise sound discretion in finding that there was manifest necessity."
2009.09-338,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2872.725,2880.263,"So are you suggesting that whenever the trial judge abuses his or her discretion in granting a mistrial, there can be relief under AEDPA?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2890.018,2891.469,--I'm sorry.
2009.09-338,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2896.956,2897.39,Right.
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2897.39,2897.906,Yes.
2009.09-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2912.3,2929.844,So the standard of review for setting aside a determination of the State Supreme Court is exactly the same as the standard of review for reviewing a Federal district court and a Federal court of appeals despite AEDPA?
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2937.831,2939.117,"No, I'm sorry."
2009.09-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2959.797,2967.035,"But it's objectively unreasonable, you say, whenever there has been an abuse of discretion by the -- by the trial court, right?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2967.035,2977.492,"Well, if the trial judge does not exercise any discretion whatsoever and acts irrationally, irresponsibly, and precipitously, I believe that relief would be warranted, even under habeas review."
2009.09-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2977.492,2982.396,So it's not just abuse of discretion; it's abuse of discretion plus something else?
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,2983.079,2992.252,"Well, it's -- it's whether the Michigan -- whether the -- the decision under review, whether it was an objectively unreasonable determination of this Court's precedent."
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2992.252,3003.643,"So you -- you do agree that there could be situations where a Federal court on direct review would find abuse of discretion, and yet a court on habeas under AEDPA would say that that has to stand?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,3003.643,3006.012,Yes.
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3024.102,3034.809,"So there are a category of cases where a Federal court could look at it and say, that's an abuse of discretion, but that same court reviewing it under habeas would say you are not entitled to relief under AEDPA?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,3034.809,3036.909,I think that that is right.
2009.09-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3036.909,3045.515,"But ""objectively unreasonable"" is already built into the criterion of abuse of discretion."
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,3059.508,3063.293,"Well, our argument is that the trial court was not in the ballpark here."
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3069.999,3071.499,How can you say that?
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,3103.017,3111.456,"Well, my -- my argument is that the judge was not exercising sound discretion because she was not responsibly gathering the facts."
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3119.061,3121.095,"No, she asked the foreperson a question."
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,3121.095,3127.149,"--But if I could just back up a couple lines, she received the note saying: What if we can't agree."
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3155.717,3156.217,Where did -- where did -- I'm sorry.
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,3165.454,3173.993,"--I'm in the petition appendix at page 94a, where she says -- I'm sorry; at the bottom of 93a."
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3182.713,3184.298,"--Well, but you got to read down further."
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,3189.499,3205.294,"--But in the absence of an expression of deadlock from the entire jury, on these facts in this case, it was unreasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court to find that that satisfied the trial judge's obligation to exercise sound discretion."
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3226.457,3229.342,"Well, just -- with respect, it's not the very first sign of disagreement."
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,3241.317,3242.267,--Well--
2009.09-338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3242.267,3251.09,"Also you are ignoring the fact the first time the question was asked, do you believe it was hopelessly deadlocked and the foreperson said the majority of us don't believe that."
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3252.192,3253.542,"Oh, no, no."
2009.09-338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3254.542,3258.929,"--and there is a period, in the opinion of the supreme court after we don't believe that."
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3258.929,3262.131,There is not a period on page 7 of the Petitioner's brief.
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,3266.1,3267.201,--I thought there was a dash.
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3267.201,3268.017,--dash.
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,3282.961,3290.9,"Well, it may be correct to stop her right there, but there is other ways to figure out exactly what the foreperson was trying to explain."
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3298.304,3300.089,Isn't that exactly what she did?
2009.09-338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3311.646,3315.765,The foreperson did not immediately answer.
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,3324.388,3325.538,I think that's right.
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3326.073,3328.123,--How -- how do you know she answered for herself?
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,3332.994,3346.903,"--I -- I think that really at best, though -- given the circumstances of this case, at best that was an expression of the foreperson's opinion, that the jury would not likely be able -- but that is not a statement."
2009.09-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3346.903,3351.105,"Do you always have to poll the jury, is that what you are saying is a requirement?"
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,3351.105,3352.355,"No, it's not -- it's not--"
2009.09-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3352.355,3358.442,"I am not aware that you would always have to poll the jury, and I could see some real disadvantages to it as a matter of fact."
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,3369.567,3372.852,--It's certainly not a requirement and we were not saying that it is a requirement.
2009.09-338,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3387.177,3391.563,You don't think it's a fair inference from the note that the jury was stuck?
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,3408.09,3411.792,--I think all that is fair is that they were just trying to gather more information.
2009.09-338,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3414.744,3419.981,You don't think there's an -- you can draw an inference fairly that they were -- that there was substantial disagreement?
2009.09-338,1,36350,marla_r_mccowan,,3419.981,3424.85,"--No, I don't think that that necessarily means that there is substantial disagreement."
2009.09-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3426.385,3428.254,"Thank you, Ms. McCowan."
2009.09-338,2,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,3430.47,3435.49,Thank you.
2009.09-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3443.346,3444.863,"You mean Respondent, right?"
2009.09-338,2,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,3444.863,3445.846,--I'm sorry?
2009.09-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3445.846,3446.548,You are -- you are the Petitioner.
2009.09-338,2,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,3446.548,3456.421,"I'm sorry, it -- it -- I'm sorry, Mr. Lett -- Mr. Lett's burden to demonstrate that there is clearly established precedent that was objectively and unreasonably applied."
2009.09-338,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3481.186,3485.59,"And those are the ones -- so as I'm seeing this case, it isn't that complicated."
2009.09-338,2,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,3505.151,0.0,186.
2009.09-338,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3505.918,3508.687,186 years ago when it was something like
2009.09-338,2,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,3536.07,3536.703,Well--
2009.09-338,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3536.703,3546.759,"Mr. McGormley, you have stressed throughout that it's not -- not the question that Justice Breyer put, but there are two -- you have emphasized the two screens."
2009.09-338,2,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,3561.852,3564.32,"--Correct, Justice Ginsburg, this is not a very easy--"
2009.09-338,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3564.32,3572.143,"May I ask you, do you think the most relevant precedent from this Court -- would you agree that the most relevant precedent from this Court is Arizona v. Washington?"
2009.09-338,2,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,3572.143,3572.826,--I would not.
2009.09-338,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3573.376,3573.376,Why not?
2009.09-338,2,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,3573.376,3578.594,"--The reason why, Justice Stevens, is because Arizona was not even a deadlocked jury case."
2009.09-338,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3582.982,3585.684,What do you think the most relevant precedent from this Court is?
2009.09-338,2,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,3585.684,3586.467,Perez.
2009.09-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3586.467,3590.236,Do you have an answer to Justice Breyer's question?
2009.09-338,2,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,3595.854,3610.88,"My best answer, Justice Breyer, is that the best cases I have are -- are those -- are those two, because this -- this Court has never overruled a manifest necessity determination due to a deadlocked jury."
2009.09-338,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3610.88,3622.937,Are you suggesting that you need a precedent overruling a lower court decision before we could declare that something was unreasonable -- that our precedent was unreasonably applied?
2009.09-338,2,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,3622.937,3627.822,"No, my point is that -- is in the 186 years since Perez it's never happened."
2009.09-338,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3632.726,3644.184,"But that could also be consistent with the fact that Perez was clear enough that judges have to act slowly and -- and with thought, and that lower courts are catching those when they are not."
2009.09-338,2,31784,joel_d_mcgormley,,3647.303,3653.707,"--Well, I -- I think it is indicative of the fact that this has never happened -- this has never happened before."
2009.09-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3653.79,3654.957,"Thank you, counsel."
