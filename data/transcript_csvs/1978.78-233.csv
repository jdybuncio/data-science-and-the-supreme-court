1978.78-233,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,69.069,We will hear arguments next in Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts against Feeney.
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,72.722,75.466,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,176.202,178.757,Is this exclusively an equal protection case?
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,178.757,182.327,It is exclusively an equal protection case Mr. Justice Stewart.
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,188.349,192.493,"Right, and it’s not, no reliance is placed upon the due process clause."
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,192.493,196.571,"Well, it is an Equal Protection Clause case as it is been decided I think."
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,196.571,198.337,And it’s been argued and --
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,198.337,198.606,Yes.
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,198.606,199.387,Reported.
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,199.387,203.388,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,259.591,273.718,"That is, there is no claim that -- assumed there were an equal number of males and females or veterans and non-veterans, there’s no claim that the discrimination in favor of veterans and against non-veterans is itself."
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,273.718,274.368,Unconstitutional.
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,274.368,276.025,Or violating the Equal Protection Laws.
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,276.025,287.786,"And those who challenge the concept of veteran’s preference, or those who challenge this preference do not challenge it but because of the concept or because they believe this statute goes too far."
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,287.786,289.705,Well and discriminates against females.
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,289.705,304.575,"I think the argue -- the essence of the District Court’s opinion is that there is nothing unconstitutional about the statute even though fewer women benefit, but that this particular statute goes too far."
1978.78-233,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,304.575,312.426,"Do you refer to the District Court’s opinion, you really have to take Judge Campbell’s opinion, Judge Tauro’s opinion together, don’t you to --"
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,312.426,325.153,"I think, I frankly Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think I have to take both of their opinions in both of the cases because of the way this particular case is, happens to come before the Court."
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,477.83,479.522,That is the classified official service.
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,479.522,484.464,"Classified official service, I tend to mix up my adjectives."
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,484.464,489.832,But -- does Massachusetts have the same veteran’s preference with respect to each?
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,489.832,501.541,"Yes, we do -- in the labor service there’s not the same examination procedures that we go for in the labor section."
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,522.034,523.549,In that service?
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,523.549,526.027,In that service.
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,579.057,582.334,It’s now surviving spouses and widows are --
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,582.334,587.437,It is now surviving spouses or parents at the time of original --
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,587.437,591.398,Surviving widows or mothers --
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,591.398,596.123,"Widows or widowed parents, it was a sex specific term at that time."
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,596.123,597.232,But no longer is?
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,597.232,608.78,"No longer is, we have an equal rights amendment in Massachusetts, with its passage to many of the sex specific terms it typified a lot of legislations in the state."
1978.78-233,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,608.78,618.964,Does the Massachusetts statute have a disproportionate effect on over men than on younger men?
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,618.964,624.372,The Massachusetts statute applies to the Massachusetts veterans’ preference statute.
1978.78-233,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,630.608,642.068,"Well, people over 40 roughly at that cut off were less likely to be in the military in the World War II or somewhere in the World War I."
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,642.068,646.4,The statute does draw lines on the basis of the time of one’s service.
1978.78-233,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,660.489,662.985,I think I didn’t make my question very clear.
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,673.811,674.646,In the time of war.
1978.78-233,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,675.712,685.796,"Isn’t it also true that, let’s move it up to age 50; that men over age 50 generally were not in military servicing combat."
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,685.796,691.614,"I think 50 is too young, perhaps 60 is the right age."
1978.78-233,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,691.614,703.261,"I’m probably talking in terms of numbers, how many men, what percentage of the armed forces in World War II, were over 50 years of age unless they were Colonels or Generals."
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,703.261,719.927,"My reference, I think Mr. Chief Justice is to the age of individuals now and the preference as it operates now, the class of non-eligibles for the veterans preference includes approximately a million males."
1978.78-233,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1113.917,1129.682,"Mr. Kiley, in reading the Massachusetts statute at least as it’s described in the district court opinion section 23 as I see, it just refers to other veterans in order there are composite scores after disabled veterans."
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1136.072,1145.095,"Yes, the provision on defining what a veteran is, is chapter 4, section 7 of general laws."
1978.78-233,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1150.979,1152.867,And that’s set forth in the --
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1152.867,1164.268,"It is set forth in the briefs, the statute that cited -- it’s chapter 4, section 7 and I believe it’s clause 43."
1978.78-233,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1309.871,1317.279,"Well, I don’t read Judge Campbell’s opinion to find or make a finding of discriminatory intent."
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1320.548,1327.844,I would suggest that Judge Toro’s opinion makes a specific finding of intents.
1978.78-233,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1345.912,1371.879,"Well, let me read you from page 19 A of the jurisdictional statement, where he says about the middle of page to be sure the legislature did not wish to hire women, but the cutting off of women’s opportunity was an inevitable concomitant of the chosen scheme, as inevitable as the proposition that if tails is up heads must be down."
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1404.2,1419.754,"I think that if I might characterize Judge Campbell’s opinion he is saying that forcibility of the impact is the equivalent of finding an intent and if the results are inevitable; that, that in itself."
1978.78-233,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1438.122,1449.854,You wouldn’t suggest that a Court reviewing a statute of this couldn’t find as a fact from inevitable consequences that there was in fact discriminatory intent.
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1449.854,1464.972,"I think that one can use forcibility of impact under limited circumstances as a factor in the evidentiary search, in the search for clear and convincing evidence or for substantial evidence that intent exists."
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1586.122,1604.444,"But General Kiley you are not seriously contending are you that this Veterans' Preference doesn’t have an extremely discriminatory impact on women, 98% or some such percentage of all of Veterans' in Massachusetts are males, right."
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1604.444,1613.486,I am contending that the impact of this particular statute has been consistently overstated; I’ll do it on this basis.
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1635.127,1636.299,In this classification?
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1636.299,1641.981,"In this classification, (Inaudible) stripping male veterans (Inaudible) stripping male non-veterans."
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1641.981,1644.486,Why should that be with the Veteran’s preference?
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1644.486,1645.533,"Well, all I am saying Mr. Justice Stewart --"
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1645.533,1647.912,Well why is it with the veteran’s preference?
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1647.912,1654.541,My own personal view is that traditionally men and women do not always compete for the same jobs.
1978.78-233,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1686.2,1690.189,That’s ancient history now isn't it?
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1693.9,1695.112,"I do, I remember the case."
1978.78-233,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1695.112,1696.23,Remember that case?
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1696.23,1696.936,I do.
1978.78-233,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1696.936,1700.32,Well that’s kind of out of the ordinary wasn’t it?
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1700.32,1702.204,I don’t know if that was out of the ordinary.
1978.78-233,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1702.204,1705.035,"Well, in all civil rights, individual rights."
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1705.035,1706.556,"Certainly, certainly."
1978.78-233,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1706.556,1710.308,So that an ordinary right is just as important.
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1710.308,1723.736,"Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall, all I am suggesting is that in this record, in the timeframe that we have this evidence; women obtained significantly more jobs than men."
1978.78-233,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1723.736,1728.561,And I think I remember is certain job.
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1728.561,1729.629,The figures that we have --
1978.78-233,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1729.629,1731.781,And that’s typical isn’t it?
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1731.781,1732.715,The figures that we have--
1978.78-233,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1732.715,1734.789,It hasn’t gone yet has it?
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1734.789,1740.329,The figures which we have Mr. Justice Marshall are for the entire official classified service.
1978.78-233,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1800.033,1810.633,That also be a truism that a lot of women don’t even bother taking the test because they are not veterans and they know they can’t overcome the great big handicap.
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1810.633,1824.41,"It maybe, it maybe it’s somewhat speculative the only indication in this record that that’s the case is that Helen Feeney in her affidavit says in someone instances she herself was not -- did not take examinations."
1978.78-233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1842.942,1849.875,Do you take the position that the legislature must have specifically intended to harm women before --
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1849.875,1863.833,"I think that there has to be a motivating factor which if it’s not characterized as an intent to harm women is an intent to perpetuate, archaic and over broad stereotypical notions about the older women."
1978.78-233,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1869.568,1882.871,Is there any big medical trunk like one for Team B that you had brought up to legislature and have them all to go through it and find out what was on their minds.
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1882.871,1883.632,No.
1978.78-233,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1883.632,1886.528,Well what other way could we do it.
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1886.528,1887.574,No I’m not saying--
1978.78-233,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1887.574,1889.429,In what other way could we do it?
1978.78-233,0,42921,thomas_r_kiley,,1889.429,1900.795,I think that the court has articulated the way in which the lower court looks for motivation and you look to every scintilla of subjective or objective evidence that one can find.
1978.78-233,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1992.257,1993.777,Thank you Mr. Kiley.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2007.128,2009.909,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.
1978.78-233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2226.113,2227.72,Must they get the job?
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2227.72,2231.052,"Yes, Your Honor it is been stipulated by the Commonwealth in a agreed statement --"
1978.78-233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2231.052,2233.708,Must number one person get the job?
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2233.708,2236.538,"Not necessarily, three names are certified --"
1978.78-233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2236.538,2241.473,"What if the number three is a non veteran, may he be picked?"
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2241.473,2243.068,"Yes, Your Honor if he is certified."
1978.78-233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2283.398,2286.194,"What page on exhibit 7, do you happen to know?"
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2286.194,2289.245,"Not on the top of my head, Your Honor I believe --"
1978.78-233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2289.245,2290.163,No go ahead.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2290.163,2291.764,It can be found.
1978.78-233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2291.764,2293.453,"I see it, page 132 I guess."
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2293.453,2295.927,Yes Your Honor.
1978.78-233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2321.167,2330.834,Do you think the average of veteran non-disabled has the same argument to make as you are making now with respect to disabled veterans?
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2330.834,2334.813,"No Your Honor, I don’t believe so."
1978.78-233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2413.116,2427.501,Is it also discriminatory to bar women in combat and then they combat service basis of the preference?
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2427.501,2430.561,"I believe it would be Your Honor in the following sense, if --"
1978.78-233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2430.561,2435.031,Are women permitted in combat service now under the existing law?
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2435.031,2475.062,"Generally not Your Honor, but the discrimination of course was far more severe than that resulting in really the systematic exclusion of women from the military and the decision that’s at stake is the judgment of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, how will it run, it’s in public employment system and what it’s done, whether there is justification for that discrimination against the military has taken all those restrictions by making the veteran classification as the court found below, a replacement for testing as to determining factor as to who appears on the top of the list."
1978.78-233,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2489.443,2502.47,"Mr. Ward, is there anyway under your argument where Massachusetts could retain the preference for disabled veterans and nonetheless give it up for non-disabled veterans?"
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2502.47,2522.883,"Your Honor in terms of the record presented to the court below, for example, Exhibit 12, one would see that the number of disabled veterans that apply are relatively minor in number as to the number of disabled veterans who apply and are eligible is relatively minor in comparison with the total number of veterans."
1978.78-233,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2560.751,2566.861,"I was asking under your argument whether disabled veteran preference could survive, is your answer yes or no?"
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2566.861,2576.77,"The answer is, disabled veteran would still constitute to the extent it produced a disproportion an impact on women because of the incorporation of the military’s discrimination."
1978.78-233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2611.798,2649.844,"Under Washington against Davis does the, intentional or deliberate or knowing discrimination against a particular group, in this case women have to be a discrimination against that group as women, an intention to discriminate against women or what if it simply as it appears on the face of this statute, an intention to discriminate against non-veterans with knowledge that many more women are non-veterans than men."
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2649.844,2665.138,"I believe Your Honor that under Washington versus Davis, in order to invoke this court to somewhat heightened level of scrutiny we have to show that the discrimination is a deliberate one against women and we believe the record adequately substantiates that fact."
1978.78-233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2665.138,2670.022,So that discrimination against non-veterans which is clearly is on its face.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2670.022,2672.279,Yes it is.
1978.78-233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2672.279,2683.337,With the knowledge that -- there are many more non-veterans who are women than there are men who are non-veteran is not enough.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2683.337,2689.19,"Well with the knowledge of the -- that may well be enough Your Honor, because --"
1978.78-233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2689.19,2690.385,I’m asking about your --
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2690.385,2692.072,I believe that is enough given the history --
1978.78-233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2692.072,2693.388,Washington against Davis requires --
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2693.388,2709.469,"Yes, given the history of discrimination by the military against the entry level of -- entry of women into the military and given the Commonwealth’s wholesale transfer of those entry level requirements by making the veteran classification, the condition perceiving to being able to obtain --"
1978.78-233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2709.469,2710.981,Well that adds up just to knowledge.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2710.981,2716.785,It adds up we believe to knowledge that there will be to severe disproportionate impact on women.
1978.78-233,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2720.573,2725.537,Well that’s just foreseeable consequences.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2725.537,2733.441,"Yes Your Honor and we believe that it’s not just foreseeable as the court below indicated it’s somewhat more than foreseeable, it’s inevitable given the chosen scheme."
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2733.441,2759.54,"Well, in any protection case then if you get in the court and you make a record and show that this supposedly and facially neutral statute has disproportionate impact, you are then telling a legislature that it has an impact and as the legislature at least didn’t effect, it’s automatically foreseeable impact and you would always get your injunction."
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2759.54,2767.327,"Well, we -- Yes, Mr. Justice White and that’s the problem with just relying solely on the foreseeable consequences test."
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2767.327,2768.589,What else do you rely on?
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2768.589,2771.222,We rely on two other principal factors.
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2781.39,2795.43,"But in my example the judge say to the Attorney General of the State, now we’ve made these findings and if you want me to say this is inevitable, it is because that’s is what the fact show, you will always get your injunction."
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2795.43,2802.546,"Okay, that maybe in terms of looking after the fact, at the facts and looking back, but in additional --"
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2802.546,2804.196,"We’re looking forward, he says --"
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2804.196,2804.534,Well looking for --
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2804.534,2807.114,I'm looking for damages I want to get an injunction.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2807.114,2810.059,"Well, that’s true too Your Honor."
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2815.134,2820.671,"So it will always will be for foreseeable consequences, will always be enough then as you."
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2820.671,2823.825,Well not necessarily every foreseeable consequence.
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2829.419,2835.167,"Mr. Ward, right on this point, 98% of the veterans are male I guess --"
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2835.167,2835.645,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2835.645,2836.898,2% are women.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2850.508,2850.859,That is correct.
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2850.859,2853.784,Your reasoning would apply equally to those I think.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2853.784,2854.95,We don’t think so Your Honor –
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2854.95,2856.172,Why not?
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2856.172,2859.749,In that merely the absence of a benefit not --
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2859.749,2862.681,"In discrimination, you’re drawing distinction between burdens and benefit."
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2862.681,2863.766,Yes Your Honor and we think here --
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2863.766,2873.208,"It’s constitutional to discriminate by giving one class benefits and whereas it’s, that’s okay but it’s bad if you burden a clause, is that true?"
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2873.208,2876.467,"Under some circumstances, we believe that is the law Your Honor."
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2877.315,2880.386,Any case that has suggested that?
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2880.386,2933.757,"Well the distinction in terms of the pregnancy case brought by the court in terms of Nashville Gas versus Satty -- statutory but the court did suggest that you’re dealings are different type of problem and you in fact burden a group and here we have a group that is historically been burdened in the employment contract, in the employment context, we have women, women constitute two-thirds of the nonveterans’ and virtually all the women are in the nonveteran category and Massachusetts sets up a preference so absolute that systematically they are excluded from every job of interest for males and to get back to Mr. Justice’s White’s question we do have additional evidence, if foreseeability and inevitability is not enough to satisfy this court’s view of when is enough proof shown that we will hold the state responsible because of the deliberate and purposeful discrimination."
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2975.738,2985.372,"If you pursue that argument, it seems to me you have an even stronger case against the Federal statute to discriminate because there is a history in the military of discriminating between men and women."
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,2990.276,3005.551,"We think not Your Honor, again one might find that all the veteran’s preferences constitute some deliberate discrimination against women but they might be tailored finely enough to their purposes that they would pass the appropriate level of scrutiny."
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3005.551,3009.413,"Well, yeah, this makes a pretty persuasive argument that they weren’t very finely tailored."
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3009.413,3010.763,"Not in this case Your Honor, this is--"
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3010.763,3012.487,No I am talking about the federal ones.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3018.438,3019.993,"Well, with respect to the--"
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3019.993,3020.725,Male and female.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3020.725,3034.69,"Oh, certainly in terms of the military restrictions are not very well tailored and that leads to the fact that this statue should essentially be treated as an explicit distinction between males and females in terms of its effect of excluding women from public service jobs."
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3034.69,3048.808,"You made two points that saying that why forcibility is one, you say difference between inevitability and forcibility and secondly you say if the governing body has a history of treating males and females differently, you look especially closely at it."
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3055.347,3058.472,They would then not necessarily condemn them Your Honor.
1978.78-233,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3096.428,3101.967,"Be careful with the 19th century, they weren’t looking for stenographic jobs either."
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3101.967,3102.135,Well--
1978.78-233,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3102.135,3106.167,"Do you remember, only men could run those machines."
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3106.167,3106.907,That’s right Your Honor.
1978.78-233,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3106.907,3108.078,Women couldn’t run them.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3108.078,3128.479,"Expect there is evidence in the record that shows that right about the time in the early, the end of the 19th century and the beginning of this century the Commonwealth was at least starting to realize that perhaps some women could run those stenographic machines and that’s why they carved out and didn’t apply the preference and they tried to so call protect women’s jobs."
1978.78-233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3143.78,3166.865,"Well If history alone is enough to condemn any law that has any sort of a discriminatory impact against women and if history alone is enough to show intent, well then any law passed by any state would be constitutionally invalid because up until fairly, well along in this century no state allowed women to vote."
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3166.865,3175.721,That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart and that’s why we don’t say that the fact that this statue was passed in the 19th century is in and off itself enough to condemn it.
1978.78-233,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3215.017,3219.279,Now you say it runs with the explicit distinction.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3233.6,3260.014,"Okay, Your Honor obviously the ultimate purpose was to drive some aid or help in some way to veterans, that was the ultimate purpose, okay, but this Court has recognized there are various factors that determined the decision and constitute motivating factors and if you express it in terms of a desire to get women or to hire women we all shrink back, that’s not discrimination."
1978.78-233,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3274.198,3278.105,"I was talking about the Veterans Preference Act, was that passed in 19th century?"
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3278.105,3293.527,"It was passed in first one in 1884, and the one that parallels the one we have now was passed in 1896 and when they passed it Mr. Justice Rehnquist what they did was they basically said this preference will not apply to jobs especially calling for women."
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3323.859,3326.802,Of course that isn’t the approach the District Court is it?
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3326.802,3330.632,District Court relied basically Mr. Justice White on the objective evidence.
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3330.632,3333.292,"Well I know, but the answer is no, it was not the approach."
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3333.292,3341.991,"Well, they’ve certainly, we’re aware of it, it was argued and in a footnote in the last decision they show that at least suggested--"
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3341.991,3344.223,That isn’t the way they arrived at their intent.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3344.223,3346.058,"No, it is not Your Honor."
1978.78-233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3346.058,3355.078,Mr. Ward would it be foreseeable that this Act would exclude a great many handicapped disabled people?
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3355.078,3361.802,"Yes it would Your Honor, because they again through no fault of their own were not allowed into the military and it would --"
1978.78-233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3361.802,3372.868,And also as I suggested to your colleague it would certainly exclude foreseeably most of the people over age 45 or 50.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3372.868,3383.987,"Again looking at the fact that’s mostly young persons that go in, in one sense it would in terms of the persons who obtain a preference in terms of what age they were when it was most likely that they would go into the service."
1978.78-233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3383.987,3392.806,"So the consequence of this in terms of the impact is not limited to women, it hits great many categories of people does it not?"
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3392.806,3402.479,"That is correct Mr. Chief Justice, but women are the more severely affected because virtually all women are nonveterans, nonveteran the inferior classification--"
1978.78-233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3402.479,3406.731,"Are all disabled, handicap people, all not most."
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3406.731,3412.408,"Well, that’s true but two-thirds of the nonveterans Your Honor are women and virtually all women are nonveterans."
1978.78-233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3412.408,3421.649,Does it make any difference whether the category or group against whom discrimination is asserted is a small group or a large group?
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3421.649,3428.683,"No Your Honor, but the group is asserting, Mrs. Feeney happens to be member of a class of women and that’s the one that’s before the Court."
1978.78-233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3662.446,3665.836,What was that definition of veteran administrators?
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3665.836,3678.795,"It is a very broad Your Honor, it includes anyone that served during the period between 1940 and 1975 for most of that period simply a minimum of 90 days and during about nine of those years a period of about 180 days."
1978.78-233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3682.075,3685.255,Including periods when weren’t even -- when there were no --
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3685.255,3685.747,That’s is right Your Honor --
1978.78-233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3685.747,3686.798,Military activity.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3686.798,3693.226,"It sweeps broadly, again it’s an extreme form of preference not well tailored to any of the profit goals."
1978.78-233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3725.567,3733.811,"So you are not, as I understand it at least attacking the veteran’s preference as such."
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3740.455,3741.829,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.78-233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3741.829,3742.069,Isn’t that right?
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3742.069,3744.549,And the effect on women is invidious here.
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3760.344,3762.758,The excluded class is not just women.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3763.367,3763.962,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3763.962,3766.9,It’s uniquely invidious on the non-veteran male.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3766.9,3770.237,Not equally given the history of discrimination against women particularly on --
1978.78-233,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3770.237,3774.351,Well the economic impact is the same on the non-veteran male.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3774.351,3776.337,It works the same on other non-veterans.
1978.78-233,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3776.337,3778.784,Which you are not claiming any such claim in this case.
1978.78-233,1,40749,richard_p_ward,,3778.784,3794.243,"I am making the claim for Helen Feeney and her class of females, who as this Court has recognized has suffered a long history of discrimination and that the job market has been particularly inhospitable to women seeking any but the lowest jobs."
1978.78-233,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3841.455,3842.177,Thank you gentlemen.
