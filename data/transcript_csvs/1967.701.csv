1967.701,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,34.981,"No. 701, In The Matter of Buddy Lynn Whittington, Petitioner."
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,37.019,41.993,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.701,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,389.336,392.047,What's the status of this?
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,393.96,399.92,"Yes sir, he's been in jail for 20 months."
1967.701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,405.756,407.524,Has the grand jury taken any action?
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,407.524,407.869,"Yes, sir."
1967.701,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,458.206,466.055,(Inaudible)
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,466.055,466.622,"Yes, sir."
1967.701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,496.391,501.898,Is he bound over as an adult? Is he imprisoned as an adult?
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,501.898,509.724,He was bound over and he is still in jail.
1967.701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,509.89,511.224,"Well, is that assessment --"
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,511.224,512.424,Same jail.
1967.701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,512.424,512.825,"Well, I know."
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,518.7,522.773,"No sir, it was the same jail that he was returned to."
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,557.18,562.777,How long did you say that this 14-year-old boy has been incarcerated?
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,562.777,565.406,"From August 5th until now, sir."
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,565.406,565.607,Oh --
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,565.607,568.583,"In 1966, that's about 20 months."
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,568.583,569.975,About 20 months.
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,579.387,582.574,The original order was his arrest in the Juvenile Court.
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,582.574,583.51,"I understand that, but --"
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,583.51,603.856,"And subsequent to that sir, after the finding of the delinquency and the binding over, then it would be -- he was then rearrested and this would be under the order of the Common Pleas Court of Fairfield County, Ohio from which we have appealed the binding over --"
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,603.856,610.069,"Now, let's try to get this thing straightened out and for my benefit, if you will."
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,610.069,610.442,"Yes, sir."
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,610.442,615.629,"The Juvenile Court found that he was -- concluded that he was delinquent, right?"
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,615.629,616.423,"Yes, sir."
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,616.423,620.57,"The Juvenile Court did not ever pass sentence, did it?"
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,621.543,622.065,"Yes, sir."
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,622.249,625.384,They can order with respect to his disposition --
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,625.384,627.219,"Yes sir, they did."
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,628.054,629.93,What was that order?
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,629.93,634.781,"Well, there were only two things the Court could have done."
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,654.249,662.605,"Before that time, before the grand jury proceeding, what did the Juvenile Court -- what was the --"
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,662.605,663.416,Disposition?
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,663.416,665.235,-- disposition?
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,665.235,669.56,He did not retain the jurisdiction but then he bound him over to the grand jury.
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,670.018,670.981,When was that?
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,673.776,691.095,"This does not appear in the record because we appealed from the determination of delinquency, from the judgment of delinquency for the sole act of having committed this murder, we appealed --"
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,691.095,700.581,"But I thought the Court ordered him to report to some diagnostic facility and it was while that order was in effect that you appealed, is that right?"
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,700.581,705.842,We appealed immediately from the finding or from the judgment of the delinquency.
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,716.221,727.961,What I want to know is for how long was he in that State and subject to that order before the grand jury indictments?
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,734.248,734.874,The binding over?
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,734.874,737.984,"-- to the grand jury indictments, yes."
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,738.283,744.872,"Over a year, sir, until the Supreme Court -- until -- they did not take him for custody --"
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,744.872,746.544,-- over a year.
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,761.266,762.063,"Yes, sir."
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,771.223,778.754,And under what order of the Juvenile Court was he held after he was returned by the diagnostic center.
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,789.944,790.741,"Yes, sir."
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,790.741,795.802,"And then, the Juvenile Court ordered that he go to the diagnostic center, is that right?"
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,795.802,796.231,"Yes, sir."
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,796.231,798.474,Then the diagnostic center returned.
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,798.474,799.715,"Yes, sir."
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,799.715,803.542,And the Court continued to hold on to the boy.
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,809.209,811.102,The Court had ordered to --
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,811.102,812.39,-- juvenile procedure?
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,825.145,841.068,"The Juvenile Court in this case as the record will show upon his being arrested, they retained jurisdiction and they kept him incarcerated, although we filed many, many motions asking for his release."
1967.701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,841.563,862.776,Where do we find the only order under which this boy was held in jail between the time that he got back from the mental observation period and the time he was indicted?
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,868.35,871.856,We asked for a transcript of the entire proceedings --
1967.701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,871.856,881.591,"Well, is it in there or resonant in there?"
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,881.591,890.365,At page 54 and there's no subsequent order which was filed on September 7th.
1967.701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,902.359,914.449,"And the state takes the position that in these circumstances, in these procedural circumstances, the boy was not entitled to bail, am I correct in that understanding?"
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,914.449,915.012,"Yes, sir."
1967.701,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,942.867,943.887,I misunderstood you there.
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,948.645,958.749,"After he had been incarcerated for about 15 months without bond or bail when it was in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court, all during that time --"
1967.701,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,958.749,962.716,"First degree murder is not bailable, is it?"
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,962.716,972.976,"Not as of right, no sir, but about the first 14 or 15 months, we were trying to get him out and we had a hearing, there were 10 witnesses."
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,994.709,998.516,"When do you say this was second degree, this would have been second degree murder?"
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,998.516,1011.533,The statute specifically says in violation â€“ as if he had -- that he is alleged to have been delinquent in that he committed the defensive murder which is in violation of the second degree murder statute.
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1015.656,1018.564,That's because he was a juvenile?
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,1018.564,1022.248,"Well, they just -- if he had been an adult, he would have been under a second degree murder but as a juvenile --"
1967.701,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1022.248,1023.659,Why?
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,1030.53,1038.252,Because it was not premeditated and I think that's our distinction in Ohio between premeditated -- between first and second.
1967.701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1038.252,1038.848,How do you know it?
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,1041.547,1043.962,We denied it and the defendant has denied it completely.
1967.701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1047.865,1050.458,Will that prove second degree?
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,1050.458,1053.484,"In order to determine -- no, sir."
1967.701,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1064.954,1068.74,May I ask you what you have brought up -- you brought up the question of bail.
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,1070.0,1078.523,We have about seven points in the right to pre-hearing release is definitely one of the issues in this case because he was denied this.
1967.701,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1078.523,1080.563,And you brought that up?
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,1080.563,1081.92,"Yes, sir."
1967.701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1085.217,1092.03,I don't see anything in this order that mentions murder.
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,1113.526,1115.134,This is the general inquiry.
1967.701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1124.617,1129.689,The real matter of fact in (voice overlap)
1967.701,0,32946,jack_supman,,1129.689,1148.079,"Excuse me sir, with the finding of the Court that appears in the record that the Court in effect stated that at the conclusion of the evidence, we move to dismiss this case because there was no evidence."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1232.24,1241.537,Thank you.
1967.701,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1241.537,1242.418,Mr. Rezneck.
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1242.418,1245.566,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.701,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1276.748,1282.942,I wish you would address yourself to the procedural posture of this case.
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1296.006,1297.288,"I understand that is correct, sir."
1967.701,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1297.288,1303.048,The boy has been bound over to the adult Court.
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1306.54,1306.924,Yes.
1967.701,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1306.924,1311.216,"-- by the grand jury, is awaiting trial in the adult Court."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1327.087,1337.868,"Well, we think that you do have a final judgment here under the test that this Court has laid down for finality that the juvenile proceeding and the adult criminal preceding are separate proceedings under the law of Ohio."
1967.701,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1346.94,1352.546,"Now, what was the judgment of those, just an adjudication of the boy as delinquent?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1357.079,1359.387,"There was not a final order of disposition, Your Honor."
1967.701,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1365.43,1366.843,For diagnostic --
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1366.843,1368.006,For examination.
1967.701,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1368.006,1369.971,"-- work, and that's over, isn't it?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1369.971,1371.974,He was returned following that.
1967.701,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1385.0,1393.884,"Now, suppose we agree with you entirely and I agree with you on everything you've asked us to do here."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1397.189,1405.223,"The judgment of the Juvenile Court is reversed here, Your Honor we believe that the indictment falls with it and that a motion to quash the indictment --"
1967.701,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1405.223,1406.125,How does that happen?
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1412.514,1413.428,Under the Ohio --
1967.701,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1413.428,1414.79,-- indictment?
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1414.79,1421.558,"Under the Ohio statute, there is no criminal jurisdiction until there has been a valid certification of the boy by the Juvenile Court."
1967.701,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1438.698,1440.981,Have you briefed that?
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1440.981,1450.328,We have directed ourselves in the reply brief to the issue both of finality and to whether the possibility of certification should have any effect on the finality of the judgment.
1967.701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1464.117,1467.104,"The problem is the worrying I think of the Ohio statute, isn't it?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1509.351,1510.683,"Well, I don't know what the --"
1967.701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1510.683,1516.39,"That is ambiguous and there's a bill now, I think as I understand it in the Ohio legislature --"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1516.39,1519.077,"Well, we don't admit that the statute is ambiguous, Your Honor --"
1967.701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1519.077,1528.231,"Well, some of the Juvenile Courts in Ohio, I must say changed their practice, to not feel obligated to make a formal finding of delinquency before they bind them over for adult."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1528.231,1530.296,"The National Council so states, Your Honor."
1967.701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1567.581,1570.819,"Now, he hasn't been tried on the crime of murder yet."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1576.544,1579.596,"As an adult, he has not been found to be guilty of the crime of murder."
1967.701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1583.255,1584.884,And has been bound over to grand jury.
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1584.884,1588.13,-- to be a delinquent by reason of having committed the act of murder.
1967.701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1621.773,1634.576,"Do I understand you that with the indictment of the grand jury, if we reverse this case, the Juvenile Court takes over jurisdiction?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1634.576,1637.325,"Well, they've lost jurisdiction by transferring the case --"
1967.701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1637.325,1639.448,They had lost jurisdiction?
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1639.448,1645.918,"Whether they would be able to reassert jurisdiction by a new proceeding is another matter, but we do assert that we can get the indictment and --"
1967.701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1645.918,1657.14,All we have before us is the holding of the juvenile judge sending him to the school or wherever it was to be examined.
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1657.14,1663.052,"I would say you have two things; you have a judgment of delinquency, and you have what is called a temporary order of commitment."
1967.701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1663.052,1664.446,That's all we have.
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1664.446,1666.393,Those are the results of the Juvenile Court judgment.
1967.701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1666.393,1668.671,And that's all we can deal with.
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1668.671,1670.549,"In this particular case, that is right."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1693.305,1710.963,"Well, as I understand it though, Mr. Rezneck, it's not that clear that if you prevailed here and this Juvenile Court judgment were reversed that it follows that the indictment would be dismissed in State proceedings, does it?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1710.963,1719.02,We believe that under a fair reading of the State statute since a valid finding of delinquency is a prerequisite to transfer that the adult Courts would not --
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1719.02,1721.694,But that still remains to be tested out.
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1721.694,1722.828,"Yes it does, Your Honor."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1749.889,1756.956,"I suppose this came about and you could not get it dismissed, would you have any basis to come here?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1756.956,1763.228,"Well, since these questions have been raised and decided by the state Courts, we submit that they are properly here now and of course --"
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1763.228,1773.243,"But my question is, if you try to get the indictment dismissed and failed in the state proceeding, can you conceive of any basis on which you could come here then?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1773.243,1776.159,"Yes, on a double jeopardy basis perhaps, Your Honor."
1967.701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1795.169,1802.357,The best I can gather from your petition for certiorari is that this may leave me in some doubt.
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1811.619,1813.575,And the procedures by which that finding was arrived --
1967.701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1813.575,1814.53,That's right.
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1820.102,1822.123,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1967.701,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1822.123,1831.434,"Mr. Rezneck, when was the transfer from juvenile to adult Court made in connection with the proceedings before this Court?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1837.948,1839.083,"I believe that it was, Your Honor."
1967.701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1917.581,1922.971,Do you think you have a right to have a delinquency judgment review in this Court?
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1922.971,1924.598,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1953.536,1966.119,"In this case, as you tell us, as you read the Ohio statute in this case, the finding of delinquency was a necessary condition precedent to binding them over to the grand jury for trial on a charge of first degree murder."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1971.43,1972.328,"Yes, sir."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1972.328,1974.618,Is that order exactly over here?
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1974.618,1976.304,"No, it is not."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1976.304,1980.854,"Well, why is it that (Inaudible)"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1980.854,1983.816,I believe it's contained in the State's opposition to certiorari.
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1988.964,1992.618,Was there an order entered by the District Court?
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1992.618,1996.744,I assume that there was but it's not part of the record and it is not in the record before this Court.
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2005.712,2015.479,"How long was involved between the finding of delinquency and the order of transfer, about 15 months?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2015.479,2019.638,I believe that the -- would you indulge me for just -- just one --
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2019.638,2021.508,"Well, just approximately."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.954,2026.231,"I'm not sure that it was quite that long, Your Honor. I think it was on the order of approximately a year before the indictment --"
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2026.231,2027.519,"About a year, Alright."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2037.044,2039.983,Only until the Ohio Supreme Court acted.
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2052.042,2072.902,"Well, the question really in my mind, one of the many procedural questions here to my mind is whether the Juvenile Court intended initially that this finding of delinquency to be the prelude to a transfer to the adult Court."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2076.94,2083.21,"Well, the record is certainly ambiguous about that and due to the fact that the Juvenile Court in effect made conflicting statements on the point."
1967.701,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2117.552,2118.457,"Well, maybe."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2128.863,2135.308,"Well, we think that the adult criminal cases that are dealt with sentencing are distinguishable for several reasons."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2166.596,2175.158,"Mr. Rezneck, why is it the final order -- why do you say their final order is the delinquency finding?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2204.161,2207.876,"No, I think certainly not and I think the question is precisely the same."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2207.876,2210.297,"Of course, this doesn't have to be on the record, that --"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2210.297,2211.341,That is true.
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.174,2248.904,Let's assume that the standard in Ohio for binding over from the Juvenile Court to the Adult Court was -- it's certain that he's alleged to have committed a certain kind of crime and there's probable cause to believe that he committed it.
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2256.083,2258.113,At that particular moment in time --
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2258.113,2262.087,At that particular moment -- it says delinquent.
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2275.463,2284.576,"If this were in fact a preliminary hearing and if the Ohio statutes provided for a proceeding in the nature of a preliminary hearing, which they do not, then I think we would have a different constitutional question."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.576,2285.553,What would that be?
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2285.553,2289.514,That would be whether there was fair notice of the nature of the proceeding in view of the fact that the --
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.514,2291.279,But you wouldn't have all these other questions?
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2292.835,2293.94,If it were not in delinquency --
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2293.94,2295.418,It would hardly be relevant at that time?
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2295.418,2299.202,"That is, if it were a delinquency trial, If it were not a delinquency trial on the merits --"
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.202,2303.712,But it was just a proceeding to determine where they should be bound over.
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2303.712,2306.484,"If the state law provided for such a proceeding, yes, that is correct, Your Honor."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.484,2317.01,"Yes, but the state law does provide for -- you yourself conceded that it provides for some preliminary consideration before being -- before binding over."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2317.01,2318.708,"Well, we think it provides to a more --"
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2318.708,2323.287,Do you think it goes on and says that there must be a full scale delinquency trial?
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2323.287,2325.361,"Well, we think that that's a necessary reading of the statute."
1967.701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2325.361,2328.939,"Well, I know you think it is, but what if you're wrong?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2328.939,2344.01,"Well, if we're wrong on that, we haven't been told so by the state Courts because we think that the state Court in this case reviewed this as a delinquency judgment and I've held up that he was charged with delinquency and he was adjudicated to be a delinquent, and we would take that to be conclusive of what the nature --"
1967.701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2344.01,2345.994,What if you're wrong?
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2345.994,2351.929,"Well, I think that the only persons who could tell us that would be the state Courts and --"
1967.701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2351.929,2353.459,What if they told you that you were wrong?
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2353.459,2357.64,Then we would have a different constitutional issue raised than the ones that we are raising here.
1967.701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2357.64,2359.863,"Yeah, that's what I thought."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2359.863,2370.05,"Mr. Rezneck, incidentally, if really what's before us is this turnover of judgment, if that's really the -- and we would agree with you on any of our arguments."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2380.777,2381.134,"Well, if --"
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.134,2387.397,Do you still have to go to the Ohio Courts then to have the indictment dismissed?
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2387.397,2394.816,"Well, I think as a matter of form, we would have to make a motion to dismiss the indictment and profit the judgment of this Court, to give the Courts below a basis for doing that."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.756,2414.341,Do you still would be open to the Ohio Courts to say notwithstanding the judgment turning him over to the adult Courts has been reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States.
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2419.714,2421.638,"Yes, Your Honor, I think it is still open to the --"
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2421.638,2438.555,But you said also that even if reversing the order turning over necessarily involves our crossing the bridge of deciding what the Ohio statutes really mean in terms of what's necessary for a turnover.
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2438.555,2439.155,"Yes, we --"
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2439.155,2447.054,"Because if we give it a -- if we read it differently than the way you read it, then the order might be valid."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2447.054,2449.203,"Well, I want to say Your Honor it isn't just my reading of it."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2464.906,2486.479,"-- I know, but if all that had to happen -- if the order in the review is the turnover order and if all that had to happen under the Ohio statutes was X but they happen to do X plus Y, and did X plus Y wrongly but did X correctly, I'm not so sure we should reverse the order."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2486.479,2490.503,"Well, I think we should still have notice that they were proposing to do X."
1967.701,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2498.521,2505.297,Is there some certification procedure in the Ohio statutes from this Court to the Ohio Courts?
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2505.297,2512.452,"To get a ruling on -- from the state Court on the matter of state law, I'm not aware that there is a statute of Ohio that enables you to do that."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2631.35,2636.017,"Well, actually, that's kind of a modest statement, isn't it?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2647.642,2648.591,"Yes, sir."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2648.591,2670.691,"And if you regard this as a preliminary hearing prior to grand jury proceedings, for some reason there may have been the fault of the various stays that were obtained that this boy was incarcerated for 15 months before the matter was in and submitted on the grand jury, maybe 12 months, whatever it was, is that right?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2670.691,2671.425,Yes.
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2674.876,2679.359,"And the finding here was the finding of probable cause, is that right?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2679.359,2682.172,"Well, I would hesitate to call that a finding, Your Honor."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2696.226,2705.355,"The judging of delinquency based upon a recital that there's probable cause to believe that the boy was delinquent, is that correctly recalled?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2705.355,2706.527,That's not in the journal entry.
1967.701,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2788.879,2798.512,"Mr. Rezneck, is there anything that this boy -- any benefit that this boy got as a result of his classification as juvenile?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2801.249,2805.176,"If it certainly does not appear on this record and I don't know of any, Your Honor."
1967.701,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2809.612,2815.004,"So he was sent to a place for a diagnosis, mental examination."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2822.249,2832.594,"Well, I assume there's a pre-sentence investigation in cases and that you could receive the same kind of examination by the appropriate officers concerned with sentencing."
1967.701,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2832.594,2854.906,"So that so far as you know, this boy by reason of being a juvenile, 14 years old, received not more but less protection and less consideration in the State of Ohio than it would have if he were an adult, is that right?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2854.906,2863.644,"Yes, and we think that's absolutely clear on the record, that no adult defendant would have been treated in the fashion that this boy was."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2864.129,2869.098,(Inaudible)
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2869.098,2876.751,"Well, he was exposed here to a potentiality as a juvenile of incarceration for up to seven years."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2895.639,2899.735,(Inaudible)
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2899.735,2903.975,"As I read the statute, it's ten years before you're eligible for --"
1967.701,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2903.975,2906.598,And no probation?
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2906.598,2914.225,"No, I don't believe the statutes forbid -- I'm not sure on that point, Your Honor but they provide for life sentence and then say there shall be eligibility for parole --"
1967.701,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2914.225,2922.96,"But Mr. Rezneck, if there had not been a turnover here, the maximum penalty would have been the seven years, would it not?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2922.96,2925.639,"The maximum penalty that the Juvenile Court could impose on him, that's --"
1967.701,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2925.639,2927.041,"Well, I know."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2933.681,2934.164,No.
1967.701,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2934.164,2934.926,That's right.
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2937.23,2937.977,Yes.
1967.701,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2937.977,2945.421,"Whereas if this indictment is still good and it's a first degree murder charge, if he's convicted, what's the penalty?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2945.421,2950.027,"Death, Your Honor."
1967.701,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2950.027,2959.687,"And the Juvenile Court, when it commits -- say it decided the constitutional right of this young man, because he's delinquent, what would the order be?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2959.687,2962.627,The order could be a permanent commitment to the youth commission --
1967.701,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2962.627,2966.116,"I mean, without any flexibility in the youth commission at all."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,2968.12,2975.248,They can come back to the Juvenile Court if they think he's rehabilitated for example and asked that he be released.
1967.701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3050.122,3060.415,"Well the limit is, Mr. Rezneck of the situation where the charge of delinquency depended upon evidence of conduct which committed by an adult would be a felony?"
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,3060.415,3071.676,"Well, that is all there is before the Court in this case. Certainly, we would differentiate proceedings such as neglected dependency which don't involve any misconduct by the child with respect to the standard of proof."
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3087.584,3100.898,But wouldn't you extend it certainly to any charge of committing conduct which would expose him to loss of liberty.
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,3100.898,3104.172,The implications of Gault is that it would apply --
1967.701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3104.172,3106.446,"I won't argue that, yeah."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,3106.446,3109.858,"If I were in this case, I would, but it's not in this case now."
1967.701,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3109.858,3122.487,"That Gault was specifically limited, wasn't he, Mr. Rezneck, the situations where the charge was something that in the case of an adult would amount to the violation of law."
1967.701,1,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,3122.487,3131.422,The particular basis for the delinquency adjudication there was an act which would be criminal and it is argued that we're dealing with a law violation case in that sense.
1967.701,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3160.158,3164.503,Recess.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3164.503,3169.128,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.701,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3273.498,3276.69,"Who found her, Mr. Morehart?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3276.69,3279.468,"Mr. Whittington, the father of the defendant."
1967.701,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3324.932,3326.072,What was the cause of death?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3326.072,3331.403,The cause of death was due to asphyxiation from strangulation.
1967.701,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3584.69,3601.733,I wonder if you can tell us what the actions of the defendant were during that day up to the time that his father -- he found the body and located the body let's say in the bedroom.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3601.733,3615.022,"As near as I can tell you, the defendant said that -- you see, he was at home this day and his parents left to go to Canton to visit some relatives."
1967.701,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3663.159,3664.961,"Where would the town be, Lancaster?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3664.961,3666.423,"That's true, yes."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3666.423,3671.469,"Well, he said he saw Mrs. Willard came at the back door to return some curlers."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3671.469,3672.253,That's true.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3672.253,3673.572,And that was about eight o'clock in the morning.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3673.572,3675.299,That's true.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3678.578,3682.402,And the curlers were found in the kitchen by the police.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3682.402,3686.903,That is what the chief of police testified to the day â€“ I believe on the table or a chair.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3810.645,3815.656,Juvenile Court has a separate Court with a separate judge in Fairfield County.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3815.656,3824.042,The juvenile judge is a separate Court but it has -- he is also the probate judge.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3836.516,3838.045,Separate Court room.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3838.045,3839.561,"Yes, that's true."
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3839.561,3841.494,And he is the same judge as the probate judge.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3841.494,3842.401,That is true.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3842.401,3844.738,"And then there's a different judge as Common Pleas judge, there are two judges."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3844.738,3849.291,That is true.
1967.701,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3860.434,3863.322,Was the probate judge a lawyer?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3870.359,3863.322,Oh yes.
1967.701,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3871.06,3873.577,They are all lawyers in Ohio?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3873.577,3880.822,"They are at the present time, although I think there is a Grandfather Clause and I am not sure whether there is any left of not anymore who may not be lawyers."
1967.701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3905.065,3913.727,"Mr. Morehart, is Whittington been release or has been out of custody at anytime that date until now?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3913.727,3914.727,Yes sir.
1967.701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3914.727,3916.525,When was he out of custody?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3916.525,3928.065,When the juvenile judge finally had a hearing in which he was bound over to the Common Pleas Court.
1967.701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3944.347,3946.867,How long is that?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3946.867,3950.309,It was about not right on.
1967.701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3975.027,3977.274,So is that less than a month?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3977.274,3978.869,Yes sir.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3980.56,3987.858,He was out less than a month after the proceedings had been transferred to the adult Court.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3987.858,3988.565,That's true.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3988.565,3995.068,"So that when he was an adult, he could get out. But when he was treated as a juvenile, he couldn't get out, is that right?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3995.068,3996.658,That is true.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3996.947,3998.9,Is that what your law provides?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,3998.9,3999.559,No sir.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4028.957,4033.912,How do you explain that seeming anomaly?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4065.703,4069.247,"Because the only thing I know is that that's what our statute serves, to judge."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4102.554,4108.188,The Common Pleas judge who released him on bail after the transfer --
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4108.188,4109.321,Could he have?
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4109.321,4110.314,Did he?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4110.314,4111.647,No.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4111.647,4123.326,"After the transfer of Buddy Lynn Whittington from the Juvenile Court to the Adult Court and the Common Pleas judge acquired jurisdiction over him, didn't he?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4123.326,4124.741,That's true.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4124.741,4127.094,And he was released on bail?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4127.094,4130.406,He was released but the bond was fixed by the Juvenile Court.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4130.406,4131.264,By the Juvenile Court.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4131.264,4132.821,By the Juvenile Court.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4132.821,4144.538,"What I want to know is the Juvenile Court judge didn't have anymore authority under the -- after the boy became an adult as a technical matter, did he?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4147.944,4154.694,"Well, our statute says that if he transfers him to the Common Pleas Court that he must fix bond."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4154.694,4156.703,He must --
1967.701,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4156.703,4158.34,So he had no discretion.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4158.34,4160.285,He had no discretion then.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4162.47,4168.724,Even though he is transferred on what turned out to be a first degree murder charge.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4168.724,4171.725,"Well, you'll understand."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4181.981,4182.818,I understand that.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4184.546,4185.97,That's true.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4185.97,4203.2,"And then he got the benefit of the Juvenile Court procedure as transferred to the Adult Court, released on bail which had been denied to him as -- when he was getting the benefit of being treated as a juvenile and then he was indicted for first degree murder."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4203.2,4205.973,That's right.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4236.699,4248.886,"Excuse me Mr. Morehart but may I ask, we don't understand that you're able to present more evidence to the Grand Jury than you're able to produce before the juvenile judge."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4251.966,4252.84,That is true.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4266.343,4273.957,Was the petition of the Juvenile Court to transfer Buddy Lynn Whittington to the Adult Court?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4273.957,4275.186,A petition to do so?
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4275.186,4275.603,Yes.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4275.603,4276.68,No sir.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4276.68,4278.976,"Well, how did that come about?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4278.976,4282.954,This came about because the discretion given to the Juvenile Court.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4312.569,4331.295,"I understand that but are you now telling us that nobody, no state official requested the judge to transfer Buddy Lynn Whittington from a status from the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court to the Adult Court?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4331.295,4332.037,No sir.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4334.221,4337.721,Why didn't the judge transfer him before?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4337.721,4338.717,He couldn't do so.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4340.963,4342.06,During that entire period?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4342.06,4343.287,That's right.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4375.961,4382.961,Was the juvenile judge's finding of delinquency presented to the Grand Jury?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4382.961,4383.533,No.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4383.533,4386.565,You went before the Grand Jury made an independent case.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4386.565,4388.051,That's true.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4396.751,4406.642,And what he found the Buddy Lynn Whittington committed this act and then he ordered it instead of -- he ordered him to go to the --
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4406.642,4408.351,Juvenile Diagnostic Research Center.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4408.351,4411.824,-- which is an additional proceeding to finding him over.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4411.824,4413.243,That is true.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4413.243,4415.45,"And while he was there, the appeal was taken."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4415.45,4416.259,That's right.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4419.945,4432.991,"You're suggesting that if there hadn't been an appeal at that moment and then he had come back to -- he had come back to Diagnostic Center, the judge would have found him over then."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4432.991,4434.652,He would have ruled on it one way or the other.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4434.652,4438.441,Now is your order to bind over appealable in your state?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4438.441,4439.488,Yes it is.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4439.488,4440.573,Is that a final order in your appeal?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4440.573,4442.096,I think that it is and I maintain.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4450.347,4459.951,Let's assume that an appeal had not been taken until Buddy can get back to the Diagnostic Center and he had been bound over.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4461.399,4462.681,That's right.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4462.681,4467.426,And the appeal was to challenge the order to bind over.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4467.426,4468.423,That's right.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4468.423,4476.348,"Now, would you suggest that what questions then would have been relevant or what questions could have been opened?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4479.168,4480.139,That's true.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4491.55,4510.692,Do you think that even though the finding that he committed this act and the finding that he is delinquent are made only as a preliminary to binding over?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4516.993,4519.333,All right.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4519.333,4535.867,"Now, if there was an appeal of the order to bind over after it was entered and it was challenged in the Ohio of course on the basis that they then proceed -- that the denial of procedure of due process in those proceedings."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4537.603,4538.876,Yes sir.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4539.786,4541.259,And open here if they brought it up here.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4541.259,4543.272,I think that is true.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4543.272,4548.385,"So that -- is that really quite -- the order now has been entered, has it?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4548.385,4550.496,That's true.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4556.161,4558.261,Taken before the entry of that binding?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4558.261,4564.555,That is true that's why I say -- it was not fine order from the Court of Appeals but the Court of Appeals wouldn't listen.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4564.555,4569.28,"Well, how long after the review was sought here was a bind of order --"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4569.28,4570.733,After the review was sought here?
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4570.733,4571.138,Yes.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4571.138,4580.915,"Just as soon as this Court refused to issue a state of execution further, the Juvenile Court then had a hearing and bound him over."
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4580.915,4588.227,"Well now, before we agreed to review this case, I forgot what date that was."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4596.635,4600.835,I don't know where to -- I forget what was said there that -- I don't remember.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4600.835,4604.278,"But in any event, no one sought to appeal the binding rule."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4604.278,4604.847,Yes they did.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4608.185,4609.476,So that order has been appealed.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4609.476,4610.195,That is true.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4610.195,4616.92,"And that's the one you say that if it were brought on that, we can review and get to the same questions that the petitioner now reads."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4616.92,4619.629,"In my opinion, that is a final order."
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4619.629,4630.883,Except -- perhaps -- Maybe some of those questions might come up but at least we would have jurisdiction to review that order.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4630.883,4632.039,I think that is true.
1967.701,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4632.039,4635.878,"Now let's see, you say that the appeal from the bind over order pending in what Court?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4635.878,4639.907,"In the Court of Appeals of our county, the Fifth District Court of Appeals, Fairfield County."
1967.701,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4639.907,4642.318,And that has not been --
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4642.318,4647.299,That has been stayed pending the outcome of this case.
1967.701,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4651.195,4652.915,You may now recite it.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4652.915,4653.593,Sir?
1967.701,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4653.593,4654.78,What are they?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4654.78,4657.809,One is an appeal from the bind over.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4671.675,4673.535,So he is presently incarcerated?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4673.535,4675.084,Yes he is.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4675.084,4676.585,After indictment he was --
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4676.585,4677.462,That's right.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4677.462,4678.608,His bail was cancelled.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4678.608,4681.389,His bail was cancelled because he was indicted for first degree murder.
1967.701,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4684.458,4693.515,Is every indictment for first degree murder appealable?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4693.515,4695.082,"No, an indictment is not."
1967.701,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4696.672,4701.415,What is more than happening in the indictment and the arrest?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4701.415,4702.074,Nothing.
1967.701,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4704.718,4708.877,And how could that be possible to be a final judgment with the meaning of our statute?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4708.877,4710.112,I don't think that it is.
1967.701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4710.112,4712.759,I thought you said there's a motion to dismiss the indictment but it was denied.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4712.759,4713.577,There is a motion to dismiss.
1967.701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4713.577,4715.715,And there's an appeal from the denial of the motion to dismiss.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4715.715,4718.347,"Yes, a question -- that's the final order but the --"
1967.701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4718.347,4721.452,Why is there a motion to dismiss and the denial of that motion?
1967.701,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4721.452,4722.304,I misunderstood you.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4725.667,4726.72,"No, no, I do not think so sir."
1967.701,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4726.72,4727.734,I am sorry.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4727.734,4729.814,You used the bind over to --
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4729.814,4730.576,That's right.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4734.456,4735.108,MThat isn't here.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4736.41,4736.998,That's right.
1967.701,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4738.383,4754.169,"The bind over be it more than just an -- the result of an arraignment of the preliminary hearing holding it -- I don't understand how you distinguish between those two, between the arrest under the indictment and the bind over order."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4754.169,4758.356,"I distinguish it on this basis, sir."
1967.701,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4775.395,4780.472,What finally sees a federal question -- final judgment in the federal sense?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4780.472,4782.063,I beg your pardon?
1967.701,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4782.063,4786.183,We're concerned with a federal meaning of the word final.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4786.183,4788.368,"Yes, I think that is true and I --"
1967.701,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4788.368,4790.527,Otherwise we don't have jurisdiction.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4790.527,4796.472,"Well, I think that this is what we're arguing here that there is in that jurisdiction."
1967.701,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4796.472,4804.745,But I'm talking about that why you think there would be a final judgment in case of the bind over because nothing has happened there except an indictment and the under arrest.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4804.745,4809.51,There's nothing more after the bind over for the Juvenile Court to do.
1967.701,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4844.941,4848.68,"Well, there's nothing more that the Juvenile Court can do now in this case."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4848.68,4852.739,"That's true when he binds him over, to my opinion, that's a final order."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4870.116,4870.609,Excuse me.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4878.755,4878.808,Yes.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4878.808,4888.202,"Your Ohio Supreme Court entertained on appeal from the precise judgment or order or whatever it is that we have for us, is that right?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4888.202,4889.295,They didn't entertain the appeal.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4893.652,4895.53,But your intermediate Court or whatever --
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4895.53,4896.772,The Court of Appeals.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4896.772,4897.746,The Court of Appeals.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4897.746,4901.332,They overruled my motion to dismiss because there's not being a final order.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4901.997,4907.879,"And they have decided that for state purposes at any rate, this is a final order."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4907.879,4908.904,And that I think they were wrong.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4908.904,4921.845,"And what you're saying thus is that, they were wrong and we ought to overrule them on that question of state law or I suppose you'd have to say that as a matter of federal law, this is not a final order."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4921.845,4922.539,That's our contention.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4922.539,4933.427,"Even though the transfer order, the binding over order was self --it didn't involve any additional findings, did it?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4933.427,4934.5,"Oh yes, it had to."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4939.604,4945.041,What if the Juvenile Court fined that it hadn't found in connection with the delinquency.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4945.041,4946.951,"No, it didn't find anything more in that regard."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4946.951,4948.157,That's what I'm talking about.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4960.478,4968.538,"Well, the Court -- the Court found based upon the investigation of the Juvenile Diagnostic Center that this boy was not mentally ill."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4968.538,4970.154,Is that in the record?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4970.154,4977.828,"No, it won't be because this was afterwards you see -- this was afterwards."
1967.701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4977.828,4979.985,Do you have magistrates in Ohio.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4979.985,4980.811,Sir?
1967.701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4980.811,4983.192,Magistrates hearings in Ohio?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4983.192,4984.606,"Yes, we do sir."
1967.701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4984.606,4988.461,"Well, suppose the magistrate binds the man over Grand Jury --"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4988.461,4989.248,Yes sir.
1967.701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4989.248,4994.121,Would that be a final order?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,4994.121,4998.711,It would be a final order but it would not be an appeal of an order in our State.
1967.701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4998.711,5002.25,"Well, what's the different between that when the Juvenile Court binds him over?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5002.25,5005.383,"With that, I think there's nothing -- there's no difference."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5008.387,5017.815,Don't your statute to provide that a juvenile has a right to proceedings in the Juvenile Court?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5020.5,5021.489,I didn't follow you sir.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5022.361,5040.437,Does the Ohio Statute provide that a juvenile has -- who is charged with an offense or whatever magic language you use that he has a right to be proceeded against in the Juvenile Court in the first instance?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5040.437,5042.008,"Yes, he does have."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5042.008,5067.969,And so that here what's happened is a necessary and an adjudication of delinquency that according to your adversary anyway was necessary before the child could be deprived of his right to be preceded against in the juvenile and not the Adult Court.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5067.969,5080.315,"Under our statute, the Juvenile Court has original, exclusive jurisdiction over all juveniles."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5137.146,5163.034,"As my understanding, what we're dealing with here maybe a finding and an order by the Juvenile Court which in effect deprives the child of a right given to him under Ohio Law namely, the right to be tried in the juvenile and not in the adult Court."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5163.034,5174.093,"No, no, it doesn't deprive the child of that right because the child or no one else has any as you say so except the Juvenile Court in cases of a felony."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5174.093,5181.733,"I think I understand you but the point is, there has to be a Juvenile Court proceeding first before the child can be tried in the adult Court."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5181.733,5182.85,That's right.
1967.701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5184.531,5202.906,"Mr. Morehart may I ask, if the turnover order were before us and if we were to set it aside, what would be the effect upon the indictment?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5202.906,5221.795,"My opinion is that it would vacate the indictment unless of course, the ruling of this Court will be such as to say that the juvenile court out of the state of Ohio were unconstitutional."
1967.701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5230.22,5231.369,Subject to indictment.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5231.369,5233.773,That's right.
1967.701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5235.903,5237.397,But apart from that --
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5237.397,5237.945,Apart from that.
1967.701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5237.945,5255.63,"On the hypothesis I gave you, the indictment would be invalidated and I gather this time would require a brand new Juvenile Court proceeding under whatever standard we set or to govern such procedures which might stand in up again I take it in a disposition which was a turnover order."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5255.63,5261.647,"I assume that to be true. Now, that is my understanding of the law at this time."
1967.701,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5264.005,5276.188,Did I understand you to say a while ago that the question of vagueness is upon in the Court of Appeals -- the right to be.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5276.188,5283.009,"Well, only in the Common Pleas Court from the indictment and not in the Juvenile Court."
1967.701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5285.894,5288.539,Is it pretty well settled in Ohio?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5299.247,5305.66,I know of no case in where they've held that if you have a right to bail on a first degree murder charge.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5392.244,5418.844,"Mr. Morehart, apart from the question of ultimate penalty, what are the benefits apart from the question of ultimate penalty, what are the benefits that Buddy Lynn Whittington received by reason of being tried in the Juvenile Court as against what would have happened to him in the Adult Court?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5418.844,5428.296,"Well, if he would have been in the Adult Court until such time as he was indicted by the Grand Jury for first degree murder."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5430.983,5435.333,I would have been an advantage of his being as an adult.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5435.333,5436.264,That's true.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5436.264,5443.965,And so that's one thing on the deficit side is so far as the Ohio Juvenile Court system is concerned.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5443.965,5444.85,That is true --
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5444.85,5447.539,He could have been released in the Juvenile Court too.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5447.539,5448.46,He could have been.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5448.46,5451.778,Wouldn't the discretion have been the same?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5451.778,5464.967,"No, I don't think the discretion would have been the same to be fair with you and honest with you, because I think a person charged with only a second degree murder and our State Courts as an adult is entitled to bail."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5476.785,5490.308,What you're telling us and we can pass to the next one is that if he had been an adult and he had been charged with exactly the same thing under Ohio and had been charged with second degree murder.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5493.811,5494.524,That is true.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5494.524,5499.369,"Whereas being a juvenile, he was at the mercy of the judge."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5499.369,5499.795,That's right.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5499.795,5501.443,And he did not get bailed.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5508.77,5522.905,"The fact that he was now -- in this individual case, I suppose that you would have to say that it was disadvantage if he was being held when he could have been released to parents or probation officer or to someone else."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5535.25,5562.089,"Is there anything you can say that this boy got -- any benefit he got, any protection he got as a result of being processed or whatever you want to call it in the Juvenile Court as against being given the rights under our constitution in an adult Court."
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5562.089,5568.823,"Well from a practical standpoint, he was not held like an adult would be."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5571.032,5575.956,That is not what the record -- what the opinion below says.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5575.956,5580.858,"Well, he was not confined in a -- he was confined in the jail but not where they keep other adults."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5580.858,5585.74,That is contrary to what I've seen somewhere in this record.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5585.74,5589.841,And he was not held in solitary confinement at no time.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5589.841,5592.928,Would you say that that isn't true?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5594.284,5597.297,And they will find that the record is close.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5611.903,5620.297,Where did this curious misapprehension that I can't spot it at the moment.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5639.8,5641.937,I know of no such thing and I --
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5641.937,5643.721,You know that does appear.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5643.721,5651.099,That does appear and there is no basis for it that he was ever sentenced or kept in solitary confinement.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5660.038,5665.051,"Now, this boy was not put in a special juvenile facility was he?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5665.051,5671.501,It was a juvenile facility session we had at that time which is in upstairs over what our county jail is.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5671.501,5674.262,Is that the eighth floor facility?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5674.262,5675.451,"No sir, this is the second floor."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5685.735,5692.503,Are there any other benefits that this boy received by reason of the Ohio Juvenile Court procedures?
1967.701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5692.503,5695.484,"Well, he wasn't arrested for a crime in the first place, was he?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5695.484,5696.266,No sir.
1967.701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5696.266,5697.688,He wasn't charged for the crime.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5697.688,5698.323,No sir.
1967.701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5699.244,5701.821,He got no criminal record --
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5701.821,5703.568,That's right.
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5704.422,5718.322,"Well apart from words what actually happened to the boy here, was he given any procedural rights that he would not get as an adult?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5718.322,5718.79,No.
1967.701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5738.838,5740.148,Why?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5740.148,5740.787,Sir?
1967.701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5740.787,5742.029,Why?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5742.029,5748.342,Because he has been transferred to the Common Pleas Court and there he will be treated as an adult.
1967.701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5748.342,5754.746,Just because he was trying to refer it from Court to the other that he is the exact same person --
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5754.746,5760.405,He is the exact same person but he is not charged with a crime before he was caught.
1967.701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5760.405,5761.545,That makes it better.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5765.206,5767.311,"No, I don't think that it makes it better."
1967.701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5777.198,5792.386,(Inaudible)
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5792.386,5800.238,"Well, after the body was discovered, then the police who had been there and had gone home for dinner was recalled back of course."
1967.701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5859.279,5861.23,How about a probation officer?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5861.23,5861.698,Sir?
1967.701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5861.698,5863.338,How about the probation officer?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5863.338,5869.099,"I don't think that he has ever talked to him since that time sir, at least not about the experience."
1967.701,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5870.13,5872.888,"Well, what was the basis then for the arrest warrant?"
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5872.888,5880.221,The basis for the arrest warrant was the fact that this boy was here and he admitted that he had been here all the time.
1967.701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5891.497,5891.983,He what?
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5892.519,5895.719,I say that we assume that it had to be the boy who committed this crime.
1967.701,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5909.646,5910.702,Very well.
1967.701,2,22866,e_raymond_morehart,,5910.702,5918.224,Thank you.
1967.701,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5918.224,5919.274,Mr. Green.
1967.701,3,35923,merritt_w_green,,5919.274,5923.304,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.701,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6013.688,6022.432,"Well Mr. Green, I have read your brief on behalf of the National Counsel of Juvenile Court judges."
1967.701,3,35923,merritt_w_green,,6051.817,6057.213,"Well, we would have to assume at the outset because of the wide latitude given to the statute."
1967.701,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6067.999,6069.419,But he didn't get that did he?
1967.701,3,35923,merritt_w_green,,6069.419,6094.671,"That's right but I would say that we would have to assume I believe that because of either of the climate in the area or the nature of the crime with which he was charged, the Court in its wisdom whether it was right or not, felt that it would be better for Buddy Whittington to be retained in the custody of the Court or one of its officers."
1967.701,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6094.671,6094.997,Yes.
1967.701,3,35923,merritt_w_green,,6112.467,6114.552,There's no question about that under our law.
1967.701,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6114.552,6119.629,"Alright, is there anything else that -- this boy."
1967.701,3,35923,merritt_w_green,,6119.629,6137.083,"This particular boy, I presume you could say, because of the entanglements of legal procedures that followed, nothing accrued to his benefit but that doesn't make the statue in it of itself unconstitutional."
1967.701,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6137.083,6147.99,"Well, you tell me what could have accrued to his benefit once we pass this debate about what the judge might have done that he didn't do with respect to the release."
1967.701,3,35923,merritt_w_green,,6147.99,6162.485,We'll have to make an assumption too that he came from a home that obviously to the Court indicated that to go back in that home it maybe the wrong thing for him.
1967.701,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6162.485,6164.088,I know nothing in this record.
1967.701,3,35923,merritt_w_green,,6164.088,6164.541,That's right.
1967.701,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6165.313,6166.92,Let's don't assume that.
1967.701,3,35923,merritt_w_green,,6169.036,6175.006,This particular boy had nothing accrued to him that I can see on this record.
1967.701,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6186.035,6192.495,Maybe too much lowing at the wrong time and maybe not enough lowing in terms of basic structure.
1967.701,3,35923,merritt_w_green,,6196.799,6199.26,"The first part, I would say it was true."
1967.701,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6231.72,6237.586,Do you disagree with the constitutional principle that provides for a right to bail?
1967.701,3,35923,merritt_w_green,,6237.586,6243.623,"No, by all means, I do not of course the constitutional principle is I believe stated in that."
1967.701,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6328.883,6333.864,Is there anything like that happened here so far as this record shows?
1967.701,3,35923,merritt_w_green,,6333.864,6334.961,You mean as to this boy?
1967.701,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6336.423,6337.923,What happened here?
1967.701,3,35923,merritt_w_green,,6337.923,6338.447,Sir?
1967.701,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6338.447,6346.632,What happened here in effect was an effort by the Juvenile Court to find out whether this boy committed the offense.
1967.701,3,35923,merritt_w_green,,6372.167,6373.446,"No, I don't think that's true Mr. Justice Fortas."
1967.701,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6373.446,6377.534,Where do you find that in -- where do you find anything else in the record?
1967.701,3,35923,merritt_w_green,,6377.534,6382.831,"Well, his finding at the start, saying that there has been a murder committed."
1967.701,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6469.407,6473.929,"In your brief, you referred to that as shameful incarceration of this boy."
1967.701,3,35923,merritt_w_green,,6473.929,6476.975,I believe shameful treatment.
1967.701,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6476.975,6478.903,Shameful treatment.
1967.701,3,35923,merritt_w_green,,6478.903,6482.502,That's right.
1967.701,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6515.333,6520.685,At which state the juvenile judge could have left it in the juvenile authority?
1967.701,3,35923,merritt_w_green,,6520.685,6521.699,"At that time, yes."
1967.701,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6528.647,6532.726,Another question that I will -- thank you for your attention.
1967.701,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6538.588,6539.265,Mr. Rezneck.
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6539.265,6542.406,"Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the Court."
1967.701,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6566.172,6568.709,"That's before we acted on the petition, wasn't it?"
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6568.709,6569.248,"Yes, you granted."
1967.701,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6569.248,6575.411,Any reason why we weren't asked to act down the petition in respect to the turnover.
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6575.411,6582.283,"Well, at that time, the turnover -- when certiorari was filed for the turnover, the transfer order had not been entered."
1967.701,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6582.283,6587.504,"No, but after it was and before we acted on the petition, it was a long interval before we acted on the petition."
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6587.504,6590.3,I believe that the record will show that there was a request for a state --
1967.701,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6590.3,6593.606,You have said that and I've looked for it with no success.
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6593.606,6597.989,"Well, it's not in the current record that I have here but it maybe in the file."
1967.701,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6601.951,6603.371,We denied a stay?
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6603.371,6604.499,Yes you did.
1967.701,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6672.909,6677.174,But it is a separate question for finality with its final progress.
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6677.174,6680.854,"Yes and I believe in that question, you look at the incidents of the judge --"
1967.701,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6680.854,6691.638,What would have happened in the Juvenile Court if the Court had decided when the -- when it was permitted to go forward that it wouldn't -- that the Court would not turnover.
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6692.507,6695.678,"Well, it would have had a variety of dispositional orders open to it."
1967.701,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6695.678,6698.74,But it's still a disposition order to be entered.
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6698.74,6708.062,"Well, there was a disposition order here, there would have been a further order which could have been still temporary in nature or which could have been a permanent commitment, which could have been probation, which could have been a fine."
1967.701,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6713.441,6721.133,But there are still in this case necessarily -- at least another order had to be entered one way or another.
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6721.133,6725.949,There's no specific provision of course requiring the Court to do that or even setting a time limit within which the Court --
1967.701,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6725.949,6731.736,Once the diagnostic center send it back -â€“ is that the statute there?
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6731.736,6737.255,Well a statute doesn't say to the contrary that there is no provision in the statute which is comparable to the provision of the federal criminal rule.
1967.701,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6737.255,6740.592,A common sense would indicate that perhaps there was another order coming.
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6740.592,6745.513,I would have thought that the judge would have to do something or else it would be susceptible to habeas corpus.
1967.701,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6792.781,6801.312,-- you understand it under which the judge decided that the man is a delinquent man.
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6801.312,6809.136,"As I understand in Ohio, he is entitled to do on a basis of a preponderance of the evidence as if it were an ordinary garden variety negligence of --"
1967.701,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6809.136,6813.772,What must they prove about it to prove that he a delinquent?
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6813.772,6822.511,"In this case where the violation of a criminal statute was involved, they must simply prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he violated the criminal statute."
1967.701,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6825.288,6829.405,What's the standard to bind over an adult to a Grand Jury for a trial?
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6829.405,6839.552,The state statute I believe refers to substantial and credible evidence.
1967.701,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6856.447,6857.958,On the presence of substantial --
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6857.958,6859.164,Yes sir.
1967.701,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6859.164,6859.978,Without weighing it.
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6859.978,6864.268,Yes which is even a lower standard than the preponderance standard?
1967.701,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6864.268,6876.377,"Mr. Rezneck, Mr. Morehart challenged the statement that's been made about a boy being confined and along with adult and being in solitary confinement."
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6877.615,6894.588,"I'd like to direct the Court's attention on the first point on the adult confinement to page 253 of the record which is the journal entry of the District Court of Appeals, which ordered Buddy released from the confinement, and in which he was then held in the adult jail."
1967.701,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6906.369,6908.499,That was after a personal viewing by the Court.
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6908.499,6910.592,That was personal viewing by the Court of Appeals.
1967.701,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6971.723,6975.701,May I ask you one more question about those two pieces of evidence?
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,6993.837,7000.257,"Well, I realized that this creates a problem as to what remedy would be affected at this time after he has been found to be a delinquent."
1967.701,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7000.257,7008.062,Would that authorize us or justify us by setting aside the judgment finding that he is a delinquent.
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,7008.062,7013.764,"We think that it would, Your Honor but for the denial of a fundamental constitutional right --"
1967.701,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7013.764,7017.749,That is a denial of the fundamental constitution right you would say.
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,7019.6,7019.825,You're right.
1967.701,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7019.825,7022.332,Do you think that should set aside the finding that he is a delinquent.
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,7022.332,7028.803,The right to be from cruel and unusual punishment such as this boy was projected to as a fundamental constitutional right.
1967.701,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7028.803,7035.177,Now we should order him completely released at all time because he was kept in a solitary confinement.
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,7035.177,7040.428,We think it should invalidate the proceedings against him with respect to whether he can be retried.
1967.701,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7046.948,7052.537,So what is the efficiency of the proof of the question of delinquency had to do with where he is kept in jail.
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,7052.537,7055.45,Those two questions are not related Your Honor.
1967.701,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7069.13,7071.525,That's kind of -- when is it addressed?
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,7071.525,7074.514,"Well, it's our last argument, Your Honor."
1967.701,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7075.552,7102.123,"Well Mr. Rezneck, it has been urged before us in this case and it's been otherwise urged that the State has a burden of showing that the classification of children for purposes of various applications of its laws is a reasonable one and in terms of justification of denial of certain rights, certain constitutional rights."
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,7203.745,7214.668,"I would certainly say that the State is going to try juvenile's criminals, confine them as criminals, and punish them as criminals that it cannot obey constitutional obligations by -- pardon me?"
1967.701,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7218.954,7231.973,Do you think it's relevant on the issue of whether or not this delinquency judgment -- to base it in that finding in anyway on whether this fellow was brought and was kept in jail.
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,7231.973,7242.15,"We think our arguments that go to the invalid fact finding procedure will amply dispose off this point and will show the invalidity of the juvenile delinquency adjudication, Your Honor."
1967.701,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7247.632,7258.584,(Inaudible).
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,7258.584,7261.584,No it does not Your Honor.
1967.701,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7261.584,7264.834,(Inaudible)
1967.701,4,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,7264.834,7268.775,The record is silent on that.
