1962.240,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,223.398,227.301,Does the trustee have an option to distribute?

1962.240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,270.703,274.597,So the tax was taken out of the gain that was added to the corpus?
1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,274.597,275.19,That's right and to that extent --
1962.240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,275.19,276.181,And what the (Voice Overlap) --
1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,276.181,280.0,-- it depleted the interest of the beneficiaries in that gain.
1962.240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,280.0,284.148,It wasn't -- it wasn't paid out of otherwise distributable income?
1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,284.148,292.34,"No, Mr. -- no, it was paid out of the corpus that with -- the capital gain was added to corpus but it was reduced by the amount of the tax."
1962.240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,292.34,293.261,Is that by reason of --

1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,297.349,305.992,"Well, in Great Britain, there is no tax whatsoever on gains of this kind, on capital gains."

1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,316.274,331.748,"Under the same treaty if there was a reverse provision, the method of taxing trusts in the United Kingdom are somewhat different from ours because they have a surtax, which is an individual tax only and has a progression in it."
1962.240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,351.595,366.938,"Well, if there's a trust administered in England and assume in one year, the only -- if what we would call income, but which wouldn't be income there was what we would call a capital gain."
1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,371.481,373.727,"Well, that's a question of fiduciary accounting."
1962.240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,375.174,378.938,But if the account for the trust provided for the distribution of it --

1962.240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,381.067,383.948,But if it were distributed --
1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,383.948,386.366,It wouldn't be taxable even though it was distributed (Voice Overlap).
1962.240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,386.366,388.296,"Oh, not in English -- not by English law but how about --"

1962.240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,388.951,390.436,How about its receipt?
1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,397.933,404.985,"Oh, a receipt of that by a United States taxpayer under our law would be considered taxable."
1962.240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,404.985,406.033,As capital gain?
1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,406.033,407.128,As a capital gain.
1962.240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,407.128,408.714,Yes.
1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,408.714,412.257,Assuming it was currently distributed.
1962.240,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,412.257,418.948,"But, perhaps I've been lost but under Connecticut law which is here applicable, it was not currently distributable."
1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,418.948,419.162,That's correct.
1962.240,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,419.162,420.192,It should be added to the corpus.
1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,420.192,423.182,"It had to be added to the corpus, correct."

1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,701.361,702.767,"That's right, that's right."
1962.240,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,702.767,717.64,"It does -- it does come in, however, earlier on that question -- the scope of the treaty if you looked at [Inaudible]"
1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,717.64,721.343,"No, because that's what this particular treaty is about."
1962.240,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,741.606,749.769,What I mean -- as I understood the scope of your argument was that the British has no capital gains tax.
1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,749.769,750.801,That's correct.
1962.240,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,750.801,765.72,The purpose of this treaty is to exempt [Inaudible] the British resident --

1962.240,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,766.423,768.768,-- so far exempt.
1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,768.768,770.975,Just as we are exempt from them.

1962.240,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,786.762,789.08,-- that no British [Inaudible]
1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,789.08,803.293,The exception is only -- only relates to a British resident who was engaged in trade or business in the United States which tends to bring them within our jurisdiction and make them more like a resident.

1962.240,0,21111,david_a_lindsay,,1364.982,1366.675,Under the regulations?

1962.240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1470.339,1473.605,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.240,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1513.822,1530.882,"As Americ -- as on a matter of American law say, if they had been distributable to the beneficiaries as a matter of Connecticut law, then the trust would have had report them but the beneficiaries would've paid the tax and there's some other tricky things about the 90 days or something that's been (Voice Overlap)."
1962.240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1530.882,1549.053,They would have been reported by the trust that they would -- the beneficiaries who had received them would not have owed any tax on them because they were non-resident aliens who with respect to capital gains had no temporary presence in the United States.
1962.240,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1556.69,1561.481,"The trust under those circumstances is exempt from tax by operation of our income tax statute, if it were distributed, is that correct?"
1962.240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1567.205,1570.705,"In effect, it's exempted because it distributes."
1962.240,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1570.705,1574.658,"It reports it as I remember but this reports the distributions, is that right?"
1962.240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1574.658,1575.587,That's correct.
1962.240,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1575.623,1575.831,Kind of like a --
1962.240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1575.831,1576.742,-- the deduction which --
1962.240,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1576.742,1578.31,Kind of like a partnership return?

1962.240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1617.285,1632.275,"Well, I think the citizenship and residents of the trustee would be relevant and it would be difficult to claim an English trust with a trust -- American trustee and property physically located in Connecticut."
1962.240,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1656.115,1670.062,I was really wondering [Inaudible]
1962.240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1670.062,1673.616,"Yes, perhaps they could have."
1962.240,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1814.906,1818.619,"But by the same token, there's no question but that the beneficiaries do qualify, is that --"
1962.240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1818.619,1827.811,"Quite so, the beneficiaries clearly as British subjects and British residents do qualify."
1962.240,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2075.012,2077.822,Where is that provision found?

1962.240,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2225.599,2230.501,"Well, it is conceivable isn't it that regardless of what our American law might be."
1962.240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2245.694,2246.027,Certain (Voice Overlap) --
1962.240,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2246.027,2248.445,Contrary to the American domestic law.
1962.240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2248.445,2263.72,"Certainly, Justice Stewart but it's hard to read that revolution in approach without some indication in the legislative history, without some express provision in the treaty."
1962.240,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2615.188,2619.999,[Inaudible]

1962.240,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2869.036,2873.627,"I mean, part of the fact that you've got a section in your brief about that."
1962.240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2873.627,2880.463,We do rely on the regulation in that it shows a contemporary interpretation.
