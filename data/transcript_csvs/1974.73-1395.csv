1974.73-1395,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.495,Mr. Frey.
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,7.495,10.712,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,395.865,404.731,In this case Mr. Frey could that be done by simply reinstating the guilty verdict and entering judgment on it?
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,404.731,412.327,"Well yes, you would the direct District Court presumably if it was wrong in its ruling to enter a judgment on the verdict."
1974.73-1395,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,466.502,470.389,Didn't he entered judgment after the verdict here?
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,470.389,473.43,"In this case, he never entered a judgment of conviction."
1974.73-1395,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,474.013,479.52,The rest of judgment was just to arrest a forthcoming judgment?
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,479.52,482.792,"Presumably, it's not clear what he acted on."
1974.73-1395,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,507.37,510.556,Is that a motion to dismiss the indictment according to the appendix?
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,510.556,520.558,"Prior to trial certainly, on this very ground that he acted on subsequently."
1974.73-1395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,521.078,527.57,"Well this would be like Jenkins, except for the different trier of fact."
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,538.418,543.121,It's difficult to say what that means.
1974.73-1395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,561.942,562.866,He enters as a judgment?
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,562.866,563.86,He enters a judgment.
1974.73-1395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,572.663,575.56,Well he can entertain a motion for a new trial?
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,575.56,583.938,"I think yes, there are certain forms of relief that he can grant."
1974.73-1395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,700.892,707.899,"Of course, Palko in effect said you could have a rational system of jurisprudence without the Double Jeopardy Clause, didn't it?"
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,707.899,726.62,"Well, it said that the core value of the Double Jeopardy Clause that would be transmitted to the states under the notion of Palko through the Due Process Clause would be basically the Ball notion that a man who has been tried and acquitted on the facts, can't be subjected to a second prosecution."
1974.73-1395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,726.62,735.384,"But presumably, even if Palko were still a law, we would be dealing in the federal system as we are here now with the core notion, but with the Double Jeopardy Clause itself?"
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,735.384,747.501,"Yes, I understand that and I don't mean to suggest in alluding to Palko that he meant to exclude the possibility of other considerations because one of the things that happened in the Palko opinion, was that he discussed Kepner."
1974.73-1395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,863.165,867.897,"Well of course, the acquittal came in the Court of Appeals in Russell, not in the District Court?"
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,867.897,877.977,"That's true but of course the Court of Appeals was performing the identical function in Russell that the District Judge was performing here in the Wilson case, that is ruling on a question of law."
1974.73-1395,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,922.967,932.81,"And you think that if the judge acquitted the man on illegal grounds, unconstitutional grounds, the Court of Appeals could reinstate it now."
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,935.648,937.681,In a jury trial or in a --
1974.73-1395,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,937.681,938.687,Either.
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,938.687,953.089,"Well in a jury trial, there's no doubt that the Court of Appeals could in our view, could order him to enter a judgment of conviction, assuming there is no other matter before him that would prevent the judgment of conviction."
1974.73-1395,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,953.089,956.304,Isn't that a directed verdict again?
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,956.304,958.244,Well the jury -- it's not a directed verdict.
1974.73-1395,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,979.455,990.511,Do you know of any case where the Court of Appeals has ordered a trial judge sitting without a jury to find a man guilty?
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,990.511,991.267,"Well, I'm not sure."
1974.73-1395,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,991.267,992.243,Of course.
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,993.731,995.855,You mean where he has found him not guilty?
1974.73-1395,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,995.855,996.68,Yes.
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,996.68,1005.323,"Well, you have to realize, this case here, these cases this morning are basically cases of first impression, so to say that there is no such case."
1974.73-1395,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1014.101,1015.463,There might still be no such case?
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1015.463,1019.295,"When the -- well there may, that's of course up to you."
1974.73-1395,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1031.392,1035.14,"When he waived the jury trial, he didn't waive the Double Jeopardy --"
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1035.14,1035.568,"No, of course not --"
1974.73-1395,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1035.568,1036.784,-- plea?
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1036.784,1037.718,Of course not.
1974.73-1395,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1040.179,1041.476,Then you are pretty close?
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1041.476,1043.907,We're suggesting the different consequences attached.
1974.73-1395,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1062.53,1064.843,"At the new trial, did you appeal it?"
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1064.843,1065.356,No.
1974.73-1395,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1080.213,1082.803,(Inaudible)
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1082.803,1083.74,Excuse me.
1974.73-1395,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1083.74,1087.558,(Inaudible) instead of discretion?
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1087.558,1093.104,"Well, the statute confides it to the discretion and the appeal statute does not authorize appeals."
1974.73-1395,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1104.219,1109.175,Is the government suggesting in any respect that we cut back on Sisson?
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1109.175,1112.748,"Well, I was going to turn now to a specific discussion of that --"
1974.73-1395,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1112.748,1116.473,"Oh, I don't (Voice Overlap ) let me ask another question."
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1131.221,1132.866,It's a determination of law clearly.
1974.73-1395,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1250.655,1251.849,Where are you're reading from now?
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1251.849,1263.711,I am reading from page 28 of our brief in Jenkins which would be page 671 of 163 U.S. the Ball case.
1974.73-1395,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1461.965,1466.537,"You see the rationale in Kepner was, you would have to have a new trial?"
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1466.537,1473.671,"Not that you would have to have a new trial, but that in fact the second proceeding was a new trial that was constitutional prohibited."
1974.73-1395,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1503.999,1513.073,"But no further -- if the Supreme Court of the Philippines' judgment had been sustained, there would have been no need for a new trial?"
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1513.073,1516.4,"If they had -- if it had been sustained, no."
1974.73-1395,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1518.591,1529.192,"Because under the Philippine practice as Judge Friendly said, “No further proceedings were required below.�?"
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1529.192,1529.589,But this was a --
1974.73-1395,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1529.589,1533.522,"And even so, there was Double Jeopardy."
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1533.522,1538.934,Because the question there was whether the second trial that he had already had put him in Double Jeopardy.
1974.73-1395,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1597.318,1600.739,"And what you said there Mr. Frey, you believe that Sisson is what?"
1974.73-1395,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1600.739,1616.492,"We think it's on all force analytically, that is in the Jenkins case, we agree that if Sisson was right in its definition of an acquittal for purposes of old 3731, that in Jenkins, you had the same beast."
1974.73-1395,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1672.461,1674.1,Very well Mr. Frey.
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,1675.534,1678.834,Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the Court.
1974.73-1395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1842.502,1849.334,Did that have anything to do with the finding of guilt or innocence?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,1849.334,1852.677,Did the judge's ruling have anything at all to do with finding of guilt or innocence?
1974.73-1395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1867.443,1871.511,Did it say anything about guilt or innocence?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,1871.511,1872.66,"Yes, I believe it did."
1974.73-1395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1873.519,1874.523,I'm listening?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,1875.215,1877.439,"Okay, I believed it did in this context."
1974.73-1395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1900.107,1903.736,"Did it touch it at all, did it, didn't anything to do with it?"
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,1911.762,1912.444,That's correct.
1974.73-1395,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1920.804,1933.431,"Isn't the implication however of the judges action that had there not been this delay the jury verdict might well have been different, it would have been not guilty?"
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,1933.431,1933.646,Yes.
1974.73-1395,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1958.88,1968.788,"The finding of substantial prejudice is simply a way of saying that, had the trial been conducted more properly, the result may well have been different."
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,1968.788,1969.028,That is --
1974.73-1395,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1969.028,1970.071,"It has to be that, doesn't it?"
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,1970.071,1971.313,That is our position sir.
1974.73-1395,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1971.313,1976.062,"And if it would have been different, it would have been a verdict of not guilty rather than a verdict of guilty."
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,1978.321,1978.898,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1395,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1988.256,1990.806,"Well, he doesn't know what these witnesses would have testified."
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,1995.945,1996.801,Well I think that perhaps he could --
1974.73-1395,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1996.801,1999.087,"-- there is a possibility that he couldn't testify, isn't that correct?"
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,1999.087,1999.421,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1395,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2017.884,2021.299,But the ruling really is that he should never been tried at all?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2021.299,2022.288,That's correct.
1974.73-1395,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2022.288,2027.352,And couldn't be tried again and hence --
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2027.352,2028.319,"I think, if I may --"
1974.73-1395,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2028.319,2029.86,-- or ever tried.
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2032.835,2033.462,That's correct.
1974.73-1395,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2034.075,2040.516,And hence it certainly doesn't invite any more jeopardy?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2040.516,2041.631,Alright.
1974.73-1395,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2081.668,2082.358,"That maybe so, that may be so."
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2097.527,2098.542,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1395,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2098.542,2105.455,"But his ultimate judgment is, he never should have been tried at all?"
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2105.455,2110.53,"Based upon facts which he didn't learn until he was tried, that's correct."
1974.73-1395,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2117.673,2122.294,But all these facts really went to prejudice?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2122.294,2123.519,"The facts did go to prejudice, yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1395,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2123.519,2126.525,I mean what finally determined it?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2126.525,2126.874,"Oh, are you asking --"
1974.73-1395,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2126.874,2136.842,"You can deny a speedy trial, but finally the time when the judge denied a speedy trial, was that not having this evidence available, his trial was prejudiced?"
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2136.842,2137.275,Correct.
1974.73-1395,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2137.275,2137.88,Isn't that it?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2137.88,2138.405,Correct.
1974.73-1395,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2138.405,2141.86,And that's the connection with the fact finding?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2141.86,2143.564,"That is the connection with the fact finding, yes."
1974.73-1395,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2167.272,2173.324,Well a speedy trial issue requires a determination of prejudice anyway?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2173.324,2178.432,"Not the speedy trial issue but the due process issue requires a determination of prejudice, yes sir."
1974.73-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2178.432,2192.987,"Well this is the type of thing that many inexperienced trial judge wouldn't take your word by affidavit for at a pretrial stage, but sitting through the evidence may have reached a different conclusion on his own?"
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2192.987,2194.421,That's correct.
1974.73-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2216.531,2217.565,I didn't approve.
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2217.565,2218.221,I'm sorry Your Honor.
1974.73-1395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2253.755,2269.271,Don't you perhaps overstate or go beyond what you need to go beyond when you say that you could not demonstrate these things by affidavit in a pretrial motion.
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2284.621,2290.837,"If I may, I would not only retreat from that, I did not mean to say that we could not have done it by affidavit."
1974.73-1395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2375.303,2398.899,"Are you suggesting that this is a parallel to some extent of the case where a judge is in doubt as he is going along but decides to let the case go to the jury, get their verdict and then with more time to reflect on the interaction of all the evidence that decide the standard of judgment N.O.V."
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2401.313,2419.157,"I think that -- no, I don't think it is really because I think that that kind of a decision as you voiced it to me or as I understand it, the question involves one with the Court has in fact cerebrated about these very things and decided, well for some reason, I'm not going to do it at this point, I'll let the jury do it."
1974.73-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2469.569,2474.499,Under your argument though a acquittal must have significance under the Double Jeopardy Clause?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2476.932,2478.873,"That's correct, that's correct."
1974.73-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2497.246,2503.171,"And if you do get over it, you have it right there?"
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2503.171,2504.096,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2736.796,2752.071,Well what would be your position Mr. Lauer if the jury returns a verdict of guilty and the judge grants a post trial motion for acquittal call it dismissing the indictment on the basis of the statute of limitations as well.
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2756.377,2765.862,I would say that if it were a statute of limitations issue which could have constituted a jury defense and if the Court found --
1974.73-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2765.862,2769.288,"Is that ordinarily something that you charge the jury about, the statute of limitations?"
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2769.288,2776.154,"No, I'm saying that it perhaps -- that it could formed -- there could be a question in fact, well maybe I'm reading too much in your question."
1974.73-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2798.695,2809.156,"What if there were no question in fact, there was simply a question of which statute of limitations applied and jury verdict of guilt in a post trial motion granted?"
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2809.156,2825.44,"Then, I would say that for the reasons we've advanced in this case, that if the decision concerned, not concerned itself but founded itself upon trial testimony going to the fundamental issue in some cases, it would not be appealable."
1974.73-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2934.424,2938.426,You waive it by making a post trial motion?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,2938.426,2940.045,I don't think that fact alone waives it.
1974.73-1395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3073.019,3078.019,How would you characterize the cerebrations of the judge?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3078.019,3083.622,"I would say Mr. Chief Justice, that it's probably a mixed question of law --"
1974.73-1395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3083.622,3087.472,Applying the law of speedy trial to the facts of the case?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3087.472,3088.461,"Yes, I think so."
1974.73-1395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3098.725,3100.582,In face of the evidence?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3100.582,3103.429,"Well, I'm not saying that the tests are the same but I'm saying that --"
1974.73-1395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3103.429,3104.359,The same process?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3104.359,3105.016,Yes.
1974.73-1395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3120.98,3135.836,"On the sufficiency of the evidence case, he would be applying what the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and applying that standard to the facts that he has heard up to the time of the closing?"
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3135.836,3136.382,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3136.382,3146.202,"And then saying to himself, this is not enough to persuade any reasonable person beyond the reasonable doubt, is that right?"
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3146.202,3149.635,I would assume that that would be the kind of thinking that we go through judge's mind if he were --
1974.73-1395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3149.635,3152.366,You said that's about the same kind of a process?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3152.366,3162.876,"I'm saying it's the same kind of process, in the sense that -- only in the sense that the same kinds of resolution of factual issues and application of legal principles must occur."
1974.73-1395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3193.142,3208.671,"On the contrary, I understand the government's position would be that the only decision on guilt or innocence was made by the jury and the judge that in itself would warrant."
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3212.343,3213.56,Yes.
1974.73-1395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3213.56,3220.671,"Now, how can you say that one is law and one is fact?"
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3220.671,3223.707,"I don't understand your question, sir because I'm specifically not saying that one is law and one is fact."
1974.73-1395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3223.707,3239.418,"I understand the government to say that if the judge had ruled that the evidence wasn't sufficient or something of that sort involving guilt or innocence, it should be a different ball game."
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3251.114,3254.484,"Yes, I disagree with one of the fundamental propositions of it."
1974.73-1395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3280.043,3287.331,"But suppose the judge had said nothing except, “I set aside the jury's verdict of guilty.�?"
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3287.331,3289.561,"Well, that's what I would suggest -- well, yes."
1974.73-1395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3289.561,3291.197,And acquit.
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3291.197,3293.565,I set aside the juried verdict and I acquit.
1974.73-1395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3293.565,3294.268,Yes.
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3294.268,3294.502,I would suggest the --
1974.73-1395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3294.502,3296.776,Will the government have right to appeal?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3296.776,3299.839,"I do not believe so, no, sir."
1974.73-1395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3299.839,3300.185,Why not?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3300.185,3301.539,And well -- the --
1974.73-1395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3301.539,3302.299,Under the statute --
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3302.299,3313.682,"Part of the government submission in this case, if Your Honor please is that one of the reasons they can appeal, in Jenkins, in particular is that the Court explained why it made its mistake."
1974.73-1395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3327.521,3330.905,Well I don't understand the government is going as far as you do?
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3330.905,3334.423,"Well, I maybe exaggerating for the sake of argument."
1974.73-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3491.419,3494.667,"But there, there would have been a second trial necessary?"
1974.73-1395,1,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3494.667,3495.266,Correct.
1974.73-1395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3558.254,3558.582,Thank you.
1974.73-1395,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3563.053,3565.986,"Well, I'll try to cover the ground I have very quickly."
1974.73-1395,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3648.77,3650.864,But the prosecution hadn't even finished its case?
1974.73-1395,3,38102,philip_d_lauer,,3650.864,3652.223,That's true.
1974.73-1395,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3715.92,3716.626,Thank you gentlemen.
