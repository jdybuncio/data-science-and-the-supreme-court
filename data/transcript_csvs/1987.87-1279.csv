1987.87-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.106,"We'll hear arguments now in No. 87-1279, Alexia Morrison v. Theodore B. Olson."
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,12.158,20.913,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,235.968,251.414,"Ms. Morrison, your opponents suggest that that is really a very narrow kind of discretion that is entrusted to the Attorney General, that following the structure of the statute he is almost bound to recommend the creation of a special prosecutor."
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,252.83,258.25,--The statute leaves the matter entirely within his discretion.
1987.87-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,295.074,298.895,--Except that he doesn't have an unlimited time period in which to conduct that--
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,298.895,299.728,That's true.
1987.87-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.728,300.978,--It's quite short.
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,350.077,354.029,"It would very much depend on the facts before him, Your Honor."
1987.87-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.337,371.539,"--You don't assert that letter from the Congress was inappropriate, Congress can have that participation in the process--"
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,371.539,395.356,"Under the statute, and it would seem to us as a matter of basic, inherent powers, any citizen, any body, any entity would be free under the statute to bring their concerns about administration misconduct to the attention of the Attorney General, and command thereby, simply by making allegations, that the review required by the statute take place."
1987.87-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.356,409.914,"--What if that letter reaches the Attorney General on the 80th day after his investigation of whether there are reasonable grounds to further investigate continues, and he has ten days to check that out--"
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,409.914,426.226,"The Attorney General has, under the statute as it existed when the matter before the Court was referred for independent counsel treatment, a total of 90 days within which to proceed with the preliminary investigation."
1987.87-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,556.676,558.212,"--But it wouldn't have to, isn't that right?"
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,565.382,565.965,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,576.438,580.023,--Doesn't that raise some separation of powers concerns?
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,587.129,595.901,"We would suggest, Your Honor, that that is not an Executive Branch power in the sense that it is not a substantive part of the investigation conducted."
1987.87-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,675.603,681.357,--Does the Special Division determine when the job is over--
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,681.357,700.385,"--There is a provision in the statute, Your Honor, which would allow... and this provision has not yet been used and indeed may never... the court having fashioned the appointment to say, my appointment authority has now been substantially completed, the independent counsel's task appears to me to be conducted--"
1987.87-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,700.385,701.171,--How would they know that--
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,701.171,710.443,"--The statute specifically provides that the court can do it on the recommendation of the Attorney General, or on its own if it were to come into possession of information--"
1987.87-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,710.443,727.552,--As a matter of fact do independent counsel regularly or at any time consult with the Special Division or members of the Special Division with respect to problems that may arise--
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,727.552,730.69,"--Concerning the progress of the investigation, no, Your Honor."
1987.87-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,775.302,777.419,--Is that subject to review--
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,777.419,779.421,"--It is subject to review, yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,779.421,780.754,--Where--
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,780.754,788.408,"As the statute existed at the time of the appointment in the current matter, it was lodged in the Special Division."
1987.87-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,797.93,812.273,"--Ms. Morrison, speaking of the functions of the Special Division, the Court of Appeals judgment that we are reviewing, that opinion, they point out that the Special Division had written an opinion in this case."
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,823.081,838.841,"Well, it is interesting because the constitutional question that the Special Division addressed in the matter was actually raised by the Department of Justice in connection with the review by the court of our request for additional jurisdiction."
1987.87-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,924.446,937.289,"--Ms. Morrison, are you going to take the position today that under the Blair case this Court shouldn't exercise jurisdiction over the case?"
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,937.289,950.197,"We are very concerned about that issue, Your Honor, because of the impact that we foresee the Appellate Court's ruling on Blair, particularly as they hold Ryan affects the Blair holding."
1987.87-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,956.251,960.136,"Well, did you raise any objection in the District Court?"
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,960.136,961.321,--We did not.
1987.87-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,961.321,970.01,"So is it perhaps waived, and is that something that the court below relied on--"
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,970.01,978.616,"The court below did find that by not raising the issue in the District Court, that we had somehow waived that jurisdictional question."
1987.87-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1090.42,1103.244,"--Well, to the extent the Court of Appeals had a different view, you think it was just wrong that the independent counsel must follow Department procedures--"
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,1103.244,1117.504,"--Yes, the statute says, that except where not possible, the independent counsel shall follow the written or other established procedures or policies of the Department of Justice."
1987.87-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1218.971,1219.721,"--Excuse me, Ms. Morrison."
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,1234.295,1241.068,"There is a United States Attorney's manual, Your Honor, that takes up a full shelf in the library."
1987.87-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1283.728,1299.321,"--And it is your position that so long as the Department of Justice put something in the manual or establishes it in writing... or I suppose even any unwritten policy would govern you, and you consider yourself bound by that--"
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,1299.321,1300.023,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1328.84,1355.258,"--That would not include, I suppose, or would it, guidelines... as I recall there used to be in the days when I was in Justice Department... about before an investigation of certain officials is conducted, matters that could be especially sensitive, the matter would be checked with the deputy attorney general or with the attorney general before it goes forward."
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,1358.793,1388.295,"We haven't had to confront that question in our case, but where the matter has been referred by the Attorney General for independent counsel treatment, I assume that at least in the regard that you are addressing, the Attorney General would have made the determination as to whether or not to proceed, the kind of preliminary check on conflicting Executive or departmental interests that would be applied by the deputy Attorney General under that standard."
1987.87-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1495.183,1508.257,"--Well, Ms. Morrison, it certainly could be argued that the appointment of the prosecutor is ordinarily an Executive function, that it gives that to the judicial branch, don't you think--"
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,1508.257,1512.026,"--The identity of the prosecutor, yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1571.481,1585.073,"--Yes, but our cases, I think, suggest it isn't just the Appointments Clause that is involved, but that you cannot assign to one branch certain functions that inherently belong to the other."
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,1585.073,1589.359,"That is correct, and we contend that none of that has happened here, Your Honor."
1987.87-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1646.127,1649.681,"Those functions were not exclusively executive, were they--"
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,1649.681,1671.844,"They may not have been, although even the dissent in that case, Your Honor, speaks about the weightiness of the nature of the Executive function, talking about how that statute went further than any statute to date at the time of the decision in Siebold in granting law enforcement or Executive functions."
1987.87-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1671.844,1680.65,--Let me ask about your position on the Appointments Clause as far as the ability of judges to appoint officers.
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,1693.46,1695.026,I think that would create more problems.
1987.87-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1695.026,1696.995,--Why would it create more problems?
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,1714.123,1734.168,"But of course that contention, Your Honor, flies in the face of a long tradition of judicial appointment of attorneys to represent parties before them, and in those cases there is inherently the fact that the attorneys being appointed to handle matters that may well end up in that courthouse as litigated matters."
1987.87-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1751.011,1759.116,"--But Ms. Morrison, it is true that in the District of Columbia the court used to appoint members of the school board--"
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,1759.116,1766.603,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor, and... on the appointments."
1987.87-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1766.603,1770.238,--I don't think it was ever challenged--
1987.87-1279,0,16533,alexia_morrison,,1770.238,1777.392,"Well, there is a case in this Court in which that very process was approved, Your Honor."
1987.87-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1814.517,1817.119,"Thank you, Ms. Morrison."
1987.87-1279,1,35694,michael_davidson,,1820.404,1828.392,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-1279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1869.769,1880.692,"Well, Mr. Davidson, you could say that about any cabinet office or any judicial appointment: Congress creates the positions, the Executive designates the people to fulfill them."
1987.87-1279,1,35694,michael_davidson,,1880.692,1887.965,"And that is the point I wish to make, that this arrangement does not violate that traditional approach."
1987.87-1279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1899.171,1911.58,"Mr. Davidson, in your view are there no limits at all on inter-branch appointments of inferior officers, from one branch to another?"
1987.87-1279,1,35694,michael_davidson,,1911.58,1922.103,"--The textual grant of authority to the Congress is indeed a broad grant of authority, and a grant of authority which this Court recognized in the Siebold case."
1987.87-1279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2046.767,2056.391,"Well, can you really say it is a single function, because the Special Division is also given the power to define the jurisdiction, is it not?"
1987.87-1279,1,35694,michael_davidson,,2062.045,2085.292,"As the Congress made clear in the most recent reauthorization of the Act in 1987, the power to define the jurisdiction of the independent counsel is solely the power to carry into the appointment order a description of the authority that is needed to fully investigate the subject matter which the Attorney General has identified."
1987.87-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2109.86,2113.144,"Well, is that what happened in this case?"
1987.87-1279,1,35694,michael_davidson,,2113.144,2115.013,As an amicus--
1987.87-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.013,2116.546,Yes or no.
1987.87-1279,1,35694,michael_davidson,,2116.546,2122.0,"--I believe the Court did not, in this case, exceed its jurisdiction."
1987.87-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.817,2130.106,"When an expansion was requested, was the request made to the Attorney General?"
1987.87-1279,1,35694,michael_davidson,,2130.106,2150.937,"--The independent counsel did go to the Attorney General, the Attorney General refused an expansion, and the Special Division, in the opinion which was discussed, concluded that it was bound by that limitation, that it could not go beyond the Attorney General's declination of any further jurisdiction for this independent counsel."
1987.87-1279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2161.892,2162.494,"Mr. Davidson, may I interrupt?"
1987.87-1279,1,35694,michael_davidson,,2173.1,2185.491,--The Special Division interpreted the prior application of the Attorney General to include authority to investigate whether the subject of the investigation had engaged in this conspiracy with others.
1987.87-1279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2212.344,2233.34,"I guess the concern is that Article III limits the jurisdiction of the courts to cases in controversies, and at least arguably this statute gives more to the courts than Article III case or controversy jurisdiction would indicate, doesn't it?"
1987.87-1279,1,35694,michael_davidson,,2233.34,2238.459,"--It gives to the courts an Article II appointment authority, just as--"
1987.87-1279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2238.459,2244.279,"Plus these other aspects, to the extent they are exercised."
1987.87-1279,1,35694,michael_davidson,,2244.279,2252.719,--None of those aspects is at the heart of the necessity for judicial appointment here.
1987.87-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2329.885,2335.873,"Mr. Davidson, can I ask you about the matter in gross rather than in the details?"
1987.87-1279,1,35694,michael_davidson,,2423.745,2445.26,"I do not think so, Justice Scalia, and for this reason: committees of the Congress have always been able to refer allegations to the Department of Justice, and whatever political influence committees can bring to bear, they have historically been able to bring to bear."
1987.87-1279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2631.232,2634.351,"When you say he must report, you are referring to the Attorney General?"
1987.87-1279,1,35694,michael_davidson,,2634.351,2635.018,That is correct.
1987.87-1279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2635.018,2637.553,And where does the Attorney General get his information?
1987.87-1279,1,35694,michael_davidson,,2637.553,2646.491,He gets that information from the inquiry that he deems necessary to determine whether there is good cause to remove an independent counsel.
1987.87-1279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2646.491,2647.925,How does he go about it?
1987.87-1279,1,35694,michael_davidson,,2647.925,2665.387,"I presume he must go to the independent counsel, and he must ask the independent counsel questions, and he may engage in any independent inquiry that he would determine is necessary to fulfill his statutory obligation to remove an independent counsel if good cause exists."
1987.87-1279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2757.88,2759.032,"Thank you, Mr. Davidson."
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,2765.486,2768.437,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-1279,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2801.009,2809.764,"Well, the independent counsel, do you think he or she is part of the Executive Branch?"
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,2809.764,2811.966,The independent counsel performs an Executive function.
1987.87-1279,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2817.953,2825.191,But the independent counsel is part of the Executive Branch in the sense that at least he or she is performing an Executive function.
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,2825.191,2825.976,That is exactly right.
1987.87-1279,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2825.976,2835.832,And the fact that he or she is not subject to the usual control of the President doesn't necessarily make it unconstitutional.
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,2835.832,2838.534,"I think it does, Mr. Justice White, for these reasons."
1987.87-1279,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2838.534,2847.973,You mean Congress may never create an office in the Executive Branch that is not subject to unlimited power by the President?
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,2847.973,2861.732,"This case is focused, and narrowly focused, on a single kind of power, and that is the power of criminal prosecution, which this Court has said many times, and all judges have described as inherently and exclusively executive."
1987.87-1279,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2863.399,2872.421,"Well, the power is being exercised by the Executive, by an officer of the Executive Branch."
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,2872.421,2878.159,But a power that is being exercised in a way that is not subject to appointment and control.
1987.87-1279,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2956.409,2970.668,"But there is a provision that says that the counsel has to obey the written guidelines and unwritten policies of the Department, and the special counsel has acknowledged that that provision means what it says."
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,2970.668,2978.322,"There is such a provision, and I think the '78 Senate report perhaps puts it on the head as to what that means."
1987.87-1279,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2996.236,2997.136,It's not written that way.
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3001.771,3008.525,There are two other aspects.
1987.87-1279,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3109.723,3116.71,But the President doesn't have a day by day supervision of the Department of Justice.
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3118.129,3120.181,"He certainly doesn't, Justice Marshall, and--"
1987.87-1279,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3120.181,3121.098,He does?
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3121.098,3121.748,--He does not.
1987.87-1279,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3134.506,3140.512,Does he do the day by day supervision of the United States District Attorney in Utah?
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3140.512,3141.045,He has--
1987.87-1279,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3141.045,3142.495,Does he?
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3142.495,3165.46,"--I suspect that the right answer to that is with respect to some matters he makes no consultation with the United States Attorney in Utah, but as to matters where he or the President chooses to exert the power which is essentially Executive, yes, he can, he can direct the United States Attorney if he want to, and that power is the essence of the constitutional scheme."
1987.87-1279,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3171.031,3174.649,Impossible under an independent prosecutor.
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3174.649,3176.899,"Right, because--"
1987.87-1279,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3176.899,3180.803,But shouldn't a prosecutor be independent?
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3180.803,3181.403,--A prosecutor--
1987.87-1279,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3181.403,3183.436,What's wrong with it?
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3183.436,3188.039,--The question is independent of what.
1987.87-1279,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3199.68,3203.049,What U.S. Attorney was elected?
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3203.049,3203.716,--Excuse me?
1987.87-1279,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3203.716,3205.501,The Attorney General wasn't elected.
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3205.501,3206.951,"No, but the President was elected."
1987.87-1279,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3206.951,3209.953,"Well, you told me that the Attorney General runs the Department."
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3209.953,3213.94,"He is the hand of the President, and he is accountable to the President in that regard."
1987.87-1279,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3252.249,3253.765,Let me ask one question.
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3257.034,3265.74,--The grand jury is a unique... has been described as a unique animal and I think--
1987.87-1279,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3265.74,3266.373,I agree it is unique.
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3268.359,3272.127,--I'm not sure it is in any branch of government.
1987.87-1279,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3272.127,3274.245,Is it independent?
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3274.245,3278.982,Some judges have described it as independent.
1987.87-1279,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3287.553,3289.722,"Well, I guess it returns indictments, doesn't it?"
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3289.722,3295.926,The grand jury cannot return indictments without the United States Attorney signing the indictment.
1987.87-1279,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3299.378,3304.348,There have never been grand juries that didn't act independently?
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3304.348,3306.467,Have there been grand juries that did not?
1987.87-1279,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3306.467,3310.586,That acted without the guidance of an Executive official?
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3310.586,3313.72,"I think there have been grand juries that have acted in that way, Justice Stevens."
1987.87-1279,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3313.72,3315.405,And I'm still not sure what your answer is.
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3318.191,3320.726,I think it is not part of either branch.
1987.87-1279,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3320.726,3321.476,It's not part of either.
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3321.476,3328.813,"It's not part of the prosecutorial function of the Executive Branch, because then it would have to be under the President, and it is not part of the Judicial Branch either."
1987.87-1279,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3328.813,3337.988,"In this case, if you should prevail, what happens to the grand jury that has issued these subpoenas?"
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3337.988,3352.079,"If we should prevail I assume that the grand jury that issued these subpoenas would be dismissed, because it is supporting the actions of an inquiry which would not be constitutional."
1987.87-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3353.947,3370.992,"Is it your position, Mr. Martin, that Congress cannot condition the President's removal power if once we find that the office is strictly an Executive function, that Congress cannot place any limits on the President's power to remove from that office?"
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3370.992,3395.274,"--I do not take that absolute position, but I do take this position: that under a removal standard, if you have an officer that is exerting classic constitutional Executive functions, if he is prosecuting, that officer has to be subject to the control of the President, and it may be that control--"
1987.87-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3395.274,3414.086,"Now you say control, the President ordinarily would exercise that control by appointing a person in the first place, choosing who it was to be, and removing the person if the President doesn't like what they are doing, yet you agree that Congress can place some limits on the President's removal authority."
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3414.086,3419.073,"--You could have situations... for example, there is the old case of the military cadet."
1987.87-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3457.198,3459.884,"Well, she can be removed for good cause, can she not?"
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3459.884,3469.756,"--She can be removed for a kind... the problem with good cause is the question is what is good cause, and the legislative history--"
1987.87-1279,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3469.756,3475.56,"But that would be, good cause would not include refusing to obey the order of the President."
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3475.56,3477.095,--Not according to the legislative history.
1987.87-1279,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3478.661,3479.395,"Or the statute, I suppose."
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3479.395,3499.425,"--This statute, unlike Bowsher, where a removal clause was intended, apparently, and was exercised to generate control in the Legislative Branch, this removal clause was intended to make sure that the Executive cannot control, and therefore it separates the Executive from one of its primary functions, first appointment and then control."
1987.87-1279,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3558.698,3564.634,"But Mr. Martin, isn't it likely that the Attorney General had some knowledge of what had been going on for that two and a half years?"
1987.87-1279,2,43126,thomas_s_martin,,3568.355,3571.39,--It did not come totally out of the blue; that is certainly correct.
1987.87-1279,3,18942,charles_fried,,4650.046,4653.932,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-1279,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5029.345,5033.313,To whom were the election inspectors in Siebold subordinate?
1987.87-1279,3,18942,charles_fried,,5033.313,5038.284,"They were subordinate to the court, I suppose, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.87-1279,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5063.0,5065.185,And the Architect of the Capitol.
1987.87-1279,3,18942,charles_fried,,5065.185,5068.97,"And the Architect of the Capitol, all of whom are appointed by the President."
1987.87-1279,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5318.115,5320.115,"Thank you, General Fried."
1987.87-1279,4,16533,alexia_morrison,,5322.951,5341.662,Mr. Martin indicated in his argument that the case that he thought might be important to the Court discussed the President's pardon power that's constitutionally textually committed to the President personally.
1987.87-1279,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5358.79,5364.176,I have just one since you're not going to use the rest of your time anyway.
1987.87-1279,4,16533,alexia_morrison,,5380.203,5382.989,"I believe the statute says, except when not possible."
1987.87-1279,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5382.989,5383.772,All right.
1987.87-1279,4,16533,alexia_morrison,,5383.772,5394.128,And I made reference before to the fact that there are certain policies within the Department's written guidelines that require checking up the chain of command.
1987.87-1279,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5413.708,5415.725,"Thank you, Ms. Morrison."
